Mr. President, I had the good fortune to serve in the \nSenate with one of the real characters of this Senate, Howard \nMetzenbaum. A smile has to cross my lips when we talk about Howard \nMetzenbaum because he was someone who really was a Senator. He had read \nthe bills. He wanted to make sure people were treated fairly. If they \nweren't, he knew how to slow things up. But in the end, he was willing \nto come around. I have such respect and gratitude for the service to \nour country of Howard Metzenbaum.\n  He served 18 years as a Senator from Ohio, from 1976 to 1995. He was \nreally a self-starter, for lack of a better description. He held his \nfirst job at age 10 delivering groceries, worked his way through Ohio \nState University with all kinds of jobs--sold flowers, played trombone \nin the band at the university, sold magazines, razor blades, rented \nbicycles. But he graduated Ohio State with all those odd jobs, Ohio \nState law school.\n  His first big business break came when he and a partner created a 24-\nhour staff parking lot at Cleveland's Hopkins Airport. No one had ever \nheard of a 24-hour parking lot. He did.\n  Howard Metzenbaum came to the Senate as a very wealthy man. He was a \nself-made man. He was a man who had made a name for himself. He was a \nlabor lawyer, a union lobbyist. When he came to the Senate, he never \nforgot the people those unions represented, the working men and women \nof Ohio. After he left the Senate, he became the head of the Consumer \nFederation of America, a perfect place for him.\n  His partner in all this was his wife Shirley, whom we all came to \nadore. They have four daughters.\n  I want the Record to be spread with my appreciation and admiration \nfor this good man from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2033-9", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, let me also note the passing of our \nformer colleague, Senator Metzenbaum. I think the majority leader \ncaptured him well. He was a man who operated in the Senate similarly to \ntwo of our colleagues today--I think of Senator Coburn and Senator \nFeingold--in the sense that he actually was interested in every piece \nof legislation that went across the Senate floor. He took the time to \nlook at it, to decide whether he thought it was a good idea or not. He \nwas a man of extraordinary passion.\n\n[[Page S2034]]\n\n  He was, by his own description, an orthodox liberal and made no \napologies about it. As the majority leader has pointed out, he had \nextraordinary success, rising from absolutely nothing financially and \nin terms of connections, not only made a substantial amount of money in \nthe private sector but then had a long and distinguished public career \nas well.\n  We all remember Senator Metzenbaum with fondness and with respect. I, \ntoo, extend my sympathy to the Metzenbaum family.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as we all know, this is the time for the \nvote-arama or whatever we want to call it. It is usually an exciting \nday, but it is a difficult day. I have conferred with the two \nRepublican leaders, and what we are going to do--and I ask unanimous \nconsent that this be the case--the first vote we are going to have will \noccur sometime around 11 o'clock. The first vote will be 15 minutes \nplus 5, like we do. After that, they will be 10 minutes straight, no \nwiggle time at all. Senator Conrad and Senator Gregg have been through \nthis many times. We tried 5 minutes; it doesn't work. But 10 minutes we \nare going to do. This is going to apply to my side of the aisle and the \nother side of the aisle, the 10 minutes. We are going to cut things \noff, if people miss votes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the leader yield? That would include, of course, \nthe 1-minute explanation of the amendment on each side.\n  Mr. REID. Of course. I appreciate that very much. As my friend \nindicated, prior to each vote there will be 1 minute on each side, pro \nand con. I also have asked the Parliamentarian to enforce this. I say \nto the Chair, and I hope you will notify your successor, we are going \nto gavel people after 1 minute. These 1-minute speeches drag on for 3 \nor 4 minutes. That takes away from what we are supposed to do. The 1 \nminute is something we have kind of traditionally started doing. There \nis nothing in the rules to say you have any time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the first vote be 15 minutes plus 5, \nsubsequent votes will be 10 minutes, with no wiggle room after that, \nand that there be 1 minute on each side on each amendment and that the \nChair will enforce the 1 minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my final request would be that the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Brown, be given 5 minutes to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes for Senator Kennedy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2034-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SENATOR HOWARD METZENBAUM\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy and Senator Metzenbaum were \nso often fighting for same causes and the same issues and showed the \nsame courage. They both were and are heroes to many. I thank the \nmajority leader for the time.\n  A great son of Ohio, Senator Howard Metzenbaum, passed away last \nnight in Florida. He was personally inspirational to so many. He \nchanged the lives of Ohioans, as he changed the lives of so many \nAmericans through his lifetime commitment to public service. I am \nhonored to hold his seat in the Senate and to follow in his footsteps.\n  According to Senate tradition, many Members of the Senate carve their \nnames in the drawers of the desks that line the rows. Whoever has \nSenator Metzenbaum's desk can, with all of us, share in the legacy of \nhis greatness.\n  As different as they were, Senator Metzenbaum and Senator John Glenn, \nwho served together for almost two decades, made an unparalleled team \nfor Ohio.\n  Senator Reid mentioned that Howard was a child of poverty. He was a \nchild of prejudice growing up as a Jew on the east side of Cleveland \nand suffered both from his family's poverty and antiSemitism in all too \nmany cases. He worked his way in jobs, starting as a 10-year-old, \nthrough Ohio State.\n  Senator Reid told us that in the Senate, Senator Metzenbaum was a \nmaster of the rules, a constant presence in an often empty Chamber, who \nwould, when leaving the Chamber, post an aide to scout for an \nunexpected amendment or hastily scheduled floor action on various \nbills. Once, when a 2-week filibuster was cut off and Metzenbaum was \nstill determined to block action on lifting natural gas price controls, \nhe and a partner sent the Senate into round-the-clock sessions by \ndemanding rollcall votes on 500 amendments. He did not care if he \nangered his colleagues. He did not care if he was liked every day by \nhis colleagues. What he cared about was to fight for economic and \nsocial justice for the 10 million citizens whom he represented in Ohio \nand for the 250 million or so Americans when he served in the Senate.\n\n  The Washington Post, in 1982, said that Senator Metzenbaum \nsinglehandedly saved at least $10 billion by blocking special interest \ntax breaks and pork-barrel programs.\n  I remember watching Senator Metzenbaum when I served in the House, at \nthe beginning of my House career and at the end of his Senate career. I \nwatched him as a younger elected official in State politics. Even as he \nwas getting older and he began to show his age, when he stood in front \nof an audience, the energy just burst from him. Fiery passion for \neconomic justice and social justice poured forth from Howard \nMetzenbaum. He would start at the podium--he is the first politician I \nsaw do this--and as he would work his way up into his speech and begin \nto inspire people, he would come away from the podium and walk out into \nthe audience, and he had a strong, powerful voice even when he was no \nlonger speaking into the microphone. People would always respond with \nthe same kind of passion and be inspired by him. That is my clearest, \nfavorite memory of him. His legislative record, of course, was so \nimportant too. One of the most important things he did was the plant \nclosing legislation, giving 60 days' notice to workers who too often \nhave seen their jobs disappear with nothing to show for it--pensions, \nhealth care, all that.\n  Howard Metzenbaum always fought for people who had less. He always \nfought for people who had less privilege than he had. He always fought \nfor opportunity for people of all races and both genders and all social \nclasses. That is what he will be remembered for.\n  I particularly admire his family. Howard was a great family man--a \nman who cared very much about Shirley, his wife, and his four \ndaughters: Shelley, Amy, Susan, and Barbara. He will be greatly missed.\n  After his service in the Senate, as Senator Reid said, he became the \nhead of the Consumer Federation of America. He never gave up his \npassion for fighting for ordinary people and for being a warrior for \nsocial and economic justice.\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Kennedy, who was a comrade in arms \nin so many ways with Senator Metzenbaum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2034-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2034-S2035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, all of us are deeply saddened with the \nloss of an extraordinary Senator and a great human being: Howard \nMetzenbaum. We extend our condolences to Shirley and to the members of \nthe Metzenbaum family.\n  He truly was the conscience of the Senate for so many years. This is \nan institution made up of 100 individuals, and all of us wonder whether \nany of us can make much of a difference in a group of 100. But history \nwill show that Howard Metzenbaum made an extraordinary difference in \nthis institution and for the working men and women of this country whom \nhe championed.\n  He was an unabashed champion for those who were left out and left \nbehind. So often their interests and their well-being are forgotten, \nbut they never were when Howard Metzenbaum served in this institution.\n  Reference has been made to one of the great battles, among the many \nhe fought, and that was on this issue of the deregulation of natural \ngas. Howard and Jim Abourezk and a few of us were interested in that \nissue. We were following the leadership of Howard Metzenbaum. He \nabsolutely infuriated every Member of this body as he kept us here day \nand night, day and night, rollcall after rollcall, but he would not \ngive up, and he would not give in.\n  All of the Members were in an uproar, until finally a solution was \nreached and the Senate went in adjournment. As Senator Metzenbaum \nwalked out on the Senate steps, Senator after Senator came up and \ncongratulated him. They all were expressing a viewpoint that was \nunsaid, but they were basically saying beneath their breath that they \nhoped they could be the champion for their interests as Howard \nMetzenbaum was a champion for the interests of working men and women in \nthis country.\n  Howard could scold, he could hassle, he could provoke, he could \ncajole, but he also could smile and he could joke. He had a warm heart \nand a brilliant mind. He was a Senator's Senator. He will be greatly \nmissed, but he will be greatly remembered as well for his service to \nthis institution, which he loved, and for the people of Ohio, whom he \nserved so nobly.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened by the news of the \ndeath of our former colleague and friend, Howard Metzenbaum.\n  The Senator from Ohio was one of the most conscientious, hardest \nworking, and influential Senators I have had the privilege to observe \nsince I came to the Senate in 1979.\n  We were friends even though we would disagree on some subjects and be \non the opposite sides of amendments he would offer on appropriations \nbills I was supporting. He was a fierce debater and would often become \nagitated and raise his voice level for effect. But, he always impressed \nme as sincere, honest, and relentless.\n  The Senate and the United States were well served by Howard \nMetzenbaum.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak today regarding the passing \nof former Senator Howard Metzenbaum, who passed away last night at his \nhome in Fort Lauderdale, FL. I think I speak for many of my colleagues \nwhen I say that our Nation has lost a principled leader and that \nSenator Metzenbaum will be missed.\n  Senator Metzenbaum was born in Cleveland, OH in 1917 and spent much \nof his life serving the people of that great State. He graduated from \nOhio State University in 1939 and received a law degree from that same \ninstitution in 1941. The early days of his legal practice were devoted \nto representing labor unions in Ohio.\n  In 1943, he began an 8-year period of service in the Ohio State \nLegislature, serving 4 years in the Ohio House of Representatives and 4 \nmore in the Ohio Senate. He soon became a prominent figure in Ohio \npolitics.\n  After his time in the Ohio Legislature, he continued his legal \npractice and also embarked on a very successful career in real estate \ndevelopment, becoming a self-made millionaire through a series of very \nsuccessful investments. However, he did not stay out of public service \nfor long.\n  In 1974, Senator Metzenbaum was appointed by Ohio Governor Jack \nGilligan to fill the vacancy in the U.S. Senate left by Senator William \nB. Saxbe who had departed to serve as U.S. Attorney General. After \nlosing a tough primary election to future Senator John Glenn later that \nyear, Howard was elected to Ohio's other Senate seat in 1976, the same \nyear I came to the Senate. He served three Senate terms before retiring \nin 1995.\n  I had the privilege of serving with Howard for his entire career in \nthe Senate. It always amazed me how dedicated Howard was and how he \ndutifully watched out for his constituents' interests. It seemed like \nhe was always on the floor at the right time and ready to stop any \namendment that he thought might go against the principled views he \nheld.\n  For many years, Howard's Senate office was across the hall from my \noffice on the first floor of the Russell Senate Office Building. \nFrequently, when there was a vote, Howard and I would enter the hallway \nat the same time and he would immediately make a statement about the \nloud tie I was wearing. He never failed to notice the unique collection \nof ties I wore. However, over the years, I noticed his selection of tie \nchoices began to grow louder and louder as well until eventually, we \nused to see who could wear the most outlandish ties to work each day. \nWe sure did wear some ugly ties trying to outdo each other. We really \ndeveloped quite a fondness for each other during those years.\n  As you might expect, Howard and I often found ourselves butting heads \non many issues. He certainly had a tendency, at times, to frustrate \nsome of our colleagues. However, we all admired him for his courage and \nconviction.\n  Howard was a tough politician. As we came to the close of each of our \nSenate work periods right before a recess began, you could always find \nHoward sitting at his desk on the Senate floor objecting to every piece \nof legislation that he did not agree with. He spent hour upon hour \nstanding up for the people of Ohio.\n  Howard's enthusiasm in protecting the interests of Ohioans was \nprobably the only thing that exceeded his zeal in guarding against \nlegislation that he viewed as helping large corporations. I recall with \nsome amusement an incident surrounding an amendment I was trying to add \nto a tax bill on the Senate floor that would have lowered excise taxes \nfor certain companies that supplied materials to mining companies. This \namendment had been cleared by the managers of the bill, who were the \nleaders of the Finance Committee. It appeared that acceptance of the \namendment was a done deal.\n  That is, until Senator Metzenbaum found out that a potentially pro-\ncorporation amendment was about to be accepted.\n  Howard began objecting to the unanimous consent request to include \nthis amendment in the bill. During a call of the quorum, I went over to \nchat with him. I informed him that of the roughly two or three dozen \nmining supply companies that would be helped by this amendment, three \nwere located in Ohio. I could see in his eyes the difficult nature of \nhis dilemma--on the one hand he did not want to spend money on helping \ncorporations and on the other hand, he always wanted to help his \nbeloved Ohioans.\n  In the end, Howard made what he thought was the best decision for his \nconstituents and agreed to let the amendment go, but not before he had \na chance to weigh in his mind the importance of his decision. I \nremember thinking at the time that I had probably witnessed one of the \nonly times Howard ever changed his mind regarding a piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I want to extend my deepest sympathies to the \nMetzenbaum family. As I said, Howard and I didn't often find ourselves \non the same side of matters before the Senate, but I can say, without \nreservation, that he was a dedicated public servant, a man I have \nalways admired and a dear friend.\n\n[[Page S2036]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn that my good friend \nand former colleague, Senator Howard Metzenbaum, has passed away.\n  He was a man of courage, conviction, commitment, and toughness. He \nwas a labor lawyer and union lobbyist, who grew up in poverty, and went \non to become a champion of the rights of American workers. He was a \nself-made millionaire who became a dedicated adversary of big business.\n  I was honored to work with him in the Senate for 18 years. He was an \nunabashed liberal who brought such an intensity to any issue he was \npromoting, that it was a pleasure simply to watch him as he worked. It \nwas the high level of energy and emotion that he brought to the issues \nabout which he felt most deeply that prompted me to remark at one \npoint, ``Some men have succeeded in politics through diplomacy and \ncompromise, [but] Howard Metzenbaum's forte has been his passion.''\n  And he was passionate about liberal causes. During his career in the \nSenate, he wrote legislation on nutrition-labeling, funding for \n``orphan drugs'' for rare diseases, airline safety, and penalties for \nviolations of child-labor laws.\n  It was a delight to work with him in the incredibly productive 100th \nCongress--and he was one of the reasons that that particular Congress \nwas so productive. Some of the legislation that Senator Metzenbaum \nsponsored during that Congress included plant-closing notification and \na massive worker-retaining program.\n  Mr. President, Senator Metzenbaum's support for liberal causes earned \nhim a variety of labels and descriptions. While the Wall Street Journal \nbranded him ``Senator No'' for his determination and ability to block \nlegislation that favored special interests, the Dayton Daily News \ncalled him ``Senator Can Do'' for his legislative accomplishments.\n  The Cleveland Plain Dealer described him as the ``watch dog for \nAmerican consumers.'' The Gannet News service called him the \n``millionaire friend of the little guy.'' The Congressional Quarterly \ndepicted him as the ``Democratic Gatekeeper.'' In his weekly newspaper \ncolumn, Senator Paul Simon called him ``the tiger of the Senate.'' The \nhead of Handgun Control, Sara Brady, labeled him a ``hero'' for his \nleadership in fighting for the Brady bill and other gun-control \nmeasures. I was privileged to be able to call Senator Metzenbaum \n``friend'' and ``colleague.''\n  American workers and American consumers, as well as members of the \nSenate, the State of Ohio, and the citizens of our beloved country are \nall so much better off because he served in this chamber for nearly two \ndecades.\n  Mr. President, during one of his fights against special interests, \nthe Washington Post editorialized, ``Thank God for Metzenbaum.'' I \nloved that remark because I, too, wish to ``thank God for [Senator] \nMetzenbaum.''\n  Mr. HARKIN, Mr. President, I was saddened to learn of the death, last \nnight, of former Senator Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio. But my grief is \nleavened by wonderful memories of this extraordinary person and all \nthat he accomplished during his nearly two decades in this body.\n  There are several essential, bedrock things you quickly learned about \nHoward Metzenbaum. He was proud, unreconstructed, irrepressible \nliberal. He was a fighter who never gave in or gave up. And he was \nutterly intolerant of injustice or discrimination toward any human \nbeing.\n  In many ways, he was a classic child of the Great Depression, raised \namidst poverty and anti-Semitic prejudice, and reared on the speeches \nof his hero, Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n  Howard was a self-made man who said that he was ``born knowing how to \nmake money.'' And he did, indeed, make a fortune in the business world. \nBut, for Howard, money was not an end in itself. It gave him the \nfreedom to devote himself to public service and to the causes that he \nbelieved in so passionately.\n  Howard and I shared a common interest in combating child labor and \nchild slavery around the world. I especially admired his work as a \nfounding member of the RUGMARK Foundation, a non-profit organization \ndedicated to fighting child labor in the hand-made carpet industry, \nespecially in countries like India and Pakistan.\n  He poured all his energy and prestige as a U.S. Senator into getting \nRUGMARK started, and building it into the successful humanitarian \norganization that it is today. And on many occasions, he joined with \nother anti-child-labor activists in picketing outside of rug stores \nthat persisted in selling products made with abusive child labor.\n  Of course, Howard's fight for social and economic justice extended \ninto many other arenas.\n  For many years, he worked as a lawyer for labor unions, and he always \nbelieved passionately in unions as instruments for lifting people up \nand fighting for justice. It was Senator Metzenbaum who passed the law \nrequiring 60-day notice before a plant could be closed.\n  And I dare say that the Senate has never had a more outspoken \nadvocate for the American consumer. In fact, after he retired from the \nSenate, Howard served as chairman of the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica. He fought for access to affordable prescription drugs. And, \nwith good reason, he was especially proud of the law he passed \nrequiring nutrition labels on all processed food products.\n  Food labels--listing calories, fat, salt, and cholesterol content--\nhave changed the way Americans shop, and they have given us an \nimportant tool for taking charge of our own health. Howard's work on \nfood product labels was the inspiration for my own bill, which would \nrequire chain restaurants to provide similar information on the \nnutritional content of regular menu items.\n  Mr. President, those of us who were privileged to serve in the Senate \nwith Howard Metzenbaum will never forget his sharp wit and equally \nsharp tongue. He didn't come to the Senate to be Mr. Popularity; he \ncame here to get things done and to change the world for the better.\n  And that's exactly what Senator Metzenbaum did during his 19 years in \nthis body. He was a tireless, outspoken voice for working families and \nunion members, for the poor, and for anyone who is oppressed, \nexploited, or discriminated against.\n  Mr. President, there was one other great passion in Howard \nMetzenbaum's life, and that was his love for Shirley, his wife and \npartner for more than five decades. My thoughts and prayers, today, are \nwith Shirley.\n  She is saying goodbye to her beloved husband. We are saying goodbye \nto one of the true giants of the Senate in the late 20th century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2036-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1027\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are on the budget resolution. We will \ncomplete work today or tomorrow at some point. It is important we \ncomplete the business.\n  Let me indicate this is the circumstance we inherit: The last \nbalanced budget was in 2001. Since then, this administration has run up \nrecord deficits and record debt.\n  Mr. President, 2004 was the largest dollar deficit in history. In \nfact, we have now had the five largest deficits in our history under \nthis administration. That dug a very deep hole as we began to write \nthis budget resolution.\n  This is what has happened to the debt: At the end of the first year \nof the administration--we do not hold them responsible for the first \nyear because they inherited a budget from the previous administration--\nthe debt of the United States stood at $5.8 trillion. It will be, at \nthe end of 2009, over $10.4 trillion. This administration will nearly \nhave doubled the debt of our country.\n  In terms of who is financing that debt, increasingly we are dependent \non the kindness of strangers because increasingly this money is being \nborrowed from abroad.\n  I show this chart: There are 42 Presidents pictured here. It took 224 \nyears to run up $1 trillion of U.S. debt held abroad. This President \nhas more than doubled that amount in 7 years. In fact, he has far more \nthan doubled foreign holdings of U.S. debt in 7 years.\n  That brings us to this budget, which recognizes the economic weakness \nour country is confronting. So our first priority is to strengthen the \neconomy and create jobs. We do that by investing in energy, to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil. We invest in education, knowing we \ncannot be a first-class nation unless our people are the best educated, \nbest trained in the world. We invest in our infrastructure, to help \nmake us more competitive. We also expand health care coverage for our \nchildren because that is a wise investment that pays off over a \nlifetime. And we provide tax cuts for the middle class.\n  At the same time, we restore fiscal responsibility by balancing the \nbudget in 4 years, and maintaining balance in the fifth year. We also \nseek to make America safer by supporting the troops by providing for \nveterans' health care, and by protecting the homeland by rejecting the \nPresident's proposed cuts in law enforcement, the COPS Program, and our \nfirst responders.\n  We all know the economic weakness the country is currently \nexperiencing. Economic growth, in 2006, averaged 2.6 percent; in 2007, \n2.5 percent. The Congressional Budget Office is now estimating for 2008 \nthe economic growth will only be 1.6 percent. Many of us believe the \neconomy is not growing at all at the present time. In fact, we may well \nbe in a recession.\n  So in order to strengthen the economy, we have provided for stimulus \nin this budget resolution: some $35 billion in an insurance policy, \nstandby authority in case this economy weakens further; providing \nrelief in the hard-hit housing sector, where we know they are not in a \nrecession, they are in a depression; also having the option of \nextending unemployment insurance; providing for additional resources \nfor food stamps; and also having the opportunity for additional funding \nfor low-income heating assistance, the WIC program, and infrastructure \nfunding for 2008--projects that are ready to go: road building, highway \nconstruction, bridge construction, school construction--projects that \nare designed, that are engineered, all of the land has been acquired; \nthey just need the money to begin construction and to hire people and \nto create jobs.\n  There is also substantial tax relief in this budget resolution: \nalternative minimum tax relief, so an additional 20 million families \nare not caught up in the alternative minimum tax; additional energy tax \nincentives, again to reduce our dependence on foreign oil; additional \neducation tax cuts, in order to make college more affordable; the \nstimulus provisions we have discussed, especially targeted at the \nhousing sector; and, of course, the all-important extenders--those tax \nprovisions that are expiring that need to be extended.\n  The first amendment to the budget resolution will also extend the \nmiddle-class tax relief. It will extend the marriage penalty relief, \nthe child tax credit, the 10-percent bracket. It will also provide for \nestate tax reform, providing for an exemption of $3.5 million a \nperson--and all of that to keep pace with inflation as well. It also \ncontains an important new property tax relief measure that the chairman \nof the Finance Committee will describe, tax relief for our troops and \nveterans, and tax relief for the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita.\n  All of that is against the backdrop of a budget that is balanced. \nOnce the Baucus amendment is adopted that extends the middle-class tax \nrelief, we show that we are able to balance the budget in the fourth \nyear, and maintain balance in the fifth year, showing a positive \nbalance in the fourth year of $4 billion, and a similar amount in 2013.\n  We are also, under this resolution, once the Baucus amendment is \nadopted, taking the debt as a share of our national income down each \nand every year, from 69.6 percent, down to 66 percent in 2013. So we \nhave the debt going in the right direction, going down as a share of \nour national economy.\n  We also have spending going down under this budget resolution as a \nshare of our national income, from 20.8 percent of gross domestic \nproduct in 2009, stepped down each year, until in the\n\n[[Page S2038]]\n\nfourth and fifth years we have reduced Federal spending as a share of \nour national economy to 19.1 percent.\n  Now, we will hear on the other side assertions that this budget \nspends hundreds of billions of dollars more. I don't know what budget \nthey are talking about because it is not this budget. This shows the \ndifference between our budget and the President's budget in terms of \nspending. The red line is the President's spending line. The green line \nis the spending under this resolution. My colleagues can see, in \nrelative terms, they are very close. There is only a 2-percent \ndifference in spending over the 5 years, the difference between what is \nin the President's budget and what is in this budget. We use those \nadditional resources for energy, for education, for infrastructure, for \nour veterans, and to maintain law enforcement programs such as the COPS \nProgram.\n\n  One percent: What does this signify? One percent is the difference in \nthe spending level for this next year between our budget and the \nPresident's budget. There is 1 percent more spending in our budget in \ntotal for 2009 than is in the President's budget. Again, those \nadditional resources are devoted to primarily education, reducing our \nenergy dependence, infrastructure, and veterans health care. Those are \nthe primary areas of difference.\n  Here are the lines which show the difference between the revenue in \nour proposal and the revenue in the President's proposal. We will hear \nthere is a $1 trillion tax increase somehow buried in this budget. \nThere is no such thing. They made the same claims last year. There was \nno $1 trillion tax increase last year; there is no $1 trillion tax \nincrease this year. I said yesterday that if I brought up the menu from \nthe dining room downstairs and introduced it as a budget resolution, \nour colleagues would say there is a $1 trillion tax increase because \nthat is what they always say.\n  The fact is the difference in revenue between the two is 2.6 percent. \nHere is the difference between the revenue in the President's budget \nand the revenue in our budget: 2.6 percent. That means we are able to \npay the debt down more. That means we are able to balance the budget. \nThat means we are able to put some additional resources in these high \npriority needs such as veterans health care, education, energy, and \ninfrastructure to help create jobs and stimulate this economy and also \nposition America to be fully competitive in the years ahead.\n  So how could we get 2.6 percent more revenue than the President and \nnot have a tax increase? Well, I suggest we can do it by going after \nthings such as the tax gap, the difference between what is owed and \nwhat is paid. The vast majority of us pay what we owe; some don't. That \namount of money has become very large. The IRS says in 2001, that gap \nbetween what is owed and what is paid was $345 billion.\n  However, that is not the only place there is money that is not being \nsecured. We have offshore tax havens. The Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations has told us we are losing $100 billion a year to these \noffshore tax havens. Here is an example: A building in the Cayman \nIslands, a 5-story building that claims to be home to 12,748 companies. \nThey all say they are doing business out of this little building. Does \nanybody believe that? The only business they are doing down there is \nmonkey business. What they are doing is avoiding and evading their \ntaxes in this United States. We ought to shut it down. If we do shut it \ndown, there is a tremendous amount of money there, according to our \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  This article appeared on March 6 in the Boston Globe: ``Top Iraq \ncontractor skirts U.S. taxes offshore.'' It is a perfect example of \nwhat I have been talking about. This story indicates that:\n\n       Kellogg Brown & Root, the nation's top Iraq war contractor \n     and until last year a subsidiary of Halliburton Corp., has \n     avoided paying hundreds of millions of dollars in federal \n     Medicare and Social Security taxes by hiring workers through \n     shell companies based in this tropical tax haven.\n\n  I wish that was the exception. Unfortunately, our Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations says it is no exception. It is \nincreasingly the case.\n  Let me close by saying on the other side, our colleagues will say a \n$1 trillion tax increase. They made the same claim last year. Now we \ncan go back and check the record and see what actually happened. With \nDemocrats in control of the House and the Senate, did they increase \ntaxes by $1 trillion? What actually happened? Well, if you go check the \nrecord--this isn't a forecast, this isn't a projection, this isn't a \nclaim; this is a fact--this Congress reduced taxes by $194 billion. \nThey increased revenue through loophole closers by $7 billion, so a net \nreduction in taxes of $187 billion. That is what the Congress did. \nCongress, controlled by the Democrats in the House and the Senate, \ndidn't increase taxes, as was claimed by the other side last year. They \nmake the same claim this year. The fact is we cut taxes, and we cut \ntaxes quite dramatically.\n  The stimulus package that will lead to checks being sent out to 100 \nmillion Americans, that was a tax cut. In addition, fixing the \nalternative minimum tax so more than 20 million American families \nweren't hit with increased taxes are in those numbers.\n  This is a budget resolution worthy of our colleagues' support, and I \nencourage each of our colleagues to carefully evaluate it and to \nsupport it.\n  Might I, before my colleague begins, thank him for his many \ncourtesies during consideration of the budget resolution. As always, we \nhave differences. My colleagues will hear them now, I am sure. On \nsubstantive issues, we have places where we disagree, but he has been \nan absolute professional in the conduct of the work of this committee \nand the handling of this resolution on the floor. I thank him for it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me join in complimenting the chairman \nof the committee. He is also a professional and a very enjoyable person \nto work with. Whether it is his birthday or he is sick, he does a great \njob around here. I think the comity which we have and the \nprofessionalism that is shown, between our staffs especially, who do an \nextraordinary job, under tremendous pressure, is the way the Senate \nshould work. Obviously, we are debating and engaging on very \nsignificant issues of public policy, but they should stay as political \nand substantive policy debates. The actual operation of the Senate and \nthe management of a piece of legislation such as this needs to be done \nthrough cooperation between the two sides, and as a result of the tenor \nthe chairman sets in the committee, it is.\n  However, as he said, I do disagree. I do disagree with the bill that \nhas been brought forward. In my opinion, it is a lost opportunity of \nimmense proportions.\n  This Nation faces so many very significant issues--the most \nsignificant, of course, being the threat of Islamic terrorism and an \nattack on our shore again. But that is followed fairly closely by the \nequally significant issue, in my opinion, of the looming fiscal \nmeltdown of this Nation as a result of the costs which we have put on \nour children, costs which they will have to bear dealing with paying \nfor the benefits of the retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  In addition, there are issues such as tax policy and issues such as \nhealth care this country needs to deal with. Everybody who fills up \ntheir gas tank with gasoline any day of the week knows we better get \nour hands around the cost of energy or we are going to be in big \ntrouble.\n  This budget does virtually nothing in any of these areas and, in many \nof these areas, in my humble opinion, significantly aggravates the \nproblems. The opportunity was there to do things--to do significant \nthings--to take significant steps, to be creative, to be imaginative, \nto even be bipartisan, which would have been nice, but those \nopportunities were passed.\n  Right upfront, this budget underfunds the troops in the field. Now, \nthey are not alone. The administration sent up a budget that did the \nsame thing. But then later, I give the administration credit for \ncorrecting their mistake and the Secretary of Defense came forward and \nsaid what the right number would be. Last year, the budget and the \nadministration reflected a correct number on what was needed for the \ntroops, but this budget grossly underfunds the troops in the\n\n[[Page S2039]]\n\nfield. Even if you subscribe to the view of some of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, which is that these troops should come \nhome tomorrow and acknowledge surrender, you can't get them home. They \nare going to be left in the field without the equipment they need, \nwithout the tools they need to fight this war under the number in this \nbudget.\n  In addition, this budget dramatically expands spending. My colleague \nloves to use a chart which shows two lines together and it is only 1 \npercent. Well, folks, 1 percent on $3 trillion is real money, at least \nin New Hampshire. That is $300 billion of increased spending on the \ndiscretionary side of the ledger. When you put in the entitlement side \nof the ledger, it adds up to over $700 billion of increased spending. \nAlso, it gets built into the baseline. In other words, when you spend \nthat extra $22 billion this year, which adds up to over $300 billion \nover 5 years, that becomes a figure off which the next year's spending \noccurs. So it gets bigger and bigger and bigger. It grows and grows and \ngrows. There is no attempt in this budget to try to discipline spending \non the discretionary side of the ledger but, more importantly, there is \nabsolutely no attempt in this budget for disciplined spending on the \nentitlement side of the ledger.\n  We know we are facing a fiscal meltdown as a result of the costs of \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security when this huge generation, of \nwhich I am a member and of which my colleague is a member, retires. \nSixty-six trillion dollars of unfunded liability will be put on the \nbacks of our children. What does that mean? That means their taxes will \ngo up so much in order to support our generation that they will be \nunable to afford the lifestyle of our generation. They will not be able \nto send their kids to college. They will not be able to buy that first \nhouse. They will not be able to enjoy the comforts of a lifestyle of \naffluence this country has obtained, the most affluent country in the \nworld, because entitlement costs will not be able to be borne.\n  This bill does absolutely nothing in this area. Why? Why do we leave \nthis problem to the next generation? We are the ones who are creating \nthis problem. The administration at least had the courtesy to send up a \nwhole series of ideas and they were all fair and they were all \nreasonable and none of them impacted the vast majority of Medicare \nbeneficiaries or Social Security beneficiaries. Yes, they did impact \nWarren Buffett. They suggested the Warren Buffetts of this world--I \nguess there is only one Warren Buffett--the people who have high \nincomes, the people with over $80,000 of personal income or $160,000 of \njoint income, that they should pay a fair portion of the cost of their \ndrug insurance under Medicare. Today, they pay virtually nothing--well, \na very small amount anyway, less than a quarter of a percent--a quarter \nof it. But that idea was not included in this bill, although there will \nbe an amendment to have it included in the bill.\n  Ideas on improving technology weren't included. Ideas on improving \nmalpractice weren't included. All ideas to get entitlement spending at \nleast partially under control--in fact, the administration proposals \nwhich would have reduced the outyear liability which we are passing on \nto our children and which they can't afford, reduce that liability by \nalmost a third in the area of Medicare, nothing in this bill, \nabsolutely zero.\n  How much saving is in this bill in discretionary accounts? Zero. How \nmuch saving is in this bill in entitlement accounts? Zero. In fact, in \nboth accounts, there are significant expansions and spending.\n  Then there are the games. This bill is replete with games to try to \nmake it look like it is more reasonable and fair and cost-effective \nthan it is. The most obscene game being played around here is the \nreconciliation instructions. Reconciliation, as we know--those of us \nwho work here--is the one tool of significance which the Budget \nCommittee has. It allows us to change how entitlement programs are \nfunded and slow their rate of growth--that was the purpose of \nreconciliation--and do it without the changes being subject to the \nfilibuster rule. It is a vehicle basically directed on the purposes of \nthe Senate.\n  What has happened in this bill? There is no talk of reconciliation. \nWhat happens on the House side? They have a $750 million reconciliation \ninstruction, which is a fig-leaf instruction, under which they intend \nto build a massive expansion of programmatic activity. The House \ndoesn't need reconciliation. The House is doing the dirty work of the \nSenate because the Senate leadership on the Democratic side is \nunwilling to put forward what they are planning to do. It is the \nultimate, cynical game of hide and seek with the budget.\n  That is why I call this the fudge-it budget. There is another fudge-\nit number in this budget, and that is this alleged tax gap the Senator \nfrom North Dakota talks about so much. He talked about it last year. \nLast year, he said we could get $300 billion. We got zero. In fact, we \nended up cutting the IRS last year--the other side did--so they \ncouldn't even collect as effectively as they were collecting the \ndollars that were coming in. This tax gap number may exist at some \nlevel, but there is no record at all that it is ever going to get \ncollected. And you certainly should not be taking credit for it, \nclaiming that is the way you are going to pay for the tax increases in \nthis budget.\n\n  This budget has tax increases. Again, the chairman says it is only \n2.6 percent. Well, 2.6 percent on $3 trillion is approximately $800 \nbillion. What does it mean in real terms? Well, it means they are going \nto allow to expire the tax rates on capital gains, dividends, estate \ntaxes, R credit, energy credit, tuition tax credit--on a whole series \nof items that benefit a lot of America.\n  The claim we hear from their national candidates on the Democratic \nside is that we are just going to tax the rich; we can pay for \neverything we want to do if we just tax the rich. If you take the top \ntax rate from the present level of about 35 percent up to the Clinton \nyears' level of 39.6 percent, you raise $25 billion year. You cannot \npay for even 10 percent of what the Democratic party is planning to \nspend with $25 billion a year. They have $300 billion in this budget \nalone. Senator Obama has proposed another $300 billion of annual \nincreases in spending. They are short hundreds of billions of dollars \nin tax revenue by taxing the rich. Where is that money going to come \nfrom? I will tell you where. It is obvious. It is going to come from \nhard-working middle-class American families. Our estimate is that this \ntax package is going to cost the average small business $4,100--small \nbusiness, which is the backbone of American job creation. This budget \nis a direct attack on their capacity to create jobs with that type of a \ntax increase. This budget is going to cost the average senior in \nAmerica--18 million seniors--$2,200 each. That is what this package is \ngoing to cost in tax increases to pay for the spending that is in the \nprogram.\n  My colleague on the other side of the aisle is fond of saying: We \ndidn't raise taxes last year; our budget is not going to raise them. \nThis budget has built into it the expectation that taxes are going to \ngo up by $1.2 trillion. And then they spend the money. They spend the \nmoney, so they have to raise the taxes. So they cannot claim it both \nways, but they try to. That is why I call it the ``fudge-it budget.''\n  Individuals in this country--43 million Americans--will have to pay \n$2,300 each to pay for this budget. That doesn't count what Senator \nObama and Senator Clinton are proposing on the campaign trail. As I \nsaid earlier, Obama has already proposed $300 billion of new spending \nevery year. That is $1.2 trillion over the 5 years. That would double \nthis figure, and it would mean American families would have to pay over \n$4,500 a year for all of the Obama plans for spending, which mirror \nSenator Clinton's plan--I don't want to just pick on Senator Obama \nuniquely. On top of this budget, you would have $2,300 plus $2,300, or \n$4,600 of new taxes on every family in America. Those are not rich \nfamilies. It is every family who pays taxes of any significance, \nfamilies who make more than $50,000, to put it into context. \nIndividuals who make more than $30,000 will have to pay this tax. The \nirony is that we hear, as I mentioned, we are going to just tax the \nrich.\n  In this budget, they already assume that the tax rates on the wealthy \nare going to go from 35 percent to 39.6 percent in years 11 and 12. \nThen they spend that money. So when these proposals come forward from \ntheir national candidates that we are going to\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\nput another $300 billion on the books of new spending next year and we \nare going to get it from the rich--well, they have already taxed the \nrich. That is already assumed in here. Who will really pay for it? \nWorking, average Americans and small businesses. Talk about stifling an \neconomy. Nothing will stifle an economy more than that.\n  This check reflects it. Under this budget, Americans are going to \nhave to write Uncle Sam a check for $2,300 a year. The spending is \nbuilt into the baseline, and the taxes are coming down the road. It is, \nregrettably, in my opinion, a budget of missed opportunities and a \nbudget that is misdirected.\n  What we need in this country is the willingness to step forward and \ntake aggressive steps to get spending under control, especially in the \narea of entitlements, and to reform our tax laws so they are more \nefficient and more effective in collecting obligations. But none of \nthat is assumed in this budget, and none of it is attempted in this \nbudget.\n  We need to support our troops in the field. None of that is assumed \nin this budget. Whether or not you agree with the policies of fighting \nterrorism that the President is pursuing, you have to feel that the \ntroops need our support. This budget does not have that support.\n  We need to have a budget that doesn't constantly game itself, where \nwe set up alleged enforcement mechanisms, such as pay-go, and then \nmanipulate the budget so we go around those enforcement mechanisms. We \nneed to have something here that protects the integrity of the few \ndisciplining initiatives we have, such as reconciliation, rather than \nright out of the box, with true cynicism, set up a scenario where you \nare going to game the reconciliation instructions to use them to expand \nthe size of Government instead of controlling the rate of growth of \nGovernment.\n\n  Most importantly, we need a budget that understands that it is not \nour money, it is not the Federal Government's money, not the money of \nthe Members of Congress. It is the money of the people who are working \nout there every day, trying to make ends meet, trying to fill up their \ngas tanks and pay for the heat in their houses, trying to send their \nkids to school, trying to pay their mortgage. It is their money, for \ngoodness' sake. Around here, it is treated as if it is our money and as \nif it is a generous act on our part to let people keep their money. \nWell, the purpose of the budget should be to structure itself so that \nwe control spending in a manner that allows us to keep taxes under \ncontrol and doesn't raise the tax burden on working American families.\n  We are going to be here voting a long time on a lot of issues. A lot \nof these issues will be raised during those votes. I appreciate the \ncourtesy of the Senator from North Dakota and the way we have gotten to \nthis point. I, obviously, disagree with the budget as presented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, with my time remaining, let me answer a \nfew of the things that were said by my colleague.\n  No. 1, we fully fund the President's defense and war costs request. \nSo let's not have any misunderstanding about that for the troops.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator entertain a question on that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I don't have time for a question.\n  No. 2, the Senator says it is not our money, it is the people's \nmoney. He is exactly right. It is also the people's debt, and \nunfortunately the other side has run up the people's debt.\n  Finally, there are no tax increases assumed in this budget. In fact, \nthere are significant tax reductions assumed in this budget in AMT, \nenergy tax, incentives, college tax--all of that is in the budget.\n  A final point. Mr. President, when our colleague says over and over \nthere are these tax increases, those tax increases must be in the \nPresident's budget, too, because there is only a 2.6-percent difference \nin the revenue.\n  I thank the Chair and our colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we want to announce the first 10 votes for \nthe information of our colleagues. This has been cleared on both sides. \nThe Baucus amendment will be followed by the Graham amendment, followed \nby the Bingaman amendment, the Conrad amendment, the Specter amendment, \nthe Salazar amendment, the Kyl amendment, the Conrad amendment, the \nBunning amendment, and the Specter amendment. Those are the first 10 in \norder. That takes us now to Senator Baucus.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4160\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes, equally divided, on the \nBaucus amendment. Senators should know that after the 1 minute Senator \nBaucus speaks and Senator Gregg speaks, there will be a 15-minute vote. \nSenators should understand there will be several subsequent votes.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand it, when we go into the vote to come after \nthe first vote, it will be a hard 10-minute vote on each one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There will be a 5-\nminute leeway on the first amendment, and we will go into subsequent \nhard 10-minute votes, with 1 minute of debate on each side. Members \nshould stay here.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment would maximize the budget's \nhelp for America's working families. It would use the surplus to \nprovide tax cuts to every American taxpayer.\n  Our amendment provides for permanent extensions of 2001 tax cuts that \nhelp working families, including the 10-percent bracket, marriage \npenalty relief, the refundable child credit, the adoption tax credit, \nand the child-care tax credit.\n  Our amendment provides for a new property tax deduction available to \nany American homeowner, even those who don't itemize.\n  Our amendment includes tax relief for America's military men and \nwomen, room to prevent the estate tax from rising above 2009 levels, \nand protection from unexpected taxes for gulf coast hurricane \nsurvivors.\n  Turning surplus dollars into tax relief for American families is the \nright thing to do. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have no problem with this amendment, \nobviously. It extends tax cuts. I think it is a poster child for the \n``fudge-it budget'' because last year the same amendment was offered. \nActually, after that budget was adopted, none of those taxes cuts were \nextended. So now we are doing it again. It is sort of like the gift \nthat keeps giving, reoffering this amendment when it has no actual \nimpact or nothing comes from it. We are for it because it reduces some \nof the tax burdens in this bill, but it still leaves in place, by our \ncalculation, hundreds of billions of dollars of new taxes on working \nAmericans, which will lead to significant tax increases for working \nAmericans because this doesn't relieve all of the tax burdens in this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time last expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the Baucus amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 99, nays 1, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 42 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n\n[[Page S2041]]\n\n\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--1\n\n       \n     Feingold\n       \n  The amendment (No. 4160) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4170\n\n  Mr. BROWN.

The \nSenator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I have a modification to the amendment, \nwhich I think has been cleared, that I would like to send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 10, decrease the amount by $245,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, decrease the amount by $949,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, decrease the amount by $3,215,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, decrease the amount by $93,791,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, decrease the amount by \n     $127,024,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, decrease the amount by \n     $151,137,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, decrease the amount by $245,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, decrease the amount by $949,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, decrease the amount by $3,215,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 22, decrease the amount by $93,791,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 23, decrease the amount by \n     $127,024,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 24, decrease the amount by \n     $151,137,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $1,900,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $110,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $2,487,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $8,005,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, increase the amount by $15,207,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $1,900,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $110,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $2,487,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $8,005,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, increase the amount by $15,207,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $247,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $967,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $3,325,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, increase the amount by $96,278,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $135,079,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, increase the amount by $166,344,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $247,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $1,214,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, increase the amount by $4,539,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by \n     $100,817,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, increase the amount by \n     $235,846,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, increase the amount by \n     $402,190,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, increase the amount by $247,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 16, increase the amount by $1,214,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, increase the amount by $4,539,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, increase the amount by \n     $100,817,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, increase the amount by \n     $235,846,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 20, increase the amount by \n     $402,190,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 12, increase the amount by $1,900,000.\n       On page 26, line 13, increase the amount by $1,900,000.\n       On page 26, line 16, increase the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 17, increase the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 20, increase the amount by $110,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 21, increase the amount by $110,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 24, increase the amount by $2,487,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 25, increase the amount by $2,487,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 3, increase the amount by $8,005,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 4, increase the amount by $8,005,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 7, increase the amount by $15,207,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 8, increase the amount by $15,207,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I know we are all busy and trying to catch \nup on a lot of business, but in 1 minute this is what I am trying to \ndo. This amendment is not about me, it is about a lot of people paying \ntaxes, and their taxes are going to go up if we don't pass this \namendment.\n  The Baucus amendment passed 99 to 1. That was good for America. We \nare filling in a gap that exists when it comes to the budget and \nprotecting tax cuts. My amendment would extend through 2013 the \nmarginal rate cuts that are now in law. The current law is 25 percent. \nIf we don't pass my amendment, in 2011 the tax will go up to 28 \npercent, a 10-percent increase, 35 percent becomes 39.6 percent, and \nthat means 23 million Americans are going to pay higher taxes.\n  The estate tax relief in this amendment would protect families and \nsmall businesses from losing, through estate taxes, their deductions \nand exemptions. It will keep the rate at 45 percent versus 50 percent.\n  The capital gains rate. Nine million people depend on capital gains \nto help support their family. The rates go up to 20 percent, if my \namendment does not pass, versus 15.\n  Dividend tax rates are great for our economy. We lock in the dividend \ntax rate cuts we have achieved the last couple years. Twenty-four \nmillion people are affected.\n  Small business expensing. Under the current law, you get $250,000 \nunder small business expensing. If my amendment doesn't pass, it goes \nto $25,000.\n  There is a lot at stake if you vote against my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I checked with the two managers, and on the \namendments that are pending, I ask unanimous consent that there be no \nsecond-degree amendments on the list of amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Graham amendment, well-intentioned as \nit is, is the road to fiscal irresponsibility. This will absolutely \nblow a hole in the budget. We now have balance by 2012, and we maintain \nbalance in 2013. If you adopt the Graham amendment--because none of it \nis paid for, there are no offsets, no spending reductions, no other \nrevenue--it is put on the debt.\n  So if you want to borrow more from China, if you want to borrow more \nfrom Japan, vote for the Graham amendment. If you want to balance the \nbudget, if you want to get this country back on the road to fiscal \nresponsibility, vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

There are now 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, prior to a vote on the Bingaman amendment, No. 4173. The \nSenate will come to order.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is to raise the caps in \nthe appropriate accounts so there is room in this budget for the \nPresident's requested levels of spending for the National Science \nFoundation and for the Office of Science in the Department of Energy, \nfor science and math education, for research and development. It is an \namendment I am proposing for myself and Senator Alexander, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Kennedy, Senator Mikulski, Senator Ensign, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Landrieu, Senator Feinstein, Senator Lieberman, and \nSenator Schumer.\n  This is bipartisan. It is something we should do. It follows on to \nthe America COMPETES Act that we passed last year.\n  Let me defer to Senator Alexander the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. On opposition time, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. I look forward to the Senator's opposition.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this is another example of Senators in \nthis Chamber working together on an important matter and getting a good \nresult. It makes room for us to meet the President's number, to keep \nour investment in science and technology so we can keep our brainpower \nadvantage and keep jobs from going overseas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Is there \nfurther debate? There are 30 seconds left for the opposition.\n  All time has expired. The question is on agreeing to the Bingaman \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4173) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we can thank Senators Bingaman and \nAlexander for setting a very good example, of taking an amendment on a \nvoice vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4190\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the Conrad amendment, No. 4190. Who yields \ntime? The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the alternative minimum tax will affect an \nadditional 20 million families if it is not dealt with. In the budget \nresolution, we have a 1-year patch to prevent additional families from \nbeing hit. This is at a cost of some $62 billion. For the outyears, we \nare providing in this amendment for a reserve fund that is fully offset \nso it does not add to the deficit and debt. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we need to defeat this amendment. This is not \nthe usual AMT fix we are used to. This actually repeals rates of the \nAMT that were put into effect in 1993. The reality is we are not going \nto increase taxes in order to pay for the relief that would be provided \nto taxpayers here. This points out the difference between the Specter \namendment, which we will deal with next, and the Conrad amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Specter amendment because it is \nthe real deal. It is the real way we will deal with AMT, rather than \nthe phony way that is presented by a mere indication that we will find \nrevenues somewhere to offset against this tax cut. The question the \nmajority would have to answer is: What taxes are you going to raise in \norder to pay for this rate reduction for the people who would otherwise \npay the AMT?\n  There is certainly no suggestion that there is a spending cut in the \noffing. Therefore, what taxes would be raised to pay for this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Conrad \namendment.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Specter amendment puts it on the debt. \nThe Conrad amendment is offset and paid for. I urge colleagues to vote \nfor the Conrad amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe it is the practice of the Senate, \nunder the 2-minute rule, that one person speaks for their time, the \nother person speaks for their time, and there isn't a tradition that \nyou reserve 10 seconds or 15 seconds. If that is going to be the \nsituation, we are going to go back and forth and everybody has to have \na last word, we are going to be here for a long time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has not consumed \nhis entire minute.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the observation I was going to make; we had time \nremaining on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4190, the Conrad amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the Specter amendment No. 4189. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my amendment would reduce the alternative \nminimum tax rate from 28 to 24 percent. When the tax increase was \nenacted in 1993, it raised the rates and that has caught many more \npeople in the snare, because the alternative minimum tax was not \nindexed for inflation.\n  I provided for no offset, because this tax was never intended to \ncapture the\n\n[[Page S2043]]\n\nmillions of people to whom it now applies. Originally, it was intended \nto apply to a very small number of people. So, as a matter of equity, \nwe ought not to have an offset when the tax was not intended to apply \nat all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The amendment that has just passed has dealt with this \nissue and done it in a deficit-neutral way. The Specter amendment, as \nhe correctly describes, would not be paid for, would not be offset, but \nwould simply add to the debt $185 billion and would mean this budget \nwould not be in balance for any one of the 5 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Specter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

I see the Senator from Colorado in the Chamber.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in support \nof amendment No. 4196. This is about estate tax reform and providing \nthe Finance Committee, Chairman Baucus, the opportunity to craft a \npackage that makes sense. This will help make sure that our farmers and \nranchers are able to stay on the ranch, that family businesses will be \nable to keep their family businesses together, and that we can provide \ncertainty for the future in terms of those who will be hit with the \nestate tax.\n  There is an alternative amendment that will be coming up by our \nfriend from Arizona, Senator Kyl. The problem with that amendment is it \nis not paid for. We will then continue to build upon this mountain of \ndebt, which has already reached $10 trillion in the last 7 years.\n  This amendment is paid for and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the question here is whether we are serious \nabout estate tax reform. We went through the exercise last year and \npassed it in the budget, and we didn't do anything. We are going to \nrepeat that same thing this year unless we commit ourselves to actually \npassing a bill, saying we are going to raise taxes--because I am sure \nwe are not going to reduce spending--and that is akin to saying it is \nnot going to happen. Once again, we would be passing an amendment we \nknow we are not going to act on. We need to be accountable to the \nAmerican people and pass something in the budget that we know we are \ngoing to do, with real legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment and to vote for \nthe next amendment, which is the real vote in favor of estate tax \nreturn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester).

There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the Kyl amendment No. 4191. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, last year this amendment received 56 votes, \nDemocratic and Republican votes. It was then in the form of a motion to \ninstruct conferees, but the provisions are the same.\n  This is the amendment on the estate tax that has a top rate not to \nexceed 35 percent, and it has a $5 million exemption for each spouse, \nfor a total of $10 million.\n  This amendment is endorsed by small business groups such as the NFIB \nand by other pro-estate tax reform groups.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree it is a way to send a very strong \nsignal through the budget process that we are serious about reforming \nthe estate tax this year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against the \namendment of my friend from Arizona because at the end of the day, it \ndoes not hold up to the principle of fiscal responsibility. All that \nthe amendment of my friend will do is continue to make the mountain of \ndebt bigger and bigger. It is a mountain of debt that is already at $10 \ntrillion and going beyond. The pay-go rules we have in this Chamber are \nimportant for us to maintain if we are going to be fiscally responsible \nstewards of America's financial treasure.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 17 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's comments. The \nquestion is what taxes are we going to raise in order to provide tax \nrelief. I don't think it is realistic that we are going to raise taxes, \nand I certainly don't expect we will reduce spending. If we are serious \nabout it, we need to send a signal through this amendment if we want to \nreform the estate tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 22 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I respond to my friend from Arizona, at \nthe end of the day, if we are going to be fiscally responsible in the \nSenate, we have to pay for those items that are creating this mountain \nof debt. We are either serious about paying down the debt in this \ncountry and getting a handle on the fiscal responsibility of the last 8 \nyears or we are not. Senator Conrad has been right in terms of pay-go. \nI ask my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4191.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from North Dakota is recorded in \nthe negative.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Once the Presiding \nOfficer has announced the clerks will tally the vote, is the vote not \nconcluded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators are permitted to change their vote.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire as to whether any of the \npersons who have cast a vote since the Presiding Officer made that \ncomment have changed their vote? The reality is they cast their vote \nafter the time for voting expired by at least 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, but it has always been the standard here, when \nthere is a close vote--and this is a close vote, I have to acknowledge \nthat; I think now it is 50 to 50--people have the opportunity to change \ntheir vote.\n  We are doing our very best to hold it to the 10-minute limit. To go \nthrough the charade of reconsidering because somebody is--it is really \nunnecessary. This is the vote total, and I think people just have to be \nvery patient. We are going to adhere to the 10-minute limit as much as \nwe can. Everyone knows that if there is a problem on the other side, we \ndo the same thing. We are not playing favorites with anyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With 50 votes in the affirmative and 50 in the \nnegative, amendment No. 4191 is not agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4191) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to the vote on the Conrad amendment, No. 4204, as \nmodified.\n  Mr. KYL. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Parliamentary inquiry for the benefit of the Senators who \nare here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if we are within two or three votes of a tie \nvote, is it going to be the rule that the Chair will leave the time for \nvoting open by at least 4 minutes, as was just explained?\n  My second question is, Given the fact that the time was closed and \nSenator Cornyn was not given the opportunity to vote earlier, what \nwould the Chair's opinion be with respect to having a revote on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would the Senator be kind enough to direct \nhis inquiry, through the Chair, to me?\n  Mr. KYL. I had a parliamentary inquiry, but I will be happy to always \nhave the majority leader comment on whatever.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, I think a lot of us didn't hear the question.\n  Mr. KYL. I am sorry, Mr. President, I am perhaps confused because I \nhave two questions.\n  The first was, since the time for voting had clearly expired by at \nleast 4 minutes and the vote was within two or three of being tied and \nthe majority leader said it was the case that Members could continue to \nchange their votes or vote if it was a close vote, whether we had now \nestablished a precedent for the remainder of the day that if we are \nwithin two or three of a tie vote, even though we are 4 minutes beyond \nthe time for voting, that the Chair would then, according to this \nprecedent, allow people to change their vote or cast a vote?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can just respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. And certainly I am not taking the place of the Chair. I \npersonally didn't know if Senator Cornyn was coming to vote or not. If \nyou or Senator McConnell or anyone else had indicated that he was on \nhis way, or one of those we have heard that of before--on his way--no \none was trying to take advantage of anyone on the vote. No one was \ntrying to take advantage of anyone. But I think we went through a lot \nof wasted time, and I probably would have done the same thing had I \nbeen in your position. But nobody was trying to take advantage of \nSenator Cornyn. It was late, and that is too bad. We will try to be as \nfair as we can.\n\n  At this stage, we have about 25 votes left.\n  Mr. GREGG. We have about 40 votes left.\n  Mr. REID. Okay, so 40. That was the last count I looked at. And we \nare going to try to move through these as expeditiously as possible. \nThere will be other close votes, and we are going to try to be as fair \nas we can to you and to us. So no one is trying to take advantage of \nanyone, and I think there is an order in effect. The order is we are \ngoing to have 10-minute votes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could just address this question to the \nmajority leader. That is exactly the question I had. Since we announced \nthe 10 minutes, in the last vote we went over by about 5 minutes. We \nneed to be consistent and our Members need to know what the rules are \ngoing to be. We made an exception here.\n  My inquiry to the Chair is whether, as a result of that exception, \nwhich did change the result of the vote, that the precedent would now \nbe that we actually would have up to 15 minutes to cast votes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, certainly the Chair can respond to this, but \nthere is an order now in effect that we are going to do 10-minute \nvotes. Everybody agreed to that this morning.\n  I would simply say this: I do say, and I am glad the Senator from \nArizona raises this as an issue, that there is not time for lunch, \nthere is no time for meetings, unless you go to the reception area. In \nthe future, I think people are going to have to start missing votes. It \nis really not fair to both sides if we have people simply off doing \nother things. Everyone is busy, and the reason we have the 10-minute \nrule is because we need to work our way through these votes.\n  So I think you have made a very good point, I say to my friend. I \nthink we need to stick to the 10-minute rule. So we will stick with the \n10-minute rule. If you have a problem when people are here shifting \nvotes around--but I think they should be in the Chamber--that is how we \nwill proceed. If anyone can figure a better way to do it, I am happy to \nlisten, but I think the 10-minute rule should apply.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, one final question. I think I need to address \nthis to the Chair as a purely parliamentary inquiry; that is, once the \nclerk's tally has been requested by the Presiding Officer, is the vote \nclosed or not, except for Members who might wish to change their vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The conventional practice of the Senate has \nbeen that Senators have been permitted to vote or change their vote at \nthat time.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4204, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. In regular order, is my amendment next?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to the vote on the Conrad amendment, No. 4204, as \nmodified.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the alternative I have offered would \nprovide for a reserve fund that would allow the repeal of the 1993 tax \nincrease on Social Security benefits in a way that would protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare and not increase the deficit or the debt over the \nperiod of the resolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who rises in opposition? The Senator from \nKentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, this is a very interesting amendment, \nsince I have had this amendment the last two times a budget went \nthrough the Senate. Senator Conrad, the chairman of\n\n[[Page S2046]]\n\nthe Budget Committee, has offered this alternative, but I would note \nthat it contains an instruction that he himself, as chairman, should \ncome up with the savings.\n  This is a very odd instruction that we put in the budget resolution \nbecause it does not say where the savings will occur. I hope he has no \nintention of raising taxes on other Americans to pay for this \namendment.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

This is the third time I have addressed on the Senate \nfloor this amendment, the unfair tax that has been on the senior \ncitizens of this country since 1993 when the additional 35 percent was \nput on. This time it is paid for, not like the last one we voted on. \nThis time it is paid for in my modification.\n  It specifically states it is paid for by an across-the-board cut in \ndiscretionary spending. We do not touch the entitlement spending, but \ndiscretionary spending is cut by the amount of money we need to pay for \nthis cut for our senior citizens.\n  This is the real cut of taxes for senior citizens. The last one was a \n``cover some part of your body'' rather than the real kind of tax cut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there are real cuts, the Senator is right \nabout that. This would cut, across the board by $21 billion, education, \nveterans' health, homeland security, law enforcement. If you want to do \nthat, vote for the Bunning amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  Mr. BUNNING. But the other one did not pay for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 52 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 4192), as modified, was rejected.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on the Specter amendment No. 4203.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of 31 \nSenators. It adds $2.1 billion to NIH funding which would bring it to a \ntotal of\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\n$32 billion. NIH has been grossly underfunded for many years. Enormous \nprogress was made during the NIH doubling; major advances on cancer, \nParkinson's, and Alzheimer's. It also adds $1 billion for LIHEAP, which \nis significantly underfunded, bringing the total to $3.5 billion. I \nurge support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is important to note this is a \nreprioritization within the budget. I happen to agree with this \nreprioritization, but it comes out of what is known as the 920 account, \nwhich means in order to pay for this, it is an across-the-board cut to \nall other accounts. I think the Senator is correct that if we are going \nto prioritize spending, I am willing to do an across-the-board cut to \nall accounts to put more money into NIH and more money into LIHEAP. I \nsuggest we take it on a voice vote, unless the Senator wants a recorded \nvote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for the yeas and nays. I think it is important \npeople know the strength of this body's support for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I encourage Members to support the amendment. The Senator \nhas made a very powerful case for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4203. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Louisiana (Mr. Vitter).\n  The result was announced--yeas 95, nays 4, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 53 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--95\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--4\n\n     Carper\n     DeMint\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Vitter\n       \n  The amendment (No. 4203) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the next amendment is an amendment by \nSenator Dorgan; then there would be a side by side to Senator \nAlexander's energy reserve amendment; then the Senator Alexander \namendment; then the Senator Kennedy amendment; followed by Senator \nSununu; followed by Senator Lincoln; followed by Senator Alexander; a \nside by side to Alexander; then Alexander; then Menendez; then \nSessions; then Cornyn; then Pryor; then Allard. That is the regular \norder previously entered, for the notice of Senators.\n  We would note that none of them are subject to second degrees. We \nwill make that request. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnone of these amendments be subject to second degrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that takes us to the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4198\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment has to do with Indian \nhealth care. We have both a trust responsibility and treaty \nresponsibilities for the health care of American Indians. They are the \nfirst Americans.\n  Let me tell you how we meet our responsibility. We also have a \nresponsibility to provide health care for incarcerated Federal \nprisoners. We spend twice as much money for health care for our \nincarcerated prisoners as we do to meet our promise to American Indians \nfor health care. This amendment provides $1 billion restoration of \nfunding for the Indian health care program. It is paid for by a general \nreduction in function 920.\n  Let me say again, people are dying as a result of the underfunding \nfor health care for American Indians. It is a promise we have made, and \nit is long past the time we keep that promise. This amendment is a step \nin that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition in opposition?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota has made an \nexceptional case regarding the failure of the Indian health program, \nespecially as it relates to his citizenry and other citizenry \nthroughout this country. He has pointed out that it involves rationing, \npoor medical care, and that it involves inconsistent and spotty medical \ncare. I think he has probably made one of the best cases you could \npossibly make for why we do not want the Federal Government running \nhealth care. The Indian health care system is a Federal system.\n  So however people vote on this amendment, I think we should \nunderstand that this vote is a condemnation of the idea of \nnationalizing our health care system.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4198.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 69, nays 30, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 54 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--69\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--30\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Sununu\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Baucus\n       \n  The amendment (No. 4198) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4329\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4329.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2048]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson], for himself, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Salazar, and Mr. Menendez, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4329.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to improve energy \n                       efficiency and production)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO IMPROVE ENERGY \n                   EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), the Chairman of \n     the Senate Committee on the Budget may revise the \n     allocations, aggregates, and other levels in this resolution \n     by the amounts provided by a bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report that would \n     encourage--\n       (1) consumers to replace old conventional wood stoves with \n     new clean wood, pellet, or corn stoves certified by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (2) consumers to install smart electricity meters in homes \n     and businesses;\n       (3) the capture and storage of carbon dioxide emissions \n     from coal projects; and\n       (4) the development of oil and natural gas resources \n     beneath the outer Continental Shelf in areas not covered by a \n     Presidential or Congressional moratorium.\n       (b) Deficit Neutrality.--Subsection (a) applies only if the \n     legislation described in subsection (a) would not increase \n     the deficit over the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2013 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2018.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Alexander amendment that is \ncoming up unwisely attempts to override the moratorium we have which \nCongress adopted and the President signed 3 months ago to prevent \ncommercial oil shale leasing, before the impacts of those proposed \ntechnologies are known and before the R projects in Colorado or Utah \nhave produced any results. So my amendment takes that out.\n  My amendment also takes out his portion, where he is going to allow \noil and gas drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. Senator Alexander \nis going to change that just to have gas drilling off Virginia. But I \nwould argue, that is the proverbial camel's nose under the tent and \nwhat we fight about each year: Oil drilling off the coast.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, there are only 2 ways to bring down the \nprice of $3.50 gasoline and to keep electricity from going up. One is \nto reduce demand and one is to increase supply.\n  The Senator from Florida and I agree on our amendments on several \nprovisions, but he would take out the parts that will increase the \nsupply of natural gas and increase the supply of oil, which will tend \nto reduce the price of gasoline and reduce the price of natural gas and \nmake us less dependent on people in other countries who are trying to \nkill us.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote if you want lower energy prices.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, prior to a vote on amendment No. 4207, offered by the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Mr. Alexander.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I have sent a modification of my \namendment to the desk.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO IMPROVE ENERGY \n                   EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), the Chairman of \n     the Senate Committee on the Budget may revise the \n     allocations, aggregates, and other levels in this resolution \n     by the amounts provided by a bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report that would \n     encourage--\n       (1) consumers to replace old conventional wood stoves with \n     new clean wood, pellet, or corn stoves certified by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (2) consumers to install smart electricity meters in homes \n     and businesses;\n       (3) the capture and storage of carbon dioxide emissions \n     from coal projects;\n       (4) the development of natural gas resources beneath the \n     outer Continental Shelf but only off the coastline of the \n     State of Virginia; and\n       (5) the development of oil shale resources on public land \n     pursuant to section 369(d) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 \n     (42 U.S.C. 15927(d)), without regard to section 433 of the \n     Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-161).\n       (b) Deficit Neutrality.--Subsection (a) applies only if the \n     legislation described in subsection (a) would not increase \n     the deficit over the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2013 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2018.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, my amendment limits the encouragement \nof the development of natural gas resources beneath the Outer \nContinental Shelf to the coastline, off the coastline of the State of \nVirginia.\n  Madam President, the estimates are that this year 400 billion \nAmerican dollars are going overseas to buy oil. This amendment has some \nconservation measures in it, but it also allows us to proceed with the \nDepartment of Interior to develop oil from oil shale in the western \npart of the United States. It allows Virginia, which has asked to do \nit, to explore for natural gas off the coastline of Virginia. A ``yes'' \nvote is to bring down $3.50 gasoline prices. The supply of oil and gas \nis important if we want to bring down the price of oil and gas to \nAmericans and make us less dependent upon foreign oil.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I point out that the \nAlexander amendment takes away the sensible moratorium, which Congress \njust adopted and the President signed 3 months ago, which prevents \ncommercial oil shale leasing before the impacts of those technologies \nare known, with the R projects in Colorado and Utah. It further \nstarts the process of drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf, which \nyou just protected by adopting my amendment. By doing what Senator \nAlexander said, the camel's nose is under the tent to start drilling \noff of Virginia.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on Senator Alexander's side-by-side amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 \nminute to answer the statement made by the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reserving the right to object, if the Senator will \namend his request for a minute on each side, I would be happy not to \nobject. I would like to talk about it too.\n\n[[Page S2049]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't care if the Senator wants 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to a minute on each side? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, what happened in this case, with \nreference to shale oil, is the United States has as much shale oil in \nthese two States--Colorado and Utah--as the Saudi Arabians have oil. We \nhad that arranged in our Energy bill, where it was being researched by \nmajor American oil companies. In the dead of night, the appropriators \nchanged the law in an appropriations bill and put a moratorium on final \nregulations so that those who are investing money to see if we can \nproduce this with $100-a-barrel oil out there, or not, they have to \nlook at a moratorium as to whether they should invest money.\n  There should not be a moratorium. It is protected by law. This is \nsomebody up in one of these States putting a moratorium on in \nappropriations with nobody around. This Senator wasn't there. If I were \nthere, it would not have happened. We would not have had a bill. We \nwould have had to filibuster that bill because it is so wrong to, in \nappropriations, say no to the largest body of ore in America that could \nsubstitute for crude oil. You might say: Why didn't we do it before? We \ndidn't do it because oil wasn't high enough. Now it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I oppose this amendment because what \nthis will do, as Senator Nelson said, is undo a quarter century of \nbipartisan agreement where there is a moratorium on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, both west and east. If we want to end our addiction \nand if we care about prices, then don't do it by striking another vein, \nultimately, of the same energy resource. You do it by considering \nalternatives. This amendment does nothing about that, but it does \nundermine the moratorium in the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  I yield to my colleague from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote no on this \namendment because it deals with the State of Colorado and the oil shale \nreserves there. We have a thoughtful way to move forward with that \nprogram. This is putting the horse ahead of the cart. This is the wrong \nway to go.\n  I urge a ``no'' note.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 56 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Byrd\n     McCain\n       \n  The amendment (No. 4207), as modified, was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4151\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I believe the pending amendment is the \namendment I offered earlier; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 4151. There is 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, everyone is aware of the credit crisis \nand its impact on homeowners. This amendment is designed to ensure that \nthe crisis does not impact students.\n  The amendment ensures that Congress can act to provide low-interest \nloans to students who need them. It will bring stability and security \nto our higher education system. My amendment strengthens the Federal \nStudent Loan Program so that secure, low-interest student loans will \nalways be available to Main Street America, even when Wall Street is in \nturmoil.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, the only cost in this country that has \nrisen faster than medical care has been college education. There is no \nshortage of student loan money under Government-guaranteed loans. We \nsent $77 billion to colleges and universities last year, half of them \nthrough earmarks.\n  The more money we send to universities, the higher the tuitions go. \nThat is one of the reasons it is higher than it is today. According to \nthe Secretary, in a study issued this last week, there is no shortage \nof available student loans among the federally backed Student Loan \nGuarantee Program. There is a slight shortage in the 10-percent \nprivate.\n  This amendment does not address or increase at all the availability \nthat is already there. So we are not doing anything with this amendment \nother than spending the very money these kids are going to have to pay \nback. By borrowing now, they will have to pay it back two and \nthreefold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty seconds remains.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as I understand, the time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4151.\n  The amendment (No. 4151) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nSununu amendment.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, as I understand it, Senator Sununu and \nSenator Kerry are discussing this amendment. I suggest we move to the \nnext regular order item, if there is no objection, which is Senator \nLincoln's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4194\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nLincoln amendment, No. 4194.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I will give a moment to the Senator to \ncollect herself and indicate that we are making very good progress. We \nhave a long way to go. We thank colleagues for being so cooperative, \nbut I do indicate that if we have any hope of getting done tonight, \neven late tonight, it is going to take forbearance on the part of \ncolleagues because we have probably 45, even 50 amendments still \npending. That means at three an hour--my colleagues can do the math--we \nwill be well into tomorrow. I ask colleagues, if there is an ability to \nwithhold amendments on this vehicle for another vehicle, that would \ncertainly be helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, my amendment is a simple one, and that \nis to better ensure that the men and women who have so courageously \nserved our Nation in uniform receive the benefits to which they are \nentitled, and certainly have earned, in a more timely manner.\n  I join my colleague Senator Snowe in offering this amendment. Last \nyear, we got around $70 million in the budget resolution and then again \nthrough the appropriations to specifically go to the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration to hire more claims processing staff.\n  We have seen a tremendous backlog. I know other Senators in their \noffices and in their casework find the same situation I do, and that \nis, these incredible men and women who have served our Nation in \nuniform and done so in such a courageous and brave way are not getting \nthe benefits they need or deserve. And they are not getting them in a \ntimely way--anywhere from 180 days to more in terms of backlog.\n\n  The VBA certainly needs more resources. They need the resources to \ntrain these individuals who are working with them to ensure that those \nbenefits are delivered to these brave men and women.\n  I certainly thank the chairman and the ranking member for working \nwith us, and certainly Senator Snowe, and urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am a cosponsor of the Lincoln, \nMikulski, and Snowe amendment.\n  Our military people don't stand in line when they have to serve this \ncountry, and they shouldn't have to stand in line to file for their \ndisability claims. This is outrageous. We need to put enough money into \nthe checkbook to protect the troops over there and when they come back \nhere.\n  Let us vote for this Lincoln amendment. If you support the troops, \nlet us end the backlog.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4194) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I believe we are back to the Sununu \namendment. We have a side-by-side, I understand, with Senator Kerry.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4221\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Sununu amendment.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, this is an amendment that simply adds \nlanguage to the deficit-neutral fund that emphasizes health care IT.\n  We all know the value of technology and improving health care \nefficiency, lowering costs, and reducing medical errors. Our language--\nmy language--would ensure that health care IT focuses first on \nelectronic prescriptions. We know we can reduce the number of errors, \nthe mistakes in prescribing, improve the quality of care, and improve \nhealth care costs for all our seniors by moving to electronic \nprescribing, with incentives for doctors, grants for doctors to \naccelerate this process.\n  This is based on legislation introduced by Senators Kerry and \nStabenow on the Democratic side and Senator Ensign and me on the \nRepublican side. It is a strong bipartisan effort that will save money \nand improve the cost of care. I know Senator Kerry has a similar \namendment that adds further language to this section, and I hope the \nSenate will accept both of the amendments.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we have no objection to the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the Sununu amendment pass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4221) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to reconsider, and to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4332\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 4332.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Whitehouse, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4332.\n\n  Mr. Kerry. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To promote the modernization of the health care system \n       through the adoption of electronic prescribing technology)\n\n       On page 64, line 1, insert ``, including incentives or \n     other supports for the adoption of electronic prescribing \n     technology,'' after ``technology''.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, as the Senator from New Hampshire has \nsaid, this is a slight variation of the amendment we just passed. It is \nan idea we have been working on, on a bipartisan basis and hopefully in \nthe conference the two amendments can be melded into one. We didn't \nhave time to do it now, but I look forward to seeing it pass.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, can we go to consideration of the Kerry \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4332) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, that takes us to the Kennedy amendment, \nwhich is a side-by-side to the Alexander amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4350\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we are going to have, in a moment, the \nAlexander amendment. This is an option which I hope the Senate will \naccept.\n  The Alexander amendment would undermine our civil rights laws. The \nAlexander amendment would cut the EEOC's budget at a time when they \nhave reported a 9-percent increase in the charges of discrimination. We \nshould be giving the EEOC more money to fight the problem, not less.\n  In addition, the kinds of cases the Senator from Tennessee opposes \nare extremely rare. The EEOC filed only 29 suits in the past 11 years \ninvolving English-only policies, and only when speaking English was \nunnecessary to do the job.\n  If we want to fund English literacy--and I favor that we should do \nit--we should do so, but not by harming the EEOC's ability to fight \ndiscrimination. So my amendment provides the needed support for English \nlanguage education, and funds it across the board for the cut, without \nharming the EEOC's ability to fight discrimination.\n  Madam President, this is amendment No. 4350.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Senator Kennedy] proposes \n     an amendment numbered 4350.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for the Department of Education's English \n     Literacy-Civics Education State Grant program, with an offset)\n\n       On page 18, line 16, increase the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 17, increase the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $1,000,000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, as I understand the amendment of the \nSenator from Massachusetts, he would increase funding for the adult \nliteracy programs to help Americans learning English. I think that is a \nterrific idea. Since 1906, immigrants have been required to learn \nEnglish. No Child Left Behind, which the Senator helped to write, \nmeasures their progress in English. Legislation I have offered, and \nwhich the Senate has passed, gives people who are legally here and who \nseek to become a citizen a chance to become\n\n[[Page S2051]]\n\na citizen a year early if they become proficient in English.\n  I support Senator Kennedy's amendment. In a moment, I will offer my \namendment, which will stop the Government from suing the Salvation Army \nfor requiring its employees to speak English on the job. That is a \ndifferent matter. The Senator is right on this amendment, and I look \nforward to voting for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Chair yield for a moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would ask if both Senators would be \nwilling to take voice votes on these two amendments?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, no, I wish to have the rollcall vote \non our amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are agreeable to a voice vote on the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be glad to take it if the Senator from Tennessee \nwanted a voice vote. I am glad to take it. If he insists on a rollcall, \nthen we will necessitate a rollcall on our side. But I would be glad to \nvoice vote it if the Senator from Tennessee wants to do that.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I admire the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and I plan to vote for it, but there is not so much \nadmiration for my amendment by some Senators. I wish to have a rollcall \nvote on it because I think it is time it became the law, and it has \nalready been passed here before. So I will require a rollcall vote on \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on amendment No. 4222, offered by the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, Mr. Alexander. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in the 1990s, Arthur Schlesinger, \nJr., a prominent Democrat, a great friend of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, wrote a book about the ``Disuniting of America.'' He \ndeplored the balkanization of our country. The Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission is balkanizing our country when it sues the \nSalvation Army, as it did, for requiring its employees to speak our \ncommon language on the job. Any employer may require any employee to \nspeak whatever language, but that is our national language. Only a few \nthings unite us--our common history, the principles in our founding \ndocuments, and our common language. We should be valuing rather than \ndevaluing our common language. A vote yes is for uniting America, a \nvote no on this amendment is for disuniting America, in the words of \nArthur Schlesinger.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, let's look at what the law is and what \nthe Alexander amendment provides. The law currently says that if there \nis a need to speak English on the job, fine; employers can require \nthat. But employers cannot use English-only rules as an excuse when \nthey want to fire minorities who are performing the job correctly. In \nthis fact situation, those employees had performed the job correctly \nfor 5 years.\n  In addition, this amendment reduces the EEOC's ability to fight all \nforms of discrimination because it cuts the entire budget. That means \nrace, age, religion, and disability cases will be harmed.\n  I hope the amendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I think it would be useful at this point \nto recap the next tranche of amendments. The following amendments are \nin order: Menendez, 4259; Sessions, 4231; Cornyn, 4242; Pryor, 4181; \nAllard, 4246;\n\n[[Page S2052]]\n\nNelson, 4212, Ensign 4240; Sanders, 4218; Conrad, undesignated; Gregg, \n4305; Reed, 4154; DeMint 4328; Biden, 4164; Dole, 4208; Dodd, 4254; \nAllard, 4232; Brown, 4155; Brownback, 4284; Kohl, 4197; Baucus side-by-\nside, undesignated; Hatch, 4280. That is the order of the next tranche \nof amendments.\n  Let me say for the benefit of our colleagues that it is going to take \nreal restraint if we are going to have any kind of reasonable ending by \nany kind of reasonable time. All of those amendments are in order. We \nare prepared to vote on them. To the extent colleagues could withhold \non additional amendments, that would certainly be helpful.\n  We are rapidly approaching the point at which we will have had the \naverage number of amendments on a budget resolution. It runs from 32 to \n36, roughly, on a budget resolution for rollcall votes. If we get \nthrough this tranche, I think we will be well over that number. But \ncolleagues have a right, we understand that. We ask people to think if \nthere is a possibility to withhold.\n  Senator Menendez is next.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4259\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nMenendez.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, my amendment creates a deficit reserve \nfund to support increased border security and enforcement of \nimmigration laws. But instead of going down the same old tired way that \nhas not created results, as you will be asked to do in the amendment \nfrom Senator Sessions, what we do is actually go after the magnet that \nbrings people to this country; that is, jobs and those who employ them \nillegally.\n  So we have the ability, under this amendment, to pursue civil \npenalties against bad-actor employers, to render them ineligible to \nreceive Federal contracts; to also go after criminal aliens in Federal, \nState, and local prisons to make sure we deport them; and finally, to \nimplement the exit data portion of the US-VISIT entry and exit data \nsystem so we know who is coming into this country and how to track \nthem. These are the ways we will begin to address some of our \nimmigration challenges.\n  Finally, we make sure we allow the National Guard to go to the border \nbut not until we have it declared that it will not impede or render \nunsafe our troops abroad, which the National Guard are supporting.\n  For all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support our amendment \nand oppose the amendment from Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the amendment offered by my colleague \nis an amendment that does not effectively replace the amendment I have \noffered.\n  My amendment that will be coming up next is a broad amendment. But \nthis amendment contains immigration reform language that suggests once \nagain that enforcement cannot be effectively done without a \ncomprehensive amnesty approach. It fails to include any provision for \nState and local law enforcement, fails to include any provision for \nborder fencing, fails to include any provision to advance specifically \nthe effective operations streamline policy that is being done now in \nfour border areas, that needs to be done in 20, and that has resulted \nin a 60-percent reduction in illegal entry in those four areas. The \nMenendez amendment does not particularly cover that area. I would ask \nthat it not be passed and that my amendment coming up next would be the \none more appropriately effective to carry out the will of this \nCongress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on amendment No. 4231 offered by the Senator \nfrom Alabama, Mr. Sessions.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, this Senate has repeatedly voted on \nissue after issue after issue that would move us toward a lawful system \nof immigration. But for one reason or the other, those votes have not \nbeen translated into action or funding. As a result, we have not made \nthe progress we should have made. We have created a lack of confidence \nin the American people who are cynical about what we do. My amendment \nis broad. It would allow a budget-neutral reserve fund for any \nimmigration factor, but it specifically mentions six. It does not in \nany way suggest these enforcement measures should be delayed until some \namnesty proposal or comprehensive reform is passed. The programs \ninclude Operation Streamline. Four of twenty southern border sectors \nnow are prosecuting illegal entries, and they have seen a 60-percent \nreduction in illegality. We would like to see that in all 20, of \ncourse. It would commit us to construction of the fence and four other \nareas.\n  I urge support for this amendment, which would clearly move us in the \ndirection we have been voting in the past.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment. The Senate, in a significant vote, voted to get to the heart \nof the matter, the draw of jobs and those who offer them illegally. \nThat is where the whole issue is. The Senate acted intelligently in \nthat respect. It was tough and smart. But under the Sessions amendment, \nwe are going to deploy another 6,000 National Guard, without \nconditions, to the border at a time in which we are overstretched with \nthe National Guard in Iraq, Afghanistan, and for challenges that States \nhave for emergencies in their own States. We are going to go ahead and \ndeputize local police in local departments. I believe that is a \nmistake. We have had these before. They have not succeeded. We \nsucceeded in passing an amendment that is going to be tough and smart \nand deal with the heart of the matter--employers who illegally hire \npeople. It will make sure they get sanctioned, make sure we proceed \nagainst those who have Federal contracts doing this and makes sure we \nget rid of criminal aliens in the jails--local, State and Federal. That \nis the way to pursue it.\n  Vote against the Sessions amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n4231.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, this amendment creates a 60-vote point of \norder against any legislation that will increase income tax rates on \ntaxpayers, including, of course, middle-class families and others.\n  If this looks familiar, it is because it is. Last year, we had a vote \non this precise amendment. You will see that we had 63 Senators vote in \nsupport of this point of order against raising income tax rates, \nincluding our friends on the other side of the aisle whose names are \nindicated on this chart.\n  I understand from the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee \nhe may offer a procedural objection to this amendment, but we are \nprepared at the appropriate time to offer a motion to waive any \nobjection.\n  I ask for support on this bipartisan legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I ask the Parliamentarian, through \nthe Presiding Officer, a series of questions about this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his inquiries.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, No. 1, is this amendment germane to the \nbudget resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, it is not \ngermane.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. 2, if this amendment were to be adopted, is it \ncorrosive to the privileged nature of a budget resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, the amendment \nwould be corrosive to the budget resolution.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. 3, if this amendment came back from the conference \ncommittee, would it be fatal to the privileged nature of the budget \nresolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be fatal to the privileged nature of \nthe budget resolution.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that is the problem with this amendment. \nThis is not in the jurisdiction----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is not in the jurisdiction of the committee.\n  Is all time yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I inquire whether adding the amendment at \nthis point--that is, prior to any conference committee--would endanger \nthe privileged nature of the budget resolution as opposed to offering \nit and adding it in conference? In other words, is there any difference \nbetween doing it now and adding it later?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is corrosive, but not fatal, to add the \namendment at this point in terms of the privilege.\n  Mr. CORNYN. So it would not affect the privileged status of the \nbudget resolution to agree to my amendment at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would not fatally affect it at this time.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it would fatally affect it if it came back \nfrom conference committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I raise a point of order that the Cornyn amendment is not \ngermane and therefore violates section 305 of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, pursuant to Section 904(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305(b)2 of \nthe Budget Act for consideration of this amendment to S. Con.

The yeas are 59, nays 39. Three-fifths of the \nSenators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in the affirmative, the \nmotion is rejected. The point of order is sustained and the amendment \nfalls.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have now cast roughly 19 rollcall \nvotes. We have another 20 pending. For the background of Senators, in \n2005, we had 37 recorded rollcall votes; in 2006, we had 36 recorded \nrollcall votes; in 2007, we\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\nhad 32 recorded rollcall votes. So with the votes we have already had \nand the votes in the train, we will have exceeded the recorded rollcall \nvotes of any of the last 3 years.\n  I say that knowing Senators have a right to continue to ask for \namendments, certainly. But to put it into some perspective, with 20 \nadditional amendments to be voted on, that would take 7 hours, which \nwould put us at midnight. I know sometimes the Senate does its best \nwork after dark, but I hope we will think seriously about relinquishing \nsome of these amendments and save them for a later vehicle.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4181\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. The next vote in order is the vote on the amendment by \nthe Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Pryor. We have indicated that on both \nsides we would be willing to take that as a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, this is amendment No. 4181. The cosponsors \nare Senators Snowe, Bingaman, and Kerry. It is a deficit-neutral \nreserve fund for science parks. These are sometimes called technology \nparks or business incubators. But there is no doubt these science parks \nhave a great track record of spurring innovation and job creation at a \ntime when the economy is slowing and international competition is \ngrowing. We need to do everything we can to provide good-paying jobs \nfor American workers.\n  More than 300,000 workers in North America work in a university \nscience park. Every job there generates an average of 2.57 jobs in the \neconomy.\n  With that, I think we have an agreement that we will voice vote this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4181) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4246\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that would take us to the Allard amendment \nNo. 4246.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I call for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, on the campaign trial, Senator Obama has \ncalled for about 188 proposals of new spending. What this amendment \nconsists of is this. We take 111 of those new spending proposals and we \nput them in this amendment. If you look at it with the 2009 5-year \nbudget, it will cost this country around $1.4 trillion. The argument \nhas been made on the campaign trail this will be paid for by taxing the \nrich. That is not possible.\n  If you apply tax increases to those who make $250,000, or more per \nyear, all you come up with is about $225 billion. That is not even \nclose to what it takes to pay for all these new proposals. What you are \ngoing to do is have to cram your hands into the pockets of small \nbusinesses and the middle-class families and yank the money out of \ntheir pockets and send it to Washington to pay for a bloated \nbureaucracy.\n  The point of this amendment is you cannot pay for all the spending by \ntaxing the rich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment is a concoction. It is a \ncomplete fabrication. Senator Obama is not the President of the United \nStates. Senator Obama has not presented a budget to this body. This is \nmake-believe.\n  I think it is unfortunate the Senator has offered this amendment \nstyled in this way. We have not done that. I think this is beneath the \ndignity of the Senate. I urge my colleagues to vote no against what is \na complete fiction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) are necessarily absent.\n  If present and voting, the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln) would \nvote ``no.''\n  Mr. KYL.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4212\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the next amendment in order is the Nelson \namendment on construction. I understand the Senator has a modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, the modification is not in the \nbody of the amendment but in the stated purpose. To make the statement \nof purpose acceptable to the other side, we have stricken the word \n``emergency.'' That meets with the approval of the other side, so it is \nnow as changed.\n  As we all know, the budget resolution before us includes room in the \nbudget in 2008 and 2009 for an additional stimulus package. The \ndistinguished chairman included this ``insurance policy'' against \nfurther economic downturn, and I commend him for it. I also thank him \nand Senator Baucus and all the distinguished bipartisan cosponsors for \nworking with me to adopt this amendment.\n  The amendment simply allocates more of the stimulus money for ``ready \nto go'' infrastructure projects. The amendment moves $3.5 billion from \nthe allowances functions to the transportation function and designates \nit as fiscal year 2008 discretionary funding. This existing money is \nalready assumed in the resolution.\n  I reiterate this point: The $3.5 billion is already assumed in the \nresolution. The idea behind this amendment is simple. If we are going \nto spend, we should invest. This amendment injects money into the \neconomy and creates jobs, over 40,000 jobs per billion dollars of \ninfrastructure expenditures, but it also makes a lasting investment in \ninfrastructure that will remain long after the economy recovers.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Nelson], for himself, Mr. \n     Voinovich, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Nelson \n     of Florida, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Conrad, and Ms. Stabenow, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4212.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To create additional jobs and make a lasting investment in \n      our national infrastructure by increasing Fiscal Year 2008 \ninfrastructure stimulus funding by designating $3.5 billion in existing \n      stimulus funding in the resolution as discretionary funding)\n\n       On page 16, line 9, increase the amount by $3,500,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 10, increase the amount by $3,500,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 12, decrease the amount by $3,500,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 13, decrease the amount by $3,500,000,000.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4212) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4240\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the next amendment is the Ensign \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, briefly, this amendment is to means test \nMedicare Part D the same way we means test Medicare Part B. An \nindividual making over $82,000 a year, a couple making over $164,000--\nseniors--would be expected to pay a little over $10 a month extra. That \nis all we are doing.\n  This amendment saves a couple billion dollars over the next 5 years. \nIt is very reasonable. There is nothing else in this budget that does \nanything on entitlement reform, and we all know entitlements are \nheading for a train wreck in this country. We ought to at least do this \nlittle bit for our children for deficit reduction.\n  I encourage all Senators to vote for this amendment. It is very \nreasonable. It is modeled exactly after Medicare Part B means testing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign], for himself, Mr. \n     Graham, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. DeMint, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4240.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the problem with this amendment is exactly \nwhat the sponsor said: It is exactly like Part B. Part B, as we know, \nis a premium that is paid with respect to doctors' examinations and \nMedicare reimbursement. Part D is the drug benefit. Part D premiums \nvary significantly nationwide according to geography and according to \nthe plans offered. It is nothing like Part B.\n  To say we should pattern this off Part B is a statement not fully \nappreciative of the sophistication of the changes in the Part D. That \nis one reason not to support this amendment.\n  Second, any change in Part D is required to be in any Medicare bill \nif it comes up. We may want to make other Medicare changes. We don't \nwant to be restricted to means testing.\n  Third, this should be considered broad health care reform, at least \nMedicare reform, and not be isolated in this case.\n  I strongly urge this amendment not be adopted.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4240.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank Senators Durbin, Kennedy, \nClinton, Harkin, Schumer, Mikulski, Brown, Casey, and Menendez for \ncosponsoring this amendment. I also thank dozens of national \norganizations representing tens of millions of Americans for supporting \nit, including the AFL-CIO, the SCIU, the Children's Defense Fund, the \nYWCA, and many other organizations.\n  This amendment cannot be simpler. The wealthiest people in the \ncountry have not had it so good since the 1920s. Their incomes are \nsoaring, while at the same time the middle class is shrinking, and we \nhave by far the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major country. \nThe time is now to begin changing our national priorities and moving \nthis country in a different direction.\n  This amendment restores the top income tax bracket for households \nearning more than $1 million a year, it raises $32.5 billion over 3 \nyears, and invests that in our kids, including $10 billion for special \neducation, because the time is long overdue that we kept our word \nregarding special education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime? The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the problem is we are in the game here, \nspending the same dollar three or four times, it appears. Under the \nSanders amendment, it is paid for by raising taxes another $32.5 \nbillion, ostensibly from the rich; that is to say, by raising taxes on \npeople who make over $1 million a year. Here is the problem with that. \nThe budget on the floor already assumes the expiration of the current \ntax rates; that is to say, the rates on the highest level go from 35 to \n39.6, and that money is spent. If you took all the top-rate income, you \nwould come up with $25 billion a year, not even enough to meet what is \nhere, and that money has already been spent.\n  The reality is somewhere or other, somehow, more taxes would have to \nbe raised. I don't think the American people want to do that, \nparticularly in the current environment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to, one more time, implore our \ncolleagues--we have some colleagues who have multiple amendments \npending. By the time we end this tranche, we will have had nearly 40 \nvotes. That is significantly more than any of the last 3 years we have \nhad a budget resolution in terms of recorded rollcall votes. But we \nhave some colleagues--I do not know whether this is their staff \nspeaking for them or whether Members are actually so wedded to those \namendments. I would ask colleagues to ask their staffs how many \namendments they have on these lists. We have a list here of 50 more \namendments. That really is not reasonable. That is not reasonable by \nany historic standard.\n  The next amendment in order is the amendment by the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe the next amendment was my \namendment, but we have agreed to pass over it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, that is correct. Senator Gregg's amendment is next \nin line, but we have agreed to drop that down. Some work is being done \non that\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\namendment, which makes the next amendment in order the amendment of the \nSenator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4154\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my amendment would increase LIHEAP funding \nby an additional $2.6 billion to bring it up to the fully authorized \namount.\n  I call up amendment No. 4154.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mr. Brown, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Obama, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Sununu, and Mr. \n     Whitehouse, proposes an amendment numbered 4154.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reduce the energy burden of low-income families, seniors, \n  and individuals with disabilities by increasing funding for the Low-\n Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) by $2.6 billion in FY \n                                 2009)\n\n       On page 19, line 16, increase the amount by $2,600,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 17, increase the amount by $1,820,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 21, increase the amount by $728,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 25, increase the amount by $52,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $2,600,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $1,820,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, decrease the amount by $728,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 25, decrease the amount by $52,000,000.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment would raise the LIHEAP \nspending to the authorized total of $5.1 billion. I wish to recognize \nthe work of Senator Specter and Senator Harkin, who earlier today \npassed an amendment that increased LIHEAP funding. I have worked very \nclosely with my colleagues, especially Senator Collins.\n  Let me point out what is obvious to everyone today: Oil reached $111 \na barrel. That translates very quickly into excruciatingly high prices \nfor seniors or low-income Americans. LIHEAP is a program that can help \nthem. I would urge passage.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Collins, on the other side.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I, too, urge adoption of this amendment. \nThis has been a very hard winter in the Northeast, with extreme cold \nand very high prices. We can make a big difference by increasing this \naccount to bring it to the authorized level. In my State of Maine, the \nlast allocation was used up in a matter of 4 days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition to the \namendment?\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4154, as modified\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \namendment in order to reflect the previous amendment passed by Senators \nHarkin and Specter. It has been agreed to by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REED. I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 21, line 16, increase the amount by $1,600,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 17, increase the amount by $1,120,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 21, increase the amount by $448,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 25, increase the amount by $32,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $1,600,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $1,120,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, decrease the amount by $448,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 25, decrease the amount by $32,000,000.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I urge adoption of the amendment and ask unanimous consent \nthat it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4154), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand we are going to Senator DeMint \nnext.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4328\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4328 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMINT] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4328.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for a deficit-neutral reserve fund for Social \n                            Security reform)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESERVE FUND FOR SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM.\n\n       If the Senate Committee on Finance reports a bill or joint \n     resolution, or an amendment is offered thereto, or a \n     conference report is submitted thereon, that provides changes \n     to the Federal Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance \n     Benefits Program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) by--\n       (1) requiring that the Federal Old Age and Survivors Trust \n     Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund are to \n     be used only to finance expenditures to provide retirement \n     income of future beneficiaries of such program;\n       (2) ensuring that there is no change to current law \n     scheduled benefits for individuals born before January 1, \n     1952;\n       (3) providing participants with the benefits of savings and \n     investment while permitting the pre-funding of at least some \n     portion of future benefits; and\n       (4) ensuring that the funds made available to finance such \n     legislation do not exceed the amounts of the Chief Actuary of \n     the Social Security Administration's intermediate actuarial \n     estimates of the Federal Old Age and Survivors Trust Fund and \n     the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, as published in \n     the most recent report of the Board of Trustees of such Trust \n     Funds;\n\n     the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may revise \n     the allocations, aggregates, and other levels in this \n     resolution by the amounts provided by such legislation, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2013 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2018.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, every Senator here today knows we need to \naddress the problem with Social Security. Within the next 8 or 10 \nyears, the current surplus we have for Social Security will run out and \nwe will be in the red as far as cashflow goes. We will begin to \ntransfer money from the general fund to pay for Social Security.\n  Over the last two decades, we have taken over $2 trillion of Social \nSecurity surplus and spent it on other things. In the next 5 years \nalone, counting interest, we will take another trillion of this surplus \nand spend it elsewhere. This amendment simply says we should spend this \nSocial Security surplus that is in front of us only on Social Security.\n  The last time this bill was on the floor, it got 45 votes. Several of \nyou who voted against it said you thought it set up private accounts, \nso you voted against it. There is nothing in this amendment about \nsetting up private accounts or how we save it. It simply says that we \nspend Social Security on Social Security and save it for the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida.) The Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment is privatization of Social \nSecurity. This body rejected an amendment of this nature in 2006. We \nalso voted last year and rejected it. The country rejected the \nprivatization in 2005.\n  This will increase insolvency of the Social Security trust fund, not \nhelp it. Despite what the Senator said, let me quote what it says:\n\n       Providing participants with the benefits of savings and \n     investment while permitting the prefunding . . .\n\n  Essentially, this, as stated in the language, sets up private \naccounts for the benefits of investments and savings. We all know that \nthe volatility of the stock market is not the best thing for seniors.\n  This is privatization of Social Security. We have voted on this many \ntimes in the past. I urge the same vote today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S2058]]\n\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4164\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have been instructed by the Budget \nCommittee that I have to ask for a modification of the amendment. The \npagination on the amendment was off. First, I call up amendment No. \n4164.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], for himself, Mrs. \n     Boxer, Mr. Brown, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Casey, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n     Kohl, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \n     Reed, and Mr. Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 4164.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To increase 2009 funding for the COPS program to $1.15 \n                        billion, with an offset)\n\n       On page 24, line 16, increase the amount by $551,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 17, increase the amount by $66,000.000.\n       On page 24, line 21, increase the amount by $154,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 25, increase the amount by $138,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 4, increase the amount by $110,000.000.\n       On page 25, line 8, increase the amount by $83,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $551,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $66,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, decrease the amount by $154,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 25, decrease the amount by $138,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 4, decrease the amount by $110,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 8, decrease the amount by $83,000,000.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4164, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk. As I \nexplained to my colleagues, the pagination in the amendment was \nincorrect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 24, line 16, increase the amount by $551,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 17, increase the amount by $66,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 21, increase the amount by $154,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 25, increase the amount by $138,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 4, increase the amount by $110,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, increase the amount by $83,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $551,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $66,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, decrease the amount by $154,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 25, decrease the amount by $138,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 4, decrease the amount by $110,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 8, decrease the amount by $83,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. My amendment will support full funding for the COPS Program. \nIt is fully offset by an across-the-board cut in nondefense \ndiscretionary spending. The chairman asked whether I would be willing \nto have a voice vote. At this hour of the night, I would be willing to \ndo about anything he asked me to do, including a voice vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think there is no time in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4164, as \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 4164), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on \nthe table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4208\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. The next amendment is the amendment by Senator Dole, No. \n4208.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4208 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mrs. Dole], for herself, \n     Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Vitter, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4208.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase amounts budgeted for States and local governments \n for expenses related to immigration enforcement training and support \n under section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, with an \n                                offset)\n\n       On page 24, line 16, increase the amount by $75,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 17, increase the amount by $60,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 21, increase the amount by $7,500,000.\n       On page 24, line 25, increase the amount by $7,500,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $75,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $60,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, decrease the amount by $7,500,000.\n       On page 27, line 25, decrease the amount by $7,500,000.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, my amendment would direct $75 million for \nICE to expand the 287(g) program so that more local law enforcement \nagencies have the resources to identify and help process criminal \nillegal aliens. To\n\n[[Page S2059]]\n\naddress the problems presented by individuals who are not only here \nillegally but who have self-identified themselves because of their \ncriminal behavior, we must provide the funding for ICE to make the \nnecessary resources available to local law enforcement officials who \nare on the front lines. Greater funding for ICE, specifically the \n287(g) program, is sorely needed. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there is no opposition. We ask colleagues \nto accept the amendment on a voice vote, if the Senator would agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 4208.\n  The amendment (No. 4208) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4254\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Next in order is an amendment by Senator Dodd, No. 4254.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I call up the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4254.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Resources \n and Services Administration for autism research, education, and early \n                       detection with an offset)\n\n       On page 19, line 16, increase the amount by $197,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 17, increase the amount by $73,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 21, increase the amount by $93,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 25, increase the amount by $22,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 4, increase the amount by $4,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $197,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $73,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, decrease the amount by $93,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 25, decrease the amount by $22,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 4, decrease the amount by $4,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Collins of Maine, and Senator Kennedy, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senators Klobuchar, Obama, Menendez, Lieberman, Durbin, \nand Clinton be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we are aware of the growing problem of \nautism. It used to be, not that long ago, that 1 child in 166 was \nafflicted with autism. Those numbers have now dropped to 1 in 150. It \nis the fastest growing neurological disability in the United States and \nbecoming more and more serious. It is highly complex. Senator Santorum \nand I offered the combating autism legislation a year or so ago, which \npassed overwhelmingly. This legislation increases the funding by $197 \nmillion. It is completely offset by dealing with the function 920. \nTherefore, it is paid for completely and revenue neutral. We urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, there has been an alarming increase in \nthe diagnosis of autism in this country. Back in the 1980s, it was 1 in \n2,500 children. As the Senator from Connecticut has indicated, the \ncurrent statistics are 1 in 150. That means that some 1.5 million \nchildren and their families are coping with this disease. This is an \narea where more research can make a tremendous difference. I urge \nadoption of the Dodd-Collins amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is the fastest growing developmental \ndisability in the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 4254.\n  The amendment (No. 4254) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4232\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that takes us to Allard amendment No. \n4232.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4232 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint], for Mr. \n     Allard, proposes an amendment numbered 4232.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To pay down the Federal debt and eliminate government waste \nby reducing spending 5 percent on programs rated (as mandated under the \nGovernment Performance and Results Act (Public Law 103-62)) ineffective \n   by Office of Management and Budget Program Assessment Rating Tool)\n\n       On page 4, line 5, decrease the amount by $750,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, decrease the amount by $375,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, decrease the amount by $225,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, decrease the amount by $150,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, decrease the amount by $375,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, decrease the amount by $225,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, decrease the amount by $150,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, decrease the amount by $375,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, decrease the amount by $750,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $750,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $750,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 16, decrease the amount by $375,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, decrease the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, decrease the amount by $750,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, decrease the amount by $750,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 20, decrease the amount by $750,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $750,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $375,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, decrease the amount by $225,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 25, decrease the amount by $150,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 10, decrease the amount by $750,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 11, decrease the amount by $375,000,000.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would ask Senator Allard to take a \nminute. I have called the amendment up. If the Senator will explain \nwhat it is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my amendment will cut the Federal deficit \nand eliminated Government waste by reducing spending 5 percent on \nprograms rated ``ineffective'' by the OMB and use the savings to pay \ndown the Federal debt.\n  Five percent is the expected increase under this budget. We are not \ncutting any programs or zeroing anything out, just saying that an \n``ineffective'' rating probably means they do not deserve an increase.\n  The PART program was initiated by Congress, a result of the \nGovernment Performance and Results Act, Public Law No. 103-62. It is \ntime we followed through on our efforts to increase Government \naccountability and efficiency. I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think there is a kernel of a good idea \nhere. Unfortunately, I think the PART program has been defective in its \nanalysis. It says, for example, the Community Development Block Grant \nprogram is defective because it lacks a clear purpose. Ask your mayors \nand your Governors about that. It says Amtrak's purpose is ambiguous. \nAsk the millions of people who go to work every day on Amtrak. It says \nthe Department of Homeland Security security grants have an ineffective \nrisk assessment formula and a lack of consistent performance. Ask that \nof the first responders\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\naround the country who have the responsibility of protecting the \nhomeland.\n  This would cut programs $750 million--programs that are vital to the \nsecurity of the country, to the economic growth of the country. I urge \nmy colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, do I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4232.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Nebraska (Mr. Hagel) and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Whatever that number is, we will lock those \nin and spend the rest of the time working through those. So I hope we \ncan do that. No one has been cut off from offering any amendments, but \nI hope people will work with the staffs. The staffs of Senator Gregg \nand Senator Conrad have worked very hard all this week, and I hope \npeople will work with them and be considerate of not only them but \nthese people up here who make the Senate work.

The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senators \nSnowe, Stabenow, Feingold, and Clinton.\n  To increase employment in manufacturing, Congress needs to address \ntraining and retraining of manufacturing workers. This amendment does \nthat.\n  More than 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost since 2000, \nmore than 200,000 in my State of Ohio alone.\n  Susan Helper, a business professor at Case Western Reserve University \nin Cleveland, wrote in the Washington Post recently about ``paving the \nhigh road'' for American manufacturing. The high road manufacturing \nagenda includes significant Federal investment in Federal tax credits \nfor research in the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and in worker \ntraining and retraining programs, which is what this amendment does. \nManufacturing training is a tool to help businesses succeed, especially \nsmall manufacturers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Brown-Snowe-Stabenow-Feingold-\nClinton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a very direct and well-known \nprocess that I wish to take to the rest of Government and ask my \ncolleagues to consider it.\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\n  I think we are all familiar with the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission. It is a process by which we try to correct where our \nmilitary bases are--where we have closed some, where we have put more \nresources in other places. I might note to my colleagues that it has \nsaved us $65 billion since BRAC has been in place. It has worked. It is \none of the things that has worked.\n  I wish to take that BRAC process to the rest of the Government \nprograms and have a commission identified, just as the BRAC Commission, \nto review all of the Federal programs and recommend for elimination \nthose that are duplicative or wasteful or have not accomplished their \npurposes and then give us one vote in a whole package--35 programs, 200 \nprograms--eliminate them or keep them, deal or no deal, and put that on \nthe line.\n  So I am asking for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would just ask the Senator from Kansas \nif he would be willing to accept a voice vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I would like a recorded vote. We have done this by \nvoice, and I think it is time to really seriously consider it and see \nwhere Members are on this issue.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will not oppose the amendment of the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 4284.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I speak today in support of my amendment, \nwhich would allow for the creation of a comprehensive nationwide system \nof background checks for long-term care workers. As it now stands, \nthousands of individuals with a history of abuse or a criminal record \nare hired every year to work closely with defenseless seniors within \nour Nation's nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. These \nindividuals evade detection throughout the hiring process, securing \njobs that allow them to assault, abuse, and steal from one of our most \nvulnerable populations.\n  I ask that my colleagues support the amendment I offer today with \nSenators Domenici, Lincoln, Whitehouse, Bingaman, Clinton, Coleman, \nStabenow, Levin, Casey, and Klobuchar, which will allow us to expand \nthe outstanding results of the pilot program nationwide. The amendment \nproposes that the Senate reserve $160 million over 3 years in a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to pay for such an expansion. I hope we \ncan get this amendment passed.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4239 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4239.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on funding for national \n                    defense in future fiscal years)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF SENATE ON FUNDING FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE IN \n                   FUTURE FISCAL YEARS.\n\n       (a) Finding.--The Senate finds that the budget of the \n     President for fiscal year 2009 requests funds for national \n     defense, exclusive of wartime costs and supplemental \n     appropriations, that constitute an amount equal to \n     approximately 3.3 percent of the current gross domestic \n     product of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the amount of funds for national defense, exclusive of \n     wartime costs and supplemental appropriations, for fiscal \n     year 2010 should be not less than an amount equal to 3.7 \n     percent of the then-current gross domestic product of the \n     United States;\n       (2) it should be the policy of the United States to fund \n     national defense, exclusive of such costs and appropriations, \n     for fiscal year 2011 in an amount equal to not less than 4 \n     percent of the then-current gross domestic product of the \n     United States; and\n       (3) the amount of funding for national defense, exclusive \n     of such costs and appropriations, for each fiscal year after \n     fiscal year 2011 should be the amount of funds for national \n     defense for the preceding fiscal year as adjusted pursuant to \n     the most appropriate cost adjustment index.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my intention to withdraw this \namendment, but I wish to use this moment to serve notice that this is \nsomething that not just myself but several of us are concerned about, \nparticularly those of us on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  We have gone through a period of time, up until the early nineties, \nwhen our defense spending was somewhere around--in fact, for the entire \n100 years in the 20th century, it averaged 5.7 percent of GDP. At the \nend of the nineties, it got down to just under 3 percent. If we are to \nanticipate the needs we will have in the future, it is going to be \nnecessary to have some kind of a floor.\n  What this amendment says is we will have to start the process by \nputting 4 percent of the GDP into the defense system. It is one that \nwould accomplish three things.\n  First, it would allow us to build the next generation of weapons and \nequipment. As we know, we are doing one weapon right now that will take \nthe next 30 years.\n  Second, it will add predictability to the industrial base.\n  And third, it sends a clear message to our military, allies, and \nenemies that we are committed to the security of our Nation.\n  It shocks a lot of people when they find out we have platform weapons \nsystems that are not as good as our potential adversaries. This would \ncorrect that problem.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4239 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that this amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from North Dakota, \nthe chairman of the committee, is going to make a request as to \nschedule. But I will simply say we are trying to develop a final finite \nlist, and anybody on our side who has an amendment who has not \ncontacted us--I believe everybody has; I believe we know what all the \namendments are that people want--it is very important they tell us \nabout them because we are developing a final finite list. And we will \neven accept amendments from your side if you want to tell us about \nthem. That is OK too.\n\n  As a practical matter, I would encourage people on the Republican \nside to tell us what they want so we can pull up this final finite \nlist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if everyone cooperates in these final \nhours, I think we could reach conclusion. It will be late, but we could \nreach conclusion at a reasonable time tonight--at least before \nmidnight. But it really is going to require everybody's cooperation.\n  If you have an amendment that you could reserve until a later \nvehicle, please do. We have already had nearly 30 rollcall votes. That \nis very close to what the average has been in the last 3 years in terms \nof recorded votes. We still have more rollcall votes that are going to \nhave to be done.\n  We think at this point it would be wise to take a half-hour break to \ngive people a chance to match the paperwork that is out there and try \nto conclude on a finite list.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would ask the chair and the ranking \nmember, I know there are a good number of amendments on both sides that \nare bipartisan and noncontroversial, and my hope would be that in this \nbreak and in future breaks packages of amendments could be put together \nthat are noncontroversial and bipartisan and move them as a block \nbecause I think there are a good many of them, and that would be very \nhelpful.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator has made a good suggestion and \none that Senator Gregg and I have just discussed that we will do during \nthis break, and that is to try to put together, No. 1, a finite list of \namendments that still require a vote; and, No. 2, a managers' amendment \nof bipartisan, noncontroversial amendments that could be agreed to as a \npackage.\n  Mr. GREGG. I stress, Mr. President, when we come out of this break, \nwe hope to have a finite list and hope to lock it in, so we need to \nhear from folks. We are, as the Senator from--the junior or senior \nSenator, I never know--from North Dakota suggested, Senator Dorgan, we \nwill be working on a group of amendments that everyone can agree to and \ndoing those as just a package.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2062-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2062-S2067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR STUDYING THE \n                   EFFECT OF COOPERATION WITH LOCAL LAW \n                   ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate may revise the allocations of a \n     committee or committees, aggregates, and other levels in this \n     resolution for 1 or more bills, joint resolutions, \n     amendments, motions, or conference reports, by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for the purposes described in \n     this subsection, that would require an assessment of the \n     impact of local ordinances that prohibit cooperation with the \n     Department of Homeland Security, with respect to--\n       (1) the effectiveness of law enforcement, success rates of \n     criminal prosecutions, reporting of criminal activity by \n     immigrant victims of crime, and level of public safety;\n       (2) changes in the number of reported incidents or \n     complaints of racial profiling; or\n       (3) wrongful detention of United States Citizens and Lawful \n     Permanent Residents.\n       (b) Limitation.--The authority under subsection (a) may not \n     be used unless the legislation described in subsection (a) \n     would not increase the deficit over--\n       (1) the total period comprised of fiscal years 2008 through \n     2013; or\n       (2) the total period comprised of fiscal years 2008 through \n     2018.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a problem on whose behalf I am \noffering this. We will get this resolved very quickly. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the record should reflect this is not being \noffered on behalf of Senator Cardin or Senator Menendez. It is being \noffered by me.\n  This is an important amendment. We believe in the COPS Program. The \npurpose of the program is to stop crime and the sanctuary city program, \nthat is being advocated by my friend from Louisiana will not alleviate \ncrime. In fact, it will stop people from even going to law enforcement \nif there is a crime committed, because if they go to a police officer, \nthe police officer, under this provision Senator Vitter has, would have \nto ask whether citizenship is up to date, and I don't think that does \nanyone any good. We want immigrants to report crimes. We don't want \npeople taking advantage of them. We want safety. That is what the COPS \nProgram is all about.\n  We have a Federal form of Government, and that is what this is all \nabout. I certainly ask my friends to vote in favor of this amendment. \nThis is for law enforcement and it is for safe cities and it is to \nprotect our form of Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I have no objection to this study \namendment. I will support it. I will be happy to support it by voice \nvote.\n  For the record, I would like to correct two things. First, I do not \nsupport any sanctuary city program. What my amendment does, which is \ncoming up, would be to say that sanctuary cities, which defy Federal \nlaw, are going to have to pay some consequence for going completely \ncontrary to Federal law. Do you believe there should be some \nappropriate consequence for defying Federal immigration law?\n  With regard to that amendment, I hope to get bipartisan support.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Parliamentary inquiry. We were in the middle of a vote. \nIs it possible to curtail the vote while we were in the middle of a \nvote and suggest the absence of a quorum?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the leader has indicated that he would be \nwilling to take a voice vote on his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. This is a vote on which amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The leader's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is on the majority leader's \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4373) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe Senator Vitter is the next speaker in order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4309\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I call up the Vitter sanctuary city amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter], for himself and \n     Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered 4309.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4309) is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To create a reserve fund to ensure that Federal assistance \ndoes not go to sanctuary cities that ignore the immigration laws of the \n United States and create safe havens for illegal aliens and potential \n                              terrorists)\n\n       On page 69, after line 25, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 308. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO PREVENT FUNDING FOR \n                   SANCTUARY CITIES.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     may revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other levels in this resolution for a bill, \n     joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report \n     that would ensure that funds appropriated for the Community \n     Oriented Policing Services Program are not used in violation \n     of section 642(a) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1373(a)), \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     over--\n       (1) the 6-year period comprised of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2013; or\n       (2) the 11-year period comprised of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2018.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I was happy to support that study \namendment. But this is the meat of the issue. There are so-called \nsanctuary cities all across the country which establish, as an official \npolicy of their jurisdiction, an official action by vote of the \ncouncil: We are not going to cooperate with Federal immigration \nenforcement officials. That is wrong. What is more, it is completely \ncontrary to Federal immigration law.\n  My amendment says: We are going to put some consequence to that \ndefiance of Federal law. We are not going to give them COPS funds. We \nare going to send those funds, instead, to all of those other \njurisdictions which abide by Federal law.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my understanding is that there are \nsanctuary cities in about 23 different States across America. What the \nVitter amendment will do is to take away the COPS funding from those \ncities.\n  The offeror of this amendment has not spoken to the police \ndepartments. If you will speak to the policemen, they will tell you \nthey need the cooperation of everyone to solve crimes and stop crime. \nIf you create fear in\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\nthe minds of those who are here in an undocumented status that any \ncooperation with the police will result in their arrest, they will not \ncooperate and criminals will go free. There will be more people who \nwill become victims--exactly the opposite of what we want to see in \nAmerica.\n  Let's not use the COPS Program as some sort of threat. If you want to \ndeal with immigration, deal with it responsibly in a comprehensive way. \nPlease, let's defeat the Vitter amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 seconds.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if folks feel that way, they should come \nto Congress and change Federal law, not simply defy Federal law. This \nis another amnesty vote. Are we going to give folks in sanctuary cities \namnesty for defying Federal law and refusing to cooperate, as Federal \nlaw demands, with Federal immigration officials?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to table the Vitter amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Parliamentary inquiry: Is that motion in order even \nthough you have already asked for the yeas and nays?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  The question is on the motion to table.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 58, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 69 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--58\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Byrd\n     McCain\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

It funds a program that Senator Ensign \nstrongly supports. It did pass the last Congress--not this Senate, the \nlast Senate. He is setting aside $50 million in the Justice Department \nfor this particular priority. What if we each came down here with our \npriority bill? I have one to fund preschool for all kids, but it is not \npassed. If I asked you to set aside $50 million for a bill that was not \nlaw yet, it would make no sense. When I asked Senator Ensign, he said: \nWell, it could pass. The Child Custody Protection Act could pass. It \ncould pass here. It could pass the House. It could be signed by the \nPresident. But my friends, what I do here is just say: Let's take that \nsame amount of money and use it for all child protection laws. I hope \nMembers will support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, what we have done with the Child Custody \nProtection Act--Senator Boxer is correct, it is a bill that passed the \nU.S. Senate on a bipartisan vote of 65 to 34. What we are doing is \nsetting up a reserve fund that says if it passes this year, the money \nwill be there to enforce it.\n  We know around here a lot of times things are authorized, things are \npassed, but then the money is not there to enforce it. So what we want \nto do is set up a reserve fund so that if the law is passed, we will \nhave the money there to enforce it. This has to do with protecting \nminor children. There are many States in this country that have passed \nlaws--parental notification, parental consent laws--that want to \nprotect the rights of parents and children from being taken across \nState lines by adults. That is what this bill will allow the \nenforcement of, to make sure the Child Custody Protection Act has the \nmoney to be enforced by law enforcement across this country.\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We need to ask people to hold it down so we can conduct \nbusiness.

The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4335\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the last amendment Senator Boxer offered \nwas extra money to have laws that protect children. That is fine. That \nis why I voted for that last amendment. We could actually have taken \nthat amendment by a voice vote.\n  What my amendment now does is create money so we will be able to \nenforce the Child Custody Protection Act when we enact that law. Around \nhere, as I said before, too many times we enact laws, we authorize \nthings, and we do not fund them. This is going to set up funding so the \nChild Custody Protection Act--the law that says we are going to protect \nyoung children from being taken across State lines to have a surgical \nprocedure, a surgical abortion--we are going to make sure those people \nare protected.\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4335.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will finish very briefly.\n  This amendment strictly funds the Child Custody Protection Act that \npassed the Senate in a bipartisan fashion by a vote of 65 to 34. We \nwill now vote to make sure it is funded. That is simply what my \namendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to inform all colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle that you voted for $50 million to enhance the \nenforcement of child protective laws. If Senator Ensign's bill becomes \na law--which it is not the law; it has not passed this Senate in this \nCongress and I do not believe people feel it is going to become law--if \nit does become law, then that money is already there to be used for \nsuch a program.\n  But now to set aside funding for a bill that is not a law is the \noddest kind of precedent. It is kind of ``Alice in Wonderland,'' to be \nhonest with you. Every one of us could take our favorite bill and say: \nLet's set aside funding in case my bill becomes law.\n  This is not the way to legislate. We have put in $50 million to \nenhance the enforcement of child protective laws, including this \nparticular bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

LIMITATIONS ON LEGISLATION THAT WOULD INCREASE \n                   NATIONAL AVERAGE FUEL PRICES FOR AUTOMOBILES.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Senate is considering legislation, \n     upon a point of order being made by any Senator against \n     legislation, or any part of the legislation, that it has been \n     determined in accordance with paragraph (2) that the \n     legislation, if enacted, would result in an increase in the \n     national average fuel price for automobiles, and the point of \n     order is sustained by the Presiding Officer, the Senate shall \n     cease consideration of the legislation.\n       (2) Determination.--The determination described in this \n     paragraph means a determination by the Director of the \n     Congressional Budget Office, in consultation with the Energy \n     Information Administration and other appropriate Government \n     agencies, that is made upon the request of a Senator for \n     review of legislation, that the legislation, or part of the \n     legislation, would, if enacted, result in an increase in the \n     national average fuel price for automobiles.\n       (3) Legislation.--In this section the term ``legislation'' \n     means a bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report.\n       (b) Waivers and Appeals.--\n       (1) Waivers.--Before the Presiding Officer rules on a point \n     of order described in subsection (a)(1), any Senator may move \n     to waive the point of order and the motion to waive shall not \n     be subject to amendment. A point of order described in \n     subsection (a)(1) is waived only by the affirmative vote of \n     60 Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeals.--After the Presiding Officer rules on a point \n     of order described in subsection (a)(1), any Senator may \n     appeal the ruling of the Presiding Officer on the point of \n     order as it applies to some or all of the provisions on which \n     the Presiding Officer ruled. A ruling of the Presiding \n     Officer on a point of order described in subsection (a)(1) is \n     sustained unless 60 Members of the Senate, duly chosen and \n     sworn, vote not to sustain the ruling.\n       (3) Debate.--Debate on the motion to waive under paragraph \n     (1) or on an appeal of the ruling of the Presiding Officer \n     under paragraph (2) shall be limited to 1 hour. The time \n     shall be equally divided between, and controlled by, the \n     Majority leader and the Minority Leader of the Senate, or \n     their designees.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, with high gas prices becoming an \nincreasingly difficult burden for all American families, it is very \nimportant that we consider all the legislation we pass here to make \nsure it doesn't further increase the prices of gasoline.\n  This is a very simple amendment that creates a 60-vote point of order \nagainst any legislation that would cause the price of gasoline to \nincrease, as determined by the CBO in consultation with the Energy \nInformation Agency.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I ask a series of questions, through \nthe Chair, to the Parliamentarian?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may do so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Chair if the amendment by the \nSenator from South Carolina is germane to the budget resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not germane.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The second question is, If this amendment is adopted, is \nit corrosive to the privileged standing of budget resolutions?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is corrosive.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. 3, if this amendment were adopted and went to \nconference and if it came back from conference, would it be fatal to \nthe budget resolution's privileged status?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be.\n  Mr. CONRAD. This amendment is simply not in the jurisdiction of the \nBudget Committee. It is in the jurisdiction of the Energy Committee.\n  I raise a point of order that the amendment violates section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. It is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is premature. The Senator \nfrom South Carolina still has 29 seconds.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Parliamentary inquiry: Mr. President, if this point of \norder is waived and the amendment is adopted, would it cause the budget \nresolution to lose its privilege at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would not.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, in that case, I move to waive the Budget \nAct and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4313 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To protect the family budget from runaway Government spending \nby increasing the number of Senators necessary to waive the PAYGO Point \n                        of Order from 60 to 100)\n\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SENATORS NECESSARY TO WAIVE \n                   PAYGO POINT OF ORDER FROM 60 TO 100.\n\n       Section 201(b) of S. Con. Res. 21 (110th Congress) is \n     amended by striking ``three-fifths'' both places it appears \n     and inserting ``all''.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my amendment concerns pay-go or pay-as-\nyou-go. Right now pay-go may be waived if 60 Senators support doing so. \nMy amendment would strengthen the pay-go provision by requiring that \nall 100 Members of the Senate support waiving pay-go before it may be \nwaived.\n  Pay-go is so riddled with exceptions that the Wall Street Journal has \nreferred to it as the ``pay-go farce.'' If the Senate is serious about \nfiscal discipline and believes that pay-go is a useful tool in helping \ncontrol Government spending, then the Senate should be unanimous in \npassing any bill that violates pay-go, a tool the majority, including \nmembers of the Budget Committee, has advocated as a way to keep check \non expanding or creating a new Government program. It has been \ncriticized because it does not apply to discretionary spending and has \nfailed to constrain the growth in entitlement programs.\n  Pay-go needs to be honest. There needs to be truth in legislating \nwhen it comes to appropriations. I ask my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Texas has \nexpired. The Senator from North Dakota has 1 minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will ask a series of questions of the \nParliamentarian through the Chair.\n  Is the amendment by the Senator from Texas germane?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have not seen the amendment.\n  Mr. CORNYN. It is amendment No. 4313.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not germane.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would it be corrosive to the privileged status of the \nbudget resolution if this amendment were adopted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would not be corrosive.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would it be fatal to the privileged status of the budget \nresolution if it came back from conference?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it would not.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, so the challenge of this amendment is it \nis not germane. I, therefore, raise a point of order that the amendment \nviolates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive section 305(b)(2) of the \nBudget Act for consideration of this amendment to S. Con.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected, the point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just help people understand where \nwe are. We have what conceivably could be 9 or 10 more rollcall votes \nbut dozens of additional amendments that are out there pending--as many \nas a total of 50. So that is the circumstance we face. The only way \nthat Senator Gregg and I can see to reach conclusion tonight is if we \ndevise another managers' package, put together amendments that can be \ncleared on both sides and deal with these other votes that require \nrollcalls, starting with Senator Kyl on his extenders.\n  Or do we want to go to Senator DeMint?\n  Mr. GREGG. Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me thank all colleagues for their \nextraordinary patience. This will be, before the end of the day, I \nthink, a record number of votes on a budget resolution in 1 day. I \ndon't think that is anything particularly to be proud of, but it is the \nreality of what we are confronting.\n  We can go now to the Kyl amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as I understand it, the next two amendments \nwill first be Kyl, and then we will go to the DeMint amendment, which \nhas been anxiously awaited by large numbers of people.\n  Mr. REID. Prior to that time, we are going to have a finite list.\n  Mr. GREGG. In between we agree to have a finite list, and we will \nread them and that will be it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We thank the leaders of both sides, and I especially \nthank our leader, Senator Reid, for pushing to get a final definitive \nlist.\n  With that, we go to Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4348\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his courtesy.\n  One of the questions we are most frequently asked is, are we, for \nsure, going to do the tax extenders--the R tax credit, the sales tax \ndeduction, the $250 teacher deduction, and the tuition deduction. These \nalready expired at the end of last year, and there are three more that \nwill expire at the end of this year. We need to provide a definitive \nanswer--yes, we are going to do the extenders package.\n  Now, the budget accommodates generally expiring tax provisions.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am having a hard time hearing. I think \nthe Senator deserves to be heard. This is a serious amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. While we are getting order, Mr. President, this amendment, I \ngather, had not been technically called up, amendment No. 4348.\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just to conclude, the budget says expiring \nprovisions are accommodated, but I don't think the Senate is going to \nraise $50 billion in new taxes to pay for these, to pay permanently for \n1 or 2 years of these extenders. In fact, in recent times, more often \nthan not, we have extended these tax provisions without offsets. In \nfact, this was done when the Democratic Party was in control of this \nChamber, of this body, in the year 2002.\n  So what this amendment does is it simply explicitly extends all of \nthese expiring tax provisions, which would expire at the end of this \nyear and that have already expired, and it would not be required to \nhave a permanent increase in taxes in order to accommodate that \nextension.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the budget resolution already provides for \na 1-year package of extenders that is fully paid for. The Kyl amendment \nwould add a second year without paying for it. Consequently, the Kyl \namendment would drive us $28.6 billion into debt, driving us further \naway from the balance that we are seeking to achieve by the fourth \nyear.\n\n  We anticipate that tax extenders will be dealt with in the regular \norder, and our resolution provides for longer term extensions, as long \nas they are paid for.\n  I ask colleagues to resist the Kyl amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, is there any time remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia, (Mr. \nByrd) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FISCAL YEAR 2009 EARMARK MORATORIUM.\n\n       (a) Bills and Joint Resolutions.--\n       (1) Point of order.--It shall not be in order to--\n       (A) consider a bill or joint resolution reported by any \n     committee that includes an earmark, limited tax benefit, or \n     limited tariff benefit; or\n       (B) a Senate bill or joint resolution not reported by \n     committee that includes an earmark, limited tax benefit, or \n     limited tariff benefit.\n       (2) Return to the calendar.--If a point of order is \n     sustained under this subsection, the bill or joint resolution \n     shall be returned to the calendar until compliance with this \n     subsection has been achieved.\n       (b) Conference Report.--\n       (1) Point of order.--It shall not be in order to vote on \n     the adoption of a report of a committee of conference if the \n     report includes an earmark, limited tax benefit, or limited \n     tariff benefit.\n       (2) Return to the calendar.--If a point of order is \n     sustained under this subsection, the conference report shall \n     be returned to the calendar.\n       (c) Floor Amendment.--It shall not be in order to consider \n     an amendment to a bill or joint resolution if the amendment \n     contains an earmark, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff \n     benefit.\n       (d) Amendment Between the Houses.--\n       (1) In general.--It shall not be in order to consider an \n     amendment between the Houses if that amendment includes an \n     earmark, limited tax benefit, or limited tariff benefit.\n       (2) Return to the calendar.--If a point of order is \n     sustained under this subsection, the amendment between the \n     Houses shall be returned to the calendar until compliance \n     with this subsection has been achieved.\n       (e) Waiver.--Any Senator may move to waive any or all \n     points of order under this section by an affirmative vote of \n     two-thirds of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (f) Definitions.--For the purpose of this section--\n       (1) the term ``earmark'' means a provision or report \n     language included primarily at the request of a Senator or \n     Member of the House of Representatives providing, \n     authorizing, or recommending a specific amount of \n     discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other \n     spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, \n     grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an \n     entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or \n     Congressional district, other than through a statutory or \n     administrative formula-driven or competitive award process;\n       (2) the term ``limited tax benefit'' means any revenue \n     provision that--\n       (A) provides a Federal tax deduction, credit, exclusion, or \n     preference to a particular beneficiary or limited group of \n     beneficiaries under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; and\n       (B) contains eligibility criteria that are not uniform in \n     application with respect to potential beneficiaries of such \n     provision; and\n       (3) the term ``limited tariff benefit'' means a provision \n     modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States \n     in a manner that benefits 10 or fewer entities.\n       (g) Fiscal Year 2009.--The point of order under this \n     section shall only apply to legislation providing or \n     authorizing discretionary budget authority, credit authority \n     or other spending authority, providing a federal tax \n     deduction, credit, or exclusion, or modifying the Harmonized \n     Tariff Schedule in fiscal year 2009.\n       (h) Application.--This rule shall not apply to any \n     authorization of appropriations to a Federal entity if such \n     authorization is not specifically targeted to a State, \n     locality or congressional district.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask, through the Chair, a question to \nthe Parliamentarian.\n  Is this amendment germane to the budget resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. This amendment is not germane.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The amendment is not germane.\n  Mr. President, if this amendment were adopted, is it corrosive to the \nprivileged status of the budget resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if this amendment were adopted and came \nback from conference, would it be fatal to the privileged nature of the \nbudget resolution?\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the pending amendment is not \ngermane; therefore, I raise a point of order that the amendment \nviolates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. DeMINT. May I ask the Chair a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. It is not the intent to bring down the budget or \ncompromise a privilege in any way. If the Senator is worried about \nprivilege, I ask unanimous consent if the motion to waive is \nsuccessful, that the amendment be withdrawn and deemed passed in a \nseparate Senate resolution.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be constrained to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. If that is the case, I now move to waive the Budget Act \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 29, nays 71, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 75 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--29\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bayh\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Obama\n     Sessions\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n\n                                NAYS--71\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. On this vote, the yeas are 29, the \nnays are 71. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to. The point \nof order is sustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the next amendment in order is an \namendment by Senator Landrieu. It is a side-by-side to Senator Kyl. \nThis is on the estate tax. Obviously, these are important amendments. \nWe would ask for the attention of our colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4378\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for each of us \nto have a minute and a half.\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard. Each Senator \nhas 1 minute.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, a group of Senators, now for several \nyears, has been working to reduce the estate tax. With the constraints \non the budget, particularly with spending $348 million a day in Iraq, \nthis has been difficult. But some of us have been working in good faith \nto reduce the 55-percent rate and to raise the unified credit. The tax \nin its current form is onerous, in my view unnecessary, and it clouds \nthe ability of many of our successful business owners from planning the \ngrowth and expansion of their businesses that create jobs right here at \nhome in America. Something should be done now, something that is real \nand does not increase our debt.\n  The amendment I offer will reduce the rate to 35 percent and increase \nthe unified credit to $10 million. Most importantly, this is paid for \nby the President's own offsets in the budget he submitted to us. So it \nis fully paid for. It reduces the tax rate to 35 percent and increases \nthe unified tax credit to $10 million.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I call up the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4378.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To protect family businesses and farmers without increasing \n    our nation's debt by providing for an estate tax that sets the \n exemption at $5 million and the rate at 35 percent, with the benefits \nof the exemption recaptured for estates over $100 million, paid for by \nclosing tax loopholes that allow offshore deferral of compensation and \n transactions entered into solely for the purpose of avoiding taxation)\n\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $4,297,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, decrease the amount by $655,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, decrease the amount by $2,645,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, decrease the amount by $1,030,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $4,297,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 22, decrease the amount by $655,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 23, decrease the amount by $2,645,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 24, decrease the amount by $1,030,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, decrease the amount by $91,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, decrease the amount by $180,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, decrease the amount by $114,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, decrease the amount by $35,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, decrease the amount by $91,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, decrease the amount by $180,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, decrease the amount by $114,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, decrease the amount by $35,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, decrease the amount by $4,388,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, increase the amount by $475,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $2,531,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, increase the amount by $995,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $4,388,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, decrease the amount by $3,913,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $1,382,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $387,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, decrease the amount by $4,388,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, decrease the amount by $3,913,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, decrease the amount by $1,382,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 20, decrease the amount by $387,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 20, decrease the amount by $91,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 21, decrease the amount by $91,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 24, decrease the amount by $180,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 25, decrease the amount by $180,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 3, decrease the amount by $114,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 4, decrease the amount by $114,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 7, decrease the amount by $35,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 8, decrease the amount by $35,000,000.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. The reason is very \nsimple. The provisions are essentially the same as the amendment I \noffered earlier and will be offering again with the 5 and $5 million \nexempted amount and not to exceed 35 percent rate. There are minor \ndifferences. The bottom line is that the bulk of it, all but $22 \nbillion, is not paid for with any explicit taxes. The question has to \nbe, what tax are you going to raise permanently in order to offset the \ncost of this estate tax relief? It is not real if we are not willing to \nanswer that question. You can't say there is going to be an amorphous \nfund out there that somehow or other we are going to raise some taxes \nfor. We all know it is not going to happen that way. The question is, \nare we serious about tax relief for estates?\n  The reason the NFIB and other groups support the approach I have \ntaken is they know it is an exercise in futility if all we do is say we \nare going\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\nto pay for it with a tax increase, when, in fact, everybody knows we \nare not going to raise taxes permanently for estate tax relief.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 4378.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 23, nays 77, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 76 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--23\n\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Feingold\n     Hutchison\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Mikulski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Salazar\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--77\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n  The amendment (No. 4378) was rejected.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, this is a revote of a vote we had earlier in \nthe day. If you supported the estate tax reform then, obviously you \nwould want to do it now.\n  I appreciate the last vote. This is a better approach. This is an \napproach which is supported by groups such as the NFIB, which asked \nus--we only have 1 year to go before the estate tax is totally \nrepealed. In the year 2010, there is no more estate tax, and then the \nyear after that, it comes roaring back with a rate of 60 percent and an \nexemption of $1 million.\n  Clearly, we have to provide some certainty. The only way to do that \nis to adopt a rate not to exceed 35 percent, an exempted amount of $5 \nmillion per spouse, and to ensure that we can actually get it done this \nyear, not require that we find some permanent tax to increase in order \nto offset it. If that is what we are asking for, we know it won't \nhappen, the outside groups know it won't happen, and they know this \nbudget exercise then is a game rather than a serious attempt to reform \nthe estate tax.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Kyl, for his \ncourtesy during all of the debates today.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kyl amendment because it is not \npaid for. It goes onto the debt some $200 billion over 10 years. This \nwould knock us out of balance in 2012 and in 2013. The previous \namendment that had the same more generous exemptions was paid for. It \ndidn't add to the debt, didn't add to the deficits, and it kept us in \nbalance.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to vote no on the Kyl amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification of \namendment No. 4276.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4276, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To exempt from pay-as-you-go enforcement modifications to the \n   individual alternative minimum tax (AMT) that prevent millions of \n            additional taxpayers from having to pay the AMT)\n\n     SEC. ___. PAY-AS-YOU-GO POINT OF ORDER IN THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any direct spending of revenue legislation that \n     would increase the on-budget deficit or cause an on-budget \n     deficit for either of the applicable time periods as measured \n     in paragraphs (5) and (6).\n       (2) Applicable time periods.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term `applicable time period' means either--\n       (A) the period of the current fiscal year, the budget year, \n     and the ensuing 4 fiscal years following the budget year; or\n       (B) the period of the current fiscal year, the budget year, \n     and the ensuing 9 fiscal years following the budget year.\n       (3) Direct spending legislation.--For purposes of this \n     subsection and except as provided in paragraph (4), the term \n     `direct spending legislation' means any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     affects direct spending as that term is defined by, and \n     interpreted for purposes of, the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (4) Exclusion.--For purposes of this subsection, the terms \n     `direct spending legislation' and `revenue legislation' do \n     not include--\n       (A) any concurrent resolution on the budget;\n       (B) any provision of legislation that affects the full \n     funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance \n     guarantee commitment in effect on the date of enactment of \n     the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990; or\n       (C) any provision of legislation that affects the \n     individual alternative minimum tax exemption amount for \n     taxable years beginning after 2007; or\n       (D) any provision of legislation that affects the extension \n     of alternative minimum tax relief for non-refundable personal \n     credits for taxable years beginning after 2007.\n       (5) Baseline.--Estimates prepared pursuant to this \n     subsection shall--\n       (A) use the baseline surplus or deficit used for the most \n     recently adopted concurrent resolution on the budget; and\n       (B) be calculated under the requirements of subsections (b) \n     through (d) of section 257 of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (as in effect prior to \n     September 30, 2002) for fiscal years beyond those covered by \n     that concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (6) Prior surplus.--If direct spending or revenue \n     legislation increases the on-budget deficit or causes an on-\n     budget deficit when taken individually, it must also increase \n     the on-budget deficit or cause an on budget deficit when \n     taken together with all direct spending and revenue \n     legislation enacted since the beginning of the calendar year \n     not accounted for in the baseline under paragraph (5)(A), \n     except that direct spending or revenue effects resulting in \n     net deficit reduction enacted in any bill pursuant to a \n     reconciliation instruction since the beginning of that same \n     calendar year shall never be made available on the pay-as-\n     you-go ledger and shall be dedicated only for deficit \n     reduction.\n       (b) Supermajority Waiver and Appeals.--\n       (1) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the bill or \n     joint resolution, as the case may be. An affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and \n     sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling \n     of the Chair on a point of order raised under this section.\n       (c) Determination of Budget Levels.--For purposes of this \n     section, the levels of new budget authority, outlays, and \n     revenues for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis \n     of estimates made by the Senate Committee on the Budget.\n       (d) Sunset.--This section shall expire on September 30, \n     2017.\n       (e) Repeal.--In the Senate, section 201 of S. Con. Res. 21 \n     (110th Congress), the fiscal year 2008 concurrent resolution \n     on the budget, shall no longer apply.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, remember, before Christmas the Senate \nvoted to make sure that middle-class America didn't pay the alternative \nminimum tax, and we did it without an offset by a vote of 95 to \nsomething. So here we are again with an opportunity to say to middle-\nclass America that we are not going to tax the people who were not \nsupposed to be hit by the AMT, and we are going to do it without an \noffset.\n  This amendment gives us an opportunity to get over that hurdle that \nis in this budget resolution that, under pay-go, you would have to have \nan offset for the AMT. So even though the resolution sets aside money \nto deal with this year's patch, unless my amendment is adopted, there \nis no guarantee the patch will be done. The 25 million families who \nwill be hit by the AMT increase will get a tax increase of over $2,000 \napiece. So they deserve a guarantee of relief.\n  My amendment puts the budget money where its mouth is, and that is we \nare going to guarantee AMT relief. The principle is applicable to this \nyear's patch and AMT's relief in future years.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if you want to blow a hole in the budget \nas big as all outdoors, here is your opportunity--a trillion dollars \nnot paid for, a trillion dollars that we are going to go out and borrow \nfrom the Chinese and Japanese. That makes absolutely no sense. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote no.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second. There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MEDICAID \n                   ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Medicaid program provides essential health care and \n     long-term care services\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\n     to approximately 60,000,000 low-income children, pregnant \n     women, parents, individuals with disabilities, and senior \n     citizens. It is a Federal guarantee that ensures the most \n     vulnerable will have access to needed medical services.\n       (2) Medicaid provides critical access to long-term care and \n     other services for the elderly and individuals living with \n     disabilities, and is the single largest provider of long-term \n     care services. Medicaid also pays for personal care and other \n     supportive services that are typically not provided by \n     private health insurance or Medicare, but are necessary to \n     enable individuals with spinal cord injuries, developmental \n     disabilities, neurological degenerative diseases, serious and \n     persistent mental illnesses, HIV/AIDS, and other chronic \n     conditions to remain in the community, to work, and to \n     maintain independence.\n       (3) Medicaid supplements the Medicare program for about \n     7,500,000 low-income elderly or disabled Medicare \n     beneficiaries, assisting them with their Medicare premiums \n     and co-insurance, wrap-around benefits, and the costs of \n     nursing home care that Medicare does not cover. The Medicaid \n     program spends over $100,000,000,000 on uncovered Medicare \n     services.\n       (4) Medicaid provides health insurance for more than one-\n     quarter of America's children and is the largest purchaser of \n     maternity care, paying for more than one-third of all the \n     births in the United States each year. Medicaid also provides \n     critical access to care for children with disabilities, \n     covering more than 70 percent of poor children with \n     disabilities.\n       (5) More than 21,000,000 women depend on Medicaid for their \n     health care. Women comprise the majority of seniors (64 \n     percent) on Medicaid. Half of nonelderly women with permanent \n     mental or physical disabilities have health coverage through \n     Medicaid. Medicaid provides treatment for low-income women \n     diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer in every State.\n       (6) Medicaid is the Nation's largest source of payment for \n     mental health services, HIV/AIDS care, and care for children \n     with special needs. Much of this care is either not covered \n     by private insurance or limited in scope or duration. \n     Medicaid is also a critical source of funding for health care \n     for children in foster care and for health services in \n     schools.\n       (7) Medicaid funds help ensure access to care for all \n     Americans. Medicaid is the single largest source of revenue \n     for the Nation's safety net hospitals, health centers, and \n     nursing homes, and is critical to the ability of these \n     providers to adequately serve all Americans.\n       (8) Medicaid serves a major role in ensuring that the \n     number of Americans without health insurance, approximately \n     47,000,000 in 2006, is not substantially higher. The system \n     of Federal matching for State Medicaid expenditures ensures \n     that Federal funds will grow as State spending increases in \n     response to unmet needs, enabling Medicaid to help buffer the \n     drop in private coverage during recessions.\n       (9) The Bush Administration has issued several regulations \n     that shift Medicaid cost burdens onto States and put at risk \n     the continued availability of much-needed services. The \n     regulations relate to Federal payments to public providers, \n     and for graduate medical education, rehabilitation services, \n     school-based administration, school-based transportation, \n     optional case management services.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that administrative regulations should not--\n       (1) undermine the role the Medicaid program plays as a \n     critical component of the health care system of the United \n     States;\n       (2) cap Federal Medicaid spending, or otherwise shift \n     Medicaid cost burdens to State or local governments and their \n     taxpayers and health providers, forcing a reduction in access \n     to essential health services for low-income elderly \n     individuals, individuals with disabilities, and children and \n     families; or\n       (3) undermine the Federal guarantee of health insurance \n     coverage Medicaid provides, which would threaten not only the \n     health care safety net of the United States, but the entire \n     health care system.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4255\n\n  (Purpose: To increase 2009 funding for Juvenile Justice Programs to \n                     $560 million, with an offset)\n\n       On page 24, line 16, increase the amount by $170,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 17, increase the amount by $20,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 21, increase the amount by $48,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 25, increase the amount by $43,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 4, increase the amount by $34,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $170,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $20,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, decrease the amount by $48,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 25, decrease the amount by $43,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 4, decrease the amount by $34,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 8, decrease the amount by $25,000,000.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4283\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that none of the funds \n   recommended by this resolution, or appropriated or otherwise made \n    available under any other Act, to the USPTO shall be diverted, \n redirected, transferred, or used for any other purpose than for which \n                       such funds were intended)\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 308.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if Senator Snowe's staff is in the \nChamber, we need the modification to Senator Snowe's amendment sent to \nthe desk.\n  Senator DeMint has an amendment on deductibility. If the Senator can \ndescribe that amendment and if he would be willing to take that \namendment on a voice vote, we can accept it at this point.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4339\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. This is amendment \nNo. 4339. What it does is what I believe all of us in the Chamber would \nlike to do and that is to make it easier for people without health \ninsurance to buy health insurance. It does not accomplish all our goals \nor solve all the problems, but what it does is allow people who do not \nhave health insurance through their employer to buy health insurance \nand deduct it the same way an employer would.\n  It is a very simple amendment. That is the only item in it, to allow \nindividuals to deduct the cost of a health insurance premium from their \ntaxes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4339.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a deficit-neutral reserve fund for providing \n    an above the line Federal income tax deduction for individuals \n           purchasing health insurance outside the workplace)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

Mr. President, the ranking member tells me we need to \ndefer on this DeMint amendment because it involves another amendment, \nit affects another amendment, and the other amendment is still in the \nclearing process. So we need to defer on this amendment.\n  Senator DeMint has another amendment on Semper Fi; is that correct?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask the Senator from South Carolina if he can describe \nthe amendment briefly, and if he will accept a voice vote, we can \nproceed to that amendment. We can accept that amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if it is what I think it is, we will \nobject. It will take all grants away from the University of California, \nif I understand the amendment correctly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we were told that amendment had been \ncleared. It appears it has not.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Excuse me, if I may, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I may have a moment, the amendment I \nagree with is the Vitter amendment which says that the rules \nsurrounding FACE, which is the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances \nAct, would apply to recruiting stations because we do not want anyone \nhurt by demonstrators. Whether it is at a reproductive health care \nclinic or a recruiting station, we fully agree, and we are very happy \nto accept that amendment.\n  The amendment by the Senator from North Carolina, on the other hand, \nwould take funds away from the University of California, would take \nfunds away from the police and firemen in Berkeley, would take funds \naway from the children who go to school there, would take funds away \nfrom transit--these people who had nothing to do with anything any city \ncouncilman in Berkeley said. And, by the way, P.S., they took it back. \nThey took back what they said.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have to return to regular order if we \ncan. Perhaps the best way to unwind this situation, as I understand, \nSenator DeMint's amendment then will require a vote; is that the case? \nThen I think what we should do is ask Senator DeMint to take his 1 \nminute to explain the amendment. Then we will ask for 1 minute in \nopposition by perhaps the two Senators from California, vote on the \nDeMint amendment, and then perhaps we can go to Senator Vitter's \namendment, if that is OK.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, since there has \nalready been more than a minute in opposition, that I have 2 minutes to \nspeak on this amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I object.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, no, that is fair. I think we need to agree to that \nrequest. That has to be done. That is fair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator call up his \namendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4380\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4380.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To provide for a deficit-neutral reserve fund for \n  transferring funding for Berkeley, CA earmarks to the Marine Corps)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESERVE FUND FOR BERKELEY RESCISSIONS AND FUNDING \n                   THE MARINE CORPS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the aggregates, allocations, and other appropriate \n     levels in this resolution for one or more bills, joint \n     resolutions, amendments, motions, or conference reports that \n     would rescind any congressionally directed spending item for \n     the City of Berkeley, California, and any entities located in \n     such city, and transfer such funds to the Marine Corps, by \n     the amounts provided in that legislation for those purposes, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2013 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2018.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, if I may have the attention of the \nChamber, I bring this Semper Fi amendment to the floor as a promise to \na number of marines and their families. I admit this is somewhat \nunusual, but this amendment is not about free speech.\n  In Berkeley, CA, there were some folks protesting the Marine \nRecruitment Office. They have their right to protest, to speak out. My \ncase is against the city of Berkeley, which incited hate against our \nmarines and encouraged them to disrupt recruitment, which is their \nFederal responsibility.\n  This is a terrible precedent for a local government to take a \nposition against our constitutional role to defend our Nation, which \nrequires recruitment.\n  The things that were said by the city council about our marines were \ndisgraceful. What we are proposing is to make a point. The earmarks \nthat are talked about that went to Berkeley, over $2 million worth of \nearmarks, should not have gone there anyway, and they do involve \nspecial gourmet-type meals for the schools and money to the University \nof California at Berkeley, where they already have a $3.3 million \nendowment.\n  We can argue about the earmarks all night, but I am trying to make a \npoint on behalf of marines and everyone in uniform that it is not the \nrole of city or State governments to try to disgrace and intimidate, \nembarrass--whatever--our marines who are doing what we ask them to do.\n  So my amendment takes away those $2 million worth of earmarks as a \nsymbol to every local government that may want to take on our Federal \nrole and try to make an issue with our marines.\n  Semper Fi means ``Always Faithful.'' It is the motto of our marines. \nThey are always faithful to us, and I promised many of their families, \nwhen I was in Iraq and back here, that I would stand up for them. I \nencourage all my colleagues to vote for this amendment to make a point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. At this \nmoment we have, unfortunately, not yet seen the amendment of the \nSenator. We do need to take a moment to review it, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the purpose of helping us move along \neffectively, in order to get this done it is very important that both \nsides have copies of the amendments that are offered. We can't do \nbusiness efficiently if we don't--both sides--have copies of the \namendments.\n  I say this because both of us are in such a rush to conclusion that \nsometimes we neglect to make sure the other side--we have done it, \nwhich we apologize for, and it is very easy to happen in this hectic \nending.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, since we have had argument on both sides, \nI wonder if it would be fair now to have 2 minutes for those in \nopposition, 1\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nminute by each of the Senators from California.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Would it be OK to add an additional 30 seconds, just to \nclarify the misinformation?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think we have to cut this off at this point, if I can \nsay that to my colleague.\n  So Senator Feinstein.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment is an overkill. My \ncolleague and I are the first ones to say Berkeley made a huge mistake. \nBerkeley apologized for that mistake. Following all of this, the \nrecruiting station wrote a letter to the University of California and \nthanked them for their steadfast service and accommodation of the \nrecruiting center.\n  Essentially, what the Senator is trying to do is punish by rescinding \nany congressionally directed spending item for Berkeley, any entities \nlocated in such city, such as the Roberts Center which treats paralyzed \nveterans, and to transfer such funds to the Marine Corps. They would \nremove transportation funds, police and fire funds, and nutrition funds \nfor children.\n  I mean, the point has been made. The situation is solved, but it \nisn't enough for the Senator. He has to come back and hit hard, and I \ndisagree.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President and my colleagues, this is a moment we \ncould be together because we had some outrageous statements coming out \nof the Berkeley City Council. They rescinded. They apologized. And what \nthe Senator wants to do is take it out on people who, A, had nothing \nwhatsoever to do with this in the first place; and, B, the whole thing \nought to be moot because they have apologized.\n  Now, I don't see how you are faithful to the Marines--and by the way, \nI hope everyone will donate, as I do, to the Semper Fi Fund. Since you \nmentioned semper fi, there is a fund that takes care of our wounded \nvets. I hope we will all write a personal check tonight.\n  You want to help the Marines? How do you help the Marines and their \nfamilies when you take money away from paralyzed people, including \nparalyzed veterans? That is what the earmark was about. How do you help \nthe Marines when you take money away from American kids who are \nlearning about the importance of nutrition? How do you help the Marines \nwhen you take money away from police and fire?\n  Please vote this down. It is mean spirited.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And it is not in the interest of America to do this.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Time for the vote. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? \nSeeing a sufficient second, the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom New Mexico (Mr. Domenici).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 41, nays 57, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 79 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--41\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bayh\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Sununu\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--57\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Byrd\n     Domenici\n       \n  The amendment (No. 4380) was rejected.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in the previous list sent to the desk, we \nneed to show amendment No. 4268, by Senator Thune, as having been \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are about to move. We are awaiting some \nadditional amendments to clear. While we are doing that, we could go to \nthe next amendments, which are on the unborn child. Senator Boxer has a \nside-by-side, followed by Senator Allard. These will require votes.\n  Senator Boxer.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4379\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I did not want to have to offer another \namendment here to tonight. The only reason I am doing that is because \nthe amendment that will be offered in a moment by Senator Allard says \nthat the SCHIP program, our kids health program, should cover \nchildren--this is from his amendment--from the moment of conception \nuntil 19 years old. I am assuming the idea is to make sure pregnant \nwomen are covered. Yet it doesn't say that. So my side-by-side says \npregnant women will be covered. That means you don't get into that \nwhole area of when does life begin and so on.\n  We are saying, please vote for this. Let's cover pregnant women, and \nthat will, indeed, cover the pregnant woman and her fetus, all the way \nfrom the minute she is pregnant.\n  This is what we hope you will vote aye for. We hope you will vote no \non the Allard amendment. I am sorry to trouble you with another vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from California call up her \namendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I call up amendment No. 4379.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4379.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To facilitate coverage of pregnant women in SCHIP)\n\n       On page 60, line 8, insert ``or pregnant women'' after \n     ``children''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I stand in opposition and ask for a ``no'' \nvote and ask for an ``aye'' vote on the Allard amendment.\n  What the Allard amendment does is redefines the child. The way the \nlaw right now reads, a pregnant woman is under the definition of a \nchild. All we do is move the child out from the definition of the \npregnant woman and say that the child is in the period from conception \nto birth, and then the rest of the program. If this is a health program \nfor children, then we define the child as part of that population of \nchildren. The pregnant woman, who is the adult, would be kept separate.\n  As far as I am concerned, it is just a truth-in-labeling provision so \nwe have a distinction between the child and mother. We have surgical \nprocedures now that are just for the unborn child and not necessarily a \nsurgical procedure, technically, on the woman.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, is all time used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been used.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, can I make one more point? My amendment is \na pro-life vote.\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the Boxer amendment.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A BALANCED BUDGET \n                   AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n        (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) On January 26, 1996, the House of Representatives \n     passed H.J. Res. 1, the Balanced Budget Amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States, by the necessary two-\n     thirds majority (300-132);\n       (2) On June 6, 1996, the Senate fell three votes short of \n     the two-thirds majority vote needed to pass the Balanced \n     Budget Amendment; and\n       (3) Since the House of Representatives and Senate last \n     voted on the Balanced Budget Amendment, the debt held by the \n     public has grown from $3,700,000,000,000 to more than \n     $5,000,000,000,000.\n        (b) Sense of Senate-- It is the sense of the Senate that a \n     Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States should be voted on at the earliest opportunity.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4233\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. On the Allard amendment, it will codify the current \nunborn child rule by amending the SCHIP reauthorization reserve fund.\n  Many States' definition of coverage for a pregnant woman leads to the \nstrange legal fiction that the adult pregnant woman is a child. This \namendment will clarify in statute that the term ``child'' includes the \nperiod from conception to birth and will not include a pregnant woman \nin the definition of a child.\n  I ask for an ``aye'' vote. This is a pro-life vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in the Boxer amendment, we clarified \nSCHIP law. A pregnant woman's coverage under SCHIP law is optional. We \nmade it obligatory so every pregnant woman has the advantage of medical \ninsurance. This amendment undoes that. It takes it away from the woman \nand gives it to the fetus. Now, if the woman is pregnant in an \naccident, loses the child, she does not get coverage, the child gets \ncoverage.\n  We solved the problem in the Boxer amendment. If you cover the \npregnant woman, you cover her fetus. What Senator Allard does is remove \nthe coverage from the pregnant woman and cover the fetus.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

There has been objection by the chairman of the \nFinance Committee.\n  Mr. DeMINT. So you would like to bring it up and vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, we have had some partisan and \ncontroversial amendments tonight. I hope this won't be one. This \namendment simply allows individuals who buy health insurance on their \nown to deduct it from their taxes.\n  All of us talk about the uninsured. This is a chance to give a number \nof the uninsured the opportunity to buy health insurance on the same \nbasis that we do in Congress, and that is to make it deductible. Some \nwill say this is a cost. We are already paying for this, and probably \nmuch more, as people seek health care in the emergency room and other \nplaces when they are not insured.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for the amendment to allow \nAmericans to deduct 100 percent of the cost of the health insurance \npremium.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the effect of this amendment is not as \ndescribed. It is similar to the amendment on privatizing Social \nSecurity. He said it was not; it was. He says this amendment gives \npeople health insurance. It does not. What does it do? This is a death \nspiral for companies that provide health insurance for their employees \nbecause this amendment will have the effect of causing, for companies \nthat have health insurance for their employees, those employees to \nleave the health insurance they have and get their own, particularly if \nthey are young and healthy, which will mean the insurance plan the \ncompany provides will not work, and that is why it is a death spiral. \nThis will have the effect of hurting small businesses that provide \nhealth insurance for their employees because younger, healthier people \nwill leave to get their own, and that will cause the employer-provided \ncoverage to disappear.\n  This should not be done in middle of the night. We should have \noverall health reform, not this pernicious amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The DeMint amendment is pending. Time has \nexpired.\n  The question is on agreeing to DeMint amendment No. 4339.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Bond), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), \nand the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have talked to the managers of the bill. \nWe have two amendments left. It is my understanding the Biden \namendment, which has 16 or 17 Republican cosponsors, is going to be \naccepted.\n  Mr. GREGG. No, not necessarily.\n  Mr. REID. No?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We do not have an answer yet.\n  Mr. REID. We do not have an answer yet. When do you think we might \nhave an answer?\n  Mr. GREGG. Why don't we just keep going?\n  Mr. REID. We have two left. We have the Biden amendment and we have \nthe Vitter amendment. We have indicated that we would take the Vitter \namendment without a vote. It is a sense of the Senate. We have had 40 \namendments already. The average is 32. It is 1 o'clock in the morning. \nI think it would be appropriate if we could work something out on these \nlast two and have final passage. Everyone has their rights, but I would \nsay that we get an answer on the Biden amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. We have an answer.\n  Mr. REID. We have an answer?\n  Mr. GREGG. We need a vote.\n  Mr. REID. OK, we need a vote. Listen, I am happy to vote. But I sure \nhope we can work to change the rules, Mr. President, next go-around. \nBut we have not changed them yet. We keep talking about it.\n  So, anyway, the one thing that brought a little bit of peace and \nserenity to this chaotic situation has been the two managers of the \nbill. They have been patient and very good in everything they have \ndone. So I appreciate the good job they are doing. They have worked \ntogether for so many years, and I think they have set an example of how \npeople, in very adverse conditions, should work together.\n\n[[Page S2086]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, this amendment reinstates the President's \ninternational affairs budget to the number he called for, No. 1. No. 2, \nit has 34 cosponsors, evenly divided, Republicans and Democrats. \nEveryone from Senator Lugar to Senator Vitter and everyone in between \nhas cosponsored this amendment.\n  No. 3, the point I would like to make is, Defense Secretary Gates, as \nwell as 50 flag officers, represented by General Zinni and Admiral \nSmith, as well as our commanders in the field, all recognize we are \nspending $19 to $1--19 military dollars to every one civilian dollar we \nspend--to deal with international affairs. I will conclude by saying, \nwhen I was in Afghanistan last week, the commanding general made the \ncomment the Taliban begins where the road ends.\n\n  I say to my colleagues this is critically important to our physical \nsecurity to fund the international function because it is redevelopment \nmoney to go to Afghanistan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, 40 percent of the money in the United \nNations is absolutely wasted. They will not report transparency in \nanything they do. We know on their procurement it is at least 40 \npercent. We know 25 percent of the last peacekeeping operation was \nwasted through fraud. We should not send another penny to the United \nNations until they become transparent with how they are spending the \nmoney they have now.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the need for \n comprehensive legislation to legalize the importation of prescription \n  drugs from highly industrialized countries with safe pharmaceutical \n                            infrastructures)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NEED FOR \n                   COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION TO LEGALIZE THE \n                   IMPORTATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS FROM HIGHLY \n                   INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES WITH SAFE \n                   PHARMACEUTICAL INFRASTRUCTURES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States is the world's largest market for \n     pharmaceuticals, yet consumers still pay the world's highest \n     prices.\n       (2) In 2000, Congress took action to legalize the \n     importation of prescription drugs from other countries by \n     United States wholesalers and pharmacists, and before such a \n     program can go into effect, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (HHS) must certify that the program would have no \n     adverse impact on safety and that it would reduce costs for \n     American consumers.\n       (3) Since 2000, no Secretary of HHS has made the \n     certification required to permit the implementation of a \n     program for importation of prescription drugs.\n       (4) In July 2006, the Senate approved by a vote of 68-32 an \n     amendment to the Department of Homeland Security \n     Appropriations Act, 2007, that prohibits Customs and Border \n     Protection from preventing individuals not in the business of \n     importing prescription drugs from carrying them across the \n     border with Canada.\n       (5) In July 2007, the Senate adopted language similar to \n     the 2007 amendment in the Department of Homeland Security \n     Appropriations Act, 2008.\n       (6) In October 2007, the Senate adopted language in the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008, \n     that prohibits anti-reimportation activities within HHS.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the leadership of the Senate should bring to the floor \n     for full debate in 2008 comprehensive legislation that \n     legalizes the importation of prescription drugs from highly \n     industrialized countries with safe pharmaceutical \n     infrastructures and creates a regulatory pathway to ensure \n     that such drugs are safe;\n       (2) such legislation should be given an up or down vote on \n     the floor of the Senate; and\n       (3) previous Senate approval of 3 amendments in support of \n     prescription drug importation shows the Senate's strong \n     support for passage of comprehensive importation legislation.\n\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this is about reimportation. There is a \nclear majority in the Congress to pass reimportation legislation. I \nthink there is a clear 60-vote majority in the Senate to do so. So why \naren't we getting on with that business? Let's do it. This simply says \nwe should take up a full-blown reimportation bill, with all the \nnecessary safety provisions, and have that debate and vote on the floor \nof the Senate this year. It is as simple as that. We have the votes. \nLet's do that.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, many of the Senators worked on this even \nprior to the Senator from Louisiana joining us in the Senate. I don't \nobject to the sense of the Senate. It will have no legislative impact \nand it has no relationship to the budget. It is 1 o'clock in the \nmorning, 14 hours after we started voting. And on this issue, about 30 \nminutes ago, the managers of the bill indicated they would approve \nthis. Yet my colleague insists on a recorded vote. I observe this. I \nhave fondly and affectionately pointed out that the Senate is \noccasionally 100 bad habits. Look, all of us have been willing to forgo \nrecorded votes from time to time, but everybody has a right to ask for \na recorded vote on anything at any point. I understand that.\n  Again, this is a sense of the Senate that has no legislative impact \nor relationship to the budget. I have no objection to it. We will vote \nfor it. I observe again that the managers had agreed to this 30 minutes \nago. I would have hoped we could have voice voted this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's comments. I \nonly add my final comments that I was here Tuesday morning with this \namendment, ready to briefly talk about this amendment and get a vote on \nthe Senate rules on this amendment. For 48 hours, we did nothing in \nterms of votes.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

He notes how certain words are so vague in meaning that they \ncan be twisted and distorted into something they are not. What is \nentirely altruistic, he argues, can be made to seem repugnant and \navaricious.\n  One such Orwellian word that has found its way into our political \nlexicon is ``earmark.'' This poor, wretched, maligned word has had \nscorn heaped upon it. It has been equated with corruption and invoked \nto describe dastardly, behind-the-scenes machinations--sometimes real, \nbut mostly imagined.\n  President Bush has enthusiastically embraced this Orwellian line. In \nhis State of the Union Address, the President asked the Congress to \nreduce Congressional earmarks by half and threatened to veto any bill \nthat does not comply. He instructed executive agencies to ignore \nCongressional guidance on earmarks for fiscal year 2009. Let the \nexecutive agencies make the spending decisions, his argument goes.\n  Certainly the White House budget office would like us to do that. I \ndon't expect officials from that office to understand the critical \nneeds of the communities we represent. They do not meet with our \nconstituencies. They do not know our States and their people. They do \nnot see what we see. An earmark may be pork to some political chatter \nbox on television, but it could be an economic lifeline for a \ncommunity. It may be a road that has fallen into dangerous disrepair or \na bridge that is on the verge of collapse. An earmark is an economic \nneed that many times falls between the cracks of the Washington \nbureaucracy. When that happens, the people we represent cannot call \nsome unelected bureaucrat in the White House budget office. They cannot \nget a Cabinet Secretary on the line. When they need help, they come to \nus, their elected representatives. These are the working people in our \nsociety. Their priorities may be considered unimportant by some, but \nit's our job to make sure critical needs in our States are addressed.\n  Some earmarked spending has proven to be a tremendous asset to this \ncountry. Children's Hospital, here in the District of Colombia, which \nhas served over 5 million critically-ill children, was built with \nearmarked funds. Human genome research was initiated by an earmark \nsponsored by our colleague Senator Domenici. The WIC program, which has \nprovided essential nutrition to 150 million women, infants, and \nchildren, was started as an earmark. The Predator unmanned aircraft, \nwhich has been so effective in the Global War on Terror, was built with \nan earmark.\n  The DeMint amendment before the Senate today fails to acknowledge the \nexistence of these achievements. The amendment does not recognize that \nMembers of Congress know the needs of the people they represent better \nthan unelected bureaucrats at the White\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\nHouse budget office. The idea that an all-knowing, all-powerful \nexecutive bureaucracy is more trustworthy than the elected \nrepresentatives of the people when it comes to spending taxpayer \ndollars challenges the most basic tenet of our political system.\n  Frankly, the effort to demonize earmarks is a ruse; it is a feint; it \nis an effort to distract Americans from horrendous budget deficits \nwhich have mushroomed under President Bush. When President Bush took \noffice, this Nation had just completed 4 straight years of budget \nsurpluses. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the surplus \nbetween 2002 and 2011 would be $5.6 trillion. Now, according to the \nWhite House's own budget documents, we are facing $2.7 trillion of debt \nover those same 10 years. During the Bush Presidency, our government \nwill have experienced the five largest annual deficits in the history \nof the Republic. The author of this amendment would like Americans to \nthink that these deficits were caused by earmarks. What poppycock. If \nanyone thinks they can eliminate the $400 billion deficit by \neliminating earmarks, they need to take a refresher course in \narithmetic.\n  In fiscal year 2008, the total cost of the Bush tax cuts will be $252 \nbillion--21 times the amount of earmark spending in question. In fiscal \nyear 2008, the cost of the tax cuts for the wealthiest one percent of \ntaxpayers will be almost $70 billion--6 times the amount of spending in \nquestion. In fiscal year 2008, special interest tax favors will cost $1 \ntrillion--83 times the amount of spending in question. Corporate tax \nhand-outs will cost $91 billion--over 76 times the amount of spending \nin question. The level of Congressional earmarks is one-fiftieth of \nwhat this country has exhausted on the war in Iraq.\n  I implore my colleagues to look at the facts. Last year, the \nPresident proposed almost 2,000 earmarks, totaling more than $22 \nbillion. Earmarks exploded under the Bush administration, including \npresidential earmarks for cattle fever ticks, fruit flies, and light \nbrown apple moths. When President Bush signed the highway bill in 2005, \nit contained over 6,000 earmarks, 50 percent more earmarks than all the \nprevious highway bills combined.\n  In the past year, it was the Congress that took the initiative to \nlimit earmarks. In 2007, we had a moratorium on earmarks until rules \ncould be enacted that would add transparency to the process of \nearmarking funds. Last year, Congress enacted new rules that added \nunprecedented transparency and accountability to the process of \nearmarking funds. These were needed.\n  Adding transparency and accountability to the earmarking process is \nresponsible. Reducing the level of earmarks below the levels approved \nby President Bush for fiscal year 2005, is responsible. We have already \ntaken these steps. But pretending that we can save money by eliminating \nearmarks is pure folly. It is poppycock. It is also bad policy. The \nConstitution gives the power over the purse to Congress. That is the \nmost effective way to check an irresponsible President of either party. \nCongress must not cede decisions about how the taxpayers' money should \nbe spent.\n  It's simply ridiculous to criticize Federal investments in local and \nState communities without having visited the neighborhoods that will \nbenefit, without talking with the people who live there, and without \nunderstanding the local planning that is involved. The earmark is the \nsafety net under blind formulas. It brings local concerns of average \npeople into the funding process. A Republic cannot address its needs \nbased on formulas and the educated guesses of bureaucrats. The earmark \nushers judgment, compassion, need, humanity, decency, and common sense \ninto the budget process. Certainly our bloated, bureaucratic Federal \nGovernment could use a whole lot more of all of those virtues.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I oppose the DeMint amendment to impose a \nyear-long moratorium on congressionally directed spending projects, \npopularly known as earmarks, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. \nRather than finding real solutions to a weakening economy and American \ndollar, the growing debt and job losses, and the fact that millions of \nAmericans are losing their homes, the Senate is being asked to bow to \npolitical posturing by turning to the already much debated issue of \nearmarks.\n  Discretionary spending in the Federal budget continues to be a \ndecreasing share of the overall budget, and appropriations provisions \ninitiated in the Congress amount to only a sliver of that. Meanwhile, \nthe President, and many in Congress who talk so much about earmarks, \nseem to find no inconsistency as they push Congress every few months to \napprove tens of billions of additional dollars to be sent to Iraq. An \nanalysis by two prominent economists, published last Sunday in The \nWashington Post, forecast that the overall, budget and off-budget cost \nof the Iraq war eventually will exceed an incredible one trillion \ndollars. And unlike the regular appropriations bills, the periodic Iraq \nspending bills are off the budget altogether--they go directly onto the \nnational debt, waiting there to be paid by our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Funny thing, but the President never bothers to point out to his \naudiences that these Iraq spending bills dwarf congressionally led \nappropriations items. Nor does he point out that regular appropriations \nbills are paid for, whereas his budget proposals for Iraq are not. Nor \ndoes he point out that by far the majority of earmarks suggested for \nappropriations bills are requested by the President, not by Congress. \nIn Vermont, and in many of our States, we would call that kind of \nillogic about earmarks ``the old bait and switch.''\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I take seriously \nmy responsibility to help craft a responsible budget for the Federal \nGovernment, and I know from long experience in working with my \ncolleagues that this sense of responsibility is felt throughout the \ncommittee. Each of the annual appropriations bills forged by the \nAppropriations Committee and its 13 subcommittees comes in at or under \nthe amount allocated under the budget process, and they often come in \nbelow the departmental amounts recommended by the President. For \ninstance, the State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill that we \nbrought to the Senate Floor last year for this fiscal year was $2 \nbillion below the President's request.\n  Long ago I became used to seeing sensational headlines about spending \npriorities that are authored by Congress instead of by the executive \nbranch. Lists are drawn up that label every line item, every program \nand every project not explicitly proposed by the President as ``pork-\nbarrel spending''--regardless of their merit, need or importance to \ncommunities nationwide.\n  The Constitution confers the power of the purse to Congress, not to \nthe President. As elected representatives from diverse districts, we \neach are closer to the needs of our states and communities than are the \nunelected staffers in White House's budget office. We also have an \nobligation to be responsive to our constituents' priorities.\n\n  As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I often advocate \nfor projects that benefit Vermont and feel strongly that the carefully \ndrawn initiatives that I have worked to secure have improved my State's \ninfrastructure, economy and quality of life. Over the years I have \nsecured funds to improve community wastewater systems, roads and \nbridges, strengthen public safety, and build affordable housing. These \naddress real needs that often are unknown or overlooked by the federal \nbureaucracy. Similarly, I work each year to shape and address other \npriorities that are ignored in presidential budget requests, on issues \nranging from developing safer antipersonnel landmines, or helping to \nsave the lives of the poorest of the poor from preventable death or \ndisease. Attempts to ban earmarks would limit the ability to address \nthese and other issues.\n  The alternative would be to leave all spending decisions up to the \nexecutive branch, which--when given no direction by Congress--can \ndescend into political favoritism, feasibility and retribution when it \ncomes to choosing whose states receive Federal funding. That would also \nlessen accountability.\n  In 2007 the Democratic-led Congress added unprecedented transparency \nand accountability to the earmark process. More than ever before, we \nare now committed to openness and accountability. Projects receiving \nfunds in fiscal year 2008 are identified by member,\n\n[[Page S2089]]\n\namount, purpose and location. Those who make funding requests must \ncertify that they have no financial interest in their earmarks and \nthose letters are posted online. Never before has it been as simple for \nthe public, for outside groups, for journalists or for Members of \nCongress themselves to see the spending their elected officials are \nadvocating.\n  Earmark opponents mislead when they say that congressional earmarks \nare given no scrutiny or oversight. Actually, the money is not just \nhanded to an award recipient, but rather carefully vetted by the \nappropriate federal agency to make sure the intended award recipient \nand project qualify under that specific program's regulations. There is \nan assistance agreement between the federal agency administering the \ngrant and the award recipient on the amount of funding and a plan for \nhow exactly those funds will be spent.\n  DeMint amendment proponents will tell you that earmarks tripled in \nnumber over the last decade, but they neglect to say that President \nBush signed those earmarks into law. They also do not mention that the \ntripling in earmarks occurred under prior Republican-led Congresses. In \nfact, fiscal year 2008 congressional earmarks dropped significantly, \nwith overall earmark costs cut by $14.9 billion, or 51 percent, \ncompared with the earmarks contained in the Republican appropriations \nbills of 2 years ago.\n  A 51-percent reduction in earmark costs, total transparency and total \ndisclosure--I could have sworn that is what earmark opponents advocated \nwhen we considered and passed the ethics bill last year.\n  Another thing earmark opponents do not widely broadcast is that \npresidents, including the current one, are champions in the earmarking \nprocess. President Bush stuffs his budgets with billions and billions \nfor his designated projects. In fact, the President directs 20 times as \nmuch spending to special projects than Congress does. Look through the \nfiscal year 2008 omnibus bill or the fiscal year 2009 budget proposal \nand you will see page after page of special projects amounting to \nbillions of dollars, all requested by the President. With the reforms \nthat the Democratic-led Congress put in place last year, congressional \nearmarks now receive far, far more public scrutiny than do the \nPresident's.\n\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina fails to \ninclude a moratorium on Presidential earmarks. If we are bent on doing \naway with congressional earmarks, then we should apply the same rules \nto earmarks requested by the President.\n  Lastly, I am struck by the tunnel vision of several of this \namendment's backers who have been stalwart supporters of the biggest \nearmark of all: The blank checks written for hundreds of billions, if \nnot trillions, of dollars for the war in Iraq.\n  The proponents of this amendment claim that they want to get our \nNation's checkbook in order, but what they do not say is that \ncongressional earmarks are already paid for--the money is there to be \nspent, as prioritized by the appropriations bills. They are ready and \nwilling to support the President's request to Congress for billions in \nemergency funding to continue the war in Iraq. Those dollars do not \nscore against the budget, so the White House can advance the fiction \nthat the President is being fiscally responsible at the same time that \nhe piles on the debt for future generations.\n  Democracy depends on openness and accountability in government. Last \nyear, the new Congress moved promptly to improve accountability by \ndramatically reducing earmark costs, and implementing a system of total \ntransparency and total disclosure. We would be making a mistake to \nimpose a rash and unnecessary moratorium on congressional earmarks. We \nwill be shirking our constitutional responsibility by ceding the power \nof the purse to the executive branch. I will vote no on the DeMint \namendment, and I strongly urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina that would create \na point of order against consideration of any legislation that contains \nan earmark.\n  I have stated in the past that I think earmark reform is a very good \nidea. I supported the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, which \nwas signed into the law last year and for the first time brought \ntransparency into the earmark process. Additionally, I have fully \nsupported the steps that have been taken to have greater transparency. \nI think to have legislation that brings light into the process is \nentirely appropriate.\n  I am concerned, however, that this amendment would cede Congress's \nauthority to participate in the appropriations process to the executive \nbranch. Article I, section 8 provides the Congress, not the Executive \nbranch, with the power of the purse. As stated by the ranking member of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, ``this debate is not about the \nlevel of Federal spending, the size of the deficit, or the national \ndebt. This debate is about who decides how Federal dollars are spent \nand where.'' Congressional participation in the appropriations process \nis a fundamental constitutional issue and should not be readily \nyielded.\n  Additionally, I submit that Members of the House and Senate are \nintimately knowledgeable about the legitimate needs of their districts. \nIt is important to recognize that members of Congress represent the \nconstituents of their State, and there are a great many issues where \nMembers of the House and Senate know more about their districts and \nStates than the remote bureaucrats in Washington.\n  It is important to note the earmark allocation is a very small \npercent of the budget. Recognizing this fact, I was willing to make the \ntough decision to cut all of the earmarks in the appropriations bill \nwhen I was chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services \nSubcommittee because there was insufficient funding available for \nhealthcare, LIHEAP, and education.\n  For these reasons, I will oppose the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, but I look forward to working with my colleagues \nin the future on reforms that will increase transparency in the \nappropriations process.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to lend my strong support for \nthe amendment offered by Senator DeMint to impose a 1-year moratorium \non earmarks. I thank him for his leadership on this important, fiscally \nresponsible proposal, and am pleased to join with Senators McCaskill, \nCoburn, Kyl, Corker, Burr, and Graham in cosponsoring the amendment. \nAdditionally, Mr. President, I understand that my colleagues from \nIllinois and New York, Senators Obama and Clinton, have recently signed \non as cosponsors of our effort. I welcome them to our cause.\n  All of us in Congress should be paying very close attention to the \ncurrent economic realities facing our country. Almost daily, we are \ninformed of worsening news on the market front, widening subprime \nmortgage delinquencies, defaults, and foreclosures, declining housing \nvalues, and a broadening credit crunch affecting all sectors of the \neconomy. Less than a month ago we passed an economic stimulus package \nin an effort to help avert an even worse situation than exists now. \nWhile I have long railed against wasteful porkbarrel spending, now more \nthan ever, we have got to establish some commonsense budgetary \nguidelines to live within our means, just like most American families \nare doing, tightening their belts and not wasting their money on \n``wants'' to ensure they have the funds available to cover their \n``needs.'' We need to follow their lead. The American public is \ncounting on us to represent their interests, not the special interests, \nand to stop spending their hard-earned tax dollars on needless \nearmarks.\n  Just over a year ago, in January 2007, 96 Members of the Senate voted \nto fundamentally reform ``business as usual'' in Washington when we \nvoted to pass S. 1, the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act \nof 2007. I was very proud to support the passage of that bill because \nin addition to sound ethics and lobbying reforms, many which I had long \nchampioned, the bill also included the most far-reaching earmark \nreforms I had witnessed. Unfortunately, nearly all of the earmark \nreforms were gutted in the final version of the bill, causing a number \nof us to have to vote against its passage despite our support for some \nof the good reforms in the bill. We didn't just miss\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\nthe opportunity to address a broken legislative system of earmarking. \nThe opportunity was purposely and deliberately scuttled by those who \ndidn't want real earmark reforms, and they are the ones who had the \nseat at the table when the final version was drafted. And as I recall, \nnot one of those seats was filled by a member of the minority party.\n  As a result, the earmarking practice continues, as proven by the more \nthan 9,000 earmarks in the omnibus spending measure approved last \nDecember 18--3 months after S. 1 was enacted. Here is just a sampling \nof some of the earmarks that were included in the omnibus:\n\n       $50,000 for the construction of a National Mule and Packers \n     Museum in Bishop, CA;\n       $100,000 for Cooters Pond Park in Prattville, AL;\n       $625,000 for the Historic Congressional Cemetery;\n       $1.628 million for animal vaccines in Greenport, NY;\n       $477,000 for Barley Health Food Benefits in Beltsville, MD;\n       $244,000 for Bee Research in Weslaco, TX\n       $10 million for the design and construction of the Derby \n     Dam fish screen in Nevada to allow passage of fish;\n       $1.786 million to develop an exhibit for the Thunder Bay \n     National Marine Sanctuary in Michigan;\n       $846,000 to the Father's Day Rally Committee in \n     Philadelphia, PA;\n       $125,000 for International Mother's Day Shrine in Grafton, \n     WV;\n       $470,000 for an Oyster Hatchery Economic Pilot Program, \n     Morgan State University, MD;\n       $446,500 for Horseshoe Crab Research, Virginia Tech, VA;\n       $125,000 for the Polish American Cultural Center in \n     Philadelphia, PA;\n       $400,000 for the National Iron Worker's Training Program;\n       $350,000 for leafy spurge control in North Dakota;\n       $1.725 million for the Hudson Valley Welcome Center in Hyde \n     Park, NY;\n\n  Clearly, when it comes to earmarking in Congress, it is business as \nusual, business as usual. And that is what drives me and other sponsors \nof this amendment.\n  Not long ago, a prominent member of the majority party in the House, \nCongressman Henry Waxman, called for exactly what this amendment calls \nfor: a moratorium on earmarks. Representative Waxman was quoted in the \npress as saying, ``We have a problem in Congress, Congressional \nspending through earmarks is out of control.'' Congressman Waxman added \n``I think our best approach would be to suspend all earmarks for the \n2009 appropriations cycle while we consider the right reforms for the \nearmark process.'' You will not hear me say this very often, but I \ncould not agree more with Congressman Henry Waxman.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. We need to start \nmaking tough choices around here--and we need to start today. We have \nto face the facts, and one fact is that we can't continue to spend \ntaxpayers' dollars on wasteful, unnecessary pork bar-rel projects or \ncater to the special interests any longer. The American people will not \ntolerate any more ``bridges to nowhere,'' and they shouldn't.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4297\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment that \nwould ensure funding for an extremely important program, the Federal \ntraumatic brain injury--or TBI--program. This is the only Federal \nprogram that helps the 3.5 million Americans living with TBI and their \nfamilies.\n  In 1996, when I helped to create the Federal TBI program along with \nmy colleague, Senator Kennedy, most people had probably never heard of \na traumatic brain injury. Many more people now are familiar with the \nterm TBI because it has been increasingly highlighted in the media, but \nthey may still not fully comprehend the gravity of such a condition.\n  TBI can strike anyone of any age without warning and with absolutely \ndevastating results. For this reason, it is often called the ``silent \nepidemic.'' TBI is defined as brain damage from externally inflicted \ntrauma to the head resulting in significant impairment to an \nindividual's physical, psychosocial, and cognitive functional \nabilities. According to the CDC, brain injuries are among the most \nlikely types of injury to cause death or permanent disability.\n  People ages 15 to 24 years and those over age 75 are the two age \ngroups at highest risk for TBI. Motor vehicle accidents, sports \naccidents, falls, and violence are the major causes of TBI. TBI is \nparticularly common among young males and people of both sexes who are \n75 years and older. Because of its unique nature, TBI affects the whole \nfamily and often results in huge medical and rehabilitation expenses \nover a lifetime.\n  TBI may also be caused by explosives, and medical experts have \ndescribed it as the signature wound of the Iraq war. Up to two-thirds \nof injuries in the Iraq war may be brain injuries.\n  TBI affects people like no other condition simply because it affects \nthe brain. Just imagine what the consequences could be if the brain did \nnot work properly. The brain is the control center of the central \nnervous system and is responsible for behavior and information \nprocessing. It controls cognition, perception, memory, and the ability \nto pay attention. The brain is also in command of posture, reflexes, \nmovement, and coordination, as well as motor skills and other forms of \nlearning. It performs a variety of body functions automatically, such \nas coordinating blood pressure and body temperature and breathing.\n  Given this, it is clear that an injury to the brain is unpredictable \nand has the potential to cause catastrophic results. TBI can be mild, \nmoderate, or severe, depending on the extent of the damage to the brain \nand the actual location of the injury. TBI can cause a host of \nphysical, cognitive, emotional, and social effects. Results can be \nanything from complete recovery to permanent disability or death.\n  As I mentioned, TBI is different from other disabilities due to the \nseverity of cognitive loss. Most rehabilitation programs are designed \nfor people with physical disabilities, not cognitive disabilities. \nCognitive disabilities require more specialized accommodations than \nphysical disabilities. Finding needed services is typically a \nlogistical, financial, and psychological challenge for family members \nand other caregivers, because so few coordinated systems of care exist \nfor individuals with TBI.\n  The program comprises surveillance and research activities at the CDC \nand NIH, respectively, as well as grants through HRSA to fund State \ndemonstration projects to improve access to health and other services \nand for protection and advocacy systems.\n  The passage of the original Traumatic Brain Injury Act of 1996 has \nimproved TBI service systems at the State level and also increased the \noverall visibility and awareness of TBI. However, more work needs to be \ndone at both the national and State level to build an effective, \ndurable service system for meeting the needs of individuals with TBI \nand their families. There are still too many dots that need to be \nconnected. We must not stop now. We must sustain this program.\n  That is why I have been working with my colleague, Senator Kennedy, \nto reauthorize the program once again. I am pleased that our TBI \nreauthorization bill--S. 793--passed the Senate by unanimous consent on \nDecember 11, 2007. Just this week, the House Energy and Commerce \nSubcommittee on Health acted on its companion bill, H.R. 1418, and \namended it with language from our Senate bill. I am hopeful that we can \nsecure a timely passage of this reauthorization and thereby reaffirm \nour commitment to helping the TBI community.\n  Under the President's fiscal year 2009 budget proposal, funding is \neliminated for this program. I support my President, and I support the \ngoals of funding programs with proven performance accountability while \nreducing the deficit; however, I disagree with the proposal to cut this \nimportant program--the only program that helps this vulnerable \npopulation.\n  And I know that I am not the only one. This is not the first time \nelimination of the program has been proposed--but it keeps getting \nfunded because others also feel it is an incredibly important program. \nIt is a relatively small program, budgetwise, but that should not be a \nreason to ignore its significance or to let it fall by the wayside. \nThat is why I have crafted this budget-neutral amendment to create a \nreserve fund of $9 million for the TBI program. This amendment will \nensure the sustainability of this essential program, and the \navailability of services for individuals with TBI, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\n                           amendment No. 4270\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the well publicized naturalization backlog \nthat the administration has allowed to build up over the last year \nthreatens not just to deprive hundreds of thousands of people the right \nto participate in the upcoming Federal elections, but it has undermined \nthe legitimate expectations of those who have followed the law that \ntheir government will function as it is intended.\n  The related issue of a backlog at the FBI in completing security name \nchecks in connection with naturalization applications not only \ncontributes to these delays, but undermines the very purpose of the \nsecurity check itself. If a security name check is pending for as long \nas three years, the result is that either someone who should not be in \nthe United States is languishing unaccounted for, or that someone who \nshould be approved is caught in a bureaucratic gridlock. Neither result \nis acceptable.\n  Our amendment gives Congress the flexibility to legislate a solution \nin relation to the backlogs at both the FBI and USCIS if the \nadministration is unable to resolve this situation. Whether it is \nnecessary to give more resources or additional authority to these \nagencies, it is becoming apparent that Congress may need to intervene. \nThe administration's efforts thus far to address this issue are too \nlittle too late. Many in Congress have been rightly concerned about \nthis situation in light of the serious security questions it raises, \nand we should not tolerate the vulnerabilities we are left with. What \nwas a foreseeable situation was not foreseen. It is disappointing that \nfor all of the administration's rhetoric in support of fair and \nrealistic immigration reform, it has allowed this to happen. Those \nindividuals who have come lawfully to the United States and who have \nproven their commitment through hard work, perseverance, and \nresponsibility deserve better. I urge all Senators to join us in \nsupport of this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4245\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Biden/Lugar \namendment that restores the full amount of the President's request for \nthe international affairs budget.\n  While American military engagement overseas is at an all time high, \nthe strength of our ideas, diplomacy, generosity, and values is at an \nall time low.\n  For example, America's lead development agency, the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development, at one point in its history had more than \n5000 full time foreign service officers working on health, education, \nagricultural, and political development around the world.\n  Yet today, while engaged in a global war of ideas and values, USAID \nhas only 1000 foreign service officers. Its budget in real dollars has \nbeen cut by 27 percent from a high in the 1980s.\n  Similarly, the Peace Corps, one of our most successful programs at \nboth sharing American values and assistance while also exposing our \nyoung people to the peoples and cultures of other worlds, has seen its \nbudget in real dollars cut by almost 40 percent since its inception in \n1967.\n  At a time when more and more failed states are in need of \ninternational peacekeeping missions, the United States is more than \n$700 million in arrears in U.N. peacekeeping dues.\n  Tragically, we have all become more aware of what dangers failed \nstates pose and what misery they bring to their own people.\n  These stark shortcomings in American nonmilitary engagement \noverseas--our smart power--not only threaten our own security, but also \nwho we are as a nation and how we are viewed abroad.\n  Defense Secretary Gates and many former military officers have spoken \npublicly about the need for a greater emphasis on American smart power. \nThey recognize that our diplomatic, development, and economic \nengagement around the world not only lift the lives of others but also \nmake us safer at home.\n  These investments in bringing stability, maternal and child survival \nprograms, clean water and sanitation, economic development, and \nsustainable democratic institutions and processes cost a fraction of \npotential military engagement.\n  This amendment will not address all our international engagement \nneeds and challenges--that will only happen when we take such steps as \nclosing Guantanamo, unequivocally renouncing torture, and taking \nresponsibility for our contribution to global warming--but the \namendment is an important step in the right direction.\n  Finally, I want to emphasize the importance of America's continued \ngenerosity in funding programs to fight HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria, \ndiseases that kill over 6 million people each year.\n  Through its contribution to the global fund, the U.S. has helped save \nalmost 2 million lives in over 100 countries during the last 5 years. \nThis highly successful program, which uses contributions from around \nthe world and works directly with individual country's health care \nproviders and organizations, is a leading force for the fight against \ndisease, improving the lives of others, and improving America's image \naround the world.\n  I believe America must work to meet a full one-third contribution to \nthe fund's efforts and I hope funds from this amendment can help meet \nthis important goal.\n  I similarly urge the Senate to support the upcoming reauthorization \nof the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, commonly known as \nPEPFAR. The President deserves credit for supporting this effort--an \neffort that should be continued.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4232\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I voted against the Allard amendment \nbecause I am not prepared to accept the blanket assessment by OMB as to \nwhich programs are effective or not effective. In my judgment, Congress \nshould make the assessment as to which programs are effective or \nineffective and then Congress should act to eliminate all of the \nineffective programs.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4218\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered \nby Senator Sanders. Budgets are vital documents that reflect our \nnational priorities, and few things are more important than ensuring \nthe health and well-being of all our Nation's children. Yet for the \npast 7 years, we have been moving in the wrong direction.\n  Thirteen million American children now live in poverty, an increase \nof 12 percent since the year 2000. Democrats have worked hard to \nsupport struggling families, especially in these difficult economic \ntimes, but we have not done enough. This amendment helps to fill the \ngap.\n  Federal investments in early childhood education and care are \nespecially important in reducing the effects of poverty. The facts are \nclear. Early education unquestionably helps children achieve at higher \nlevels when they enter school. Children from low-income families who \nparticipate in high-quality early childhood education have to repeat \nfewer grades. They are less likely to require special education, less \nlikely to commit crimes, and less likely to be dependent on public \nassistance.\n  Despite these compelling facts, the United States ranks 9th among 14 \ndeveloped countries in public investments in early education. Only 14 \npercent of eligible American families have access to quality child care \nfor their children, and half of our neediest children still lack access \nto Head Start.\n  The Sanders amendment brings greater opportunities for high-quality \nearly education for the children who need it most. It provides an \nadditional $5 billion for Head Start to carry out the reforms enacted \nlast year. It supports programs offering needed transportation services \nto children and families, provides cost of living increases to program \nstaff, enables programs to offer full-day, full year services, and \nprovides other essential support as well--such as mental health \nservices for young children and their families.\n  The Sanders amendment also provides an additional $4 billion for the \nChild Care Development Block Grant, to reduce the shortfall in child \ncare assistance across the nation and improve the quality of such care. \nWith these additional funds, overwhelmed parents will be better able to \nbalance their child care obligations with their jobs, and make sure \nthat their children have a safe place to go after school. The funds \nwill also mean better training and support for child care workers, and\n\n[[Page S2092]]\n\nstrengthen coordination among federal, state and local programs.\n  We also need to do more to see that children have a safe and \nsatisfactory environment to learn. Many schools across the country \ntoday are crumbling from disrepair, which creates a discouraging, \ninadequate environment for learning. The backlog on repairs is now \nestimated at $100 billion, and we can't afford to ignore it. This \namendment makes a down payment on rebuilding the schools by authorizing \n$3 billion to begin the most urgently needed repairs.\n  Another key issue is the home heating crisis, which is also putting \ncountless children across the country at unacceptable risk. They can't \ngrow and develop normally if their homes are too cold, and their \nfamilies can't even afford the fuel to cook their food. LIHEAP--the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program--was intended to help families in \nneed pay their energy bills, but it has never been fully funded. Too \nmany families are left out of the program, and left in the cold. The \nfunds in this amendment will support millions of additional households, \nand bring vital assistance to those in need.\n  Finally, the amendment provides funds to expand the Food Stamp \nProgram. In these difficult economic times, more and more Americans are \nstruggling to put food on their table. Thirty-five million Americans \nlive in hunger or on the verge of hunger, an increase of nearly 2 \nmillion under the Bush administration. One in every six children \nstruggle with hunger in the United States each year. How can we let \nthat happen in the richest country in the world?\n  The Food Stamp Program has long provided vital support for low-income \nfamilies. It improves their children's diet, their children's health, \nand their children's performance in school. The Sanders amendment will \nbring millions of additional families into the program, and give \nmillions more children the chance for a brighter future.\n  Investing in our Nation's children is the best money we can spend. \nThe Sanders amendment provides the funds we need to truly start \nfulfilling our commitment to America's children.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4209\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am pleased to join Senator Collins today in offering the \nCollins-Levin energy independence amendment that sets forth important \nsteps to be taken in the area of energy tax policy. The amendment we \nare offering will provide some improvements to the work already done by \nthe Budget Committee.\n  The budget resolution before us includes a reserve fund for clean \nenergy and the environment that establishes a framework for Congress to \nenact legislation that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, \nreduce our greenhouse gas emissions, and protect the environment. Tax \nincentives such as extension of the renewable energy production tax \ncredit and the Clean Renewable Energy Bond, CREB, program will be key \ncomponents of such legislation. Both will expire at the end of 2008, \nand both are critical to the development of new renewable energy \nprojects. Without an extension of the renewable production tax credit, \nmany projects will be put on hold because they will be less financially \nviable. With the tax credit, these projects can go forward, and provide \nboth investment in the economy and creation of new jobs. Similarly, the \nCREB program provides interest free borrowing by public utilities for \nqualified projects, by providing a tax credit for the taxpayer holding \nthe bond. Eligible renewable projects are the same as those that \nqualify for the renewable production tax credit, including wind, solar, \nbiomass, geothermal energy, landfill gas, trash combustion, and \nqualified hydropower facilities.\n  The amendment we are offering today adds several important tax \nincentives to those that may be included in the legislation under this \nreserve fund and it specifies an adjustment in the tax code that could \nbe used to help pay for the tax credits proposed to be extended or \nestablished. The additions that we are proposing will help us take \nstrides toward increased use of renewable sources of energy and away \nfrom our dependence on oil.\n  I want to mention 3 tax incentives that are included in this \namendment that offer the potential to reduce significantly both our \ndependence on oil and our greenhouse gas emissions. We propose 2 tax \nincentives that address the production of ethanol from cellulosic \nsources and the production of biodiesel fuels, and we propose a new tax \ncredit for plug-in hybrid vehicles.\n  Specifically, we propose extension of the current production tax \ncredit for biodiesel fuel and the small-producer biodiesel tax credit, \nboth of which will expire at the end of 2008. Extension of these tax \ncredits were included in the 2007 energy bill but not enacted into law. \nMany of our small biodiesel producers are already having a hard time \nnow because of the increasing prices of feedstock. Without this tax \ncredit, they will not be able to stay afloat and we will lose these new \nsources of biodiesel fuels. We cannot afford to do that.\n  We also propose a new production tax credit for cellulosic ethanol. \nCurrent law provides for an ethanol blenders tax credit for ethanol \nfrom any source. Ethanol produced from cellulosic sources, however, \noffers the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent \nor more. Therefore, we propose a new per gallon production tax credit \nfor cellulosic ethanol, up to a limit of 60 million gallons. This \nprovision was also included in the 2007 energy bill but not enacted \ninto law. Again, this is a necessary boost needed by those pushing the \ntechnology toward cellulosic ethanol to ensure that they are able to \nbring the technology to commercialization.\n  Finally, we propose a new tax credit for plug-in hybrid vehicles, \nincluding a tax credit for hybrid conversion kits that can modify \ncurrent technologies with the latest in battery technology as it is \ndeveloped. This new tax credit would provide for a base tax credit of \n$3,000, with up to an additional $2,000 available based upon kilowatt \nhours of battery power capacity. This tax credit was previously \nincluded in the 2007 energy bill but not adopted in the final package. \nThe combination of advanced battery technology and advanced hybrid \nsystems offer tremendous potential for reduction of oil consumption, \nbut tax incentives will be necessary to offset the increased cost to \nconsumers and to achieve widespread acceptance by consumers. These tax \ncredits will accelerate significantly the availability of these new \nplug-in hybrid vehicles to consumers.\n  Lastly, I want to say something about the offset that we propose. Our \namendment specifies that legislation under this reserve fund may \ninclude adjustments to the amortization of geological and geophysical \nexpenditures for major integrated oil companies to help pay for the new \ntax incentives. In 2005, the major oil companies testified that they do \nnot need all of these tax breaks. Adjustment to these tax breaks could \nprovide billions over 5 years--with that investment put into renewable \nsources of energy instead, I believe we can take significant strides \ntoward reducing our dependence on oil and protecting the environment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Collins-Levin energy independence \namendment will help set us on a path toward energy independence and \nprovide a more sensible energy tax policy. The Collins-Levin energy \nindependence amendment to the budget resolution specifies that \nlegislation under the reserve fund for investing in clean energy, \npreserving the environment, and providing for certain settlements may \nalso include tax credits for the following:\n  Our amendment expands energy tax credits to encourage replacement of \nold wood stoves with clean burning, more efficient stoves. \nUnfortunately, many of the wood stoves purchased decades ago are \noutdated, inefficient, and are contributing to both indoor and outdoor \nair pollution. The emissions from these old wood burning stoves present \na serious health concern, contributing to such respiratory ailments as \nasthma and bronchitis. New, EPA-certified wood and wood pellet stoves \ncan cut emissions by more than 70 percent and use as much as a third \nless firewood for the same amount of heat.\n  The production of ethanol from cellulosic sources and production of \nbiodiesel fuels. These technologies each offer tremendous potential for \nreductions in our gasoline consumption and in greenhouse gas emissions \nand will help move our petroleum-based economy toward a renewable, \nsustainable forest bio-economy.\n\n[[Page S2093]]\n\n  The purchase of plug-in hybrid electric drive vehicles. The \ncombination of advanced battery technology and advanced hybrid systems \noffer tremendous potential for reduction of oil consumption, but tax \nincentives will be necessary to offset the increased cost to consumers \nand to achieve widespread acceptance by consumers. It is estimated that \na plug-in hybrid could get the equivalent of 100 MPG, having a large \nimpact on reducing our use of oil.\n  We would pay for these by scaling back a tax preference for large oil \ncompanies which their executives have testified they do not need. The \namendment also specifies that legislation under this reserve fund may \ninclude adjustments to the amortization of geological and geophysical \nexpenditures by integrated oil companies to help pay for the tax \nincentives.\n  In 2005, the major oil companies have conceded that they do not need \nthis tax break. Adjustments to this tax break could provide billions \nover 5 years. There is no reason to provide reduced tax rates for one \nof the world's most profitable industries at a time when so many \nfamilies and small businesses are struggling and when we need to \naddress the long-term challenge of reducing our reliance on imported \noil.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4196\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have been a strong proponent for repeal \nof the estate tax. Over the years, I have voted repeatedly to get rid \nof this tax. It harms American families, farms, and businesses.\n  Once I realized that repeal would not be enacted immediately, \nhowever, I worked to get a compromise for the American people. I am \ncontinuing that fight.\n  Last fall, during the farm tax markup, I announced my goal to develop \na workable estate tax compromise that could be passed this year. I \ncontinue to be committed to that goal.\n  As chairman of the Finance Committee, I have been using the Senate \nprocess to fully analyze what we need to do. I have been holding \nhearings on effective estate tax reform.\n  The first estate tax hearing was held in November. The hearing \nfocused on the scope of the problem. We had a second hearing yesterday \nto explore alternatives to our current estate tax system.\n  And in April, the Finance Committee will hold a final hearing to \ndiscuss reforms to our current system that go beyond rates and \nexemptions.\n  After those hearings, we plan to roll up our sleeves and begin \nworking on an estate tax bill--a bill that will pass in the Senate. \nOnce we develop that bill, we will have a markup in Committee.\n  My goal is an estate tax bill that will get enough support to pass. \nThat goal will take time and work on both sides.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4170\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to lend my strong support for \nthe amendment offered by Senator Graham. We should always strive keep \ntaxes low, but the threat of higher taxes is especially damaging during \nthis time of subpar economic growth. I thank him for his leadership on \nthis important, fiscally responsible proposal, and am pleased to join \nas a cosponsor. I believe this amendment addresses the most important \nissue among any that will be discussed during this budget debate, and \nthe one that most clearly defines the differing governing philosophies \nbetween the majority and minority parties: The Democrat-controlled \nSenate wants to raise taxes by $1.2 trillion and immediately spend \nthose tax dollars, while the Republicans want to prevent tax increases \nand reduce wasteful spending. It really is that simple.\n  All of us should be paying very close attention to the current \neconomic realities facing our country. Almost daily, we are informed of \nworsening news on the market front, widening subprime mortgage \ndelinquencies, defaults, and foreclosures, declining housing values, \nand a broadening credit crunch affecting all sectors of the economy. \nBut we also need to look beyond the economic news--we need to focus on \nthe American families who are struggling as a consequence, some close \nto giving up hope, and we need to help them. Having spent the past \nweeks and months traveling across America, I have heard first hand of \nthe difficulties facing so many hardworking families. I can assure you, \nnot one of them has asked for higher taxes.\n  Instead, we should he focused on sound, meaningful progrowth policies \nthat will help create jobs. But the one thing that we should not do, \nunder any circumstances given our present economy, is to raise taxes on \nAmerican workers who are already struggling to put food on their tables \nand gas in their cars.\n  I have long fought against tax increases, as have my other colleagues \nsupporting this amendment. This Congress has the power to keep taxes \nlow. Instead, the majority party is actively seeking damaging tax \nincreases on a broad spectrum of Americans 116 million taxpayers--\n$1,833 increase; 84 million women--$2,121 increase; 48 million married \ncouples--$3,007 increase; 43 million families with children--$2,323 \nincrease; 12 million single women with dependents--$1,091 increase; 18 \nmillion seniors--$2,181 increase; 27 million small business owners--\n$4,066 increase.\n  I oppose these efforts because millions of middle-class families will \nbe hit with higher taxes, not just the rich. In fact, I believe the \noverwhelming tax increases that will occur under this budget will hit \noverwhelmingly the middle class.\n  Let me offer just a few examples of how families will be impacted if \nwe fail to provide tax relief that our amendment would allow for. A \nfamily of four with two children who earn $50,000 annual income today--\n$53,400 in 2011--would see a $2,155 increase, from $1,128 to $3,283, or \na 191-percent higher tax bill. A family of four with two children who \nearn $60,000 annual income today--$64,100 in 2011--would see a $1,901 \nincrease, from $2,733 to $4,634, or a 70-percent higher tax bill.\n  Instead of increasing taxes as the Democrats' budget resolution \nenvisions, and in turn spending that money on more Federal programs, or \nworse, earmarks, we should be focusing on less government, not more. \nAmericans want jobs, not new Federal programs. Yet this budget provides \nfor the largest tax increase in history--$1.2 trillion. And, not \nsurprising, it calls for the largest spending increase in history--$l \ntrillion. And what does that get the average American family: a $2,300 \ntax increase. Thanks, but no thanks. Keep their taxes low and stop \nspending so much of their money--that is what most Americans will say--\nand I know because I hear that every single day.\n  What we should be doing within this budget resolution is considering \nthe best long-term economic approach and acting accordingly. We need to \nadopt this amendment to avoid a crippling tax increase for millions of \nAmericans. We need to adopt the DeMint earmark moratorium amendment, \nwhich I am pleased to also cosponsor, to rein in wasteful pork-barrel \nspending. We should eliminate the AMT, not just provide another 1-year \npatch as the Democrats are suggesting. These are steps we should take \nnow to end the uncertainty facing American families and businesses--not \nraising taxes by $1.2 trillion.\n  As I said, this is a defining moment. American families want us to \nfix our economy and help those along the way who struggling the most. \nWe have much ahead of us to do, and, unfortunately, the tax-and-spend \nbudget resolution before us does not get us to where we need to be. \nEven worse, it is taking the country in the wrong direction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4195\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today Congress is confronted with making \ndifficult choices in developing the budget for fiscal year 2009. \nUndoubtedly, there will be issues that will divide us as we consider \nthis budget resolution, but I do believe that surely we can all come \ntogether on other issues. One such issue that I hope we can find mutual \nagreement is the need to expand the availability of the child tax \ncredit to more working families. This is an issue that I have long \nworked with my good friend, Senator Lincoln, the senior Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Specifically, I have joined Senator Lincoln on an amendment that \nwould create a reserve fund to lower the income threshold for the \nrefundable child tax credit to $10,000 and de-index it from inflation. \nThis amendment is modeled after legislation that I introduced last year \nwith Senator Lincoln, the Working Family Child Assistance Act.\n\n[[Page S2094]]\n\n  In 2001, Congress doubled the child tax credit from $500 to $1000, \nand I along with the Senator from Arkansas pushed to make the child tax \ncredit refundable for workers making around the minimum wage as well. \nAs enacted, a portion of a taxpayer's child tax credit would be \nrefundable beginning with up to 15 percent of earnings above the \nindexed $10,000 threshold.\n  The consequences of inaction are serious for low-income Americans \nliving paycheck-to-paycheck. It means that tens of thousands of low-\nincome families will be completely ineligible for a credit they should \nreceive. This year, because the income threshold is indexed, only \ntaxpayers earning over $12,050 are eligible to receive the refundable \nportion of the child tax credit. Low-income families earning less than \n$12,050 are shut out of the child tax credit completely.\n  Today I am introducing legislation, the Working Family Child \nAssistance Act, with Senators Lincoln, Obama, and Rockefeller that will \nenable more hardworking, low-income families to receive the refundable \nchild credit this year. My legislation returns the amount of income a \nfamily must earn to qualify for the child tax credit to $10,000. \nMoreover, my bill would ``de-index'' the $10,000 threshold for \ninflation, so families failing to get a raise each year would not lose \nbenefits.\n  The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that this \namendment will allow an additional 600,000 families to benefit from the \nrefundable child tax credit. The Maine Department of Revenue estimates \nthat 16,700 families in Maine alone would benefit from our proposal. \nTwo thousand of these Maine families would otherwise be completely \nlocked out of the refundable child tax credit under current law.\n  I am committed to this issue, thank the Senator from Arkansas, and \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical amendment \nthat will make the child tax credit available to 2 million children who \nwould be otherwise ineligible. Most notably, this amendment is \nidentical to the refundable child credit proposal the Senate passed in \nMay 2001 as part of its version of that year's tax bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4181\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an amendment, which \npassed today, that I introduced with my colleagues Senators Pryor and \nBingaman. The amendment will create a deficit-neutral reserve fund for \nscience parks. This deficit-neutral reserve fund will help highlight \nthe need for funding so this critical industry can continue to expand. \nScience parks are concentrated high-tech, science, and research-related \nbusinesses, and are an important tool in strengthening America's global \ncompetitiveness. Through the development of new innovative \ntechnologies, competing and complementary companies working within \nclose quarters are able to build on each other's ideas when entering \nthe national and global marketplace. Unlike well known industrial \nparks, science parks primarily focus on innovation and product \nadvancement. These parks are a vital part of the Nation's economy, \ncreating 2.57 jobs for each core job in a science park.\n  As a strong supporter of expanding America's science parks, I am the \nlead cosponsor of S. 1371, legislation which provides grants and loan \nguarantees to promote the development and construction of science, \nresearch, and technology parks. I adamantly encourage increased \ninvestment in new and existing science, research, and technology parks \nthroughout the U.S. This amendment highlights that science parks need \nmore funding to help drive innovation and regional entrepreneurship by \nenabling existing science parks to make needed renovations while also \nencouraging rural and urban States to undertake studies on developing \ntheir own successful regional science clusters.\n  Congress recently passed, and the President signed into law, the \n``America Competes Act,'' legislation authorizing $43 billion of new \nfunding over the next three fiscal years which will boost Federal \ninvestment in math and science education programs. Building on the \nefforts of the America Competes Act by increasing research funding and \neducation for our innovative workforce is vital, and this amendment \nwill help ensure that this workforce is provided with a place in which \nto operate.\n  Residency in science parks provides businesses numerous advantages \nsuch as access to a range of management, marketing, and financial \nservices. At its heart, a science park provides an organized link to \nlocal research centers or universities, providing resident companies \nwith constant access to the expertise, knowledge, and technology they \nneed to prosper. These innovation centers are specifically geared \ntowards the needs of new and small companies, providing a controlled \nenvironment for the incubation of firms and the achievement of high \ngrowth.\n  In my home State of Maine, we simply do not have the population \ndensity in any given area to support traditional science parks. \nHowever, Maine has been a national leader in providing business \n``incubation'' services. Incubators, like science parks, are critical \nto the success of new companies. To help start-up entrepreneurial \ncompanies in Maine, centers around the State provide business support \ntailored to companies in their region. The benefit of business \nincubators in Maine has been nothing short of monumental, with 87 \npercent of all businesses that graduate from incubators remaining in \nbusiness. The seven technology centers located throughout Maine have \nplayed a pivotal role in promoting technology-led economic development \nby advancing their own regional competitive advantages. Under this \namendment, funding can be made available for not only science parks, \nbut business incubators may also be eligible for assistance.\n  It is also vital to point out that the jobs science parks create \nreflect the needs of a high-tech, innovative, and global marketplace. \nScience parks have helped lead the technological revolution and have \ncreated more than 300,000 high-paying science and technology jobs, \nalong with another 450,000 indirect jobs, for a total of 750,000 jobs \nin North America.\n  Our Nation's capacity to innovate is a key reason why our economy \ncontinues to grow and remains the envy of the world. Through America's \ninvestments in science and technology, we continually change our \ncountry for the better. Ideas by innovative Americans in the private \nand public sectors have paid enormous dividends, improving the lives of \nmillions throughout the world. We must continue to encourage the \nadvancement of this vital sector if America is to compete at the \nforefront of innovation. I thank my colleagues for their support of \nthis amendment, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nsecure additional funding to ensure the growth and prosperity of \nscience parks.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4121\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Secretary, I want to talk for a moment about how \nimportant it is to encourage physicians to adopt e-prescribing. Some \nstudies suggest that e-prescribing could save the Nation tens of \nbillions of dollars. It can prevent doctors from prescribing a drug to \na patient when he is allergic to it. It can prevent doctors from \nprescribing a drug that could cause dangerous interactions with a drug \nthe patient is already taking. It can help doctors better use health \nplan formularies, saving themselves time and their patients money.\n  Senator Sununu knew this years ago. Well ahead of others, he was \npushing to give incentives to physicians to buy and implement e-\nprescribing systems. Senator Sununu introduced a bill 3 years ago, but \nCongress wasn't ready to take his lead. We should be ready now. Studies \nshow that only 11 percent of physicians are using e-prescribing.\n  Adopting e-prescribing isn't cost-free to doctors. Not only must they \ninvest in the technology, but they also must reengineer their \npractices. This means lost time and money. And many doctors, especially \nrural doctors, cannot afford that. So providing some financial \nincentives to get them started makes a lot of sense.\n  There is bipartisan support for e-prescribing. Many members of the \nFinance Committee, Democrats and Republicans alike, have said how \nimportant they think it is. The administration, too, supports e-\nprescribing as an integral part of electronic health records. With all \nthis support, it is time to get the job done. I support Senator \nSununu's amendment to provide financial incentives to encourage \nphysicians to adopt e-prescribing. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n\n[[Page S2095]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my amendment to the \nfiscal year 2009 budget resolution, S. Con. Res. 70, which condemns the \nunwise practice of diversion of funds from the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office, USPTO.\n  By stopping the short-sighted practice of fee-diversion, Congress \nwould ensure that all funds collected are available to modernize the \nUSPTO and increase the number of examiners so that U.S. entrepreneurs \nreceive swift, precise decisions to secure their intellectual property.\n  The patent system is the bedrock of innovation, especially in today's \nglobal economy. The USPTO is the sole intellectual property policy \noffice in the U.S. Government and a leading agency for intellectual \nproperty protection and enforcement worldwide. The nature of the USPTO \nworkload is constantly evolving and increasing year by year, and \nrequires active, responsive management. Considering the value of our \nNation's intellectual property and its contribution to building a \nstrong and vibrant economy, it is incomprehensible to siphon these \nfunds away from their intended use, especially during these trying \neconomic times.\n  Patent applications reflect cutting-edge technology, and are \nincreasingly complex. More than ever, resources commensurate with the \nburdens placed on examiners are needed to efficiently and accurately \nprosecute patent applications. The backlog of unfinished applications \nfor U.S. patents might reach well over 800,000 this year alone. It \nmakes no sense to me why Congress would siphon off funds from the USPTO \nat this crucial time. Now is the time to act to protect this important \nagency, which is so vital to our Nation's economy.\n  Last year alone, more than 467,000 applications were filed at the \nUSPTO. The sheer volume of patent applications reflects the vibrant, \ninnovative spirit that has made America a world-wide leader in science, \nengineering, and technology. No doubt, the number of applications is \nhampering the agency's ability to keep pace with the innovative thought \nof applicants and to be flexible with the emergence of new \ntechnologies.\n  By prohibiting the practice of diverting fees to pay for other \nprograms, the agency will be able to ensure that fees paid by inventors \nare used solely for USPTO operations. The resource-starved agency is \nstill trying to recover from the almost $750 million in patent and \ntrademark application fees that were diverted away from the USPTO \nbetween 1992 and 2004. As a result, the agency has been unable to hire, \ntrain, and retain the number of qualified examiners needed to handle \nthe ever-increasing number of patent application filings. Moreover, the \npractice of fee diversion has inhibited the agency from playing more of \na key role in combating counterfeiting and piracy, both domestically \nand abroad.\n  I note that the Congress and the administration have permitted the \nUSPTO to keep almost all of its fees for the last 3 fiscal years. But, \nthere is nothing to prevent this devastating practice of fee diversion \nfrom happening in the future. This senseless starving of the USPTO must \nend.\n  I believe this sense of the Senate is the first step in acknowledging \nthat Congress must act in short order to stop depriving the USPTO of \nfunds it so desperately needs and give the paying applicants the \nquality and timeliness of service they are due.\n  For all of the above reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support \nthis sense of the Senate.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the budget \nresolution that is before the Senate today. I want to thank Chairman \nConrad for his leadership--he and the Budget Committee have put \ntogether a smart, fiscally disciplined budget that will help put our \neconomy back on track while bringing our budget into balance by 2012.\n  This is the time of year when middle-class families across the \ncountry are sitting down at their kitchen tables with stacks of bills, \ntax forms, and a calculator. They are adding up expenses and incomes--\nand the numbers are not good.\n  The cost of health insurance is up. Mortgage payments are up. Gas \nprices are up. Food prices are up. Heating bills are up. Inflation is \nup. Unemployment is up.\n  Families' expenses are on the rise, but, for the last 7 years, wages \nhave not kept pace. In times like these, it is hard to balance a \nbudget, but American families don't have a choice. They either balance \ntheir budget or face debts and bankruptcy.\n  The Federal Government should take a lesson from American families: \nwhen pennies are tight, we need to be making smart, disciplined \ndecisions that bring budgets into balance. That is no easy task when \nyou consider the fiscal mess this Congress inherited.\n  In 2000, we were running $236 billion in budget surpluses. In 2006, \nthe Federal budget deficit was $248 billion. The national debt will \nhave gone from $5.8 trillion in 2001 to over $10 trillion by the end of \nthis year. Think of that for one second: in just 8 years, this \nadministration will have almost doubled the entire national debt. It is \nstaggering. And it is the reason that Americans have lost trust in the \nfiscal policies of this administration.\n  But the budget resolution we passed last year and the budget \nresolution we are considering today rein in this recklessness.\n  This budget, thanks to the work of Chairman Conrad and the Budget \nCommittee, is the blueprint for how we fund our most important Federal \nprograms, provide new tax relief, and bring the budget into balance \nwithin 4 years--without raising taxes.\n  And this budget puts the Federal Government back on a pay-as-you-go \nbasis, meaning that if someone wants to pass a new Federal program or \ncut taxes--they have to find a way to pay for it. This is known as \n``pay-go,'' and it is simple common sense.\n  It is not easy to enforce the type of fiscal restraint embodied by \npay-go while addressing the most pressing challenges our country is \nfacing, but this budget succeeds in doing just that.\n  I want to spend a few moments talking about the tax portions of the \nbudget resolution because they are of direct interest to those middle \nclass families who are feeling the squeeze of stagnant wages, rising \ncosts, and declining home values. The underlying budget resolution \noffers AMT relief and measures to close the tax gap, and the amendment \nthat Senator Baucus has offered would provide further relief.\n  The Baucus amendment would permanently extend a series of critical \nmiddle-class tax cuts and create new tax relief for two important \ngroups: (1) middle-class homeowners burdened by high property taxes and \n(2) veterans and servicemembers that are giving so much. As a member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, I believe that Congress should use the \nbudget resolution to demonstrate its strong support for the tax \npolicies that provide relief for middle-class families.\n  The Baucus amendment makes permanent the 10-percent tax bracket, the \nchild tax credit, the adoption credit, the dependent care credit, and \nmarriage penalty relief.\n  It helps address the housing crisis by allowing middle-income \ntaxpayers an ``above-the-line'' deduction for property taxes. This \nwould allow homeowners to deduct their property taxes whether or not \nthey itemize their deductions, providing relief to a segment of the \npopulation that has been hard-hit by recent economic troubles.\n  In addition, the Baucus amendment includes a series of targeted \nprovisions designed to provide tax relief to veterans and \nservicemembers, including a provision to allow servicemembers to count \ncombat pay as income for purposes of the earned income tax credit.\n  Finally, this amendment will pave the way for meaningful estate tax \nreform by preventing any increase in the estate tax above the 2009 rate \nand exemption levels. The Finance Committee is working toward the goal \nof enacting permanent and comprehensive reform, and this amendment is \nan important step in the right direction.\n  These are not the only tax priorities that we intend to pursue this \nyear, but they are at the top of the list for urgency and priority.\n  In addition to these tax cuts for middle class families, the budget \nestablishes and funds priorities and programs that have been neglected \nfor far too long.\n  For our Armed Forces, the budget provides full funding for our troops \nin Iraq and Afghanistan but also helps rebuild a military that has been \nunder intense strain for five years. The Army\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\nChief of Staff, General Casey, has been very clear that the current \noperational tempo and repeated deployments is putting the Army ``out of \nbalance,'' and less able to respond to contingencies.\n  The National Guard has also been hit hard by the administration's \npolicies--units have been short equipment for training, disaster \nresponse, and other missions. This budget, though, provides over $49.1 \nbillion to recruit, train, equip, and sustain National Guard and \nReserve units--these funds are desperately needed to reset the force. \nThe budget also provides a 3.4-percent pay raise for military \npersonnel, and rejects the administration's proposals for new TRlCARE \nenrollment fees and higher deductibles for military retirees.\n  For our veterans, the budget provides $48.2 billion for discretionary \nprograms, including medical care. This is $3.2 billion more than the \nPresident's proposed funding level and brings funding for the VA in \nline with the recommendations in the independent budget, which \nveterans' service organizations compile each year to guide funding for \nthe VA.\n  I am particularly proud that the committee was able to fulfill my \nrequest to restore funding for major construction projects in the VA, \nincluding the Fitzsimons Hospital in Denver. The administration has \nbeen dragging its feet on the construction of major medical facilities \nthat have been planned for years. The foot-dragging has only caused \ncosts to rise and veterans to have to wait longer for modern medical \nfacilities. This is unacceptable. I appreciate Chairman Conrad's \nwillingness to work with me to include funding and report language that \nwill help get the VA back on track on these projects.\n  In addition to the good things that this budget does to rebuild our \nmilitary, honor our veterans, and cut taxes for middle class families, \nit also provides adequate funding for domestic programs that are \nfundamental to Americans' economic security.\n  As a Senator from a State where 57 of our 64 counties rely on payment \nin lieu of taxes, PILT, to offset tax revenue that can not be collected \nfrom the federally owned lands in their county, I know how damaging the \nPresident's cuts to PILT are. For a county like Mineral County, CO, \nwhich has over half a million acres of Federal land, cuts to PILT are \ndevastating to its budget. That is why I am proud that the Budget \nResolution rejects the President's cuts to PILT and creates a deficit \nneutral reserve fund to accommodate legislation that will fully fund \nthe program for five years.\n  I am also cosponsoring an amendment that Senator Enzi is offering \nthat will help stop the Federal Government from raiding the States' \nshare of mineral leasing revenues. Those revenues from oil and gas \nleases in Colorado, Wyoming, and across the West should be divided 50-\n50 between the state and the Federal Government. The administration \nsucceeded in changing this formula in 2008, but the reserve fund that \nSenator Enzi's amendment creates would help ensure that this does not \nhappen again.\n  But these aren't the only steps we can take in this budget to help \nrural economies. The budget resolution also makes a dramatic new \ninvestment in renewable energy development and research. It puts $2 \nbillion into the Department of Energy EERE account, which funds \nresearch and development at labs like the National Renewable Energy Lab \nin Golden, CO. This is a $738 million increase over the President's \nbudget. It will help accelerate the renewable energy revolution that is \nsweeping across the country, giving new life to rural economies.\n  On health care, the budget once again lays the groundwork for \nexpanding health care coverage for children. On two separate occasions \nlast year, the President vetoed bills that would have expanded the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. If not for those vetoes, 3.8 \nmillion more children would have health insurance today.\n  We are not going to give up that fight, so the budget provides up to \n$50 billion for CHIP so that we can expand coverage to 6 mi1lion more \nchildren.\n  And on law enforcement, the budget resolution rejects the President's \nproposal to eliminate the COPS program. This was the sixth straight \nyear that the President has proposed massive cuts to a program that has \nput over 100,000 police officers on the streets. As a former attorney \ngeneral, I can tell you just how misguided these cuts would be, if we \nallowed them to go through.\n  As American families sort through their finances, stack up their \nbills, and calculate their 2007 taxes in this period, they know they \nhave to set priorities in their own budgets.\n  They expect the Federal Government to do the same: they expect \nCongress to assemble and pass a budget that is fiscally disciplined, \nthat provides tax relief, and that funds those programs that are \nfundamental to our security and our economy.\n  I believe that this budget meets those objectives by putting us on \ntrack to balance the budget by 2012, despite the fiscal recklessness \nthat will be the legacy of this administration.\n  I again want to thank Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee for \nall their work on this budget. I am proud to stand behind it.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will be supporting this budget resolution \nand would like to offer a few observations as we go forward.\n  I begin by expressing my appreciation to the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Budget Committee, as well as their talented staff. \nPlotting a fiscal roadmap is a difficult task. While everyone may not \nagree on the outcome, I think we all appreciate and commend the \ndedication and expertise of those who are at the center of the process.\n  Sandwiched as it was, between Super Bowl Sunday and Super Tuesday, \nthe President's budget generated only passing scrutiny beyond the \nbeltway when it was submitted earlier this year. I believe the budget \nbefore us improves on that plan substantially.\n  The President put forward a $3 trillion budget with near-record \nprojected deficits and the biggest defense expenditure since World War \nII. It recycled a number of ill-advised proposals that have been \nroundly rejected in the past. It put the squeeze on Medicare and \nMedicaid. And it shortchanged future generations. Congress can and will \ndo better in addressing the challenges Americans face on education, \nhealth care, job creation, crime prevention, and high energy costs. I \nlook forward to working with Democrats and Republicans alike in \ndeveloping bills that put the priorities of the American people first.\n  This budget invests in education by increasing resources for \neducation and training programs. It provides for $13 billion in \neducation tax cuts, which will help make college more affordable. It \nprovides a $2 billion Education Reserve Fund to provide for school \nconstruction and facility improvements, as well as the reauthorization \nof the Higher Education Act and the extension of education tax credits \nand deductions.\n  This budget gives a little more hope for American families raising \nchildren with disabilities. The President's budget proposed $11.3 \nbillion in funding for special education, which represents the lowest \nlevel of support since fiscal year 2002. Last year, over 56,000 \nWisconsin students with disabilities did not receive needed services \ndue to chronic underfunding of IDEA, and the President's budget sought \nto continue this shameful trend.\n  This budget is better for Head Start, a program that prepares low-\nincome children to succeed in school. For every dollar invested in Head \nStart, Wisconsin reaps $15 in future higher earnings, fewer crimes, and \nless remedial education. Head Start's funding has not kept pace with \ninflation or had any cost of living adjustments. In fact, Head Start \nhas been cut by 11 percent since 2002.\n  This budget resolution rejects the President's proposal to eliminate \n48 education programs, including vital student financial aid programs \nlike Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and the Perkins \nVocational Education Program. The President's proposal would have \ntranslated into a loss of $24 million in Federal aid for Wisconsin \ncareer and technical education.\n  This budget rejects the over $200 billion in cuts to Medicare and \nMedicaid that the President proposed. Such large cuts to these programs \ncannot be sustained without our Nation's health care safety net \nsuffering. The result\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\nwould be fewer people with access to health care, and that is not \nacceptable. In Wisconsin, this would have meant $1.3 billion in cuts to \nhospitals over 5 years, decreased enrollment in BadgerCare, and drastic \ncuts in Medicaid. I am pleased that my home State of Wisconsin will not \nsee President Bush's unrealistic health care funding cuts implemented.\n  This budget resolution provides for more funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health and other health care programs. I believe we must \ncontinue to invest in the NIH.\n  This budget anticipates a $4 billion allocation for the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Program, an increase of $68 million from last \nyear. The CDBG Program is the largest program that helps cities and \nstates create job opportunities and affordable housing. For Wisconsin, \nthat would translate into approximately $74 million if the increase is \nenacted. Given the current housing market crisis, a program like CDBG \nis vital for communities to combat rising foreclosures and create more \naffordable housing units through rehabilitation of those properties.\n  This budget resolution would allow restoration of the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership program, MEP, at $122 million. MEP helps \nmanufacturers streamline operations, integrate new technologies, \nshorten production times and lower costs, leading to improved \nefficiency. At a time when we want to increase economic activity and \nstrengthen the manufacturing base of our Nation, the MEP is a fiscally \nsound investment of Federal resources.\n  I am especially pleased that the budget resolution includes a reserve \nfund to address child support enforcement. This gives Congress the \nleeway to repair the damage done under the Deficit Reduction Act which \nslashed funding for the child support enforcement program. Counties in \nWisconsin are feeling the crunch of those cuts--and so are families \nrelying on child support to make ends meet. I am hopeful that Congress \nwill take the opportunity laid out in the resolution to help these \nfamilies by restoring cuts to the child support program.\n  And finally, as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, I would be remiss if I failed to draw some observations \nabout the President's budget and the situation we face on the WIC \nProgram. I would like to insert for the record a letter which I \nrecently sent to the Secretary of Agriculture. WIC provides essential \nnutrition assistance to pregnant women, infants and children. It is \nwidely recognized for the impact this has on early childhood \ndevelopment. It is a critical discretionary program that is underfunded \nin the President's budget.\n  Our Nation faces extraordinary challenges. War and terrorism demand \nresources and attention. An aging population struggles to find the \nmoney to educate the next generation while battling increased health \ncare costs. Our economy is struggling to create jobs. We need a budget \nthat does better on all these counts. We need one that sensibly faces \nthese challenges. This budget may not be perfect, but it gets us closer \nto that goal and therefore earns my support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated March 12, 2008, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2008.\n     Hon. Ed Schafer,\n     Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Schafer: The Consolidated Appropriations Act \n     of 2008 included the following language as part of its \n     Explanatory Notes:\n       ``. . . the Department is directed, beginning on the date \n     of enactment of this Act, and thereafter, to provide monthly \n     reports on the program performance and estimated funding \n     requirements to fully fund the WIC program. Timeframes \n     addressed in these estimates should include the prior year, \n     current year, and budget year of the President's budget \n     submission, currently under consideration by the Congress and \n     should separately address baseline program performance from \n     the impact of current law and legislative budget proposals. \n     The Department shall consider, and include in these \n     estimates, current participation trends and current Economic \n     Research Service food cost estimates in developing updated \n     WIC estimates.''\n       Although this measure was signed into law by the President \n     on December 26, 2007, the first report pursuant to this \n     directive was not received until March 4, 2008. It appears \n     the Administration was either unable or unwilling to meet the \n     established deadlines. This is unacceptable. The intent was \n     clear, and similar disregard will not be tolerated in the \n     future.\n       The letter accompanying the initial report notes that \n     ``Since 2001, the Administration has consistently sought to \n     ensure that all eligible women, infants and children seeking \n     to participate in the WIC program can be served.'' Were that \n     an entirely factual statement, this directive would not have \n     been necessary in the first place.\n       Congress faced incredible difficulty fully funding WIC in \n     FY 08 because program costs increased by more than $633 \n     million above the President's budget request. This situation \n     was never acknowledged by USDA in any responsible manner, nor \n     were specific counter-measures recommended. Sadly, the \n     Administration only recognized this problem (in the vaguest \n     of terms and at the last possible moment) in response to a \n     request by this Committee. That lack of responsiveness forced \n     Congress to rely on updated estimates from an outside (and \n     historically reliable) organization. While I value the \n     expertise of outside organizations, I do not believe this is \n     the best way to make important funding decisions on such a \n     vital program. The circumstances we face demand much more \n     meaningful cooperation between the Executive and Legislative \n     branches of government.\n       As we contemplate that cooperation in the future, I am \n     obliged as Chairman of the subcommittee to turn my attention \n     to the Administration's FY09 budget request for WIC. Sadly, I \n     find the Administration's proposal to be detached from \n     reality. It is difficult to fathom, given current economic \n     trends, that the Administration realistically believes an \n     increase of $80 million is an appropriate amount for WIC. \n     (The inadequacy of this request is tacitly acknowledged \n     elsewhere in the budget which anticipates using $150 million \n     in ``contingency'' funding for program participation, rather \n     than reserving it for unforeseeable circumstances, which is \n     its intended purpose.)\n       Outside estimates already provided to the Congress show \n     that the WIC level requested in the budget is at least $400 \n     million below the amount necessary to fully fund \n     participation, assuming that Congress will continue to reject \n     the Administration's attempt to cap administrative funding. \n     My grave fear is that the Administration's inadequate WIC \n     budget request will greatly diminish our ability to provide \n     sufficient funding levels for other important functions of \n     the Department.\n       Mr. Secretary, Congress did not create this WIC reporting \n     directive to be difficult or require more work on the part of \n     USDA. We are making an honest attempt to avoid the surprises \n     and the dismal alternatives we faced last year when WIC costs \n     increased suddenly and substantially, and we were forced to \n     cut other important items at USDA in order to overcome this \n     shortfall. Our hope was that these reports will be useful in \n     protecting the integrity of USDA programs. They will be \n     useless if the Administration refuses to provide the \n     information in a timely and honest manner.\n       We are not asking for a budget amendment--simply \n     information. Your initial report states that USDA believes \n     the President's budget request is adequate, although it says \n     participation estimates are already higher than anticipated. \n     It further says that USDA will continue to monitor program \n     performance. Continued monitoring means nothing unless you \n     are willing to provide this information to the Congress. USDA \n     employs many competent staff, including many at FNS and the \n     Economic Research Service. I believe their expertise can \n     provide better information than that which we have been sent \n     so far.\n       It would be difficult to overstate the seriousness with \n     which I view this issue. The WIC appropriation equals one \n     third of this Subcommittee's entire discretionary allocation \n     and estimate errors of only a few percentage points can mean \n     shortfalls of hundreds of millions of dollars. You should \n     know that if the Administration fails to provide this \n     necessary information in the manner requested, this \n     Subcommittee may, and likely will, take more stringent \n     measures in the months to come. We are eagerly anticipating \n     the next report, and hope that it will be a substantial \n     improvement. We note that it is due to us before your \n     testimony at the USDA budget hearing on April 8, 2008.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                    Herb Kohl,\n\n                                         Chairman, Subcommittee on\n             Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this budget resolution lays out a fiscally \nresponsible plan with the right priorities, which include job creation, \ntax breaks for the middle class, and programs that ensure the safety, \nhealth, and education of our Nation's children.\n  Our Nation is enduring hard economic times. Congress cannot neglect \nits responsibility to enact priorities which help our Nation return to \na state of economic stability and prosperity. Through this budget, the \nSenate will set the blueprint for its work to help reverse the current \nadministration's failed fiscal and economic policies.\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\n  Since 2001, we have lost over 3 million manufacturing jobs \nnationwide. My home State of Michigan has lost over 250,000 \nmanufacturing-related jobs. The manufacturing industry faces pressure \nfrom international corporations that are subsidized by their respective \ngovernments; our own government needs to act to keep American \nmanufacturing companies competitive in the global marketplace and \ncompeting on a level playing field.\n  That is why I am glad that the Budget Committee included in this \nresolution my proposal to establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to \npromote American manufacturing. Congress needs to act to revitalize our \ndomestic manufacturing sector.\n  The American Manufacturing Initiative, which I announced last year \nwith a number of my colleagues, would help address critical needs in \nthe manufacturing sector by increasing Federal support for research and \ndevelopment; expanding the scope and effectiveness of manufacturing \nprograms across the Federal government; increasing support for the \ndevelopment of alternative fuels and leap-ahead automotive and energy \ntechnologies; and creating tax incentives to encourage continued U.S.-\nbased production of advanced technologies and supporting \ninfrastructure. Over the last year, we have been able to give more \nsupport to some components of the AMI--primarily increasing authorized \nfunding levels for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the \nTechnology Innovation Program and providing significant new funding for \ndefense manufacturing programs--but much more needs to be done.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues and the next \npresident to support the manufacturing sector in a meaningful way, and \nmake a wise investment in the long-term growth, health, and stability \nof the manufacturing industry.\n  I am also pleased that this budget paves the way for a second, much-\nneeded, economic stimulus package. The economic stimulus package that \npassed in January of this year was a very modest first step toward \naddressing our economy's problems. Further initiatives such as an \nextension of unemployment insurance and housing relief are urgently \nneeded and this budget provides $35 billion toward that effort.\n  The continuation of the pay-go rule, which would require any new \nspending or tax cuts to be paid for elsewhere in the budget unless a \nsupermajority of at least 60 votes in the Senate agrees otherwise, \nshows that the Senate is committed to reversing the administration's \ndigging into a deeper and deeper ditch of debt. I hope the Senate will \nlive up to this important standard we set for ourselves.\n  This budget resolution will also allow for much-needed tax relief for \nmiddle-class families by shielding them from the alternative minimum \ntax. Congress has long known that this is the only fair thing to do for \nAmerica's middle-class families, since the tax was never intended to \nimpact them in the first place.\n  I am also pleased that we passed the Baucus amendment to pave the way \nfor extending a number of existing tax cuts that help working families, \nincluding a tax credit provided for each child in a family and relief \nfrom the joint-filing penalty paid by America's married couples. It \nalso extends estate tax reform at the 2009 level, meaning that married \ncouples would be able to pass on to their beneficiaries estates worth \nup to $7 million before they become subject to the estate tax. The \nBaucus amendment also includes fully paid-for tax relief to members of \nAmerica's military, including a provision allowing combat pay to count \ntoward a refundable federal income tax credit.\n  I am pleased that the Senate adopted the Collins-Levin amendment that \nsets forth important steps to be taken in the area of energy tax \npolicy.\n  Specifically, our amendment proposes extension of the current \nproduction tax credit for biodiesel fuel and the small-producer \nbiodiesel tax credit, both of which will expire at the end of 2008. \nMany of our small biodiesel producers are already having a hard time \nnow because of the increasing prices of feedstock. Without this tax \ncredit, they may not be able to stay afloat and we could lose these new \nsources of biodiesel fuels. We cannot afford to do that.\n  We also propose a new production tax credit for cellulosic ethanol, \nup to a limit of 60 million gallons. Ethanol produced from cellulosic \nsources offers the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 \npercent or more. Again, this is a necessary boost needed by those \npushing the technology toward cellulosic ethanol to ensure that they \nare able to bring the technology to commercialization.\n  Finally, we propose a new tax credit for plug-in hybrid vehicles, \nincluding a tax credit for hybrid conversion kits that can modify \ncurrent technologies with the latest in battery technology as it is \ndeveloped. The combination of advanced battery technology and advanced \nhybrid systems offer tremendous potential for reduction of oil \nconsumption, but tax incentives will be necessary to offset the \nincreased cost to consumers and to achieve widespread acceptance by \nconsumers. These tax credits will accelerate significantly the \navailability of these new plug-in hybrid vehicles to consumers.\n  I am also pleased that this budget plan provides for Congress to go \nafter the offshore tax haven and tax shelter abuses that are \nundermining the integrity of our tax system, and I commend Chairman \nConrad and the Budget Committee members for their willingness to \naddress these complicated areas. Cracking down on these abuses is a \ncritical step toward achieving fairness in our tax system.\n  For many years, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, of \nwhich I am chairman, has been looking at the problem of offshore \ncorporate, bank, and tax secrecy laws and practices that help taxpayers \ndodge their U.S. tax obligations by preventing U.S. tax authorities \nfrom gaining access to key financial and beneficial ownership \ninformation. The subcommittee has also investigated abusive tax \nshelters, which are complicated transactions that are entered into to \nprovide tax benefits unintended by the Tax Code. They are very \ndifferent from legitimate, congressionally-approved tax shelters, such \nas deducting the interest paid on your home mortgage or taking tax \ncredits for historic building preservation. Abusive tax shelters, on \nthe other hand, are marked by one characteristic: no real economic or \nbusiness rationale other than tax avoidance. We cannot tolerate high-\npriced accountants, lawyers and banks concocting ways for tax cheats to \noffload the missing revenue from their unpaid taxes onto the backs of \nhonest taxpayers. That is why I have introduced The Stop Tax Haven \nAbuse Act, on which I am proud to have as cosponsors Senators Coleman, \nObama, Salazar and Whitehouse. This bill provides a powerful set of new \ntools to clamp down on offshore tax and tax shelter abuses.\n  If Congress addresses these inequities, it would bring in billions of \ndollars needed to pay for many important national priorities. These \npriorities are recognized in this budget, including education, \nchildren's health care, veterans' medical care, community development \nblock grants, and law enforcement. We can go a long way toward paying \nfor these critical programs by stopping these tax dodges that rob the \nTreasury of up to $100 billion a year, and shift the tax burden from \nhigh income persons and companies who are principal users of offshore \ntax havens onto the backs of working families who pay their taxes.\n  This budget can provide for ample revenues by shutting them down, \nwhich is not only reasonable, but crucial to improving the integrity of \nour tax system. I applaud Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee, as \nwell as the Finance Committee and Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley, for their efforts on this front, and I look forward to \nworking with them and other allies on this issue as we address these \nproblems over the next year.\n  The blueprint set forth in this resolution is worthy of support. It \nsets us on a course of fiscal responsibility and paves the way for \nimportant investments in America's future.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, from 1997 to 2000, I served as ranking \nmember of the Senate Budget Committee alongside Chairman Domenici, and \nI am proud to say that by the end of my tenure, the Federal Government \nhad a budget surplus of $236.4 billion.\n  Today we face a starkly different picture. Our country is more in \ndebt than ever, owing an astounding $9.3 trillion.\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\nUnder President Bush's watch, the national debt will have almost \ndoubled, and he has sacrificed the stability of our economy in the \nprocess. He has effectively taken our Nation from one of economic \nstability and prosperity to a nation on the brink of recession, and our \nchildren and grandchildren will be stuck with the bill for generations \nto come.\n  Each year, the President has a chance to do the right thing and \npropose to Congress a responsible budget which addresses the needs of \nour country and is fair to all Americans. I have been extremely \ndisappointed these last 8 years as President Bush has continually \npresented us with budget proposals that have resulted in four of the \nfive highest deficits in our country's history, leaving us with a \nstaggering budget deficit of hundreds of billions of dollars. At the \nsame time, his proposals have rewarded the wealthiest members of our \nsociety at the expense of the middle class and Americans struggling to \nearn a living.\n  I am proud to have helped ensure that Congress rejected these Bush \nproposals. Once again this year, we find ourselves in the same process.\n  In rejecting President Bush's fiscal year 2009 budget proposal, we in \nthe Senate Budget Committee under the leadership of Chairman Conrad \nhave brought forward a budget that is not only fiscally responsible but \nalso morally responsible. As a member of this committee, I was pleased \nto be able to help shape this budget.\n  This budget focuses on the real problems that Americans face. It \nincludes tax relief for the middle class, makes much needed investments \nin our economy and our future, and keeps America safe by responsibly \nfunding our homeland security needs.\n  One of the most pressing concerns to New Jerseyans, and all \nAmericans, is tax relief for the middle class.\n  New Jerseyans in particular need relief from the unfair and \nunintended consequences of the alternative minimum tax, AMT. This tax \nwas first imposed on the richest 155 families to ensure they did not \nabuse loopholes to avoid paying any taxes at all. But it has grown to \nensnare far too many people, even members of the middle class, and has \nbecome an unfair and unintended tax. That is why it is so important \nthat our budget includes AMT relief for over 1.4 million New Jerseyans \nwho would otherwise be forced to pay this tax. That is a significant \ntax cut for the middle class.\n  I am pleased our budget includes this AMT relief, and I will continue \nto work diligently to help create a lasting solution to provide \nsufficient tax relief--from the AMT and other Federal taxes--for those \nwho need it in New Jersey and nationwide.\n  I am also proud to be a cosponsor of the Baucus amendment to the \nbudget, which the Senate passed today, to provide further tax relief \nfor America's working families.\n  Our amendment permanently extends a lowered tax rate that benefits \nevery single wage-earning American by keeping the tax rate on the first \n$7,000 of income earned to only 10 percent. This provision will save \ntaxpayers an average of $498.\n  Our amendment also provides for the permanent extension of marriage \npenalty relief. According to the latest estimates, this extension will \nbenefit 29.5 million Americans with an average savings of $686 per \nyear. In addition, our amendment extends the refundable child tax \ncredit which will provide an average of $1,025 in tax relief to some \n31.3 million families.\n  Important especially to New Jerseyans, this amendment provides new \nrelief from high property taxes. We pay among the highest property \ntaxes in the country, and many in our State need help.\n  While two-thirds of all Americans are homeowners, only one-third of \nhomeowners itemize property tax deductions on their tax returns. That \nleaves 28.3 million Americans without a property tax deduction benefit, \nover 451,000 of whom live in New Jersey.\n  Our amendment provides tax relief to those who don't itemize by \ncreating a standard property tax deduction. For single filers, this \namendment will provide $500 in property tax relief and for joint filers \nthat number increases to $1000 in property tax relief.\n  Aside from providing middle-class tax relief, our budget prepares for \nour economy's future by making the necessary investments in critical \npriorities, such as infrastructure, energy, and education.\n  To keep America moving, we must invest in our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  Last year, we saw the I-35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis, MN. Some \n25 percent of our bridges are still structurally deficient or \nfunctionally obsolete. Much of our surface infrastructure is in \ndisrepair, and it will cost billions to improve it.\n   But less than 1 year after the collapse in Minneapolis, President \nBush wants to cut funding for high and bridge repair by almost $2 \nbillion.\n   He also wants to fund transit programs at $200 million below the \nlevel that Congress authorized. These cuts hurt States like New Jersey \nthat need transit funding the most, and working families who depend on \nthis transportation.\n   All of these programs are vital to commuters and travelers in New \nJersey. After all, New Jersey is the most densely populated State in \nthe country and is even more densely populated than the countries of \nIndia and Japan.\n   Traffic congestion on our roads costs our country nearly $80 billion \na year--twice the Federal budget for highways. Commuters cannot afford \nto sit in traffic when gas prices are well over $3 a gallon, and our \nenvironment cannot afford the greenhouse gas emissions from these \nidling cars.\n   Our budget restores billions of dollars President Bush proposed in \ncuts to transportation and provides even more money to rebuild the \nbackbone of our economy--our bridges, highways, skyways, seaports, \nairports, and transit systems. Our budget is expected to create 475,000 \nnew transportation jobs, 7,900 in New Jersey alone. I was proud to \nsponsor an amendment to this budget to ensure that infrastructure \nprojects involving rail transportation, including high-speed rail, \nairports, and seaports are eligible for this new funding.\n   Airline travelers fared no better under President Bush's budget \nproposal. The Bush administration's failures on aviation have led to \none of the worst years ever for flight delays. More than one in four \nflights was late. Our air traffic control system remains dangerously \nunderstaffed, and air traffic controllers are overworked and fatigued. \nAnd there is a lack of leadership in preventing runway incidents.\n   One billion airline passengers will be flying each year by 2015. Now \nis no time to be cutting funding for our Nation's airports and runways \nby $765 million, as President Bush proposes. Our budget restores these \ncuts to aviation infrastructure to keep passengers moving.\n   President Bush is also trying once again to bankrupt Amtrak.\n   In a time of record high gas prices and record airport delays, we \nshould not be taking away this popular, energy-efficient, and \nconvenient travel option, which people are using in record numbers.\n   Last October, the Senate passed my legislation with former Senator \nTrent Lott to provide $11.4 billion for Amtrak to expand passenger rail \nin the United States, and I am working with my House colleagues to get \nit taken up and passed into law this year. It is time that America had \na world-class passenger rail system.\n   I want to thank Chairman Conrad working with me to ensure Amtrak's \noperations and capital needs are fully funded in this budget--a total \nof $1.8 billion, plus an additional $250 million for State passenger \nrail grants.\n   Another key feature of our budget is tackling the extremely \nimportant energy and environmental problems we are facing. Our budget \nshows real commitment to tackling these challenges.\n   The proposal by President Bush would cut funding for the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, which provides much needed assistance \nfor many contending with expensive bills to heat their homes in the \nwinter.\n   President Bush also proposed major cuts to programs that reduce our \ngreenhouse gas emissions and help us combat global warming--the most \nserious environmental threat we face. At a time when the science of \nglobal warming is certain, President Bush attempted to cut the budget \nfor renewable energy by almost 30 percent. This is not a strategy to \nfight the climate\n\n[[Page S2100]]\n\ncrisis; this is simply the same old, ineffective energy policy.\n   Our budget not only restores these cuts but goes even further and \ncalls for new programs that will reduce our dependency on foreign oil \nand help us fight global climate change.\n   When it comes to education, our budget addresses the real problems \nAmerican families face with rising tuition costs. While New Jerseyans \nand the rest of the Nation have seen average tuition costs go up 52 \npercent since 2000, President Bush has continued to propose massive \ncuts in education programs. That is no way to ensure the future of \nNation.\n   Not only does our budget reject these proposed cuts but it increases \neducation funding by an additional $5 billion. That is a serious \ncommitment to education.\n   Our budget puts in place policies that will help our children get \nthe education they need to compete in a global society. It increases \nmoney for Pell grants and student loan programs so that our students \ncan afford to go to college and achieve their dreams. Our budget also \nprovides increased funding for early education like Head Start and puts \nadditional resources into our public schools.\n   Another issue of importance to all Americans is ever-rising health \ncare costs. Since President Bush took office, health care premiums have \nrisen 40 percent in New Jersey. Our budget restores proposed cuts to \nMedicare, Medicaid, and other important programs to ensure all members \nof our society get the health care they need.\n   In addition, no responsible budget would be complete without dealing \nwith the continuing threat of terrorism here in the United States.\n   While spending over $3 billion a week on the war in Iraq, President \nBush has badly underfunded our homeland security needs, leaving our \nNation at greater risk.\n   This risk is very real in New Jersey. The FBI has called the 2-mile \nstretch between Newark Liberty International Airport and Port \nElizabeth, NJ, ``the most dangerous two miles in the country'' for \nterrorism.\n   Yet President Bush proposed cutting funding for State homeland \nsecurity grant programs by almost 80 percent.\n   We all know that homeland security begins with hometown security. \nPresident Bush inherited a country where crime was going down thanks to \nsuccessful, proven programs like COPS and Byrne Justice Assistance \nGrants, Byrne JAG.\n   But after declining for years, violent crime has gone up in each of \nthe past 2 years. And now President Bush wants to eliminate critical \nfunding for local law enforcement under COPS and Byrne JAG.\n   Thankfully, our budget restores funding for these programs and \nreaffirms our commitment to keeping our communities safe.\n   When it comes to taking care of the men and women of our military, I \nam very pleased that we have recognized the sacrifices our career \nmilitary retirees make by rejecting President Bush's proposal for \nTRICARE enrollment fees and deductibles. This is something I have been \nworking to fix permanently.\n   I also strongly support the 3.4-percent pay raise for military \npersonnel that our Senate budget resolution proposes. I believe our \nservice men and women deserve the best benefits that a grateful nation \ncan provide.\n   Lastly, and perhaps most prudently, this budget provides relief to \nthose being hit hardest by the current downturn of our economy.\n   It is clear that our economy is struggling. In response to that, \nthis budget provides an additional $35 billion for a future stimulus \nbill to help families and businesses boost the economy.\n   I am hopeful that this stimulus bill will include funding for our \nStates, including increased Medicaid funding and even more \ninfrastructure dollars.\n   I commend Chairman Conrad for his leadership on this budget \nresolution, and I am proud to be a coauthor. It is a much needed step \nin the right direction.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Conrad on this \nbudget. He has done a brilliant job, and this bill will give us a safer \ncountry and a stronger economy. It will meet compelling human needs and \ntake care of the long-range needs of America.\n  This budget reflects America's priorities and my priorities: finding \ncures for devastating diseases, helping families with special needs, \nprotecting our homeland and protecting our communities, supporting our \ntroops with what they need overseas--and what they need when they come \nback home.\n  Unlike President Bush's proposal, this budget makes a difference for \nfamilies. It looks out for our returning military and rejects the \nPresident's Draconian cuts that would hurt the most vulnerable people.\n  I am for this budget because it takes care of NIH. NIH is a jewel in \nthe Nation's crown. It is saving lives and improving our Nation's \nhealth by bringing discoveries to patients from the lab to the bedside. \nNIH needs adequate resources to meet its mission.\n  That is why I strongly supported doubling the NIH budget from $13.6 \nbillion in 1998 to $27 billion in 2003, but this year the President \nshortchanged NIH. His budget flat funds NIH at $29.5 billion which \ndoesn't even keep up with inflation.\n  Shortchanging NIH means we slow down research and slow down our \ntransition from research to treatment. We need this research to improve \nthe treatments for autism, Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, and heart \ndisease.\n  I am on the side of science, which is why I joined my colleagues \nSenator Harkin and Senator Specter to cosponsor an amendment to \nincrease the NIH budget by $2.1 billion. This additional funding will \nimprove the health of the Nation by supporting research on causes, \ndiagnosis, prevention, and cures. So this funding will save lives today \nand tomorrow.\n  Our budget should save lives, and it should also improve lives--\nespecially for the most vulnerable. In December, Bush announced a new \nrule which said CMS won't pay for most Medicaid case management \nservices. This cuts our most vulnerable citizens off from their social \nworkers and nurses.\n  This rule is just wrong. Without case management, Medicaid falls \napart. If you don't provide the right services in homes and in schools, \nyou can't coordinate health care plans to keep kids and the elderly \nhealthy.\n  In Maryland, this rule would mean 200,000 poor adults and children \nwith disabilities or chronic health problems may not receive case \nmanagement services. And in these tough fiscal times, my State will \nlose over $66 million and 1,400 jobs: mostly nursing and social work \njobs\n  Our budget rejects the President's reckless rule until we have a new \nPresident and a new attitude. I am going to make sure that we keep the \ncommitments in this budget and keep our promises to those sick adults \nand children who need our help.\n  Our budget also recognizes that families need a government that is on \ntheir side. However, the Bush budget shortchanges children with special \nneeds and their families by not providing enough for IDEA. When \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, passed in 1975 \nCongress promised to pay 40 percent of costs. Thirty three years later, \nwe don't even come close.\n  This year, IDEA should be funded at $21.5 billion, but it only got \n$11 billion. Bush talks about leaving no child behind, but his budget \nabandons a generation of children by making IDEA an unfunded mandate.\n  Senator Sanders' amendment, which I cosponsor, would increase IDEA \nfunding by $10 billion over the next 3 years and would dramatically \nimprove services for 7 million children. These are children who can't \nmake it on their own and who may need individual services like special \nattention from teacher's aides, speech therapy, and smaller classes.\n  These aren't ``extras.'' They are essentials that may mean the \ndifference between self-sufficiency and a life of dependence. America \nneeds to get behind our kids--by getting behind those kids that need us \nmost.\n  The Bush budget also falls short, once again, when it comes to social \nservices block grants. These are services that give people the tools \nthey need to practice self-help such as child care assistance and \ntreatment for substance abuse.\n  The Bush budget cuts SSBG from $1.7 billion to $1.2 billion. That is \nhalf a billion dollars that States won't have to help their most \nvulnerable residents. And the President wants to eliminate the program \nentirely in 2010. I am outraged that the President would be so\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\ncoldhearted but I am proud that the Senate budget rejects these cuts \nand restores funding to $1.7 billion.\n  My home State of Maryland will receive $32 million this year. I know \nour communities need it--especially during these tough times. These \nservices help families who are scrimping and saving to stay afloat.\n  I know about social services block grants. Before I was ``Senator \nBarb,'' I was ``Social Worker Barb.'' The services provided are about \nmore than checking boxes and pushing paper; they are about helping \npeople with their problems and meeting them where they are.\n  The Democratic budget also helps families by helping them keep what \nthey earn for things that they need with smart tax breaks for the \nmiddle class. We do it responsibly and realistically by using the \nbudget surplus to extend the tax breaks that matter to working families \nlike the $1000 refundable credit per child, so families can make ends \nmeet; like marriage tax penalty relief so that we don't put a tax on \ngetting married; and like the 10 percent tax bracket so lower income \nworking Americans keep more of their hard-earned pay check. Finally, we \nalso make sure that AMT doesn't hit more middle-class families.\n  These are the tax breaks that help Main Street, not Wall Street, and \nthey are tax breaks we can afford.\n  I am always going to fight for our first responders because we need \nto protect the Americans who protect us. But President Bush wants to \neliminate Community Oriented Policing Program, COPS, funding. That is a \n$587 million cut from last year.\n  The COPS Program pays for cops on the beat because the way that you \nreduce crime is to increase cops. That is why Democrats added $599 \nmillion to our budget for COPS.\n  Firefighters also protect our communities. They need tools to protect \nthemselves--and to protect us. Yet the Bush budget slashes funding for \nour first responders--eliminating one grant program for firefighters \nand cutting another grant program by $260 million.\n  They put their lives on the line every day; they should never be \nshortchanged by their government. That is why our budget rejects the \nadministration's reckless cuts and adds $2.2 billion more for law \nenforcement and first responders.\n  The Democratic budget also supports our troops with what they need on \nthe battlefield--and what they need when they come back home.\n  We fully fund the President's request for the military, and we take \ncare of them here at home. I am so proud that Senator Baucus's \namendment includes the Defenders of Freedom Act. These are tax breaks \nto reward soldiers for their service--a tax credit for businesses who \nkeep National Guard and Reserve on their payrolls when reservists and \nguards are called to help their country and a tax break on money earned \nbecause of service to the Nation.\n  I want everyone to look at what the Bush budget does for our \nveterans. It is unacceptable that the President underfunded programs \nfor vets. Promises made must be promises kept. Vets fight our enemies \non foreign battlefields; they shouldn't have to fight their own \nGovernment for the services and benefits they deserve.\n  Democrats understand, and we keep our word to America's vets by \nproviding an additional $3.2 billion to come up to the funding \nsuggested by Independent Budget.\n  Finally, as the chairman of the subcommittee that funds science and \nour space program, I am pleased that the Democrats have an innovation \nbudget. This is a strong budget for NASA: $18.7 billion for NASA. That \nis $1 billion more than the President's request. NASA is our premier \ninnovation agency. It creates new technologies that create new jobs and \nexcites our next generation of scientists and engineers.\n  These extra funds will allow us to reimburse NASA for the costs of \nreturning the space shuttle to flight safely after the Columbia \ndisaster.\n  I have fought for this extra funding for several years, and I hope we \ncan make it a reality this year in the CJS bill.\n  The budget also says that we must have a balanced space program of \nscience, aeronautics, and space exploration and that we should work to \nclose the 5-year gap in our human space flight program.\n  I support these goals and thank Chairman Conrad for his leadership.\n  Yet I am disappointed that the budget does not recommend full funding \nfor the American Competitiveness Initiative at the National Science \nFoundation and the National Institutes of Standards and Technology.\n  That is why I am supporting the Bingaman-Alexander amendment, to \nprovide the fully authorized levels for these science agencies as \nrecommended by the America COMPETES Act. This funding will provide \ncritical investments in education in science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics, STEM. This is the research that creates new \ntechnologies and new jobs.\n  It is an important time for America. Our economy is in trouble, and \nwe need to spend wisely. Democrats are making the hard choices to make \nAmerica stronger, invest in our future, and balance the Nation's \ncheckbook.\n  The budget reflects the best of our country. It keeps commitments to \nvets and our first responders, invests in our kids and our future, and \nmeets our economic challenges head on.\n  Let's get the job done and pass this budget. Americans deserve it, \nand the Senate needs to deliver.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing great \nconcern for families struggling during these tough economic times. \nCosts are going up. Prices for everyday goods are increasing. Food \ncosts are skyrocketing. Heating and electricity prices are on the rise. \nThe price of gas is breaking all-time records. The family budget is \nbeing strapped. We all agree this is a time of great economic \nuncertainty.\n  But we disagree about how Congress should respond to this situation. \nWhat is the Federal Government's role? I will tell you precisely how we \nshould not respond--when the costs of food and fuel for families are \ngoing through the roof. We should not add to that burden by increasing \nthe cost of the Federal Government. Unfortunately, that is precisely \nwhat my friends on the Democrat side plan to do with their budget. With \nthe family budget under serious threat, the other side of the aisle \nplans to expand the federal budget--at the expense of the family \nbudget. I say to my friends: if there was ever a time not to raise \ntaxes, if there was ever a time not to increase the costs people pay \nfor the federal government, that time is now. Yet this budget contains \nthe largest tax increase in America's history.\n  We all hear about rising energy costs. However, families are also \ntaking another big hit in the pocketbook with food prices that are \nincreasing at their fastest rates since 1990. Prices for many groceries \nare rising at double-digit rates. Milk prices increased 26 percent last \nyear. The price for eggs is up 40 percent. Cheese prices have doubled \nfrom a year ago. Beef prices are up 50 percent. Flour is up about 20 \npercent since last year. Taken as a whole, food and beverage prices are \nrising at 4 percent a year, which is the fastest rate of increase in 20 \nyears. All indicators point to this trend continuing, if not worsening.\n  Food, which accounts for about 13 percent of the family budget, is \nnot the only expense that has seen dramatic increases. Energy costs now \nconsume about 4 percent of a family's budget. On Monday, gas prices set \na record high of $3.227 per gallon--while oil prices broke the all-\ntime, inflation-adjusted record and rose to $108 per barrel. The cost \nof heating and powering a home is rising. The Energy Department is \nforecasting sustained increases in the demand and prices of electricity \nand residential energy usage. It is important to remember that even \nmodest increases in home energy prices have a significant impact on the \nbudgets of middle-income Americans.\n  Undoubtedly, the costs of many items in the family budget are \nincreasing. In this context, Democrats are rolling out their budget \nplan, and what do we see? Unbelievably, we see plans to radically \nincrease the cost that families will pay for the Federal Government. \nWith the cost of so many household essentials skyrocketing, why are we \nraising the cost of the Federal Government? This is the last thing the \neconomy needs. And it is the last thing families need.\n  This year, the Federal Government will tax $21,604 per household, \nspend\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\n$25,117 per household, and run a deficit of $3,513 per household. But \nit is not enough. It never is.\n  The budget we are considering contains a $1.2 trillion tax hike. On \ntop of the thousands of dollars families are already paying for the \nFederal Government, on top of food costs and energy costs reaching \nstratospheric levels, the majority party is rolling out a budget plan \nwith record tax increases. This budget plan increases taxes by more \nthan $2,300 each year for 43 million families with children. $2,300 in \naddition to what these families are already paying.\n  I watch my colleagues on the other side come down to the floor one \nafter another and complain that the Federal Government does not have \nenough money. Might I remind my friends that this budget is a $3 \ntrillion budget. This government spends more money than the entire \neconomies of most countries. In 2006, only two countries had entire \neconomies--every good and service produced within their borders--bigger \nthan $3 trillion. One was the United States. The other was Japan at $4 \ntrillion. Germany ranked third in world GDP. Amazingly, my colleagues \nhave proposed a budget that is bigger than Germany's entire economy in \n2006.\n  Under the Democrat's budget, 43 million families face tax increases \nof $2,300. What could $2,300 buy for an American family? I started by \ntalking about food costs, which are rising at the fastest rate in two \ndecades. $2,300 could buy 8 month's worth of groceries for a family. \nThen I talked about record-setting energy costs; $2,300 could buy a \nfamily's electricity and home heating oil for an entire year.\n  Now more than ever, we need to protect the family budget from the \nFederal budget. The Democrat budget does exactly the opposite, \ncontaining massive tax increases. It deserves to be defeated.\n  While the family budget is under threat by Democrat's nondefense \nspending, our Nation is under threat by global terrorist forces. We \nmust support our courageous men and women in uniform by adequately \nfunding defense spending.\n  The greatest trust placed upon Congress by the American people is to \nprovide for their security by maintaining a strong national defense. It \nis a trust we cannot betray. However, we are rapidly reaching a \ncrossroads--a nexus that will determine America's security for the next \nseveral decades.\n  To better understand where we are today, it is important to \nunderstand how we arrived at this point. This Nation's historical \npattern has been one of a small professional military in peacetime, \nrapidly supplemented by a mobilization of civilians during war, \nfollowed by a rapid demobilization at the war's end. This \ndemobilization or downsizing occurs within a context of balancing risks \nand threats. The trick is to retain and fund a force of sufficient size \nand capability to deter or dissuade, and, if necessary, to fight and \nwin.\n\n  In the late 1970s, the military of the United States was a hollow \nforce--low morale, low pay, outdated equipment, and unable to maintain \nthe equipment it possessed. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan expanded the \nmilitary budget, increased troops size, reenergized weapons \nprocurement, and revived our intelligence capabilities . . . returning \nthis country back to its superpower status. The Cold War officially \nended in 1990.\n  Much of this Nation's firepower is a legacy of the Reagan years. With \nthe demise of the Soviet Union, our military was downsized to counter a \n``perceived'' diminished world threat. Unfortunately, the global \nstrategic environment has since then become increasingly complex, \ndynamic, lethal, and uncertain.\n  During the Clinton administration, I was on the floor every 2 weeks \nwarning that we would live to regret the massive cuts and procurement \nholiday of the 1990's. I believe one of the great tragedies of our \nnational security history is the military spending during this time \npassed.\n  Between fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 2001, the DOD budget \nexperienced a downward trend, $313.3 billion less than if it stayed \ntrue to the rate of inflation. Clinton's proposed budget was $99 \nbillion less than what Congress believed defense required. The Clinton/\nGore administration cut the defense budget by 40 percent, reducing it \nto its lowest percentage of the gross national product since before \nWorld War II.\n  As a result of these budgetary cuts, today's force is half the size \nof the military in the 1990s. The Army was reduced from 18 divisions to \n10, the Air Force from 37 tactical air wings to 20, and the Navy from \n568 ships in the late 1980s to only 276 today.\n  As our forces decreased in size, the number and lengths of \ndeployments increased and international terrorism took the forefront. \nAfghanistan was used as a training ground for terrorists and the \nTaliban regime allowed al-Qaida unfettered mobility.\n  On February 26, 1993, a car bomb was planted in the underground \nparking garage below the World Trade Center, foreshadowing the 9/11 \nattacks. On June 25, 1996, the Khobar towers were bombed by Hezbollah, \nwith intelligence pointing to support by al-Qaida. On August 7, 1998, \nthere were simultaneous bombings at the U.S. embassies in Dar Es \nSalaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya. On October 12, 2000 suicide \nbombers used a boat to attack the USS Cole while it was moored in \nYemen.\n  America's response was comparatively restrained and, at best, \ninconsistent. Operation Infinite Reach included cruise missile strikes \nagainst Afghanistan and Sudan, but there was no real change. This \ninadequate response has been cited as a factor emboldening al-Qaida to \nundertake further plans. WMD proliferation throughout the world reached \nan unprecedented level.\n  The Chinese government learned that it could rely on our \nacquiescence. They transferred prohibited weapons technology to North \nKorea, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and other countries, threatened to \nabsorb Taiwan, and intimidated our regional treaty allies, South Korea, \nand Japan. During this period, our country concluded, as Secretary \nGates put it, ``that the nature of man and the world had changed for \nthe better, and turned inward, unilaterally disarming and dismantling \ninstitutions important to our national security--in the process, giving \nourselves a so-called ``peace'' dividend . . .''\n  We were wrong. The reason I talk about this is because it highlights \nwhat can happen when we don't adequately fund our military and provide \nit with stability and predictability about its future. The United \nStates must build and sustain military capabilities required to respond \nto possible future threats across the spectrum of conflict.\n  The next war will not be like the past one--history has taught us \nthis. We cannot assume freedom of the seas, freedom of air and space, \nand freedom of maneuver on the ground. In order to provide stability, \nAmerica must be able to deter or defeat any threat, be it an insurgency \nor a challenge from a near-peer competitor. In order to provide this \nstability, Congress needs to guarantee a baseline in funding.\n  Guaranteeing a baseline budget, one that is indexed to our GDP, is \nthe best way to accomplish this. Historically, defense spending was 4.6 \npercent in 1991 during the gulf war; 8.9 percent in 1968 during \nVietnam; and 11.7 percent in 1953 during the Korean war. Across the \nlast century, it has averaged about 5.7 percent. The fiscal year 2009 \ndefense budget is $541.1 billion--approximately 3.3 percent of GDP.\n  We can no longer afford to kid ourselves that we are still sending \nour sons and daughters out with the best equipment available. In some \ncases, we simply can't match the quality of our competitors. In other \ncases, while we may have developed a superior system, we have \nrestricted the quantity to a point where many of our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines are forced into battle with the older, inferior \nequipment.\n  Many other countries are able to buy avionics, airframes, and \nweapons--often mixed and matched together--to create aircraft that \nrival our current F-15, F-16, or Navy and Marine F-18, such as Russian \nSu-30s and 35s, or upgraded MiG-21s and MiG-29s. We can solve this \nproblem if we decide to make the investment in our F-22 and F-35 \nprograms, and buy the number needed to ensure American air superiority \nin the future. Despite the Air Force's requirement for 381 F-22 \nRaptors, it is now slated to only obtain 183.\n  Some systems in the Army are overmatched by systems sold by other \ncountries. Four other countries have\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\nbetter artillery systems than the U.S. The British AS90, the Russian \n2S19, the South African G6, and the German PzH 2000 are all superior in \nrate of fire and range to our Paladin. Though we are currently \ninvesting in Future Combat Systems, the Army has been forced to extend \nthe production time by 4 years.\n  Our Navy and Marine Corps are being challenged by a variety of \nthreats ranging from near-peer competitors, to non-state and \ntransnational actors, to rogue nations and pirates. While trying to \nsustain and recapitalize their ships, submarines, aircraft, and ground \nequipment, they are being challenged across the globe. Russian and \nChinese submarines continue to threaten our forces with China operating \nover 60 submarines. China, Japan, Australia, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, \nIndonesia, Singapore, Bangladesh, and South and North Korea either now \nhave or are planning to acquire submarines. While most do not pose much \nof a threat to our more advanced fleet, that dynamic is changing. It is \nsimply unacceptable that we have been forced into this predicament.\n  One can never predict future threats accurately. Our level of defense \nspending must consider the resources needed to meet current and future \nthreats. A Pentagon official claimed 15 years ago that in 10 years we \nwould no longer need a standing army. This is not the only example of \nflawed strategic thinking. We weren't able to predict the fall of the \nSoviet Union, or the rise in asymmetric warfare that we are currently \nengaged in. We built a force for 50 years that was predicated upon the \nidea that we would be fighting a conventional war against the Soviets \nin the heart of Europe. It doesn't matter how great our military \nleaders or intelligence is, our strategic thinking will always be \nimperfect. There will always be unknowns.\n  Tying defense spending to GDP accomplishes three things. First, it \nwill allow our military to develop and build the next generation of \nweapons and equipment: Weapons and equipment that will be needed to \nmaintain national security for the next 30 years; that will provide \nincreased capability across the spectrum of warfare; and that have \nlower lifetime costs and increased readiness rates.\n  Second, it provides predictability for our military and industrial \nbase. It allows the Department of Defense and the Services to plan and \nfund their acquisition programs based on a minimum known budget. We are \nno longer able to complete purchases of large acquisition programs in 3 \nto 5 years. To recapitalize the entire Air Force tanker fleet will take \nover 30 years. Programming from a known minimum budget for the out \nyears will translate to less reprogramming and more stability for \nthousands of businesses throughout the United States at decreased \ncosts.\n  Finally, a commitment to a minimum defense budget sends a clear \nsignal to our military, allies, and enemies alike that we are committed \nto the security of our nation and the preservation of freedom and \ndemocracy around the world. Congress must provide the Department of \nDefense with the certainty and stability that comes with a long-term \ndefense-spending plan.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will support the Senate budget resolution \nbrought to the Senate by the Budget Committee and Chairman Conrad. This \nbudget continues the long process that the new Congress started last \nyear to restore fiscal responsibility and order to our Federal budget. \nI commend Chairman Conrad and his colleagues on the Budget Committee \nfor producing a responsible budget resolution that strives to meet the \nreal needs of the American people and to optimize our Nation's most \npressing challenges and opportunities.\n  As we debate the budget, it is important to recall how we got to this \npoint. When he took office in January of 2001, President Bush inherited \na record Federal budget surplus. Instead of steering the country on a \nprudent course that would have helped prepare for the retirement of the \nbaby boomers, supported the aspirations of working families, met the \npressing needs of those who are struggling, and paid down our large \nnational debt, the President immediately pushed through more than $1 \ntrillion in tax cuts aimed at the wealthiest Americans and \ncorporations.\n  Since then, the Bush administration has pursued fiscal policies of \nrecklessness and squander that have short-circuited the priorities of \nhard-working families, children and seniors. For the Bush \nadministration, investments in health care, education, housing, the \nanticrime and antidrug work of our law enforcement community, our first \nresponders, and the rising home heating costs of those who can least \nafford them have taken a back seat to a costly, misguided and \nmismanaged war in Iraq and to the administration's disastrous fiscal \npolicies here at home.\n  Now that a worsening housing slump, high gas prices and dampened \nconsumer confidence have caused jitters throughout our Nation's \nfinancial markets--leading to continued job losses and weaker-than-\nexpected retail sales--the President's continued fiscal mismanagement \nhas hamstrung the government's ability to provide needed investments in \nprograms that will help hard-working American families weather the \nfinancial storm.\n  We cannot continue on the path of fiscal irresponsibility the current \nadministration has set, by holding to a course that will cost more than \n$3 trillion in Iraq and ignoring the needs of our most important \ndomestic programs. As far as the White House is concerned, anything \ngoes when it comes to spending in Iraq, while the real priorities of \nthe American people have been forced farther and farther back in the \nline.\n  With the budget plans of the past 2 years, the new Congress has ended \nthe days of rubberstamping the President's budget, and the process has \nbegun of shifting our country in a new direction that will be better \nfor hard-working Americans everywhere. By strengthening our economy, \ncreating jobs, investing in our infrastructure, increasing our energy \nindependence and supporting our military veterans and first responders, \nthe Senate's budget plan puts the concerns of the working Americans \nfront and center. Moreover, by carefully targeting and reallocating \nresources, the budget resolution would return us to Federal budget \nsurpluses in 2012 and 2013 and accomplish this without raising new \ntaxes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support this alternative to the \nPresident's deeply flawed budget policies.\n  The President submitted a budget request with a shocking price tag, \n$3.1 trillion. In the entire history of the Republic, the Congress has \nnever had to grapple with such an enormous budget request. In the \nentire history of the Republic, the Congress has never had to reconcile \nsuch enormous deficits, the highest ever proposed by any \nadministration. In the entire history of the Republic from George \nWashington, to Abraham Lincoln, through Franklin Roosevelt--in 220 \nyears, after a Civil War, two World Wars, and the Cold War, after \nsevere economic depressions, and stock market manipulations and crashes \nthat eclipse anything we have seen in our lifetimes--the Congress has \nnever, ever had to wrestle with such an alarming explosion in the \nnational debt. No administration has ever proposed to borrow so much \nmoney. Once you look past the Orwellian rhetoric about earmarks, and \nsee through the phony arguments about domestic programs somehow paying \nfor everything else, you come to inexorable conclusion that this \nadministration's policies have been an unmitigated, indisputable fiscal \ndisaster.\n  What's most worrisome, is that the President's budget continues a \ndangerous practice of squeezing domestic agencies, and gambling that \nthey can get by for another year, and another year, and yet another \nyear on a starvation diet. Hurricane Katrina exposed the consequences \nof this kind of budgeting, when disasters inevitably occur and agencies \nlike FEMA do not have the resources they need to respond. The same \nthing happened at the Mine Safety and Health Administration, where the \nadministration chipped away at the mine safety budget for 6 years until \nit had lost inspectors, and teetered on the edge of disaster daily. \nCoal miners died because of budget decisions of this administration. \nFederal prisons are dangerously understaffed. Food safety inspections \nare alarmingly less than they should be. Our Nation is forgoing \ninvestments year after year to replace aging and deficient \ninfrastructure, and that is going to come back to\n\n[[Page S2104]]\n\nhaunt us one day. There are consequences, sometimes deadly \nconsequences, when the necessary operations of government are denied \nadequate funding.\n  Now the administration is telling local communities they must do \nwithout Federal investments in State economies, threatening community \nand neighborhood projects that have been long planned and supported by \nthe Federal Government. Some may deceptively dismiss these investments \nas earmarks, but they are vital stimuli for communities, especially in \nthe midst of an economic slowdown. The President has even taken the \nbrazen step of instructing Federal agencies and offices to ignore \ncongressional committee report language related to future \nappropriations bills. To direct executive agencies to ignore the \nguidance of congressional committees on a spending bill, opens the door \nto its doing so on other bills--maybe an appropriations bill, maybe an \nauthorization bill, maybe a revenue bill, maybe on matters that are \nentirely unrelated to so-called earmarks. It is a dangerous, dangerous \nprecedent, and something that is to be resisted.\n  After 8 years of budgets that have burdened future generations with \nenormous debt and interest payments, and left behind physical \ninfrastructure that is dangerously underfunded, let us do what we \nshould have done many years ago, and reject this President's ill-\nconceived proposal. I am glad that the Budget Committee produced an \nalternative budget, and I look forward to supporting it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nhigher education tax provisions included in the fiscal year 2009 budget \nresolution.\n  I would like to begin by commending Chairman Conrad and the rest of \nthe Budget Committee for their foresight in providing for $13 billion \nin tax relief to help make college more accessible and affordable. \nPrioritizing education in this year's budget, in my opinion, is a step \nin the right direction. If we do not change the status quo, over the \nnext decade, an estimated 2 million students will not attend college \nbecause their families cannot afford it. We must not stand idly by \nwhile the goal of providing a better future for our children becomes \nunattainable. Qualified students should not be denied access to a \ncollege education because they cannot afford it.\n  Since my first Senate campaign in 1972, I have supported tax \nincentives to help families send their children to college. While we \nhave come a long way since then, we must do more, such as enacting the \nbill I introduced last year--the College Affordability and Creating \nChances for Educational Success for Students Act, S.1399--or ``College \nACCESS Act.'' I would encourage my colleagues to consider one specific \nprovision in the College ACCESS Act: the creation of a single $3,000 \nrefundable tax credit, or the ACCESS credit.\n  The ACCESS credit would consolidate two existing tax incentives--the \nHope credit and the tuition deduction--and replace them with a single \n$3,000 refundable tax credit. Families would no longer face the complex \nand varying eligibility criteria or the difficult task of determining \nwhich tax incentive has the greatest value. The ACCESS credit improves \nthe existing tax incentives in several ways.\n  First, the ACCESS credit would allow families to claim the credit for \neach child in their household. While the Hope credit can be claimed for \nmultiple students in a household, the tuition deduction can only be \nclaimed once per tax return. The ACCESS credit removes this \ndiscrepancy.\n  Second, the ACCESS credit would be available for all 4 years of \ncollege and 2 years of graduate school. Presently, the Hope credit is \navailable only for the first 2 years of a student's postsecondary \neducation while the tuition deduction can be claimed for multiple \nyears. The ACCESS credit remedies this discrepancy.\n  Another improvement is that the maximum value of the ACCESS credit is \n$3,000 per student, which covers the average cost of tuition at a \npublic 2-year college and half the average cost of tuition at a public \n4-year college. In comparison, the Hope credit's maximum value is only \n$1,650 per student and the tuition deduction's maximum value is only \n$1,120 per household.\n  One of the most important features of the ACCESS credit is that it \nwould be refundable. The existing tax incentives for higher education \nare of limited or no benefit to low-income families who have no income \ntax liability. These families cannot claim either the Hope credit or \nthe tuition deduction. The ACCESS credit's refundability provides \nrelief for those that need it the most.\n  The ACCESS credit also broadens the income eligibility limits to help \nmore middle-class families. Couples earning up to $130,000 could claim \nthe full credit, while a reduced credit would be available for those \nearning up to $166,000.\n  A report issued by the Government Accountability Office found that 27 \npercent of eligible tax filers claimed neither the tuition deduction \nnor an education tax credit because of their complexity. Tax incentives \ncannot benefit students and their families if they do not know about \nthem or understand their eligibility criteria or their value. The \nACCESS credit would eliminate existing discrepancies and reduce the \ncomplexity of the existing incentives for students and their families, \nhelping approximately 4 million more hard-working American families pay \nfor college.\n  While a college education has never been more important, a college \ndegree is fast becoming a luxury good for too many families. This \nbudget provides us with an opportunity to reverse that trend. If we \nexpect to maintain our status as a leader in the global economy, we \nmust do more for our students. The ACCESS credit I have introduced \nwould do just that, ensuring that the doors that lead to opportunity in \nour country remain open to all our children.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the budget resolution proposes that \nCongress delay several CMS Medicaid regulations that are unpopular with \nstates and advocates. I know some people have concerns with the CMS \nMedicaid regulations. I am not going to argue they are perfect. I have \nissues with some of them as well.\n  However, the regulations do address areas where there are real \nproblems in Medicaid. States don't have clear guidance and could be \ninappropriately spending taxpayer dollars. This leads to improper \npayments and wasteful spending.\n  We see this throughout the regulations in question. I have a CRS memo \nthat shows some of the issues that exist under current law that I am \ngoing to be quoting from shortly, and ask unanimous consent at this \ntime to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                                   March 13, 2008.\n\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Senate Committee on Finance--Attention: Rodney L. \n         Whitlock, Ph.D., Health Policy Advisor.\n     From: Elicia Herz, Specialist in Health Insurance Financing; \n         Cliff Binder, Analyst in Health Care Financing; Jean \n         Hearne, Specialist in Health Insurance Financing; Rick \n         Apling, Specialist in Education Policy.\n     Subject: Responses to Medicaid Regulation Questions \n         Governing: Graduate Medical Education, Intergovernmental \n         Transfers, School-based Services, Rehabilitation, and \n         Targeted Case Management.\n       Per your request, we are responding to your specific \n     questions on Medicaid regulations recently issued by the \n     Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Also as you \n     instructed, we have framed our responses to your request in \n     the context you described as if the proposed regulations did \n     not exist:\n       ``The questions below assume that none of the regulations \n     are allowed to go into effect. Therefore, current statute and \n     any regulations or guidance in place prior to the issuance of \n     these regulations remain in effect.''\n       Your questions focus on specific aspects of selected issues \n     addressed in the new Medicaid regulations regarding \n     intergovernmental transfers (IGTs), graduate medical \n     education (GME), school-based services, rehabilitation \n     services, and targeted case management (TCM). Therefore, \n     the responses provided in this confidential memorandum are \n     neither intended to be a full discussion of CMS' \n     justifications for each new regulation, nor the \n     counterpoints raised by opponents of the regulations. The \n     Congressional Research Service (CRS) is preparing several \n     reports on these new regulations that will encompass \n     fuller discussions of these issues.\n       In the meantime if you have addition questions or need \n     clarification, please contact staff as follows: IGTs, Jean \n     Hearne or Elicia Herz, GME and school-based services,\n\n[[Page S2105]]\n\n     Elicia Herz, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     (IDEA), Rick Apling, and rehabilitation services and TCM, \n     Cliff Binder.\n     1.0 Intergovernmental Transfers (IGTs)\n     1.1 Can a state pay a hospital and require the hospital to \n         return a portion of the payment to the state?\n       Under certain circumstances, a state can require providers \n     to transfer funds to the state and because a provider's \n     Medicaid receipts are indistinguishable from other receipts, \n     effectively a portion of Medicaid payments may be included in \n     those transfers. There are two allowable methods states can \n     use to require hospitals to transfer funds to states: \n     intergovernmental transfers and taxes. Each method has its \n     own set of requirements. Congress specifically protects the \n     ability of states to collect funds from governmental \n     providers through intergovernmental transfers as long as \n     those transfers are certified public expenditures (Section \n     1903(w)(6)(A)). States are limited, however, in their ability \n     to collect funds from non-governmental providers. States are \n     able to collect funds from all types of providers through \n     taxes as long as the taxes comport with federal Medicaid law.\n     2.0 Graduate Medical Education (GME)\n     2.1 Is there any guidance in statute for how states should \n         bill CMS for IME and GME?\n       Most states make Medicaid payments to help cover the costs \n     of training new doctors in teaching hospitals and other \n     teaching programs. Historically, both Medicare and Medicaid \n     have recognized two components of GME: (1) direct graduate \n     medical education (DGME) (e.g., resident salaries, payments \n     to supervising physicians), and (2) indirect graduate medical \n     education (IME) (e.g., higher patient costs in teaching \n     hospitals due to treating sicker patients, residents ordering \n     more diagnostic tests than experienced physicians).\n       There is one explicit reference to GME in the federal \n     Medicaid statute. Section 1932(b)(2)(D) of the Social \n     Security Act stipulates that non-managed care organization \n     providers (non-MCO providers) that deliver emergency care to \n     an MCO beneficiary must accept as payment in full (up to) the \n     maximum amount applicable in the fee-for-service (FFS) \n     setting, minus any GME payments.\n       There also is one explicit reference to GME in federal \n     regulations at 42 CFR 438.6(c)(5)(v). This regulation \n     stipulates that if a state makes payments to providers for \n     GME costs under an approved state plan, the state must adjust \n     capitation rates for managed care to account for those GME \n     payments made on behalf of MCO beneficiaries, not to exceed \n     the aggregate amount that would have been paid under the fee-\n     for-service (FFS) delivery system. States must first \n     establish actuarially sound capitation rates prior to making \n     adjustments for GME.\n       These provisions are intended to prevent duplicate GME \n     payments under Medicaid managed care since states may make \n     supplemental GME payments directly to teaching hospitals \n     outside of provider payments assumed in capitation rates to \n     MCOs.\n     2.2 Do states bill for IME and GME using a consistent \n         methodology?\n       There appear to be no data that directly address how states \n     claim federal Medicaid matching dollars for payments related \n     to IME and DGME. These payments may be included in claims for \n     inpatient and outpatient hospital services when made on a FFS \n     or direct payment basis, and also may be represented in \n     claims for capitation rates paid to managed-care \n     organizations.\n       Survey data show that 48 states provided payment for DGME \n     and/or IME costs under their Medicaid programs. States use a \n     variety of methods to calculate IME and DGME payment amounts \n     under both FFS and managed care. Some states use more than \n     one method. For example, under FFS in 2005, 20 states \n     reported following Medicare's methodology; 12 used a per-\n     resident amount based on a teaching hospital's share of total \n     Medicaid revenues, costs or patient volume; 5 used a lump sum \n     amount; 4 used a per-Medicaid discharge amount; and 19 states \n     used other methods. Also, under FFS, states typically use two \n     methods to distribute GME payments to hospitals. Thirty-one \n     states included GME payments as part of the hospital's per-\n     case or per-diem rates, 20 states made a separate direct \n     payment to teaching hospitals, and 2 states used other \n     methods.\n       Under managed care, ten states recognized and included GME \n     payments in capitation rates for MCOs, but only two of those \n     10 required MCOs to distribute DGME/IME payments to teaching \n     hospitals; the other 8 states assumed MCOs provided these \n     payments to their participating hospitals.\n     2.3 Do all states separate out IME and GME in billing CMS?\n       Data do not appear to be available with which to directly \n     answer this question. However, according to the AAMC survey, \n     in 2005, 11 states reported that their GME payments to \n     providers did not distinguish between IME and DGME under at \n     least one delivery system (FFS, managed care, or both).\n     2.4 Does CMS know how much they are being billed for IME and \n         GME?\n       States are not required to report GME payments separately \n     from other payments made for inpatient and outpatient \n     hospital services when claiming federal matching payments \n     under Medicaid. For the Medicaid GME proposed rule published \n     in the May 23, 2007 Federal Register, CMS used an earlier \n     version of the AAMC survey data as a base for its savings \n     estimate and made adjustments for inflation and expected \n     state behavioral changes, for example.\n     3.0 School-based Services\n\n     3.1 Based on the original intention of the program, are \n         states under-funded by the federal government for the \n         provision of IDEA services?\n       States, school districts, interest groups, and parents of \n     children with disabilities often argue that the federal \n     government is not living up to its obligation to `fully fund' \n     Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     (IDEA, P.L. 108-446) (the grants-to-states program). This \n     argument can be made on one of two grounds.\n       First, when IDEA was enacted in 1975, the Congress set a \n     goal (or made a promise--depending on one's interpretation of \n     the legislative history) to fund up to 40% of the excess cost \n     of providing special education and related services to \n     children with disabilities. The metric used to measure excess \n     cost is the national average per pupil expenditure (APPE). \n     Appropriations for Part B have never reached the 40% level. \n     Current appropriations represent about 17%. Based on this \n     goal, promise, or intent, one can argue that IDEA has been \n     under-funded.\n       Another argument for under-funding can be based on \n     authorization levels contained in the Act. The 2004 \n     reauthorization of IDEA added specific authorization levels \n     for FY2005 to FY2011. The authorization levels were intended \n     to provide a path to ``full funding'' by FY2011. The FY2008 \n     authorization is $19.2 billion while the FY2008 appropriation \n     is $10.9 billion. So the current appropriation is below the \n     ``full funding'' level, which would be about $25 billion for \n     FY2008, and it is significantly below the FY2008 \n     authorization level, which was meant to be a target on the \n     path to eventual ``full funding.''\n     3.2 Are school-based transportation services focused largely \n         on children who are receiving IDEA services?\n       When certain conditions are met, the costs of \n     transportation from home to school and back home again may \n     receive federal matching funds as a Medicaid benefit. These \n     conditions are: (1) the child receiving the transportation \n     must be enrolled in Medicaid and receiving services pursuant \n     to an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or Individualized \n     Family Service Plan (IFSP) under IDEA, (2) the need for \n     specialized transportation must be listed in the child's IEP \n     or IFSP, (3) the transportation is billed on a day when the \n     child receives a medically necessary Medicaid covered service \n     in school pursuant to the IEP or IFSP, and (4) the school or \n     school district that is billing for the transportation must \n     be a certified Medicaid provider. In this context, \n     ``specialized transportation'' means the child requires \n     transportation in a vehicle adapted to serve the needs of \n     individuals with disabilities, including a specially adapted \n     school bus. In addition, if a child resides in an area that \n     does not have school bus transportation (e.g., areas in close \n     proximity to school), but has a medical need for \n     transportation that is noted in the IEP, that transportation \n     may also be billed to Medicaid. Transportation from school to \n     a provider in the community may also be billed to Medicaid \n     for both Medicaid/IDEA children and Medicaid/non-IDEA \n     children. These policies apply whether the state is claiming \n     FFP for transportation as medical assistance or \n     administration.\n       There does not appear to be data that show the proportion \n     of school-based transportation services that are provided to \n     Medicaid/IDEA versus Medicaid/non-IDEA children. It is \n     generally assumed that such transportation is predominantly \n     provided to Medicaid/IDEA children.\n     4.0 Rehabilitation Services\n\n     4.1 Do states bill CMS for rehabilitation services and how \n         much has it increased recently?\n       There are two reporting mechanisms that states may use to \n     report expenditures for optional rehabilitation services: the \n     Form HCFA-64 and MSIS. States report expenditures on the Form \n     HCFA-64, a quarterly financial accounting reporting form. \n     There is a separate category on the HCFA-64 form where states \n     may report optional rehabilitation services. States report \n     rehabilitation expenditures through Medicaid Statistical \n     Information System (MSIS). MSIS data are derived from \n     individual paid Medicaid claims. Even though there is a \n     category for reporting rehabilitative service expenditures, \n     states have discretion in deciding which paid claims will be \n     classified as rehabilitative services.\n       States report rehabilitation expenditures to CMS when \n     claiming FFP. States or fiscal agents receive bills or \n     Medicaid claims for payment from providers (e.g., hospitals, \n     physicians, physical therapists, psychologists, social \n     workers, nurses, and other providers). Claims submitted to \n     Medicaid are verified that they meet certain requirements and \n     electronically checked before being paid.\n       As shown in Table 1, in FY2005 total federal and state \n     Medicaid expenditures reported via MSIS as rehabilitation \n     services were approximately $6.4 billion. In FY1999, states \n     reported MSIS rehabilitation expenditures of approximately \n     $3.6 billion. Between FY1999 and FY2005, federal and state \n     Medicaid rehabilitation expenditures increased by 77.7%. In \n     FY1999, 1.2 million beneficiaries received rehabilitation \n     services; but by FY2005, the number of beneficiaries \n     receiving\n\n[[Page S2106]]\n\n     rehabilitation had increased by 36.2% to more than 1.6 \n     million. Further, average per beneficiary rehabilitation \n     expenditures increased by approximately 30% between FY1999 \n     and FY2005. In FY2005 six states reported no rehabilitation \n     services expenditures and another state reported only 2 \n     beneficiaries received rehabilitation services.\n\nTABLE 1: MEDICAID REHABILITATION SERVICES EXPENDITURES AND BENEFICIARIES\n                           FY 2005 AND FY 1999\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Percent\n             Item                 FY1999        FY2005     Change FY1999-\n                                                               FY2005\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBeneficiaries................     1,207,543     1,645,095           36.2\nExpenditures, Federal and              $3.6          $6.4           77.7\n State (in billions).........\nAverage $/Beneficiary........        $3,020        $3,916         29.7%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS), FY1999 and\n  FY2005, downloaded March 6, 2008. FY2004 MSIS data for Maine were used\n  as an estimate of state expenditures for Rehabilitation in FY2005.\n\n     4.2  Is there clear guidance to states for appropriate \n         billing for rehabilitation services so that states bill \n         on a consistent basis?\n       Guidance for claiming rehabilitation service expenditures \n     and receiving FFP can be found in Section 1901 [42 U.S.C. \n     1396] of the Social Security Act (SSA) which gives states the \n     option to cover rehabilitation services. Section 1905(a)(13) \n     of SSA, and Medicaid regulations [42 CFR 440.130(d)] define \n     rehabilitation services broadly as ``any medical or remedial \n     services recommended by a physician or other licensed \n     practitioner of the healing arts, within the scope of his or \n     her practice under State law, for maximum reduction of \n     physical or mental disability and restoration of a recipient \n     to his best possible functional level.''\n       States may receive more explicit guidance on what specific \n     services may be included as rehabilitation when preparing and \n     submitting state plan amendments to CMS' Regional Central \n     Offices. CMS' Regional and Central Office staff must review \n     and approve all SPAs before a state may add or change a \n     service.\n       In addition, a state Medicaid director letter (SMDL) was \n     issued by CMS in June 1992 (#FME-42) that provided states \n     some guidance on using the rehabilitation option as a vehicle \n     for providing services to mentally ill beneficiaries. This \n     letter reiterated regulatory guidance that rehabilitation \n     services were intended to be ``medical and remedial in nature \n     for the maximum reduction of physical or mental disability \n     and restoration of a recipient to his best possible \n     functional level.'' The letter offered some examples of \n     services that states could cover under the rehabilitation \n     option including: basic living skills, social skills, and \n     counseling and therapy. The SMDL also described examples of \n     services CMS believed to fall outside of the definition of \n     rehabilitation including: vocational training, direct \n     personal care services, case management (case management is \n     covered under a separate benefit option).\n       There have been several attempts to clarify in statute and \n     regulation what activities states may cover as rehabilitation \n     services. These administrative and legislative activities \n     strived to define how rehabilitation service benefits should \n     be used as well as to control or reduce states' \n     rehabilitation service expenditures. For example, the \n     Secretary approved a few states to cover habilitative \n     services in the 1970s and 1980s under the rehabilitation \n     option for individuals with mental retardation. Habilitative, \n     in contrast to rehabilitative services, are intended to help \n     individuals acquire, retain, and improve self-help and \n     adaptive skills, but are not intended to remove or reduce \n     individuals' disabilities. The Secretary later withdrew \n     approval for habilitative services, because the services were \n     determined to not meet conditions to qualify for the \n     rehabilitation benefit.\n       In 1989, with passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \n     Act of 1989 [Sec. 6411(g), P.L. 101-239)], Congress \n     intervened and specifically allowed states that already had \n     received the Secretary's approval to cover habilitative \n     services for individuals with mental retardation to continue \n     to cover these services. Congress disallowed other states \n     from being approved to cover habilitative services for mental \n     retardation.\n     4.3  Is there clear guidance to states so that they can tell \n         when they should be billing Medicaid for rehabilitation \n         services or another program?\n       States need initial CMS' approval for state plan amendments \n     to offer services for rehabilitation. There is limited formal \n     guidance for states in Medicaid statutes and regulations on \n     how to determine when medically necessary services should be \n     billed as rehabilitation services. However, there is some \n     informal guidance that states could utilize from GAO and HHS/\n     OIG reports as well as audits, SPA denials, disallowances, \n     and deferrals (see footnotes in next section).\n       Guidance also is often provided on a state-by-state basis \n     from CMS' Regional Office staff. CMS' Central Office staff in \n     the Center for Medicaid and State Operations also may provide \n     individual state guidance on what services might be claimed \n     as rehabilitation services.\n     4.4  Is there a clear definition for states of what \n         constitutes `rehabilitation'?\n       Section 1905(a)(13) of SSA, and Medicaid regulations [42 \n     CFR 440.130(d)] define rehabilitation services broadly as \n     ``any medical or remedial services recommended by a physician \n     or other licensed practitioner of the healing arts, within \n     the scope of his or her practice under State law, for maximum \n     reduction of physical or mental disability and restoration of \n     a recipient to his best possible functional level.''\n       In 2006, 47 states and the District of Columbia covered \n     rehabilitation services. Rehabilitation services can be \n     difficult to describe because the rehabilitation benefit is \n     so broad that it has been described as a catchall. Services \n     provided under the Medicaid rehabilitation optional benefit \n     span a broad range of treatments from physical rehabilitation \n     to behavioral health and substance abuse treatment, but there \n     may not be consensus on one definition of Medicaid \n     rehabilitation. GAO in particular has attributed confusion \n     about the rehabilitation benefit to the lack of clear \n     guidance and inconsistent enforcement of existing regulations \n     across states and CMS Regions. Some states have been audited \n     and faced subsequent disallowances and claim denials, while \n     other states have been permitted to continue similar \n     rehabilitation claiming practices.\n       Often Medicaid rehabilitation services assist beneficiaries \n     who have mental-health conditions. In one study, nearly 80% \n     of MSIS claims that states classified as rehabilitation \n     expenditures, contained a diagnosis for mental health. \n     Programs like the New Freedom Initiative that encouraged \n     better integration and acceptance of mental health treatments \n     and settings might have led states to utilize Medicaid \n     rehabilitation benefits to reach mentally-ill beneficiaries. \n     Also, state initiatives to close psychiatric facilities may \n     have contributed to a surge in utilization of the Medicaid \n     rehabilitation benefit for providing treatment to individuals \n     with mental illness. Although mental health services are \n     important, even dominant components of states rehabilitation \n     service benefits, they are not the only services encompassed \n     by the benefit. States also utilize rehabilitation to assist \n     beneficiaries with services such as physical, occupational, \n     and speech therapy, as well as other comprehensive services \n     to treat and help individuals recover from substance abuse \n     disorders.\n     5.0 Targeted Case Management (TCM)\n\n     5.1 How do states bill CMS for case management services and \n         how much has it increased recently?\n       In 2006, only Delaware did not cover TCM. Most states \n     report TCM expenditures in their Medicaid Statistical \n     Information Systems (MSIS) data. MSIS data are derived from \n     paid Medicaid claims. In FY2005, six states and the District \n     of Columbia did not report any TCM expenditures in the MSIS \n     data. In addition, states report Medicaid expenditures to CMS \n     to claim FFP using a financial accounting form (Form HCFA-\n     64). The HCFA-64 has a reporting line for targeted case \n     management. In FY2006, total federal and state expenditures \n     for TCM reported on the HCFA-64, were $2.8 billion \n     (individual state-by-state expenditures were not available \n     from this data source). Expenditures reported on the HCFA-64 \n     and MSIS data for the same years can vary considerably, since \n     these systems for capturing and reporting Medicaid activity \n     are independent of each other. HCFA-64 data were for FY2006, \n     while the most recently available MSIS data were reported for \n     FY2005.\n       Medicaid expenditures for TCM have increased rapidly. As \n     shown in Table 2, between FY1999 and FY2005, total federal \n     and state TCM expenditures reported in MSIS more than doubled \n     from $1.41 billion in FY1999 to $2.9 billion in FY2005. For \n     the same period, the total number of beneficiaries increased \n     62.6% from approximately 1.7 million in FY1999 to \n     approximately 2.7 million in FY2005. The average expenditures \n     per beneficiary also increased during the period FY1999-\n     FY2005 rising by nearly 27%, from $834 in FY1999 to $1,058 in \n     FY2005.\n\n TABLE 2: MEDICAID TARGET CASE MANAGEMENT EXPENDITURES AND BENEFICIARIES\n                            FY1999 AND FY2005\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Percent\n             Item                 FY1999        FY2005     change FY1999-\n                                                               FY2005\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBeneficiaries................     1,687,440     2,744,027           62.6\nExpenditures, Federal & State         $1.41         $2.90          105.7\n (in $ billions).............\nAverage $/Beneficiary........          $834        $1,058          26.9\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS), FY1999 and\n  FY2005, downloaded March 6, 2008. FY2004 MSIS data for Maine were used\n  as an estimate of state expenditures for TCM in FY2005.\n\n     5.2 Is there clear guidance to states for appropriate billing \n         for case management services so that states bill on a \n         consistent basis?\n       Guidance for states on appropriate claiming of federal \n     financial participation for TCM can be found in a number of \n     official and unofficial sources including: a 2001 letter to \n     state Medicaid and child welfare directors (SMDL 01-013); the \n     Medicaid statute, Sections 1905(a)(19) and 1915(g) of the \n     SSA; Section 6052 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, \n     P.L. 109-171); Medicaid regulations at 42 CFR Parts 431, 440, \n     and 441 (Sec. Sec. 440.169 for TCM definition); the state \n     Medicaid manual at Section 4302, Optional Targeted Case \n     Management Services--Basis, Scope, and Purpose; CMS' Regional \n     Office staff and CMS' Central Office state representatives; \n     unofficial sources, such as reports from Health and Human \n     Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General and the U.S. \n     Government Accountability Office (GAO); and denials and \n     approvals of state plan amendments.\n       In reviewing states use of contingency contractors, GAO \n     found that CMS has allowed some states to continue to claim \n     for TCM services even though other states were denied \n     approval for state plan amendments for\n\n[[Page S2107]]\n\n     similar proposals to provide TCM services. In addition, some \n     states received disallowances, deferrals, and denials for \n     TCM services, while other states were not audited for \n     similar practices. States received guidance on TCM \n     claiming for foster care in a January 2001 letter to state \n     Medicaid and child welfare directors (#01-013). This \n     letter reiterated the statutory definition of TCM and \n     described services ``commonly understood to be allowable'' \n     as case management including: (1) assessment of the \n     eligible individual to determine service needs, (2) \n     development of a specific care plan, (3) referral and \n     related activities to help the individual obtain needed \n     services, and (4) monitoring and follow-up. Moreover, CMS \n     added that, ``In general, allowable [case management] \n     activities are those that include assistance in accessing \n     a medical or other service, but do not include the direct \n     delivery of the underlying service.'' Although there has \n     been guidance for individual states and some indirect \n     guidance and discussion on TCM claiming, states have \n     received limited written national guidance from CMS.\n       HHS/OIG and GAO have documented what they describe as \n     states' attempts to maximize FFP by claiming additional TCM. \n     These tactics include the use of contingency contractors who \n     allegedly assisted states in exploiting ambiguity in Medicaid \n     statutes and regulations to claim additional FFP. Another \n     tactic CMS and GAO cite that states use to increase Medicaid \n     matching funds is the practice of paying for direct services \n     delivered by staff of other state social services programs, \n     such as schools, juvenile justice, parole, child welfare, and \n     foster care programs. Furthermore, CMS and GAO have cited \n     problems with states' use of cost allocation plans that \n     duplicate claiming for administrative expenses by several \n     programs. CMS has repeatedly cited these abuses as rationale \n     for explicit and comprehensive TCM regulation.\n     5.3 Is there clear guidance to states so that they can tell \n         when they should be billing Medicaid for case management \n         services or another program?\n       States may find guidance on whether services should be \n     billed as Medicaid case management/TCM or as components of \n     other programs: the state Medicaid manual at Section 4302, \n     Optional Targeted Case Management Services--Basis, Scope, and \n     Purpose; a 2001 letter to state Medicaid and child welfare \n     directors [(SMDL 01-013), see reference in previous section]; \n     HHS/OIG audits, such as (A-07-06-03078) [see footnote below]; \n     Sec. 6052 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, (DRA, P.L. \n     109-171); denials and approvals of state plan amendments; and \n     CMS's Regional Office staff and CMS's Central Office state \n     representatives.\n       Although there may be a number of issues related to \n     claiming FFP for Medicaid addressed in these sources, at \n     least two issues have been sources of confusion, \n     misunderstanding, and dispute. One issue where there has been \n     misunderstanding is non-duplication of payments. Guidance for \n     states on non-duplication of payments can be found in the \n     State Medicaid Manual, ``Payment for case management services \n     under 1915(g) of the [SSA] Act may not duplicate payments \n     made to public agencies or private entities under the program \n     authorities for this same purpose.'' States can not receive \n     Medicaid FFP for services provided to beneficiaries who \n     received these services from other state agencies, such as \n     schools, foster care, child welfare, and juvenile justice. \n     However, there has been misinterpretation and disagreement \n     about claiming of a share of administrative costs \n     attributable to other programs where there is overlap between \n     Medicaid and other state programs (e.g., foster care, special \n     education, and juvenile justice). The aforementioned sources \n     advise states to allocate administrative costs between the \n     overlapping programs in accordance with OMB Circular A-87 \n     under an approved cost allocation plan.\n       Another area where there has been some disagreement is over \n     the direct delivery of services by other programs where \n     Medicaid is then charged for the direct services provided by \n     the other program. A letter to state Medicaid directors \n     (January 19, 2001, SMDL 01-013) indicates that FFP would not \n     be available for the direct delivery of services by another \n     program:\n       ``Unallowable services: Medicaid case management services \n     do not include payment for the provision of direct services \n     (medical, educational, or social) to which the Medicaid-\n     eligible individual has been referred. For example, if a \n     child has been referred to a state foster care program, any \n     activities performed by the foster care case worker that \n     relate directly to the provision of foster care services \n     cannot be covered as [Medicaid] case management.''\n       Subsequent HHS/OIG audits recommended that CMS establish \n     policies and procedures to ensure state FFP claims do not \n     include direct medical services.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will start with the public provider \nregulation.\n  We know that in the past, many states used to recycle Federal health \ncare dollars they paid to their hospitals to use for any number of \npurposes beyond health care.\n  It was an embarrassing scam that several administrations tried to \nlimit.\n  This administration has gone a long way towards cleaning that up and \nthe oversight of payments to public providers is part of that effort.\n  I have taken issue at times with the administration's methods. I \ndon't believe they have their public provider definition right in the \ncurrent regulation.\n  That said, simply making the CMS regulation go away opens the door \nfor a return to the wasteful, inappropriate spending of the past.\n  Quoting from the CRS report, ``Under certain circumstances, a state \ncan require providers to transfer funds to the state and because a \nprovider's Medicaid receipts are indistinguishable from other receipts, \neffectively a portion of Medicaid payments may be included in those \ntransfers.''\n  Intergovernmental transfers do have a legitimate role, but it is \ncritical that states have a clear, correct understanding of what is a \nlegitimate transfer and what is not.\n  If the regulation goes away, those lines will still not be adequately \ndefined.\n  Now I would like to turn to the new regulation on graduate medical \neducation. I personally think Medicaid should pay an appropriate share \nof graduate medical education or GME.\n  But I would like to see us put that in statute rather than return to \nthe current customary practice because I don't think the taxpayers are \nwell served by the way Medicaid GME operates today.\n  If we simply make the regulation go away, what are the rules for \nstates to follow?\n  There are five different methods States use in billing CMS, eleven \nStates don't separate IME from GME, and CMS can't say how much they are \npaying States for GME.\n  Let me quote from the CRS memo: ``States are not required to report \nGME payments separately from other payments made for inpatient and \noutpatient hospital services when claiming federal matching payments \nunder Medicaid. For the Medicaid GME proposed rule published in the May \n23, 2007 Federal Register, CMS used an earlier version of the AAMC \nsurvey data as a base for its savings estimate and made adjustments for \ninflation and expected state behavioral changes, for example.''\n  To make their cost estimate for the regulation, CMS relied on a \nreport from the American Association of Medical Colleges to determine \nhow much they are paying for GME in Medicaid. That's because the states \ndon't provide CMS with data on how much they pay in GME.\n  That is simply unacceptable.\n  You can disagree with the decision to cut off GME, but simply leaving \nthe current disorderly and undefined structure in place is not good \npublic policy.\n  Now let me turn to the regulations governing school-based \ntransportation and school-based administration.\n  Is it legitimate for Medicaid to pay for transportation in certain \ncases? I think the answer to that is ``yes.''\n  I do think it is legitimate for Medicaid to pay for transportation to \na school if a child is receiving Medicaid services at school.\n  That said, we should have rules in place that make it clear that \nMedicaid doesn't pay for buses generally.\n  We should have rules in place that make it clear that schools can \nonly bill Medicaid if a child actually goes to school and receives a \nservice on the day they bill Medicaid for the service.\n  You can also argue that the school-based transportation and \nadministrative claiming regulation went too far by completely \nprohibiting transportation, but if making this regulation go away \nallows States to bill Medicaid for school buses and for transportation \non days when a child is not in school, we still have a problem.\n  It is also critical that Medicaid pay only for Medicaid services.\n  We all openly acknowledge the federal government does not pay its \nfair share of IDEA.\n  Quoting from the CRS memo: ``States, school districts, interest \ngroups, and parents of children with disabilities often argue that the \nfederal government is not living up to its obligation to `fully fund' \nPart B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, P.L. \n108-446) (the grants-to-states program).''\n  We can also acknowledge that just because IDEA funding is inadequate, \nStates will try to take advantage of Medicaid to make ends meet.\n\n[[Page S2108]]\n\n  Again quoting from the CRS memo: ``It is generally assumed that such \ntransportation is predominantly provided to Medicaid/IDEA children.''\n  We should define clear lines so that States know what is and is not \nMedicaid's responsibility.\n  Now I would like to turn to the rehabilitation services regulation.\n  I certainly wouldn't argue that Medicaid paying for rehabilitation \nservices is a bad thing. We want Medicaid to help beneficiaries get \nbetter.\n  But States must have a common understanding of what the word \n`rehabilitation' means in the Medicaid program.\n  Again quoting from the CRS memo: ``Rehabilitation services can be \ndifficult to describe because the rehabilitation benefit is so broad \nthat it has been described as a catch-all.''\n  Also, States need clear guidance on when they should bill Medicaid or \nanother program.\n  Again quoting from the CRS memo: ``There is limited formal guidance \nfor states in Medicaid statutes and regulations on how to determine \nwhen medically necessary services should be billed as rehabilitation \nservices.''\n  You can say the CMS regulation went too far, but that does not mean \nthere is not a problem out there.\n  As CRS notes, billing for rehabilitation services between 1999 and \n2005 grew by 77.7 percent. I am far from convinced that all of that \ngrowth in spending was absolutely legitimate.\n  Finally turning to the case management regulation, I first want to \npoint out the issues relating to case management are a little different \nthan issues associated with some of the other Medicaid regulations I \nhave discussed so far.\n  The provision in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) relating to \ncase management received a full review in the Finance Committee, along \nwith Senate floor consideration and conference debate prior to \nenactment of the DRA. This regulation relates to a recently enacted \nstatutory provision.\n  Certainly there is reason to believe that states have been using case \nmanagement to supplement state spending. An example is child welfare. \nThe income eligibility standard for the Federal entitlement for foster \ncare is linked to a pre-welfare reform standard. This means that every \nyear fewer and fewer children are eligible for federally supported \nfoster care. States must make up the difference for these children. \nThis has caused some to believe that states are shifting some of their \nchild welfare costs to the Medicaid program through creative uses of \ncase management.\n  Concern about the inappropriate billing to Medicaid for child welfare \nservices extends back to the Clinton administration.\n  There are some that would disallow most child welfare case management \nclaims from reimbursement from Medicaid. This goes further than I would \nsupport. Children in the child welfare system are arguably some of our \nNation's most vulnerable citizens, presenting with complex and multiple \nproblems. Getting them the proper services requires thoughtful review, \nplanning and management and I believe that Medicaid is the appropriate \nagency to support these activities.\n  On the other hand, driving a child in foster care to a court \nappearance and billing the caseworker's time to Medicaid is not an \nactivity that should be billed to Medicaid.\n  Certainly, the regulations are not perfect. I am not convinced that \nlimiting individuals eligible for case management to one case manager \nwill contribute to the quality of their care and provide for access to \nservices. Requiring case manager's to document their time in 15 minute \nincrements seems overly burdensome and inefficient. Eliminating the \n180-day period to transition from an institution into the community is \ncontrary to a number of provisions supporting home and community based \nservices, including the ``Money Follows the Person'' program, also \nincluded in the DRA.\n  But again let me quote from the CRS memo: ``Although there may be a \nnumber of issues related to claiming FFP for Medicaid addressed in \nthese sources, at least two issues have been sources of confusion, \nmisunderstanding, and dispute. One issue where there has been \nmisunderstanding is non-duplication of payments. Another area where \nthere has been some disagreement is over the direct delivery of \nservices by other programs where Medicaid is then charged for the \ndirect services provided by the other program.''\n  When CMS tried to come up with rules to increase accountability in \ncase management, they had good reason to be trying to provide clarity \nand specificity for states.\n  Surely the answer is not to tell States they are on their own to \ninterpret the case management provision in the DRA.\n  As CRS notes, billing for case management services between 1999 and \n2005 grew by 105.7 percent. With spending growing that fast, we must \nmake absolutely certain states understand how they should be billing \nCMS.\n  Mr. President, the budget resolution provides for 1.7 billion dollars \nto address the regulations.\n  This is only to delay the regulations until the end of March of next \nyear. I know supporters hope that the next administration will pull \nback and undo the regulations.\n  What would it cost if we tried to completely prevent these \nregulations from ever taking effect?\n  Not $1.7 billion that's for sure.\n  It would actually cost the taxpayers 19.7 billion dollars over 5 \nyears and 48 billion dollars over 10 years.\n  It is an absolute farce for anyone to argue that all of those dollars \nare being appropriately spent and that Congress ought to just walk away \nfrom these issues.\n  What we ought to do is insist the Finance Committee to REPLACE the \nregulations.\n  That's what this amendment does.\n  Instead of just making the regulations go away, the Finance Committee \nshould replace them with policy that fixes the problems.\n  Mr. President, that's what we should be doing for the taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, on Monday, the chairman of the Budget Committee talked \nabout the need for adequate funding to fight health care fraud and \nabuse and how they believe the budget accomplishes that.\n  Let me quote:\n\n     We have program integrity initiatives to crack down on waste, \n     fraud, and abuse in Social Security and Medicare. In fact, I \n     received a letter from the Secretary of Health, Secretary \n     Leavitt, thanking us for the program integrity funds that we \n     have included so that he can continue his important \n     investigations to shut down these Medicare fraud operations \n     that he found in Florida and other parts of the country last \n     year and that he is continuing to crack down on.\n\n  What the chairman failed to mention is that Democrat appropriators \napparently do not think rooting out fraud and abuse in the health care \nsystem is a priority.\n  In fact, here is what actually happened last year. Last year, the \nOmnibus appropriations bill gave CMS nearly $39 million less than the \nprior year to fight health care fraud and abuse in the Medicare and \nMedicaid programs.\n  And they cut all the new funding for fighting fraud and abuse--that \nis almost 100 million dollars they took from CMS for fighting health \ncare fraud and abuse. That is an actual cut in funding to fight fraud \nfrom the prior year.\n  The funding we are talking about here is for the Health Care Fraud \nand Abuse Control Program known as HCFAC. The HCFAC Program was created \nin the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and \nis jointly administered by the Department of Health and Human Services \nand the Justice Department. It is intended to help combat fraud and \nabuse in health care programs including Medicare and Medicaid and \nestablishes a national framework to coordinate Federal, State and local \nlaw enforcement efforts to detect, prevent, and prosecute health care \nfraud and abuse.\n  These funds are used to pay for FBI agents, OIG investigators, as \nwell as assistant U.S. attorneys who prosecute fraudfeasors. These \nfunds represent the frontline defense we have for fraud against the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs and pay for themselves in savings.\n  I absolutely agree that CMS must be properly funded. Of course the \nagency needs funding to detect and deter fraud and abuse in health \ncare--there are billions at stake. CMS also needs funding for general \nprogram oversight.\n  Congress actually cut funding last year, yet my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are given to criticizing the job CMS does.\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\n  Just to expand on this, the Finance Committee has had three hearings \nin the last 6 weeks that focused on how well CMS was enforcing the \nrules in Medicare Advantage. During those hearings, some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle were critical of the job CMS \nis doing.\n  For example, in Medicare Advantage, some want to let the States take \nover enforcement of the marketing rules. They say that CMS lacks the \nresources and the experience to do the job.\n  But it is hard to conduct oversight when Congress cuts the money you \nneed to get the job done right--and that is exactly what the other side \ndid. It is a self-fulfilling prophesy. Without the right resources CMS \ncan't get the job done and CMS didn't get the resources. CMS would like \nto improve its enforcement and oversight of Medicare Advantage plans.\n  For Fiscal Year 2009, CMS is requesting $198 million in new fraud and \nabuse discretionary funding. This would be 100 percent more than last \nyear, when there was no funding.\n  The administration plans to use $147 million of the $198 million--or \nabout three-quarters--for the Medicare Integrity Program, which is used \nfor Medicare Advantage oversight. Without these new funds, CMS cannot \nundertake some of the oversight activities Congress believes it should.\n  I agree with my good friend Senator Conrad that Congress must fund \nCMS appropriately to crack down on fraud and abuse. After all billions \nof dollars are at stake. But it also needs to fund CMS appropriately to \nensure that Medicare beneficiaries are well served by those selling and \nproviding Medicare services.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side to avoid last year's mistake, \nwhich was to talk a good game in the budget process but zero out needed \nnew funding in the actual funding bill. But to be blunt, the budget \nresolution is no better on the Medicaid side.\n  Allocating $1.7 billion in the budget to stop CMS Medicaid \nregulations aimed at providing States clarity, stopping inappropriate \nspending and protecting the integrity of the Medicaid Program without \nrequiring any action to replace the regulations is irresponsible.\n  Money spent on fighting fraud and abuse is money saved in the long \nrun. We have seen time and time again that when we invest money in \nfighting fraud, we get lots of dollars back. And rest assured that the \ndeterrent value associated with those actions is significant too--\ncrooks read the papers, and they will think twice when they see someone \nturning in their pinstripe suit for an orange jumpsuit.\n  While Democrats like to talk about how inexpensive Medicare \nadministration is, that is no excuse to fund CMS at such a low level \nthat it cannot actually oversee its own programs so that it can protect \ntaxpayer money.\n  If you want to combat fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid, you \nreally do need to put your money where your mouth is. On this subject, \nthe majority is toothless.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am proud to support the Democratic \nbudget that Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee have so ably put \ntogether. This budget lowers taxes, and it creates or maintains nearly \na half million good-paying jobs here at home.\n  In contrast, the Bush-Republican budget that the President proposed \nlast month promotes the same tired old ideas that got us into this \nfiscal mess in the first place--ideas that have weakened the economy \nand hurt America's middle class.\n  A budget is an expression of values: you choose what to spend your \nmoney on and you choose how much of it to spend now instead of later.\n  As families across America sit down at the kitchen table to create \ntheir own family budgets, they decide what they have to pay for now--\nthe house, the tuition, the heating bills, the gas for the car--and \nthen how much they can spend on other things without going too far into \ndebt.\n  Creating a budget for the Federal Government is very similar. This \nweek the Senate will decide what we have to pay for now--housing, \neducation, energy, and infrastructure--and what we cannot afford \nwithout further burdening our children with our bills.\n  The Democratic budget recognizes that one of the key elements of the \nAmerican economy--the housing market--is in very serious trouble, the \nworst we have experienced since the Great Depression.\n  For most families, the largest monthly expense is the mortgage or the \nrent, and as the housing market crumbles, increasing numbers of \nfamilies are struggling to pay that bill. Our budget takes steps to \nsupport the families struggling in this housing market as well as the \ncommunities that are coping with this crisis.\n  Our budget allows for the four main appropriations within the \nForeclosure Prevention Act, a bill the Senate attempted to debate a \ncouple of weeks ago. We allocate funding for Community Development \nBlock Grants, housing counselors, mortgage revenue bonds, and net \noperating loss carrybacks.\n  The Republicans filibustered that bill. Every Republican but one \nstated very clearly that they do not even think the housing crisis is \nimportant enough for the Senate to talk about. The Democrats are \nproving with this budget that we think it is time to act.\n  The simple fact is that our economy will not fully recover until we \naddress the primary cause of this economic crisis. If families can't \nkeep a roof over their heads, they aren't going to produce much for the \neconomy or buy enough to keep the economy growing.\n  The Democrats will try again to pass this housing bill when we return \nto Washington after the recess, and I hope that our Republican friends \nwill join us in that effort. This bill will help over 600,000 families \navoid foreclosure nationwide--28,000 families in Illinois.\n  The housing crisis goes beyond just those families that are in danger \nof losing their homes. As property and sales taxes flatten when the \neconomy slows down, local governments are stretched thin. It is more \nimportant than ever for the Federal Government to support community \ndevelopment programs that provide funding for critical local housing \nprograms.\n  The Democratic budget includes an inflation-adjusted increase of $68 \nmillion for community development. Compare that to the President's \nbudget. The Bush-Republican budget requested a $932 million cut in \ncommunity development funding.\n  Under the President's budget, my home State of Illinois would lose \nover $40 million in Community Development Block Grants compared with \nthis year, which would have meant that funding would be slashed for \nhousing counseling, abandoned property maintenance, upgrading low-\nincome housing, and many other critical programs--just as communities \nneed funding for these initiatives most.\n  The Democratic budget says no to the President, and instead increases \nthis vital community funding. We must help stabilize the housing market \nin order to help our economy grow, and this Democratic budget will help \nus do just that.\n  With the economy slowing and the unemployment rate creeping higher, \nwe need to provide workers with the best retraining opportunities that \nwe can right now. In the long term, America can only compete \neffectively in the global economy if we develop the best workers in the \nworld. The Democratic budget recognizes both of these realities. The \nBush-Republican budget recognizes neither.\n  Overall, the Democratic budget provides an additional $8.8 billion \nabove the President's request for training and education. Workers who \nare trying to learn new skills and parents who are trying to pay \ntuition bills will all benefit from the investments made by the \nDemocrats in this budget.\n  The budget allows for $414 million in job training, which will help \n165,000 workers build the skills they need to compete in the economy of \nthe 21st century.\n  For many working Americans worried about their current jobs and for \nat least some of the 1.3 million Americans who have been looking for \nwork for longer than 6 months, this funding will provide a little hope, \na little help towards a better job in the future. For students, the \nresolution provides an additional $5.4 billion for the Department of \nEducation, which funds Head Start, No Child Left Behind, and Pell \nGrants to make a quality education more accessible to students of all \nages.\n  Compare that to the Bush-Republican budget. The impact of the Bush-\nRepublican budget on education in my\n\n[[Page S2110]]\n\nhome State of Illinois would be severe. Mr. President, 119,871 Illinois \nelementary and high school students would be left without the full \nservices promised by No Child Left Behind. Nearly 90,000 Illinois \nstudents would be hurt by the President's decision to eliminate \nSupplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, Leveraging Education \nAssistance Partnerships, and Federal Perkins Loans.\n  Mr. President, 10,000 Illinois students would no longer have a safe \nplace to go after school thanks to the President's proposed cuts to \nafterschool programs.\n  The Democratic budget supports the workers of today and tomorrow. The \nBush-Republican budget cares about neither.\n  To create good jobs in America we must invest in industries that \npromise growth in the short and the long term. Green-collar jobs--which \nhelp America reduce its dependence on foreign oil and push us down the \npath of energy independence--represent perhaps the best opportunity for \nmeaningful job creation for millions of Americans over time.\n  The Democratic budget focuses on these jobs by allocating $8.45 \nbillion towards clean energy and another $2.7 billion specifically \ntowards green-collar jobs. This funding will support weatherizing homes \nand office buildings, investing in battery research and development, \ndeveloping wind and biofuel power generation, and much more. And all of \nthose jobs can be created here at home.\n  The Bush-Republican budget? It has a 7-percent reduction in solar \nenergy research, a 27-percent cut in energy efficiency programs, a 79-\npercent cut in weatherization programs, ``intergovernmental'' programs \nto help local and State governments become more energy efficient, and a \nreneging on the earlier commitment for the FutureGen clean coal energy \nprogram in Mattoon, IL.\n  The Democrats believe that green-collar jobs should be the \ncenterpiece of our economy. President Bush and the Republicans \napparently do not.\n  Our budget also provides other forms of critical energy assistance at \na time when the price of oil has reached $110 per barrel. The \nDemocratic budget provides $2.5 billion for families who are struggling \nto heat their homes, $500 million more than the President's request.\n  The Bush-Republican budget proposes to cut LIHEAP funding by $359 \nmillion. In Illinois, 15,000 low-income families and seniors would lose \nheating assistance.\n  That is unacceptable. The Democratic budget invests properly in the \nenergy needs of the country, which supports the long-term strength of \nthe economy and the short-term needs of the people who need it most.\n  The Democratic budget would create nearly 500,000 good-paying jobs \nhere at home, including nearly 20,000 in Illinois. How? By investing in \nour infrastructure.\n  The general rule of thumb in the transportation infrastructure \nindustry is that for every $1 billion invested in roads, bridges, \nairports, and the like, around 47,500 jobs are created. The Democratic \nbudget invests over $10 billion more than the Bush-Republican budget in \nrebuilding our infrastructure, which is good for short-term economic \nvitality and for longer term economic strength.\n  The demand for this funding is readily apparent, from the bridge \ndisaster in Minneapolis last year to the crumbling roadways in Illinois \nand throughout the country. The American Association of State Highway \nand Transportation Officials reported last month that $18 billion worth \nof infrastructure projects were ready to go in 46 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, including 212 projects worth $831 million in \nIllinois. These projects are already designed and approved, and \nconstruction work could begin within 90 days from the moment that \nFederal funding was provided.\n  The Democratic budget would give the go-ahead to put Americans to \nwork on many of these jobs. The Bush-Republican budget would not.\n  Overall, the Democratic budget lowers taxes and balances the budget \nby 2012.\n  Including Senator Baucus's amendment, which I support, middle class \nAmericans would benefit from the extension of the alternative minimum \ntax patch, which will spare 20 million middle-class Americans from \npaying the AMT this year: the child tax credit; marriage penalty \nrelief; the adoption credit; and the 10 percent tax bracket.\n  The Bush-Republican budget, on the other hand, would extend tax \nbreaks that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. Households with annual \nincomes over $1 million would save more than $150,000 a year in tax \ncuts from the Bush-Republican budget, on average.\n  Although this group makes up just 0.3 percent of the Nation's \nhouseholds, its combined tax cuts would exceed the entire amount that \nthe Federal Government spends on elementary and secondary education, or \nthe entire amount that we devote to medical care for our veterans. That \ncertainly doesn't reflect this Senators' priorities, and I don't think \nthat reflects the priorities of most Americans either.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the Democratic budget funds America's \neconomic priorities wisely, without running up more debts that our \nchildren will be forced to pay. Our budget balances by 2012.\n  The Bush-Republican fiscal record is far less sensible.\n  Seven years ago, President Bush inherited the largest budget surplus \nin our Nation's history. Since that time, when both Houses of Congress \nwere mostly controlled by Republican majorities, Federal spending has \nincreased by over 50 percent. The Federal debt has grown by over $3 \ntrillion.\n  Enough is enough. It is time to manage the Federal budget like \nadults.\n  It is time to manage the budget more like families must manage their \nown finances every month around the kitchen table-- pay for what you \nmust, and don't spend what you can't afford. It is time to pass a \nbudget like the Democratic resolution we have before us.\n  I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President. I rise today to recognize the senior \nSenator from Colorado, Mr. Allard, for his service as a valued member \nof the Senate Budget Committee. Senator Allard and I have served \nthrough eight budget cycles together on the Budget Committee. This will \nbe his last budget season as he has decided to retire when his term \nexpires at the end of this Congress.\n  Since he joined the Budget Committee, Senator Allard has been an \nadvocate for fiscal responsibility and a good steward of the taxpayers' \nmoney. I think this was made clear through his contributions this year, \nespecially in the constructive amendments he has offered both in \ncommittee and on the Senator floor. Senator Allard will be missed as an \nimportant voice for fiscal discipline in this body and most notably as \na member of the Budget Committee.\n  I also wish to pay tribute to Senator Domenici, who essentially \ndefined what it means and how to be chairman of the Senate Committee on \nthe Budget. The Senator has announced that he is not seeking to be \nreelected for the sixth time. That means that last week he participated \nin his last markup of a Budget resolution. This week is the last vote \nhe will take on the Senate floor on a committee-reported budget \nresolution.\n  At the start of the 108th Congress, Senator Pete V. Domenici stepped \ndown as the longest serving chairman, and the only Republican chairman, \nin the history of the Senate Budget Committee. Senator Domenici has \neither been the chairman or ranking member of the Budget Committee for \nnearly two-thirds of the committee's 34-year existence.\n  A member of the committee from 1975, one year after its formation, \nSenator Domenici held the chairmanship for 12\\1/2\\ years, and was the \nranking member for 9\\1/2\\ years. During his time on the committee, \nSenator Domenici served with its first chairman, Edmund Muskie, and \nMuskie's brief successor, Senator Hollings in 1980. Domenici first \nbecame the Committee's Chairman in 1981, remaining in that position \nthrough 1986. After serving as ranking member from 1987 to 1994, he \nreturned as chairman in 1995 and served in that role through May 2001. \nOver the years, he has served as the committee's ranking member to \nthree Democratic chairmen: Senators Chiles, Sasser, and Conrad.\n  Looking back over his distinguished career on the committee, Senator\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\nDomenici has been at the center of Federal budgeting. This year he is \nparticipating in his 34th congressional budget cycle. In 1981, he led \nthe effort in the first major use of reconciliation as part of the \nbudget process. He joined Senators Gramm, Rudman, and Hollings in 1985 \nto offer the first major reforms to the 1974 Budget Act. He was in the \nforefront guiding fiscal policy through the dark days of the stock \nmarket crash in the fall of 1987 that led to a major budget summit \nagreement in November 1987. Later he directed and guided the Senate in \nthe budget summit of 1990 that resulted in the Budget Enforcement Act \nof 1990, which remained the basis of fiscal discipline through its \nexpiration at the end of 2002. The pinnacle of his budget leadership \noccurred in 1997 with the historic bipartisan balanced budget \nagreement. Along the way, he helped craft the Credit Reform Act of 1990 \nand the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.\n  For his successors as chairman--first Senator Nickles, and then \nmyself--Senator Domenici's intimate knowledge of the budget process, \nmuch of which he helped invent along the way, and wise counsel have \nbeen tremendously valuable in helping us try to fill his big shoes. \nSenator Domenici will remain a legend whenever people talk about the \ncongressional budget process, and I thank him for his service to the \nSenate and to the country.\n  Mr. President, a little more than a year ago, offices were being \nrelocated, staffs were being reorganized, and Capitol Hill was readying \nitself for the change in majority in the House and Senate. The new \nmajority's leadership and Budget Committee membership immediately set \nout to put in place pay-as-you-go rules that would fulfill Democrats' \npromise to return to ``tough, old-fashioned pay-go.'' What does ``old-\nfashioned'' or ``traditional'' pay-go mean?\n  In November 2005, during debate on a reconciliation bill that became \nthe Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the now Chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee offered an amendment to change the Senate's pay-go \npoint of order and stated, ``Our proposal is to go back to what has \nworked in the past. It is traditional pay-go.'' In March 2006, during \ndebate on the FY 2007 budget resolution, the same Senator again offered \nan amendment to change the Senate's pay-go point of order and stated, \n``This amendment would reestablish the budget discipline that worked so \nwell in previous years, a rule that has been allowed to lapse by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.''\n  These are just two examples. In fact, Democratic Senators have \noffered amendments to reinstate in the Senate ``tough, old-fashioned \npay-go'' to every Republican budget resolution debated since 2004. They \nalso proposed pay-go amendments to the 2005 tax reconciliation bill and \nduring the Senate Budget Committee markup of the Stop Over Spending Act \nof 2006.\n  The Senate pay-go point of order amendments offered by Democrats when \nthey were in the minority were remarkable in their consistency.\n  Every time Senate Democrats offered a proposal to reinstate the \n``tough, old-fashioned pay-go'' point of order, the proposal required \ndeficit neutrality in the first year of the budget, over the sum of \nyears 1 to 5 and over the sum of years 6 to 10. For example, if such a \npoint of order were in place for the 2008 budget resolution, it would \nrequire direct spending and revenue legislation to be deficit-neutral \nin 2008, 2008 to 2012, and 2013 to 2017.\n  Every instance of their proposal also included a cumulative pay-as-\nyou-go scorecard, so that any net savings recorded from an enacted \npiece of legislation could be used to offset the cost of a future piece \nof legislation.\n  Why did Senate Democrats keep returning to the same version of the \npay-go point of order? Because the Senate pay-go point of order was \nbased on the original pay-go law, enacted in 1990 in the Budget \nEnforcement Act. That law put in place a 5-year pay-go scorecard that \nkept track of any accumulated deficit increases from enacted \nlegislation. If, at the end of each year, the net effect of all enacted \nlaws affecting revenues and mandatory spending was to increase the \ndeficit, then the Office of Management and Budget was supposed to issue \na sequestration order--an across-the-board cut of certain mandatory \nspending.\n  Statutory pay-go, in effect, was the original ``first-year'' test, \nenforced by sequestration. In 1993, Senate Democrats created a 5-year \npay-go point of order, for the Senate only, that was based on and \nparalleled the pay-go law but relied on the sanction of a point of \norder instead of sequestration to encourage compliance.\n  But some Members sought to increase spending after the 5-year pay-go \nwindow so they would not run afoul of the initial 5-year pay-go point \nof order. So in a 1994 revision to this initial point of order, the \nSenate added a second 5-year test, which covered years 6 through 10 of \nthe ``budget window,'' to have the point of order cover a 10-year \nperiod instead of just 5 years. Given all this activity on pay-go in \nthe 1990s, some assert that the pay-go concept--without being specific \nabout whether it was the pay-go law, the pay-go point of order, or \nboth--was responsible for reducing the deficit in the 1990s.\n  No question about it--Democrats are on record in support of \ntraditional pay-go, and that support was carried through as a major \ntheme of many 2006 Democratic candidates' campaigns. We have heard \nagain on the floor this week the familiar refrain: ``If you want to \nincrease spending you have to pay for it. If you want to cut taxes you \nhave to pay for it.'' And when Democrats returned to power in the \nSenate in 2007, their efforts appeared true to their past pay-go \nefforts and campaign promises--at first.\n  As one of their ``top 10'' legislative priorities for the 110th \nCongress, the new majority leader along with the new Budget Committee \nchairman introduced S. 10, the Restoring Fiscal Discipline Act of 2007.\n  S. 10 included a provision to install in the Senate the exact same \n``old-fashioned'' pay-go point of order offered so many times over the \nprevious 3 years, as summarized in Table 1. S. 10 was referred to the \nBudget Committee on January 4, 2007, but the chairman has scheduled no \nfurther action.\n  Following the pay-go promise set out in S. 10, the 2008 Senate-passed \nbudget resolution did include the same ``old-fashioned'' pay-go point \nof order requiring deficit neutrality in each of the periods covering \nyear 1, years 1 to 5 and years 6 to 10.\n  In contrast, the 2008 House-passed budget resolution did not include \npay-go budget enforcement because a House pay-go rule had already been \nput in place. The House had never before had any kind of pay-go point \nof order--not until January 5, 2007, when the House agreed to its rules \npackage in H. Res. 6 for the 110th Congress. Title IV of that package \nincluded the first-time-ever pay-go point of order that applies in the \nHouse.\n  The House pay-go rule makes it out of order to consider direct \nspending or revenue legislation that increases the deficit or reduces \nthe surplus over years 1 to 6 or over years 1 to 11. So in the case of \nlegislation considered during 2007, the relevant periods were 2007 to \n2012 and 2007 to 2017; for 2008, the relevant periods in the House are \nnow 2008 to 2013 and 2008 to 2018. Each measure is considered on a \nbill-by-bill basis; savings from one bill cannot be ``banked'' and used \nto satisfy the pay-go requirement for future legislation.\n  When it came time to arrive at a conference agreement on the 2008 \nbudget resolution, there were two good reasons to think that the \nagreement would include the Senate pay-go point of order in the exact \nsame form as was included in the Senate-passed budget resolution, which \nwas the old-fashioned pay-go they advocated for years.\n  First, the pay-go point of order in the Senate-passed 2008 budget \nresolution applied only in the Senate. The House-passed budget \nresolution did not include any pay-go point of order for the Senate or \nthe House because the House already had adopted one. So there was no \nreason for the conference agreement to compromise or deviate from the \nversion in the Senate-passed budget resolution.\n  Further, Senate supporters of ``old-fashioned'' pay-go had repeatedly \ninsisted over recent years and throughout the 2006 campaign on the same \nversion of pay-go contained in the Senate-passed 2008 budget resolution \nand had pledged to return to it if they were in the majority.\n  Apparently, 15 years of Senate Democrats' support for ``old-\nfashioned'' pay-go was expendable when their conferees\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\non the 2008 budget resolution decided that the new, less-stringent time \nperiods for deficit neutrality in the House rule weren't so bad after \nall. Currently, in the Senate's enforcement under the conference \nagreement on the 2008 budget resolution, the relevant time periods for \nmeasuring pay-go compliance are 2008 to 2012, the first 5 years, and \n2008 to 2017, the 10-year period. The year 2007 is no longer included \nin the sum because 2007 is over.\n  But there is no test for the first year, which currently is 2008, and \nthere is no test for just the ``second'' 5 years, which are 2013 to \n2017, aka the 5 years after the first 5 years.\n  The rationale or excuse of the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee for this divergence from the pay-go rule that he had long \npromised was that the Senate wanted to be the same as the House. Of \ncourse that is nonsense.\n  Why does the House get to dictate the form of a point of order for \nthe Senate? The Senate had a pay-go point of order for 13 years when \nthe House never had one. If the Senate wanted to be like the House for \nall those years, the Senate never would have had a pay-go point of \norder in the first place.\n  The Senate has had, and currently has, plenty of points of order that \nthe House does not have or that are different from the House's version \nof the point of order. If the Senate wanted to retain its old, tough \nfirst year test that it had from 1994-2006, it simply could have kept \nit, and all legislation would have had to clear that hurdle before it \ncould be enacted, even if it was tougher than the House rule. This \ndynamic essentially describes the difference between the House and \nSenate anyway, where things can pass the House by simple majority and \nthings almost always need 60 votes to pass the Senate.\n  And if the Senate really wanted to be the same as the House on the \npay-go rule, then why does the Senate point of order not include some \nof the tougher features the House included in the House's new pay-go \nrule as shown in table 2.\n  For example, the pay-go point of order that applies only in the \nSenate as adopted via the 2008 budget resolution conference agreement \nmeasures any deficit effect of each bill against a pay-go scorecard. If \nthe scorecard has a zero or negative balance on it, the legislation \nwould have a pay-go point of order against it, unless the deficit \nincreases are offset in the same measure. If the Senate pay-go \nscorecard has a sufficient positive balance on it, which represents a \nprojected on-budget surplus or net decreases in the deficit accumulated \nfrom previously enacted legislation, then no pay-go point of order \nwould apply against the measure.\n  In the House, there is no pay-go scorecard. Instead, each bill is \nindependently evaluated by whether it increases the deficit, on net, \nover 6 and 11 years.\n  In addition, the House pay-go rule prohibits legislation that \nincreases the on-budget deficit or reduces the surplus; the Senate rule \nonly prohibits legislation that increases the on-budget deficit.\n  Despite their rhetoric about returning to good, old-fashioned pay-go \nenforcement, the Democrats' 2008 budget resolution changed their \npromised, long-sought Senate pay-go point of order to a much easier \ntest that is now in place. Legislation cannot increase the deficit over \nthe sum of 5 years or over 10 years. But for the first time since pay-\ngo began back in 1990, legislation no longer has to be deficit neutral \nin the first year.\n  By throwing the first-year test overboard and swapping the old test \nfor years 6 to 10 for a new 10-year sum, the Democrats' new pay-go \npoint of order has encouraged timing shifts to make legislation look \nlike it is paid for over the near-term, even if it isn't.\n  Consider a simple example starting with table 3A to see how this has \nworked. Under good, old-fashioned pay-go, let's say you wanted to \nincrease spending or cut taxes by $9 billion in 2008 with no budgetary \neffect thereafter. To avoid an old-fashioned, traditional pay-go point \nof order, you would have had to come up with a $9 billion offset in \n2008 so that there would be no net increase in the deficit, which would \nsatisfy the first-5-year test and the first-5-years test.\n  But let's face it--under old pay-go, coming up with an immediate \nreduction in spending of $9 billion this year or increasing taxes by $9 \nbillion this year would be supremely tough. So maybe you defer your \nspending to 2009 instead. Then you don't need an offset in 2008, and \nyou could come up with an offset that reduces the deficit by $9 billion \nover the next 4 years--say by $2.25 billion in each of the years 2009 \nto 2012--and still not have a pay-go point of order, as shown in table \n3B.\n  But maybe you don't even have an offset that is palatable over the \nnext several years. Maybe the only offset you can come up with is to \nextend customs user fees past 2015, when they are currently slated to \nexpire. For this example, table 3C shows that doing so would yield \nabout $3 billion in customs fees in each year 2015 to 2017, for a total \nof $9 billion. Customs user fees have been around since 1985 and will \nlikely continue to be extended forever since they are a favorite \noffset.\n  So under tough old pay-go, customs user fees would not save you from \na pay-go point of order because extending them does not provide an \noffset when you need it--in the first 5 years. Good thing that Senate \nDemocrats threw out old pay-go for a new version that would allow them \nto skip a first-year test and use offsets far in the future, like \ncustoms user fees, to pay for near-term spending as shown in table 3D. \nWhile this example shows the increase in spending in 2009, note that, \nbecause there is no first-year test, this approach would work just as \nwell if you want to do your spending in 2008 instead of 2009.\n  But the trick of using customs user fees--which won't be collected \nuntil 7 years from now--to pay for spending today requires one more \ntweak. While customs user fees will satisfy the 10-year test of deficit \nneutrality, extending these in 2015 still would not satisfy the first \n5-years test, as shown in table 3D.\n  So what to do? Do what many bills have already done in the 110th \nCongress do a timing shift as shown in table 3E. Specifically, tell \ncorporations with assets of at least $1 billion to increase their \ncorporate estimated tax payment due in the last quarter of fiscal year \n2012 by a certain percentage. Also tell corporations that their first \npayment due in fiscal year 2013 should be decreased by the same \npercentage.\n  This progression of examples demonstrates that new pay-go is \nessentially only a 10-year test of deficit neutrality. The stricter \ntests of deficit neutrality in the first year and over the first 5-\nyears have been dropped or emasculated, respectively. The corporate tax \ntiming shift is the linchpin for meeting new pay-go's significantly \nweakened tests in the 110th Congress because it makes it possible to \nsatisfy the first 5-year test when the only real offsets occur near the \nend of the 10-year period.\n  Table 4 shows that in the first session of the 110th Congress, six \nbills were enacted that include the corporate estimated tax shift. The \nInternal Revenue Code now says that corporations must send in $6.8 \nbillion more to the Federal Treasury in 2012. Congress apparently \nthinks that corporations are OK with that, since corporations will send \nin $6.8 billion less in 2013.\n  In addition, there is $8 billion more in corporate tax shifts still \nin the wind, depending on the conference outcomes of the farm bill and \nenergy tax provisions. Is there a point at which corporations say \n``Whoa!''? Perhaps. If the House-passed ``paid for'' AMT patch for 2007 \nhad become law, corporations may have had a hard time shifting nearly \n$32 billion in tax payments from 2013 into 2012.\n  In the past, these timing gimmicks have been occasionally used to \nfill in budget enforcement holes here and there by both Republicans and \nDemocrats. However, in the 110th Congress, it seems like the corporate \nestimated tax payment shift is a required element in every direct \nspending or revenue measure.\n  I am surprised that timing shifts have become so prevalent, \nespecially considering the criticism that the current chairmen of the \nBudget and Finance Committees have both raised in the past.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has argued that timing shifts don't pay \nfor anything. During Senate floor debate on the 2004 highway bill he \nsaid: ``I believe that the spending in this bill, which occurs over six \nyears, should be fully paid for over the same six year period. However, \nI do not believe that\n\n[[Page S2113]]\n\nthe shift in corporate estimated tax payments is the most appropriate \nway to achieve the goal of fully funding this bill over six years. The \nprovision proposed by the Chairman shifts a hole in general revenues \nfrom one year to another.'' He continued: ``I am counting on them [the \nFinance Committee Chairman and Ranking Member] to keep that commitment \nthat in this Chamber, before this bill leaves the floor, that it will \nbe paid for--and not by any timing changes; not by moving corporate \nreceipts from 2010 to 2009, or any funny-money financing, but really \npaid for.''\n\n  The Senator from Montana levied similar criticism. During Senate \nFinance Committee debate on the 2004 highway bill, he said: ``The shift \nin corporate income in one year actually has moved forward, and then it \nis canceled out the next year. This is something that we can work [on]. \nTo be honest, it is not something I am very comfortable with.''\n  Indeed, isn't pay-go supposed to be about ``paying'' for something? \nHow does moving money 3 months forward pay for anything?\n  Supporters of the new pay-go who have bragged on its success \nthroughout 2007 neglect to tell you about an important feature of their \nnew, though not improved, rule. As the examples above demonstrate, \nbecause it no longer has a first-year test, new pay-go allows Congress \nto spend new money immediately, or cut taxes immediately, without an \nimmediate offset.\n  Everything else being equal under our current Federal budget \ndeficits, where does the Treasury go to get the money to pay for the \nnew spending? To the credit markets, of course. Treasury has to go out \nand borrow the money to pay for the new spending or tax cuts today for \nas long as it takes for the offsets to kick in.\n  In the case of the example in table 3E, the offsets for the $9 \nbillion in spending in 2008 do not start coming in until 2015 to 2017. \nThe corporate tax timing shift only moves corporate payments forward by \n1 month, which does not significantly affect Treasury's borrowing needs \nover the next 10 years. The Treasury won't be able to pay off all the \nprincipal amount of $9 billion until the end of 2017. By then, however, \nit will have cost Treasury $4 billion in interest to borrow that $9 \nbillion for 8 to 10 years.\n  Does the new pay-go require that the $4 billion in interest costs be \noffset to satisfy the point of order? No.\n  Pay-go pretends that the Treasury does not have to borrow money in \nthe near-term. But in fact, Treasury has no choice but to add to the \ndebt, at least for many years, to provide for the new spending. If the \n``debt is the threat,'' then why is it so virtuous that new pay-go \nrequires the Treasury to borrow the $9 billion today and pay $4 billion \nin interest financing costs? This adds to the national debt forever the \n$4 billion in interest costs, which will never be offset under new pay-\ngo.\n  By throwing away the discipline of a first-year test that had \ncharacterized all previous versions of pay-go from 1991-2006, the \nDemocrats' current pay-go is now Wimpy's pay-go: ``I'll gladly pay you \nTuesday for a hamburger today.'' What is a first-year test?--any \nspending increase or revenue reduction in the first year of a budget \nperiod had to be deficit neutral and therefore matched in that same \nyear with an offsetting spending cut or revenue increase. But instead \nof a hamburger, Congress wants more spending today.\n  And instead of next Tuesday, Congress has decided to wait at least 5 \nor 6 years before starting to pay for the spending today.\n  Here are some specific examples from the first session of the 110th \nCongress to use in evaluating the actual experience with pay-go.\n  The U.S.-Peru Free Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act was \nsigned into law on December 14, 2007. Over the next 5 years, the free-\ntrade agreement part of the legislation increased outlays by exempting \ncertain goods from customs merchandise processing fees by $27 million \nand reduced revenues through tariff phaseouts by $173 million, for a \ntotal 5-year deficit increase of $200 million. How was the deficit \nincrease paid for? It wasn't paid for in 2008 or 2009 or 2010 or even \n2011 and $465 million of corporate taxes were shifted into 2012 from \n2013. Is it paid for yet? Well, the test for deficit neutrality in the \nfirst 5 years was satisfied, but the shift created a hole in the second \n5 years. How was this hole filled? By our old friend, of course--\ncustoms user fees.\n  Under the law that existed at the beginning of the 110th Congress, \ncustoms user fees were set to expire on September 30, 2014. So far this \nCongress, five bills have been enacted that have extended these fees \nfor 1 week, 2 weeks, and 2 months. The U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement \nincreased the fees for 2 months through December 13, 2014, resulting in \n$485 million additional fee collections in 2015. Subsequently, the \nAndean Trade Preference Extension Act extended the fees through \nDecember 27, 2014.\n  Table 5 illustrates that the only real offset for the new spending \nthat happens in years 2008 through 2015 is the customs user fee \nextension in 2015.\n   The Senator from North Dakota is fond of saying that prior to \nenactment of the 2007 AMT patch in December 2007, there was a \n``surplus'' on the pay-as-you-go scorecard.\n   Consider in table 6 all of the bills with pay-go effects, except the \nAMT patch, that were enacted during the 1st session of the 110th \nCongress. The first line summarizes the pay-go effects of the six \nenacted bills that used the corporate tax timing shift. You can see \nthat bills with the shift increased the deficit in each and every year \nuntil 2012. In 2012, the six bills reduced the deficit on net by $8.7 \nbillion, then increased the deficit by $5.3 billion in 2013.\n   The second line of table 6 summarizes the pay-go effects of all the \nother bills enacted during the first session. You can see that these \nbills increased the deficit in 2008, 2009, and 2010, and only begin to \nreduce the deficit in 2010.\n   The total line shows that in 2007 to 2010, all of these bills \nincreased the deficit by a total of $10.7 billion. Then how can there \nbe a ``surplus'' on the pay-go scorecard? Because of the big, bumpy \ndeficit reduction that takes place in 2012, thanks mostly to the \ncorporate tax payment shifts. If the interest impacts of spend now, pay \nlater were taken into account, there would be only a very small surplus \non the scorecard in the first 6 years and a deficit of $1.5 billion \nover 11 years.\n   Nonetheless, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee is fond of \nsaying, as he did during Senate floor debate on the Food and Energy \nSecurity Act of 2007 on November 16, 2007, that ``pay-go is not full of \nholes . . .[but] don't take my word for it. We can look to the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.''\n   Actually, when you look at the cost estimates that the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office has prepared during the 110th Congress, you \nwill not find one word about pay-go. CBO's job is straightforward: it \nprepares estimates of the budgetary effects of legislation and displays \nthem in each year for a 10-year period. A CBO cost estimate has never \never evaluated whether a House or Senate point of order applies against \nlegislation or determined whether a piece of legislation complies with \nthe budget resolution. That is the job of the chairmen of the House and \nSenate Budget Committees, most often using CBO estimates to inform \nthose determinations, but sometimes using alternate estimates.\n   For example, last year, the House Budget Committee chairman overrode \na scorekeeping rule and directed CBO to score savings for a particular \nprovision in the House farm bill--without this directed scoring, the \nHouse farm bill would have violated pay-go. It was the House Budget \nchairman who decided whether the House pay-go point of order applied \nagainst the House farm bill. CBO did not decide. In addition, it was \nCBO's estimate of the farm bill that let Congress know that some of the \ncost of the Senate farm bill was deferred to after the period of pay-go \nenforcement. So the Senate was dodging pay-go by hiding new spending \nfrom the enforcement period. CBO did not say that the Senate complied \nwith pay-go, nor did it say that the Senate dodged pay-go. But any user \nof CBO's estimates would come to the conclusion that pushing spending \noutside the enforcement window is avoiding pay-go.\n   In addition, CBO does not evaluate the merits of ``policy'' in its \ncost estimates. CBO estimates the budgetary incidence of early sunsets \nand payment shifts exactly as written in legislation, gimmicks though \nthey are. CBO's job is\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\nto simply provide the estimates of budgetary effects year by year. It \nis the budget chairmen who then say ``CBO estimates  this bill reduces \nthe deficit'' while abdicating themselves from responsibility for the \ngimmicks.\n\n   Finally, the Senate Budget Committee chairman likes to point to the \nbottom line of table 6 to illustrate how well pay-go has worked because \nthere was a pay-go scorecard surplus for a brief period in the fall. \nBut was there really a surplus? Over the 2008 to 2012 and 2008 to 2017 \nperiods, respectively, the pay-go surplus was $1.988 billion and $1.311 \nbillion.\n   But what the scorecard omits is a cost of spending now and paying \nlater that the Treasury does not have the luxury of ignoring. Because \nof enactment of all of these bills, the deficit is now increasing by \n$10.7 billion over 2007 to 2010. The Treasury has no choice but to go \nout right now to the credit markets and borrow $10.7 billion, and will \nhave to pay $2.8 billion in interest costs over the next 10 years until \nall the offsets in these bills finally come in and allow the Treasury \nto pay off that borrowing. Not only does that unrecognized interest \ncost get added permanently to the debt, but it is also so large that it \nmore than wipes out the supposed and ephemeral pay-go scorecard surplus \nof just over $1 billion.\n   But another bill wiped out the surplus on the pay-go scorecard \nfirst. The enacted AMT patch increased the deficit by $50.6 billion in \n2008 because it was not offset and it did not comply with pay-go. \nBefore it passed both the Senate and the House without an offset, the \nHouse passed a ``paid for'' AMT patch with the deficit increase in 2008 \nand actual offsets in later years. The House bill only satisfied the \n2008 to 2012 deficit-neutrality test for pay-go by using a corporate \nestimated tax shift of $32 billion from 2013 into 2013.\n   Finally, let me address some of the protestations of the Budget \nCommittee chairman about my criticisms about the spotty enforcement of \nhis vaunted pay-go rule after this past year.\n   For example, I have criticized the gimmick of enacting a one-month \nextension of MILC in the 2007 supplemental in order to get mandatory \nMILC spending in the baseline and avoid pay-go enforcement to the tune \nof $2.4 billion over 10 years. My summary of this gimmick is as \nfollows:\n   The story starts with confusion about how budget rules work. \nConsider a recent example, fueled by misinformation from congressional \nsources, from a daily Capitol Hill publication dealing with a provision \nto extend subsidies to certain dairy farmers--known as the Milk Income \nLoss Contract Program, or MILC--in the House- and Senate-passed \nversions of the 2007 supplemental:\n\n        CBO has not included MILC in the baseline for the new farm \n     bill because [MILC] was scheduled to [expire at the end of \n     August 2007], but [Senator] Kohl said in a release that the \n     extension to the end of . . . fiscal year [2007] ``will also \n     build the cost of the dairy program into the baseline budget \n     for the next farm bill.'' The [House-passed] version [of the \n     2007 supplemental] . . . extends the MILC program for 13 \n     months at a cost of $283 million, but the extension is as a \n     discretionary program, which means CBO would not include it \n     in the baseline. A Democratic House aide said the House did \n     not include it as a mandatory program because under budget \n     rules the bill had to account for the full 10-year cost of \n     the program, which CBO estimated at $4.2 billion. But the \n     Senate did not have that problem because it does not have \n     similar budget rules.\n\n   To understand why this is a confused statement requires \nminitutorials on several facets of budget enforcement history and \nrules.\n   The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 established a two-sided budget \nenforcement system designed to measure the budgetary effects of every \npiece of legislation enacted by Congress and compare those effects \nagainst a standard of enforcement.\n   One ``side'' of enforcement was defined as discretionary spending--\nthat is, spending provided in annual appropriation bills. The \nenforcement standard was discretionary caps or limits set out in law \nfor a period of 5 years. If appropriations for a year exceeded the \ndiscretionary cap for that year, then the Office of Management and \nBudget would order a sequester--an across-the-board reduction of \nappropriations of a sufficient magnitude so that the remaining \nappropriations could fit within the cap.\n   The other ``side'' of enforcement was pay-as-you-go, or pay-go, \nwhich covered all spending provided in all legislation that is not an \nappropriation bill, aka mandatory spending, and all legislated changes \nin Federal revenues. If, at the end of a year, all the mandatory \nspending and revenue legislation enacted by Congress cumulatively \nincreased the deficit relative to the OMB baseline, then OMB would \norder a sequester of mandatory spending. All mandatory spending that \nwas not exempted would be cut across-the-board to achieve savings \ncorresponding to the amount of deficit increase enacted by Congress \nthat year.\n\n  That sounds easy since there are only two kinds of enforcement \ndiscipline to worry about. To make things even easier, the joint \nexplanatory statement of managers in the conference report on BEA \nincluded a list of all accounts at that time that were to be considered \nmandatory. Of course, the universe of spending accounts in the budget \nnever remains static. So to anticipate future changes, as well as the \nlikelihood that Congress may occasionally decide to make changes in \nmandatory spending programs in appropriation bills, or vice-versa, the \nstatement of managers also included the following scorekeeping rule \nnumber 3 in a larger set of scorekeeping guidelines:\n\n       Entitlements and other mandatory programs, including \n     offsetting receipts, will be scored at current law levels as \n     defined in section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act, unless Congressional action modifies the \n     authorization legislation. Substantive changes to or \n     restrictions on entitlement law or other mandatory spending \n     law in appropriations laws will be scored against the \n     Appropriations Committee section 302(b) allocations in the \n     House and the Senate.\n\n  Put another way, rule number 3 means that if an appropriation bill \nmakes a change in what has in the past been a mandatory program, then \nthe appropriation bill is the bill that gets charged with the cost or \ngets credit for the savings. That change is counted against the bill's \ndiscretionary limit, aka the 302(b) allocation.\n  If an authorization bill, which is any bill that is not an \nappropriation bill, makes a change to mandatory spending or previously \nenacted discretionary appropriations, then that authorization bill is \nscored with the cost or credit and that bill is measured under pay-go. \nScorekeeping rule 3 has often been colloquially paraphrased in the \nfollowing way: ``He who does the deed gets charged with the cost or the \ncredit.''\n  So how did this work in practice? Consider in the following table \nsome stylized discretionary caps roughly equivalent to the levels \nenacted for the last 5 years for which BEA discretionary caps and pay-\ngo were in effect. Those statutory enforcement mechanisms expired at \nthe end of fiscal year 2002; similar, but not equivalent, mechanisms \nfor discretionary caps and pay-go that are enforced by points of order \nrather than sequesters have continued in the Senate since then. Last \nyear the House adopted a pay-go point of order for the first time.\n  Assume all the appropriation bills for 1998 provided in aggregate the \nexact level of discretionary spending allowed for that year--$530 \nbillion. Since the enacted level for all appropriation bills did not \nexceed the cap, there would be no sequester.\n  Out of this total, what if the Agriculture appropriation bill for \n1998 included a $2 billion annual increase in a mandatory program that \nhad been created by the agriculture authorizing committee in the 1996 \nfarm bill? Budget experts will recognize this concept as a CHIMP, or \nChange In Mandatory Program. For purposes of scoring the 1998 \nAgriculture appropriations bill, the $2 billion increase would be \nconsidered discretionary spending in every year, even though it was for \nan existing mandatory program, because it was enacted in an \nappropriations bill, not an authorizing bill. This $2 billion increase \nin a mandatory program would not count against pay-go.\n  So where would it count? For 1998, the answer is straightforward--the \n$2 billion cost of increasing the mandatory program in 1998 would count \nagainst the discretionary cap of $530 billion for that year.\n  But what about subsequent years? Since the appropriation bill for \n1998 is only measured against the 1998 discretionary cap, how would the \n``do-er'' get charged for the ``deed'' of increasing\n\n[[Page S2115]]\n\nthe cost of a mandatory program by $2 billion in 1999 and each year \nthereafter? By reducing the amount that the appropriations committee \nwould be able to spend in future years under their discretionary caps.\n  OMB would simply reduce the discretionary cap in each of those \nsubsequent years by $2 billion. In 1999, the $2 billion in higher \nspending on farm bill programs would appear back on the mandatory side \nof the budget, which is known as ``re-basing'' in budget-speak, but its \neffects would not have escaped enforcement because the 1999 \ndiscretionary cap would be reduced from $535 billion to $533 billion \nand so on for as many subsequent years as there are statutory caps. \nUnder this system, no one could get away with free mandatory spending \nby hiding it in a different legislative vehicle to avoid pay-go.\n  When BEA and some supermajority budget points of order in the Senate \nwere about to expire late in 2002, many Senators were concerned that \nthere would no longer be any budget enforcement, especially since there \nwas no budget resolution for 2003.\n  After several failed attempts to extend the statutory enforcement of \nBEA, the Senate settled for adopting S. Res. 304 by unanimous consent \non October 16, 2002. For a 6-month period, until the next budget \nresolution could be agreed to, S. Res. 304 extended the 60-vote \nrequirement for waiving certain points of order, extended the Senate's \npay-go point of order, and applied the pay-go point of order to \nappropriation bills.\n  Why suddenly apply pay-go to spending in appropriation bills? Because \nthere was no budget resolution or deemer for 2003, the chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee did not have a discretionary allocation \nfor 2003 and was concerned that members would want to load up new \nmandatory-type, permanent, automatic spending programs or increases in \nexisting mandatory programs on his appropriation bills to avoid pay-go.\n  If those mandatory programs were enacted in authorizing bills, they \nwould have continued to face a pay-go point of order because S. Res. \n304 also extended the expiration date for the pay-go point of order. \nBut since there was no discretionary allocation for appropriation bills \nfor 2003, there was no budget enforcement for appropriation bills. \nMandatory spending programs attached to appropriation bills would not \nhave to be counted against anything. There would have been no 60-vote \npoint of order to thwart them.\n  In addition to persuading the Senate to adopt S. Res. 304 to \ndiscourage such behavior, the chairmen of the Appropriations Committee \nand the Budget Committee went so far as to issue a warning to members: \nIf a provision to increase a mandatory program for later years was \nsomehow enacted on an appropriation bill, those two chairmen promised \nto see to it that whatever allocation that would have occurred for \nfuture years would be reduced by the amount of the mandatory spending \nadded to the appropriation bills. But remember, there were no longer \ndiscretionary caps set out in law in advance for future years; instead, \ndiscretionary allocations were set on a year to year basis. This saber \nrattling seemed to do the trick, but only temporarily since S. Res. 304 \nexpired on April 15, 2003.\n  For the next 4 years, 2003 to 2006, the only supermajority point-of-\norder tool available to prevent increases in mandatory spending \nprograms from hitching a ride on appropriation bills was the advance \nappropriation point of order. Remember that until very recently, since \nenactment of BEA in 1990, when changes to a mandatory spending program \nare added to an appropriation bill, even if the changes seem mandatory-\nlike, they have been considered as discretionary spending for purposes \nof budget enforcement on that bill.\n  Therefore, budget authority for mandatory spending activities \nprovided for future years in an appropriation bill is considered a \ndiscretionary appropriation. The advance appropriation point of order \nin section 401 of the 2006 budget resolution, H. Con. Res. 95, 109th \nCongress, has included a definition of the term that captures this \nscoring practice: ``the term `advance appropriation' means any new \nbudget authority provided in a bill . . . making general appropriations \n. . . for fiscal year 2007, that first becomes available for any fiscal \nyear after 2007.''\n  With the advent of the 110th Congress and a new chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, however, the Senate Parliamentarians--contrary \nto precedent in the 108th and 109th Congresses--have decided that this \ndefinition of advance appropriation somehow no longer applies to budget \nauthority in appropriation bills when that budget authority results \nfrom changes in mandatory programs. As a result, folks in the Senate \nhave flocked to the 2007 supplemental appropriations bill to augment \ntheir favorite mandatory programs for free.\n  For example, the Senate-passed version of the supplemental included \nthe Wyden amendment, adopted on the Senate floor, that would extend \n``county payments'' under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self \nDetermination Act from 2008 to 2012 at a cost of $2.2 billion. \nProponents of this program, which was initially enacted as a temporary, \ntransitional program in 2000, have fretted for the past several years \nabout the imminent expiration of the program and how they could find \nsufficient offsets to pay for its extension.\n  The proponents were not able to convince the authors of the 2008 \nbudget resolution to include a sufficient allocation to the Energy \nCommittee to cover authorizing legislation to extend the program. But \nadding the extension to the supplemental means they did not have to pay \nfor it under pay-go. The sponsors of the county-payments amendment \nclaimed that they ``offset'' the cost by increasing various revenues, \nbut the revenue provisions add up to only $0.2 billion over 2008 to \n2012, which is $2.0 billion short of offsetting the cost of the \namendment.\n  The amendment did include other provisions that pretended to raise \nrevenues, but those provisions--amounting to $1.4 billion over 2008 to \n2012--had already been incorporated by unanimous consent into the \nsupplemental through the minimum wage amendment, and you cannot use the \nsame offsets twice in one piece of legislation. Regardless of the \namount of the supposed revenue offsets, any revenue increases enacted \nin the supplemental will go on the Senate's pay-go scorecard to be \navailable to be spent on some other authorizing legislation in the \nfuture. Revenues cannot be used to offset spending in an appropriation \nbill.\n  Finally, also consider the confusing tale of MILC. MILC is a farm-\nbill program that makes payments to certain dairy farmers. MILC was \nintentionally scheduled to expire on August 31, 2007, unlike most of \nthe other farm bill programs that were scheduled to expire on September \n30, 2007, with some variation depending on the type of crop. When \nCongress first enacted the MILC Program, it designed it that way on \npurpose so MILC would not be continued in the CBO baseline; \nconsequently, MILC was not continued in the CBO baseline for 2008 to \n2017, while the rest of the farm bill was by and large continued in the \nbaseline.\n  In an authorization bill reported from the Agriculture Committee, an \nextension of MILC for 1 month--making it expire at the same time as the \nrest of the farm bill--would have allowed the program to receive the \nsame continuing-in-the-baseline treatment as the rest of the farm bill. \nBut then that authorization bill and the Agriculture Committee would \nhave had to pay for the extension with an offset for the last month of \n2007 as well as for the subsequent 10 years or else be subject to the \n60-vote scrutiny of the pay-go point of order. Proponents of MILC were \nnot able to convince the authors of the 2008 budget resolution to \ninclude a sufficient allocation to the Agriculture Committee to cover \nauthorizing legislation to extend the MILC Program. But with the option \nof the 2007 supplemental, it appears they did not need to.\n  While a 1-month extension of MILC was added to the Senate \nsupplemental, it is not automatic--contrary to the suggestion in \nSenator Kohl's press release cited earlier--that CBO will ``build the \ncost of the dairy program into the baseline budget for the next farm \nbill.''\n  What happens instead is that CBO consults the chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee on whether the Budget Committee wants CBO to continue \nan expiring mandatory program in the baseline. Note that in the case of\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\ncounty payments mentioned above, the current Budget chairman had \nadvised CBO not to extend the payments in the baseline after they would \nhave expired under the supplemental at the end of 2012.\n  But in the case of the 1-month extension of MILC in the Senate-passed \nsupplemental, the current chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has \ninstructed CBO to parlay that 1-month extension, which cost $31 \nmillion, into a $1.2 billion increase in the 5-year allocation to the \nAgriculture Committee, or $2.4 billion over the 10-year \nenforcement period under pay-go, all without any offset or any 60-vote \nbudget enforcement opportunity.\n\n  The chairman could have just as easily directed CBO not to assume \ncontinuation of MILC in the baseline, which is what Budget Committee \nchairmen have advised CBO to do about MILC in the past and what the \ncurrent chairman did in the case of county payments. That would have \nprevented a $2.4 billion dodge around pay-go. Instead, the chairman \nchose to exempt MILC from the pay-go discipline.\n  The House-passed supplemental also included an extension of MILC, \nalthough it did so without amending the existing MILC law. In contrast \nto the Senate, the House supplemental simply appropriated money to USDA \nto make MILC-like payments to dairy farmers as if MILC were still in \neffect for the 13 months after August 31, 2007.\n  Even so, the distinction made in the news article cited earlier about \nthe House extending MILC as a discretionary program and the Senate \nextending it as a mandatory program is misleading. MILC is by \ndefinition a mandatory program because it was created by an authorizing \ncommittee. However, any changes made to the MILC Program in an \nappropriation bill are considered discretionary for purposes of \nevaluating that appropriation bill for budget enforcement, regardless \nof whether MILC is extended by tweaking language in existing law or by \ncreating parallel new language.\n  Further, the Democratic House aide cited in that article is not \ncorrect that ``under [House] budget rules that [House supplemental] \nbill had to account [with an offset] for the full 10-year cost of the \n[MILC] Program'' if the MILC program were going to be extended for that \nlong. Note that the House supplemental did not ``pay for'' the $283 \nmillion cost of extending MILC through 2008; it just designated it as \nan emergency to avoid budget enforcement.\n  Why was the House aide incorrect? Because the House pay-go point of \norder does not apply to appropriation bills in the House. After the \nHouse adopted its pay-go rule in January 2007, there was some initial \nconfusion and unsettledness about which legislation its pay-go rule \nwould apply to. But now it is clear that the House pay-go rule applies \nto authorization bills only.\n  The House appropriators, however, do not want their bills to become \nthe vehicle of choice to carry increases in mandatory spending programs \nthat cannot find offsets in authorization bills to fit under the House \npay-go rule. So, it is only the persuasive jawboning by interested \nparties, such as the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, \nthat has thus far been able to keep House appropriation bills nearly \nfree and clear of multiyear changes in mandatory spending.\n  At least the House seems committed as a matter of practice, even if \nnot as a result of its rules, to preventing its appropriation bills \nfrom becoming a huge loophole for avoiding pay-go enforcement. However, \nthe Senate has shown no such restraint since it added $4.6 billion in \nmandatory spending increases over the next 10 years for county payments \nand MILC alone to its version of the 2007 supplemental.\n  There is a way to close this pay-go loophole. One way would be to \nreinstate the enforcement of pay-go for appropriation bills that the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee succeeded in providing for six \nmonths in 2002 to 2003 through S. Res. 304. The Appropriations \nchairman, however, now opposes that approach.\n  Another way would be if the conference report on the 2008 budget \nresolution had included an amendment offered by the chairman of the \nBudget Committee and myself, which was adopted by UC during Senate \ndebate on that budget resolution. The amendment would have created a \n60-vote point of order against net increases in spending for mandatory \nspending programs on an appropriation bill.\n  In fact, the conference report did include a weakened version of the \nGregg-Conrad point of order that the Senate passed. But that weakened \npoint of order exempted the 2007 supplemental. So there was no 60-vote \npoint of order available to strip the MILC provision out of the \nsupplemental. The Budget Committee chairman's excuse is that he did not \nwant to change the rules in the middle of the game while the \nsupplemental was being considered at the same time as the 2008 budget \nresolution.\n  But this is nonsense. If the MILC provision had instead been in an \nauthorizing bill at that time, the pay-go point of order that was \nalready in place in the Senate would have made it possible to subject \nthe MILC provision to 60-vote scrutiny. That was the rule already in \nplace at the time. By hiding the MILC provision in the supplemental and \ngetting the Parliamentarian to change the precedent on what constituted \nan advance appropriation, that was changing the rules in the middle of \nthe game in order to protect the MILC provision and, even more \nimportantly, to stock the farm bill baseline with $2.4 billion more in \nspending that would never be subject to pay-go.\n\n  Some other things that the Budget chairman has wrong about pay-go are \nas follows.\n  He said this week that pay-go matters only when bills are enacted. \nThis is exactly the opposite of the truth. Pay-go is a point of order. \nA Senator cannot raise a point of order after a bill has been enacted \ninto law. The pay-go point of order is only worth anything when the \nSenate considers a bill before sending it on to conference; seldom do \nconference reports get blown up by a point of order.\n  The chairman also said pay-go has been defended nine times since the \n2008 budget resolution was put in place and that it was never waived, \nso that is an indication of how successful and wonderful it has been. \nBut I count only eight times that a pay-go point of order was raised \nsince adoption of the 2008 budget resolution conference report, and in \neach and every instance it was raised against amendments offered to \nbills brought to the floor. The pay-go point of order has not yet been \nraised in its current incarnation against any of the several bills \nbrought to the floor that by themselves violated pay-go.\n  The Budget chairman is defensive about pay-go. He should be. The pay-\ngo he defends is not the pay-go that he promised for years that we \nwould have if only his party were in charge. Now that he is in charge, \npay-go is watered down and incredibly easy to gimmick or avoid.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the tables to which I have referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            TABLE 1.--PROPOSED PAY-GO AT START OF THE 110TH CONGRESS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     S. 10                            House (H.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the information of all Members, we will \nnot be in session today. We will have final passage. I said this just a \nfew minutes ago, but it really speaks volumes. This bill has been \nmanaged in a very professional way, and we appreciate the good work.\n  We will be out now for 2 weeks. There will be no votes on Monday, \nMarch 31, but there will be votes--it is more apropos to what we have \ndone today--on April Fools' Day, April 1. We are going to have votes \nbefore lunch on Tuesday, April 1. We will have votes before lunch. So \neveryone should be advised there will be votes before noon on Tuesday. \nI hope everyone will keep that in mind and have a happy and successful \n2-week break period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I know everybody wants to head off quickly, \nbut I have to take a minute to first thank Senator Conrad for his \nprofessionalism in leading this bill. Although we disagree, I greatly \nadmire the way he managed this bill. He did an extraordinary job.\n  I also thank his staff, led by Mary Naylor. They are extremely \nprofessional. Everybody's staff around here spends extraordinary time, \na lot of time away from family. We thank them for everything they have \ndone.\n   In particular, I wish to thank all my staff, first and foremost, \nDenzel McGuire, who wears many hats for me. In addition, the rest of my \nBudget Committee staff have worked tirelessly:\n        Cheri Reidy, Allison Parent, Jim Carter, David Fisher, Jay \n     Khosla, Melissa Pfaff, Liz Wroe, Amy Tenhouse, Matt Giroux, \n     Nancy Perkins, Kevin Bargo, Greg McNeil, Mike Lofgren, Betsy \n     Holahan, Emma Post, David Myers, Jim Hearn, Giovanni \n     Gutierrez, Winnie Chang, and David Pappone.\n\n  I wish to acknowledge that this is the last budget in which Pete \nDomenici--regrettably, he is not here right now--will participate. He \nis, obviously, the father of the budget process, along with Senator \nByrd. His commitment to this budget process is extraordinary, and his \nimpact on this Congress is extraordinary. I wanted to acknowledge that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first, thanks to all of our colleagues for \ntheir extraordinary patience. I thank Senator Gregg, the ranking \nmember, for being so decent, reasonable, and fairminded. I think that \nhelped the process.\n  Special thanks to my staff director, Mary Naylor, John Righter, Joel \nFriedman, and Lisa Konwinski. I also thank Steve Bailey, Jamie Morin, \nMike Jones, Joan Huffer, Jim Miller, Jim Esquea, Cliff Isenberg, Sarah \nKuehl, Robyn Hiestand, Brodi Fontenot, Matt Salamon, Kobye Noel, Steve \nPosner, Stu Nagurka, David Vandivier, Anne Page, Jackie Keaveny, Josh \nRyan, Ben Soskin, and Brock Ramos. I will just say they have worked \ntirelessly 7 days a week for months.\n  I also want to give great regard to Senator Gregg's staff, led by \nDenzel McGuire--a truly professional team.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to everyone. Everyone, please be \npatient.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on this vote, I have a pair with the \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.

Mr. President, this week, as the Senate debates proposed \nchanges to the budget resolution, our minds are focused keenly on the \npros and cons of various amendments and on the consequences of the \nbudget resolution for the authorization and appropriations process that \nlies ahead. We have much to do this year, and less time than usual in \nwhich to do it.\n  Personally, I am glad to be back amid the controlled chaos of the \nannual budget debate. As many people know, I fell last week. \nFortunately, I only gave my back a good wrench, but my family and my \ndoctors insisted on a lot of care and physical therapy, which was both \ntherapeutic and frustrating. I do not like to be poked and prodded and \ncajoled any more than the next person, especially after I begin to feel \nbetter and am ready to get back to work. Nevertheless, the rest did let \nme spend a little time staring out the windows, watching the beauty of \nspringtime steal across Washington. I hope that each of my colleagues \nwill have a chance to enjoy the springtime show as the Senate breaks \nfor the Easter recess.\n  This year, the vernal equinox falls in the middle of the Easter Holy \nWeek, on Maundy Thursday. Therefore, the first day of spring is also \nthe day that marks the Last Supper between Jesus and his disciples, the \nevening before the crucifixion Good Friday and the miracle of \nresurrection on Easter Sunday. It is fitting that the dawning of the \nspring and the resurrection of Christ occur in close conjunction. Both \nevents celebrate renewal and rebirth, the awakening of new life. I, \ntoo, feel a sense of renewal this year, of restored health and energy \nthat only enhances my usual affection for the springtime of year.\n  I welcome spring with the words of the English poet, William Blake \n(1757-1827) in his poem, ``To Spring:''\n\n     O thou with dewy locks, who lookest down\n     Through the clear windows of the morning, turn\n     Thine angel eyes upon our western isle,\n     Which in full chorus hails thy approach, O Spring!\n\n     The hills tell one another, and the listening\n     Valleys hear; all our longing eyes are turn'd\n     Up to thy bright pavilions: issue forth\n     And let thy holy feet visit our clime!\n\n  Next week, as Christians step through the liturgical calendar of \nEaster, observing and commemorating great events of two millennia past, \nthe occupants of the northern hemisphere also count down the days to \nSpring. In these first warm and fragrant days, we can most fully \nappreciate the beauty of the season, so easily compared to the cold and \nwet weather of the previous weeks. With each trumpeting daffodil, each \nnodding crocus, each arching branch of yellow forsythia, and each \ndainty petal of blooming pear and cherry tree, we find the undeniable \nevidence of the approaching season. In the ever-lengthening evening \nlight, we spy the house wren flitting about as she seeks a sheltered \nspot to build her nest. We hear, clear and strong, the first evening \nchorus of frogs, a song that will be lost in the background noise later \nin the season. But this week, we hear it ``a capella,'' unaccompanied \nby the evening singing of crickets and the hum of air conditioners on \nhot summer evenings.\n  Each sign of spring, each glory of the Easter-tide, is a gift from \nthe Creator, a promise made to each of us that there is life after \ndeath, and beauty after the dark days of winter. I urge my colleagues \nin the Senate and those listening at home to step outside and revel in \nthe glory and the beauty of spring.\n  Mr. President, I close with a poem by the great American poet, Robert \nFrost (1874-1963), called ``A Prayer in Spring.'' I thank my colleagues \nfor their many kind wishes for my renewed health.\n\n     Oh, give us pleasure in the flowers to-day;\n     And give us not to think so far away\n     As the uncertain harvest; keep us here\n     All simply in the springing of the year.\n\n     Oh, give us pleasures in the orchard white,\n     Like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night;\n     And make us happy in the happy bees,\n     The swarm dilating round the perfect trees.\n\n     And make us happy in the darting bird\n     That suddenly above the bees is heard,\n     The meteor that thrusts in with needle bill,\n     And off a blossom in mid air stands still.\n\n     For this is love and nothing else is love,\n     The which it is reserved for God above\n     To sanctify to what far ends He will,\n     But which it only needs that we fulfill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2119-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2119-S2120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. HARRY CARLOSS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good \nfriend and respected Kentuckian, Dr. Harry Carloss. Dr. Carloss has \nworked diligently for over 32 years to treat thousands of his patients \nwho face one of life's most terrible illnesses, cancer.\n  Originally from Lexington, KY, Dr. Carloss went to the University of \nLouisville Medical School and later worked at the Scripps Clinic and \nResearch Foundation in San Diego, CA. Dr. Carloss, along with and his \nwife Barbara, returned a few years later to Kentucky and settled in \nPaducah to practice as an oncologist. Dr. Carloss worked in Paducah for \n28 years, choosing to help those who oftentimes were facing a death \nsentence.\n  Along with helping his patients, he became a point man in the \ncampaign to battle cancer. He has written medical scientific papers, \nbeen involved in many research and clinical trials over his career, and \nbeen given numerous accolades in the form of honors and awards from his \npeers.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring a man who \nworked tirelessly and gave so much of himself to the people he served. \nRecently the Paducah Sun published a story about Dr. Harry Carloss, \nwhich admirably illustrates the work, sacrifice and commitment Dr. \nCarloss gave to his patients, and to finding a cure for cancer. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be included in the \nCongressional Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Paducah Sun, Mar. 12, 2008]\n\n Carloss Standing Down--After a Reluctant Withdrawal, Combatant in War \n                    on Cancer Looks Back on Campaign\n\n                          (By Steve Vantreese)\n\n        Paducah, Ky.--A cancer doctor dying of cancer--that sort \n     of story has a dark irony.\n        In the case of Paducah oncologist Harry Carloss, happily \n     it isn't true.\n        ``I've heard the rumor,'' he said, not particularly \n     offended. ``I don't have cancer. I have physical limitations \n     that forced me to retire.''\n        Instead of his primary foe over 32 years as a cancer \n     fighter, a fall from a ladder stopped the 57-year-old Carloss \n     in his oncological tracks. He broke his back, had it \n     surgically repaired as best as could be done--ruined spinal \n     parts removed, at least--and now is debilitated. Not dead, \n     not totally paralyzed, both of which he could have been. Just \n     limited.\n        He returned to his practice after injury and surgery, but \n     found after a trial period that he couldn't remain on his \n     feet for any length of time, or sit in most circumstances, \n     for that matter. He makes little reference to ongoing pain, \n     loss of sensation and difficulties in walking that came with \n     the nerve damage.\n       ``Other people have far worse problems,'' Carloss notes in \n     self-deferring fashion.\n        He's seen enough to know. As once the sole oncologist in a \n     void west of Louisville, south of St. Louis and north of \n     Nashville, Carloss saw a steady parade of patients in dire \n     straits.\n        The Lexington native and University of Louisville medical \n     school graduate went to the Scripps Clinic and Research \n     Foundation (San Diego, Calif.) to work in primarily \n     hematology. He and his wife, Barbara, returned to Kentucky, \n     coming to Paducah as a smaller town in which to raise their \n     kids.\n        ``I came here to be an oncologist, but I had doubts at \n     first that a town the size of Paducah could support an \n     oncologist,'' Carloss said. ``That turned out to be the joke \n     of the century.''\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\n        In the 28 years that he practiced in Paducah, Carloss \n     treated thousands. When he recently had to cease practice, he \n     found that he had approximately 3,000 current patients on \n     chemotherapy who shifted their cases to other physicians' \n     care.\n        Even though cut short by result of accident and injury, \n     Carloss can still claim a lengthy practice in a field that \n     often doesn't produce long runs.\n       ``Thirty-two years is a long time to practice as an \n     oncologist,'' Carloss said. ``There is a high burnout rate. \n     Most doctors who do this end up in research or something \n     outside seeing patients every day.''\n        One reason is that there is extra emotional burden in \n     specializing in the care of people who in many instances are \n     fatally ill.\n        The position of the oncologist has improved through the \n     years as medicine has, yet there is still the excess baggage \n     that comes from serving some of the sickest people.\n        ``Their problems become your problems,'' Carloss said. \n     ``Especially during the early years of my practice, before \n     medicine evolved as much, many cancers were just a death \n     sentence.\n        ``The stuff we had to use for chemotherapy would either \n     kill you or cure you,'' he said. ``It has to attack cancer \n     cells, but it attacked white blood cells, too. We now have \n     antidotes that chemo patients get to keep their white cell \n     levels from dropping.\n       ``There are lots of things we have to battle cancer now \n     that we didn't have then,'' Carloss said. ``And over the \n     years the mortality for cancer has gone down. It's become \n     more of a chronic disease than a death sentence.''\n        That has eased Carloss' burden of fighting what too often \n     seemed a losing battle. More clear wins against cancer \n     certainly helped, but he also has learned to benefit \n     patients--and himself--with relative, mitigated victories.\n       ``I discovered pretty early that I couldn't fix \n     everything,'' he said. ``What I learned is, while I might not \n     be able to save somebody, there are things I could do. I \n     might give them more time, make sure they had less pain and \n     improve the quality of the life they had left.''\n        Carloss said fairly early in his practice he got help in \n     dealing with losses, assistance that came from dying men.\n       ``I explained to one man that he was terminally ill and \n     offered him a chance to take part in some research,'' Carloss \n     said.\n       ``He really didn't show any emotion and I wasn't sure he \n     understood, so I explained his situation again--and still no \n     emotion.\n       ``Then he told me that he'd landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day \n     and everybody in his group was killed but him,'' he said. \n     ``He figured that everything he'd done since that day was a \n     bonus. And he said if he could do anything that would help \n     somebody else with the time he had left, he'd be glad to.''\n        A young man told Carloss that there was a blessing in his \n     cancer as opposed to a fatal heart attack.\n       ``He said at least he had time to correct his mistakes and \n     say his good-byes to people,'' Carloss recalled.\n        Carloss doesn't regret the emotional expenditures from his \n     past practice. He does have some sore spots about some of its \n     frustrations.\n       ``Because of the way treatment is paid for, all services \n     aren't available to everybody,'' Carloss said.\n        He said Medicare regulations and the resulting insurance \n     coverage parameters are such that every cancer patient simply \n     cannot get access to some of the drugs that might be \n     beneficial.\n       ``Now drugs have become so expensive that reimbursement \n     drives what can be used for a patient,'' Carloss said. ``I \n     could, or I used to could write you a prescription for a drug \n     that would cost you $72,000 for a year's supply. There are \n     drugs available that nobody can afford.\n       ``That's the part of the practice that I don't miss,'' he \n     said. ``Before, in the first 25 years of my practice, if \n     there was a drug out there, I could use it for a patient and \n     it would be paid for. We never turned anybody away if they \n     didn't have the money.''\n        Beyond patient care in small town America, Carloss has \n     been a point man in the campaign to counter cancer.\n        He has been involved in a wealth of research and clinical \n     trials through the years. He likewise has been a prolific \n     writer of medical scientific papers.\n        Carloss' honors and awards among medical peers have \n     stacked up through his career. His foremost recognition may \n     be his selection for mastership in the American College of \n     Physicians, which comes only for those cited for exceedingly \n     stellar career achievements.\n        Carloss, a plain talker might say, had a lot of irons in \n     the fire. His injury-forced retirement was such an abrupt \n     change in schedule, the reversal of pressure was so extreme \n     that it might have produced the bends in a mental sense.\n        Long days of life and death decisions were suddenly \n     switched over to longer days of no particular commitments.\n       ``I had lots of people that I was taking care of, and it \n     took me two months to stop calling the office every day to \n     check on them,'' he said. ``I solve problems during the \n     night, and it took me two months before I could sleep through \n     the night and not be lying there working things out in my \n     head.''\n        The demands of the career don't seem to have taken a \n     regrettable toll, however.\n       ``If I could do it all over tomorrow, I'd do it again,'' \n     Carloss said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2120-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO THE MOUNT SAINT JOSEPH CONFERENCE AND RETREAT CENTER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor an organization \nthat has contributed greatly to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and its \ncitizens. The Mount Saint Joseph Conference and Retreat Center \ncelebrates its 25th year of service this year. The center has been a \nlong time contributor to the State and the community in western \nKentucky surrounding Maple Mount.\n  In 1983, after many years as a boarding school, the Ursuline Sisters \nof Mount Saint Joseph made a difficult, yet promising decision to close \nits educational facilities. That led to the opportunity to develop the \ncenter into a modern facility. After much thought and prayer, the \nsisters that so dedicatedly ran the boarding school worked to transform \nit and its surroundings into a retreat center offering programs and \nmeeting spaces for businesses and organizations.\n  Since the renovation 25 years ago, the Mount Saint Joseph Conference \nand Retreat Center has focused on spirituality, the arts, and \nenvironmental education. Each year, 500 students visit the center to \ntour the surrounding farm and learn good stewardship of the Earth. \nGroups from churches and businesses frequent the center, which contains \nliving quarters and a cafeteria.\n  Not only does the center add to the mental and spiritual well-being \nof the people of western Kentucky, it works to preserve the environment \nas well. Through the dedicated leadership of Sister Amelia Stenger, \ndirector of the center, the Ursuline nuns have made it their mission to \neducate the community about the environment. In so doing, they have \nbuilt one eco-friendly home out of straw and now plan to rebuild a home \nusing several energy-saving measures.\n  They plan to build a ``near-zero'' home that uses no outside sources \nof energy in western Kentucky. Sister Stenger pioneers these efforts \nafter a visit to Austria, where she toured various conservation efforts \nthere. This house will be called the Casa del Sole Environmental \nEducation Center. The name is Italian for ``house of the sun,'' and for \nthe Ursulines it also refers to Jesus Christ.\n  The service and selflessness of Sister Stenger, three previous \ndirectors, and the center's staff has contributing much to those who \nvisit the center every year and to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in honoring the Mount Saint Joseph Conference \nand Retreat Center for 25 years of service in the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2120-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2120-S2121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HOUSE CONSIDERATION OF FISA LEGISLATION\n\n   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the House of Representatives for \ndebating its amendment to the Senate's FISA Amendments Act of 2007. \nThis is a step forward and a good bill.\n   The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is intended to protect \nboth our National security and the privacy and civil liberties of \nAmericans. This law was passed to protect the rights of Americans after \nthe excesses of an earlier time.\n   The FISA Amendments Act of 2007 that passed the Senate had a number \nof serious failings and did not adequately protect the privacy and \ncivil liberties of Americans with this sweeping new surveillance. I had \nhoped that the Senate would incorporate improvements that had been \nreported by the Senate Judiciary Committee and that I and other \nSenators offered as amendments on the floor. It did not. Instead, \nhaving gotten exactly the bill they wanted from the Intelligence \nCommittee, the administration threatened of Presidential veto if any \nfurther improvements were made. The Senate bill was flawed.\n   The House leadership understood that under our constitutional system \nof government, Congress gets a say in legislation. For the last month \nthe House has worked with 4 Senators and sought to work with \ncongressional Republicans and the administration to fashion a \nreasonable compromise between its earlier legislation, the RESTORE Act, \nwhich passed last fall, and\n\n[[Page S2121]]\n\nthe Senate's bill. Unfortunately, congressional Republicans and the \nadministration have refused to engage in meaningful discussions or \nnegotiations about the legislation. It has been their position that the \nSenate's bill must be the end of all discussions, and the House must \nsimply accept it. I commend the House leadership for upholding our \nlegislative tradition and allowing Congress to act as a separate and \nequal branch of the Federal Government. The Constitution provides in \narticle I for Congress to write the laws and in article II for the \nexecutive to faithfully execute them- not the other way around.\n   The administration has engaged in all of its usual scare tactics to \ntry to bully the House into accepting the Senate bill. First, they \nrefused to allow an extension of the Protect America Act, thereby \nallowing it to expire. Then, they tried to convince the American people \nthat the expiration put Americans at risk--and somehow that was the \nDemocrats' fault. It was not true, of course; the expiration of the \nProtect America Act put nobody at risk because the orders entered under \nthat act remain in force for a year. And it is the White House and \ncongressional Republicans who have repeatedly refused to extend the \nProtect America Act. And they have ensured delay by refusing to allow \nthe appointment of conferees so work on the bill can move forward. \nThese are just more in a long line of administration attempts to \npoliticize national security in order to shield itself from \naccountability.\n   Despite the failure of the administration and the Republican Members \nof Congress to discuss the bills, the House engaged in intensive, \nproductive bicameral discussions and produced a compromise bill that \nimproves on both the Senate bill and their earlier efforts. It adds to \ntitle I of the bill several protections that I urged in the Senate. \nVery importantly, it includes a requirement that inspectors general, \nincluding the Department of Justice inspector general, conduct a \nthorough review of the so-called terrorist surveillance program and \nreport back to the Congress and, to the greatest degree possible, the \nAmerican people. This is a key measure to finally require \naccountability from this administration. We have not yet had anything \nclose to a comprehensive examination of what happened and how it \nhappened. We cannot expect to learn from mistakes if we refuse to allow \nthem to be examined. As an additional accountability mechanism, the \nHouse bill would establish a bipartisan national commission to \ninvestigate and report on the administration's warrantless surveillance \nactivities.\n   The House bill also strengthens the exclusivity provision from the \nSenate bill by mandating that, absent specific statutory authorization, \nFISA is the exclusive means to conduct electronic surveillance. This \nprovision makes clear that the Government cannot claim authority to \noperate outside the law--outside of FISA--from legislative measures \nthat were never intended to provide such exceptional authority. This \nadministration argues that the Authorization for the Use of Military \nForce, AUMF, passed after September 11, justified conducting \nwarrantless surveillance of Americans for more than 5 years. That is \nnot what was intended. With enactment of this strengthened exclusivity \nprovision, we should not see similar arguments of circumvention in the \nfuture.\n   The House bill would also clarify that the Government may not use \nthis new authority to target Americans indirectly when it cannot do so \ndirectly. The administration says it will not do that, but the Senate \nbill does nothing to prevent it.\n   Finally, and critically, the House bill would not grant blanket \nretroactive immunity. This administration violated FISA by conducting \nwarrantless surveillance for more than 5 years. They got caught, and if \nthey had not, they would probably still be doing it. When the public \nfound out about the President's illegal surveillance of Americans, the \nadministration and the telephone companies were sued by citizens who \nbelieve their privacy and their rights were violated. Now, the \nadministration is trying to get this Congress to terminate those \nlawsuits in order to insulate itself from accountability.\n   The House bill does, however, address the concerns of the carriers \nwho are defendants in those lawsuits that they are prevented from \ndefending themselves because the administration is asserting the State \nSecrets privilege over the subject matter of the litigation. The bill \nprovides mechanism for the companies to present their defenses in \nsecure proceedings in the district court. I think this is a fair \nprovision.\n   I have been very disappointed by the failure of the administration \nand congressional Republicans to participate in important discussions \nabout this bill. I applaud the House for its significant efforts. It \nhas passed a good bill.\n   Republicans in Congress and the administration now have a choice: If \nthey are concerned with a delay in authority, they should help the \nHouse, and in urn the Senate, pass the improvements to FISA that the \nHouse amendment contains and replace the expired Protect American Act \nprovisions and do so immediately. Having rejected the extension of the \nProtect America Act and allowed it to expire before the last \ncongressional recess, I hope that they will join in supporting the \nHouse amendment to restore the additional tools this measure would \nprovide without further delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2121-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, April 11, 2008 marks the 40th anniversary \nof the enactment of the Fair Housing Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1968. Signed into law just 1 week after the assassination of Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr., the bill made discrimination in the sale and \nrental of housing illegal based on a person's race, color, religion, \nsex, or national origin. This act opened doors of opportunity. It was a \nbig step towards eliminating discrimination in housing and to providing \nfair housing.\n  Dr. King's inspiring message of equal opportunity for every person \nand the commitment to change views and attitudes is embodied in the \nFair Housing Act. As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of this historic \nlegislation, we must reaffirm our commitment to ensure that every \nperson has equal access to housing.\n  I want to commend the Iowa Civil Rights Commission and the 25 local \ncommissions across Iowa for their advocacy of housing opportunities for \nall of our citizens. These commissions provide comprehensive community \neducation, public outreach, investigation, mediation, and training to \nfoster fair housing by enforcing local, State, and Federal fair housing \nlaws.\n  I would encourage my fellow Members of Congress to support a \ncommitment to fair housing by strengthening laws against predatory \nlending practices, racial segregation, and restoring rights for persons \nwith disabilities under the ADA.\n  On this 40th anniversary, we can celebrate many victories, but, \nunfortunately, housing discrimination still occurs. We still have many \nbattles to be fought in our march towards a future where there is \njustice and housing opportunities for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2121-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2121-S2122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FIREARMS INFORMATION USE ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today for two purposes. One is to \nshed light on the serious problem of gun violence that afflicts our \nNation, and the other is to introduce legislation which would assist \nlaw enforcement in their efforts to address this growing scourge that \naffects countless Americans every day.\n  Each and every year, tens of thousands of Americans have their lives \nsenselessly cut short because of gun violence. In 2004, 29,569 \nAmericans were killed by guns. This figure is higher than the number of \ndeaths our military has suffered in any year of any war since World War \nII--and it translates to over 81 gun deaths per day--over 3 deaths per \nhour. Tragically, statistics show that by the time I finish this \nspeech, another American will have lost his or her life to gun \nviolence.\n  Gun violence does not discriminate; it affects rich and poor, young \nand old, the innocent and guilty alike. It is not a red or blue State \nissue, but an American crisis that concerns our Nation as a whole. Not \na single American is immune to the tragic reach of gun violence.\n\n[[Page S2122]]\n\n  Our brave law enforcement officers risk their lives every day to stop \ngun violence before it occurs, but they cannot do it alone. They need \nresources--not just funding and equipment although those are critically \nimportant--but also information and intelligence. That is why the ATF \ncollects and compiles gun trace data--to provide crime gun information \nto law enforcement agencies, federally firearm licensees, FFL, the \npublic, Congress, and State and local authorities so they may better \nunderstand and prevent gun violence.\n  It goes without saying that the more we understand a problem and its \nsources, the more proficient we will be in our ability to solve it. \nThat is particularly true when talking about guns that are used to \ncommit crimes. In fact, one study has shown that 1.2 percent of gun \ndealers sell 57 percent of guns later traced to criminal \ninvestigations.\n  My home State of New Jersey has some of the strictest gun laws in the \ncountry, yet hundreds, if not thousands, of off-limit customers, such \nas those under age or those with violent criminal records, wind up with \nsuch weapons each month. And the overwhelming majority of guns used to \ncommit crimes in our State's cities were originally sold in compliance \nwith the law in other States.\n  In fact, a large majority of the guns used to commit crimes in Jersey \nCity, Newark, and Camden traveled up the east coast along I-95--the \n``Iron Pipeline''--and therefore don't fall under New Jersey's gun \nlaws. This is truly a paradox that has not only frustrated law \nenforcement agents, but elected officials too.\n  According to ATF reports released in July 2002, 85 percent of the \ntraced guns used to commit crimes in Jersey City and Newark, and 77 \npercent of those used in Camden, were originally purchased outside of \nNew Jersey. And more than 67 percent of crime guns recovered in Jersey \nCity were originally purchased more than 250 miles away, with 20 \npercent originating in South Carolina.\n  This is exactly the type of information that assists law enforcement \nofficials in placing local crime guns in a regional and national \nstrategic enforcement context and would allow Federal, State, and local \nelected officials to develop national, regional, and local strategic \nresponses to gun crime.\n  Unfortunately, every year for the past few years some of my \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle have slipped a provision \ninto law to prohibit the release of this information to anyone other \nthan `` a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency or a \nprosecutor solely in a criminal investigation or prosecution.'' This \namendment effectively prohibits information from reaching Congress, and \nState and local authorities, and the public. The practical impact of \nthe Tiahrt amendment is that gun trace data is rarely shared and an \nimportant law enforcement tool goes largely unused.\n  The Tiahrt amendment also limits how Federal, State and local law \nenforcement agencies can use crime gun trace data they are able to \nobtain. The Tiahrt provisions restrict use of the information to \nretroactively investigate crimes that have already been committed. \nUsing the data to proactively prevent gun crimes from happening is not \npermitted.\n  This makes no sense. We should be using every tool we have to prevent \nthe deaths and injuries that result from gun violence--not waiting \nuntil they happen and then figuring out the hows and whys.\n  Unfortunately, here in Washington, every year the Republican Congress \nand President Bush bow to the gun lobby in Washington and sacrifice the \nsafety of our streets. They do this by including the Tiahrt provisions.\n  Denying police access to critical information about crime gun traces \nhelps no one but the bad guys. Our families' safety should never take a \nbackseat to the demands of radical interest groups seeking only to \nfurther their own narrow agenda. Congress needs to pass my \nlegislation--instead we need to stand up to President Bush and the gun \nlobby, and stand up for our families.\n  Far too often in this country, innocent Americans, including \nchildren, are tragically caught in the crossfire of gun violence. Far \ntoo often these crimes may have been prevented with stricter gun \ncontrol regulations. As a Senator, it is my solemn duty to do \neverything within my power to protect the American people from the \nravages of gun violence. Addressing this grave issue should not be \nhampered by divisive, partisan bickering. We must undertake a \nbipartisan approach to reach an effective solution to this problem that \nis concerned solely with the welfare and safety of the public.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation to make this gun crime data \npublic again. It will not only help law enforcement prosecute gun \ncrimes, but will also increase public awareness about where these guns \noriginated. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2122-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DEATH OF CHALDEAN ARCHBISHOP PAULOS FARAJ RAHHO\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, we recently marked the 14th anniversary of \nthe enactment of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. This \nlegislation was a major step in our fight to curb gun violence. \nAccording to Centers for Disease Control statistics, since the Brady \nlaw went into effect, the number of gun deaths in the United States has \ndropped 26 percent, from 39,595 in 1993 to 29,569 in 2004. Even more \ndramatically, the number of gun homicides dropped by more than 38 \npercent from 17,024 in 1993 to 10,661 in 2004.\n  According to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, the Brady \nlaw's requirement that gun purchasers undergo a criminal background \ncheck before purchasing a firearm has prevented approximately 1.4 \nmillion prohibited purchasers from buying guns from federally licensed \ngun dealers. By preventing these potentially dangerous individuals from \nobtaining guns, the law has helped prevent countless tragedies. On this \n14-year anniversary, I urge my colleagues to capitalize on the \nsuccesses of the Brady law by taking up and passing additional gun \nsafety legislation, such as closing the gun show loophole and \nestablishing an assault weapons ban.\n  In a New York Times Op-Ed written March 29, 1991, on the 10th \nanniversary of the assassination attempt on his life and that of his \npress secretary, James S. Brady, President Reagan described his \nincredible ordeal of surviving the shooting and then went on to talk \nabout Jim Brady. President Reagan said:\n\n       I was lucky. The bullet that hit me bounced off a rib and \n     lodged in my lung, an inch from my heart. It was a very close \n     call. Twice they could not find my pulse. But the bullet's \n     missing my heart, the skill of the doctors and nurses at \n     George Washington University Hospital and the steadfast \n     support of my wife, Nancy, saved my life.\n       Jim Brady, my press secretary, who was standing next to me, \n     wasn't as lucky. A bullet entered the left side of his \n     forehead, near his eye, and passed through the right side of \n     his brain before it exited. The skills of the George \n     Washington University medical team, plus his amazing \n     determination and the grit and spirit of his wife, Sarah, \n     pulled Jim through. His recovery has been remarkable, but he \n     still lives with physical pain every day and must spend much \n     of his time in a wheelchair.\n       Thomas Delahanty, a Washington police officer, took a \n     bullet in his neck. It ricocheted off his spinal cord. Nerve \n     damage to\n\n[[Page S2123]]\n\n     his left arm forced his retirement in November 1981. Tim \n     McCarthy, a Secret Service agent, was shot in the chest and \n     suffered a lacerated liver. He recovered and returned to \n     duty.\n       Still, four lives were changed forever, and all by a \n     Saturday-night special, a cheaply made .22 caliber pistol, \n     purchased in a Dallas pawnshop by a young man with a history \n     of mental disturbance. This nightmare might never have \n     happened if legislation that is before Congress now, the \n     Brady bill, had been law back in 1981.\n\n  President Reagan was right. The record of prevention of gun sales to \npotentially dangerous buyers over the past 14 years and the lives saved \ndramatically demonstrate that and remind us of the wisdom embodied in \nthe Brady law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2123-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   5TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WAR IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, next week marks the 5-year anniversary \nof the war in Iraq. Although Saddam Hussein's brutal authoritarian \nregime no longer exists, the war has been nothing less than a disaster \nfor that country, for others in the region, and unquestionably for our \nown, as well.\n  Four million Iraqis are displaced from their homes and Iraq's \nprofoundly weak central government cannot provide its citizens with \nsufficient basic services like food, water, and electricity or protect \nthem from savage violence, disappearances, or kidnappings. Tensions \ncontinue to rise throughout the Middle East and, as the war triggers \ninternal unrest in many countries, it has caused our own credibility to \ndecrease significantly.\n  The war continues to undermine our top national security priority--\nthe fight against al-Qaida, which has strengthened itself in Pakistan \nand reached out to new affiliates around the world. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, the war costs us over $10 billion a \nmonth in direct costs. The war saps our military, which is stretched \ntoo thin to keep us safe here at home. In short, the war is making us \nweaker, not stronger, and that trend is not likely to change.\n  America continues to be mired in a conflict that has no end in sight. \nAs of the beginning of this week a total of 3,974 American soldiers had \nbeen killed and 29,320 wounded. While the administration touts a recent \ndecline in violence as an indication that the surge is ``working,'' \nthere is little political progress that might indicate the decrease in \nviolence will result in genuine national reconciliation. As the region \nremains particularly fragile and our international credibility \nprofoundly damaged, Americans ask each other just how many more \nbillions of dollars will be spent and how many more of our brave troops \nwill die or be injured while we wait for national reconciliation in \nIraq--which is the only way to end the violence.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, many of my Republican colleagues stood on the \nSenate floor to sing their praises of the surge, but now we may be \nwitnessing a reemergence of the brutal violence that was said to have \ndissipated. Early last week, two car bombs exploded, killing 24 people \nand wounding 56, while later in the week two bombs exploded in downtown \nBaghdad, killing nearly 70 people and wounding over 120. Yesterday a \nsuicide bomber approached five American soldiers in Baghdad and \ndetonated a bomb--killing all five soldiers and injuring three more. \nThis attack has been labeled the worst attack on U.S. forces in months \nand it comes only days after a female suicide bomber blew herself up in \nthe home of a Sunni leader who was reported to have been working in \ncollaboration with U.S. forces.\n  Similarly, another political impasse in Parliament may result in \nlittle tangible results from recently passed and supposedly key \nlegislation. Yes, a de-baathification law has passed but it may usher \nin renewed sectarian tensions as former officials from Hussein's regime \ntry to reclaim their old jobs. A provincial powers election law was \nsent back to the Parliament by the President's Council--requiring \nanother round of drafting before it is able to move forward. As we well \nknow, working on a law and even passing it is one thing--seeing it \nsuccessfully implemented is another.\n  National reconciliation still looks far off. The passage of what the \nadministration is calling ``benchmark'' laws does not ensure society-\nwide sectarian reconciliation; in fact, there are significant concerns \nabout how the local efforts we have supported to bring about this \ndecline in violence will be integrated into the national framework. The \nSunni Awakening has taken tens of thousands of former-insurgent Sunni \nmilitia fighters and it is unclear to what extent we can rely on their \nloyalties. It is not hard to see, however, that this policy risks \nincreasing distrust between the local Sunnis and national government, \nwhich is led predominately by Shi'ites.\n  Without a legitimate political settlement at the national level, any \ndecline in violence in Iraq is likely to be tenuous. Recent news from \nIraq seems to indicate that any gains in security are already slipping \nand without a strategy for safe redeployment, it is inevitably our \nbrave men and women who will pay the price.\n  The war in Iraq drags on while al-Qaida has reconstituted and \nstrengthened itself. The Director of National Intelligence, DNI, \nrecently testified before Congress that al-Qaida's central leadership \nbased in the border area of Pakistan is its most dangerous component. \nAnd just a few months ago, the DNI again repeated the Intelligence \nCommunity's assessment that, over the last 2 years, ``[al] Qaida's \ncentral leadership has been able to regenerate the core operational \ncapabilities needed to conduct attacks in the Homeland.''\n  Let me remind my colleagues, that it was from Afghanistan, not Iraq, \nthat the 9/11 attacks were planned and it was under the Taliban \nregime--which is once again gaining ground--that al-Qaida was able to \nflourish so freely. With a recent report warning that we are not \nwinning in Afghanistan, we need to rethink our current Iraq-based \nstrategy so we can counter the threat posed by al Qaida around the \nworld.\n  As we approach the 5th anniversary of the US-led invasion in Iraq, it \nis clear that continuing the current open-ended military policy doesn't \nmake sense. The American people certainly know that this war doesn't \nmake sense and they expect us to do everything in our power to end it. \nWe in Congress cannot in good conscience put Iraq on the backburner, \nand we cannot turn a blind eye or feign helplessness as the \nadministration keeps pursuing its misguided policies.\n  This Congress has no greater priority than making right the mistake \nit made over five years ago when it authorized the war in Iraq. I do \nnot want the American people to lose faith in their elected leaders for \npursuing a war that they rightly oppose. I do not want to watch a \nfailed strategy perpetuate regional turmoil any longer and I do not \nwant any more American troops to die or get injured for a war that is \nnot in our national security interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2123-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2123-S2125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KC-X TANKER DECISION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on February 29, 2008, the Secretary of the \nAir Force, Michael W. Wynne, announced that the Air Force had made a \nselection in the KC-X competition for development and procurement of up \nto 179 tanker aircraft, which are urgently needed to support our armed \nforces.\n  This was a critical step forward in the recapitalization of an aging \nfleet of aircraft that are essential for force projection, \nintelligence, surveillance, and global strike capabilities. A modern \ntanker force is at the heart of our national security.\n  I understand that it was a carefully constructed and transparent \nprocess that the Department of Defense and the Department of the Air \nForce structured and faithfully implemented to reach this decision. As \nSecretary Wynne said, the announcement ``is the culmination of years of \ntireless work and attention to detail by our acquisition professionals \nand source selection team, who have been committed to maintaining \nintegrity, providing transparency and promoting a fair competition for \nthis critical aircraft program.''\n  The Boeing Company has filed a protest, as is their right under law, \nwith the Government Accountability Office concerning the Air Force's \naward of this contract to Northrop Grumman. Further, as provided by \nlaw, the GAO will issue their decision within the next 100 days.\n  I now would like to provide some context and historical background to \nthe ongoing discussion by reviewing the oversight process employed by \nSenate oversight committees beginning\n\n[[Page S2124]]\n\nwith the original proposed tanker lease procurement.\n  Nearly 6 years ago, a $30 billion authorization provision, placed in \nthe fiscal year 2002 Defense appropriations bill, provided the Air \nForce the authority to lease, not purchase, up to 100 767s from Boeing, \na sole source contract, for use as aerial refueling tankers.\n  Authority to fund and execute this lease required approval of the 4 \ncongressional committees of jurisdiction over defense programs. Three \napproved; but, the fourth, the Senate Armed Services Committee, \ndisapproved.\n  Under Senate procedure, the chairman of the committees made the \ndecision for their respective committees. As chairman of Armed Services \nat the time, I found fault with the proposed lease contract and after \nconsultations with Members--in particular Senator McCain, who provided \nvaluable oversight of the entire process--the committee declined to \napprove the proposal.\n  Additionally, consultations with outside experts had corroborated \nthat procedures and provisions related to the lease contract required \nfurther oversight by Congress.\n  Following a full committee hearing on September 4, 2003, I directed \nthe Department of Defense, by letter to investigate the Air Force's \ninitial proposal and analyze alternatives that would meet the \noperational requirement.\n  Furthermore, in letters to the General Accounting Office, the \nCongressional Budget Office, and the Office of Management and Budget, \namong others, I directed that these other agencies provide assessments \nof the proposal.\n  These assessments, as well as further oversight conducted by both the \nSenate Armed Services and Commerce Committees, led Deputy Secretary of \nDefense Wolfowitz to order a ``pause'' in the execution of the proposed \nlease contract.\n  On December 2, 2003, I sent a letter to the Deputy Secretary to \nconcur with the decision requiring a ``pause'' in execution, and stated \nfurther:\n\n       The Department of Defense Inspector General inquiry should \n     pursue the trail of evidence wherever it leads, in accordance \n     with standard IG procedures.\n\n  By February 2004, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld put a ``halt'' to the \nentire tanker lease process, pending the DOD inspector general report.\n  During the following 3 years, the investigative process uncovered \nevidence revealing serious, criminal breaches in the very process that \nAmericans trust to provide their service members with the equipment \nnecessary to defend our great Nation. In fact, these efforts resulted \nin jail sentences for senior persons from the Air Force and Boeing, and \na settlement of $600 million that was paid to the U.S. Treasury.\n  The findings confirmed--the view of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee--that the Air Force's tanker lease proposal was faulty. \nActions by the Congress allowed for the requisite time within which the \nexecutive branch could establish a free and fair competition. This \nultimately resulted in a new proposed contract.\n  On December 1, 2006, Senator McCain, then chairman of the Airland \nSubcommittee, wrote a letter to Robert Gates, then the President's \nnominee to be Secretary of Defense. In his letter, Senator McCain \nencouraged Secretary Gates to ensure a fair and open competition by \nissuing a second draft request for proposals in an effort to make \ncertain that there was no ambiguity in the competition process. As \nchairman of the committee, I concurred with his initiative, given I \nhave been a very strong proponent of competition.\n  Since the announcement on February 29, 2008, by the Secretary of the \nAir Force with regard to the Department's acquisition decision, there \nhas been, in my opinion, an injection of considerable misinformation in \nthe public forum. Consequently, I believe I had an obligation to \nrecite--and document--portions of the history relative to the debate.\n  I am particularly concerned about allegations that the proposed \ncontract would adversely affect job opportunities in America, given \nparts of the aircraft would be manufactured abroad.\n  I draw on my experience as Under then as Secretary of the Navy, 1969-\n74, when I solicited bids, for major procurements of fleets of new \naircraft, from an American industrial base of many companies sized, \nfinanced, and experienced to compete.\n  For many reasons that base, comprised of numerous large domestic \ncompanies, has consolidated and narrowed, but America remains the \npreeminent provider for the vast majority of our military procurements. \nToday, we also rely on our global partners for a wide diversity of \ntechnologies and support in joint military procurements. A prime \nexample is the Joint Strike Fighter procurement.\n  In closing, we must respect the right of Boeing to seek a review by \nthe GAO as provided by law. It is my judgment that until the GAO acts \nand reports to Congress their findings; we should lower the emotional \nrhetoric, be accurate with the facts, and withhold judgment of the work \ndone by a large dedicated group of uniformed and civilian acquisition \nspecialists.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 2003.\n     Hon. Donald H. Rumsfeld,\n     Secretary of Defense, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: As you know, the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee held a hearing today on the Department's proposed \n     lease of 100 KC-767A tanker aircraft. There was a large \n     attendance of members and an extensive exchange of questions \n     and views in this hearing that lasted over three hours.\n       During the course of the hearing, Chairman Warner raised \n     the option of leasing a smaller number of tanker aircraft--up \n     to 25--to address the current, short-term need for additional \n     tankers, to be followed by a traditional procurement, not a \n     lease, of the remaining tankers, presumably under multi-year \n     authority. Secretary Roche said that such an option had not \n     been considered. We would like to draw your attention to \n     section 367 of the Senate version of National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, which requires the \n     preparation of an analysis of alternatives for the \n     Department's aerial refueling requirements. While this \n     language is not directly targeted at the KC-767A lease \n     proposal, it reflects the thinking of the Senate that other \n     alternatives should have been considered.\n       We request that the Department analyze the option of \n     leasing up to 25 tanker aircraft, followed by a procurement \n     of the remaining aircraft. Such an analysis should include an \n     examination of the budgetary and cost implications of various \n     options for an incremental lease-buy, including an \n     accelerated exercise of the purchase option in the proposed \n     lease.\n       Additionally, given the emphasis on an apparent corrosion \n     problem in the existing KC-135 tanker fleet, we would \n     appreciate your providing as with a thorough assessment of \n     the extent of those corrosion problems and the expected cost \n     of addressing those problems if tanker aircraft were \n     purchased according to the previous Air Force plan instead of \n     leased sooner as more recently proposed. Also, please provide \n     us with a justification of the Department's decision to pay \n     $10.3 million per aircraft more than the $120.7 million per \n     aircraft as determined by the Institute for Defense Analysis \n     to be a reasonable purchase price.\n       The Committee will await your reply prior to meeting to \n     discuss the pending lease proposal.\n       With kind regards,\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin,\n       Ranking Member.\n     John Warner,\n       Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2003.\n     Hon.

Testimony by the General \n     Accounting Office (GAO), as well as GAO's work for the \n     Congress on this issue over the past year and a half, was \n     instrumental to the Committee during the hearing.\n       Subsequent to the hearing, Senator Levin and I asked DOD to \n     analyze the option of leasing up to 25 aircraft, followed by \n     a procurement of the remaining aircraft. We also asked for \n     more detailed pricing information and an assessment of \n     corrosion problems including the cost of addressing those \n     problems for the existing KC-135 fleet of aircraft.\n       The Department has responded to that letter, and identified \n     several alternative acquisition strategies, with associated \n     estimates of cost and savings. I ask that the GAO review the \n     Department's response, a copy of which is attached. Please \n     provide the Committee with your assessment of the validity of \n     DOD's assumptions and the accuracy of the cost and savings \n     estimates, and identify\n\n[[Page S2125]]\n\n     any other alternative acquisition strategies the Committee \n     should consider.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Warner,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2003.\n     Mr. Douglas Holtz-Eakin,\n     Director, Congressional Budget Office, 402 Ford House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Holtz-Eakin: As you know, the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee held a hearing on September 4, 2003, to \n     review the Department of Defense's (DOD) proposed lease of \n     100 KC-767 aerial refueling aircraft.

Please \n     provide the Committee with your assessment of the validity of \n     DOD's assumptions and the accuracy of the cost and savings \n     estimates, and identify any other alternative acquisition \n     strategies the Committee should consider.\n       I ask that the CBO provide the results of this assessment \n     as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Warner,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Commitee on Armed Services,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Joshua B. Bolten,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Bolten: On September 4, 2003, Deputy Director \n     Kaplan testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee \n     on the proposed Air Force lease of 100 KC-767 tanker \n     aircraft.\n       After the hearing, we wrote a letter to the Secretary of \n     Defense (copy attached) in which we requested three things: \n     (1) an analysis of the option of leasing up to 25 tanker \n     aircraft; followed by a procurement of the remaining 75 \n     aircraft; (2) a thorough assessment of the extent of \n     corrosion problems in the existing KC-135 tanker fleet and \n     the expected cost of addressing those problems over the \n     period before purchased aircraft would become available; and \n     (3) justification and explanation of the Department's \n     decision to pay $10.3 million per aircraft more than the \n     $120.7 million per aircraft determined by the Institute for \n     Defense Analysis to be a reasonable purchase price. Deputy \n     Secretary Wolfowitz has responded to our letter, a copy of \n     which is also attached.\n       Given the importance of this tanker leasing issue, we would \n     appreciate receiving the benefits of your review of Secretary \n     Wolfowitz's response. Specifically, do you concur with the \n     assessments of the advantages and disadvantages of the \n     various funding options that are portrayed in the Deputy \n     Secretary's letter, and do you agree with the stated \n     rationale for paying the price per aircraft as negotiated by \n     the Air Force? We believe that the Committee needs to hear \n     your views on this subject before reaching a decision on the \n     lease. Accordingly, we ask that you provide this matter \n     prompt attention.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin,\n       Ranking Member.\n     John Warner,\n       Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Wolfowitz,\n     Deputy Secretary of Defense,\n     Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Wolfowitz: I commend the Secretary of \n     Defense and yourself for the prompt actions you have taken \n     regarding the Air Force's tanker aircraft program, in light \n     of recent extraordinary personnel actions taken by the Boeing \n     Company. Your decision to require a ``pause'' in the \n     execution of any contracts to lease and purchase tanker \n     aircraft is a prudent management step.\n       Further, I concur in your judgment to task the Department \n     of Defense Inspector General (DOD-IG) to conduct an \n     independent assessment. However, I believe that the DOD-IG \n     assessment should go further than the review described in \n     your letter of December 1, 2003. The DOD-IG inquiry should \n     pursue the trail of evidence wherever it leads, in accordance \n     with standard IG procedures. This inquiry should examine the \n     actions of all members of the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of the Air Force, both military and civilian, top \n     to bottom, who participated in structuring and negotiating \n     the proposed tanker lease contract which was submitted to the \n     Congress in July 2003.\n       Your recent actions clearly indicate that there are many \n     outstanding questions that must be answered before proceeding \n     with this program. I expect that you will consult further \n     with the Congress as you receive the report of the DOD-IG and \n     that no actions will be taken with respect to the lease and \n     purchase of KC-767 tanker aircraft until the Congress has had \n     an opportunity to review the DOD-IG report. Ultimately, this \n     program, as restructured, must be executed in a manner that \n     is fully consistent with Section 135 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 (Public Law 108-136).\n       With kind regards, I am\n                                                      John Warner,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      John McCain,\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 2006.\n     Dr. Robert M. Gates,\n     President, Texas A University,\n     One Circle Drive, College Station, TX\n       Re: Tanker Replacement Program\n       Dear Dr. Gates: Subject to the confirmation of your \n     nomination, perhaps the most important new major defense \n     acquisition program for which you will be responsible, will \n     arise from the replacement of the KC-135 aerial refueling \n     tanker fleet. As you probably know, this program is currently \n     valued at about $200 billion.\n       Given the regrettable history of the Air Force's prior \n     attempt to recapitalize the fleet, it is vital that this \n     program obtain the best possible joint aerial refueling \n     capability at the most reasonable price. In my view, this can \n     only be achieved by conducting a competition for replacement \n     aircraft fully, openly and transparently--using objective, \n     verifiable metrics. More to the point, if this very important \n     program is to reach production timely, I respectfully suggest \n     that the final Request for Proposals (RFP) must be \n     unambiguous and uncontroversial. Unfortunately, I am not sure \n     we are yet on that course.\n       In recent correspondence to Deputy Secretary Gordon \n     England, I conveyed concern about the unprecedented inclusion \n     of an element related to litigation between the United States \n     and the European Union Trade Commission currently pending \n     before the World Trade Organization (WTO), in the draft \n     Request for Proposals (dRFP). I remain troubled that, without \n     clarity on how answers to this provision will be evaluated, \n     this element (and other similarly troubling provisions, \n     including an overly restrictive invocation of the Berry \n     Amendment and a questionable extension of ITAR regulations) \n     may risk eliminating competition before bids are submitted. I \n     understand that the Department will issue a final RFP on \n     December 15, 2006.\n       Recent developments in the program underscore my concerns. \n     On Tuesday, November 28, 2006, the Air Force held an \n     Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP) to review tanker \n     requirements and select an acquisition strategy for \n     replacement aircraft. I understand that the ASP selected a \n     strategy that did not include a ``capabilities-based \n     acquisition.'' As such, the approach that the ASP selected \n     appears to deviate from what I understand the Joint \n     Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) prescribed. I \n     understand that, in vetting the KC-X Operational Requirements \n     Document (ORD), the JROC called on the Air Force to consider \n     tanker aircraft options that maximize cargo and passenger \n     capacity. But, without a capabilities-based evaluation that \n     objectively and verifiably measures capability beyond \n     thresholds in either the primary mission area (aerial \n     refueling) or other inherently critical missions available \n     from large aircraft platforms (such as airlift), it is \n     difficult to see how the JROC's recommendation can be \n     implemented. As a result, competition may, once again, be \n     eliminated before bids are even submitted.\n       Against this backdrop, I respectfully suggest that issuing \n     a second dRFP, which can address issues raised by all \n     prospective offerors in their responses to the first dRFP, \n     and conducting a capabilities-based evaluation, which can \n     help assure that the warfighter and the taxpayer obtain the \n     most capable platform at the best possible value, may be \n     useful.\n       If you are confirmed, I respectfully ask for the following: \n     that you withhold releasing the final RFP until you have \n     provided me with an explanation of how you intend to assure \n     that the competition for tanker aircraft will be conducted \n     fully, openly and transparently--particularly in light of the \n     issues described above.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John McCain,\n     Chairman, AirLand Subcommittee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2125-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2125-S2126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING DR.

Mr. President, today I wish to pay my respects to \none of my constitutents, Mrs. Henrietta Bell Wells, who passed away on \nFebruary 27, 2008.\n  Mrs. Wells was the last surviving member of the famous debate team \nfrom Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, whose story is told in the \nrecent film ``The Great Debaters.'' She was a remarkable woman whose \nearly success in challenging gender and racial barriers was followed by \nmany years of faithful service. She will be missed but certainly not \nforgotten. Her life is truly an inspiration.\n  I ask that an obituary that was published in The New York Times \nyesterday be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n         [From the New York Times News Service, Mar. 12, 2008]\n\n                          (By Douglas Martin)\n\n       Henrietta Bell Wells, the only woman, the only freshman and \n     the last surviving member of the 1930 Wiley College debate \n     team that participated in the first interracial collegiate \n     debate in the United States, died Feb. 27 in Baytown, Texas. \n     She was 96.\n       Her friend Edward Cox confirmed the death.\n       The story of the team, called the Great Debaters in last \n     year's movie of the same name, began in 1924 at Wiley \n     College, a small liberal arts college in Marshall, Texas, \n     founded a half-century earlier by the Methodist Episcopal \n     Church to educate ``newly freed men.''\n       Melvin B. Tolson arrived at the all-black school that \n     autumn to teach English and other subjects. He also started a \n     debate team.\n       Tolson, who would win wide distinction as a poet, saw \n     argumentation as a way to cultivate mental alertness. Wiley \n     was soon debating and defeating black colleges two and three \n     times its size.\n       In 1930, Tolson decided to break new ground. He managed to \n     schedule a debate with the University of Michigan Law School, \n     an all-white school. Wiley won. Other debates with white \n     schools followed, culminating with Wiley's 1935 victory over \n     the national champion, the University of Southern California.\n       Tolson's stunningly successful debate team was portrayed in \n     ``The Great Debaters,'' directed by Denzel Washington. \n     Describing the cinematic young debaters in The Chicago Sun-\n     Times, the critic Roger Ebert wrote, ``They are black, proud, \n     single-minded, focused, and they express all this most \n     dramatically in their debating.''\n       In the fall of 1930, Henrietta Bell, who would later marry \n     Wallace Wells, was a freshman in an English class taught by \n     Tolson. The professor urged her to try out for the debate \n     team, because she seemed to be able to think on her feet. She \n     was the first woman on the team.\n       In an interview with The Houston Chronicle in 2007, she \n     said the boys ``didn't seem to mind me.''\n       But the work was far from easy. Bell attended classes \n     during the day, had three campus jobs and practiced debating \n     at night. The intensity of debating was reflected in Tolson's \n     characterization of it as ``a blood sport.''\n       But the hard work paid off. In the interview with The \n     Chronicle, Wells declared, ``We weren't intimidated.''\n       Henrietta Pauline Bell was born on the banks of Buffalo \n     Bayou in Houston on Jan. 11, 1912, and raised by a hard-\n     pressed single mother from the West Indies. When riots broke \n     out in 1917 over police treatment of black soldiers at a \n     World War I training camp, the family's house was searched. \n     Wells recalled being unable to try on clothes in segregated \n     stores.\n       She did not debate in high school but was valedictorian of \n     her class. She earned a modest scholarship from the YMCA to \n     go to Wiley, Episcopal Life reported.\n       In the spring of 1930, Bell, her teammates and her \n     chaperone arrived at the Seventh Street Theater in Chicago. \n     It was the largest black-owned theater in town, because no \n     large white-owned facility would host a racially mixed \n     audience, according to an article in The Marshall News-\n     Messenger. Wells remembered a standing-room-only crowd.\n       She wore a dark suit and had her hair cut in a boyish bob. \n     In an interview with Jeffrey Porro, one of the screenwriters \n     of ``The Great Debaters,'' she felt very small on that very \n     big stage. ``I had to use my common sense,'' she said.\n       She remembered Tolson urging her to punch up her delivery. \n     ``You've got to put something in there to wake the people \n     up,'' he had said.\n       Wells told The Chronicle, ``It was a nondecision debate, \n     but we felt at the time that it was a giant step toward \n     desegregation.''\n       She debated for only one year, because of the need to work \n     for money. She kept up with drama, which Tolson also coached. \n     After graduating from college, she returned to Houston, where \n     she met Wallace Wells and married. He was a church organist \n     and later an Episcopal minister. She worked as a teacher and \n     social worker.\n       Wells advised Washington on the movie, using her scrapbooks \n     as visual aids. She urged him to play Tolson, something he at \n     first was not inclined to do. He called her ``another \n     grandma.''\n       Wallace Wells died in 1987. Wells left no immediate \n     survivors.\n       Her advice to today's students was straightforward: ``Learn \n     to speak well and learn to express yourself effectively.''\n       She learned this lesson directly from Tolson, whom she \n     called her crabbiest and best teacher. He was known for \n     issuing intellectual challenges immediately upon entering the \n     classroom.\n       A typical salutation: ``Bell! What is a verb?''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2126-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2126-S2127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO THE DRAKE UNIVERSITY MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am here today to commend the \nDrake University Men's Basketball team on its outstanding and \nunexpected success this past season. Drake is a school of less than \n5,000 students in Des Moines, IA. Today the Drake community is \nexperiencing basketball success the likes of which it hasn't seen in \nover 35 years. Coached by Keno Davis, the Bulldogs won the regular \nseason Missouri Valley Conference, the Missouri Valley Conference \ntournament and earned a berth to the NCAA tournament. They were picked \nto finish ninth in the conference and instead roared to a 28-4 overall \nrecord. It was only the second winning season the Bulldogs have enjoyed \nin the past 20 years. And it's the first time since 1971 that they will \nplay in the NCAA tournament. Drake also finished the regular season \nranked 20th in the Nation and beating a tough Illinois State team by 30 \npoints in the MVC tournament final. It's been a long drought, but the \nBulldog nation, from Iowa to Washington, DC, to California, could not \nbe prouder.\n  This upstart team has quite a story. Two starters, Adam Emmenecker \nand Jonathon Cox are former 3-year walk-ons who recently earned \nbasketball scholarships. They are also incredibly successful \nacademically. Drake started off the season well and won the mythical \nState championship by beating the University of Iowa, Iowa State \nUniversity and the University of Northern Iowa. They snapped a 20 game \nlosing streak at the University of Iowa. Drake also had great success \nin Missouri Valley Conference play. The Bulldogs cracked the Top 25, \ntoo, and traveled to Butler University and beat the eighth ranked team \non their home court.\n  This Drake team exemplifies what it means to be a student-athlete. \nFive Drake players, Adam Emmenecker, Josh Young, Klayton Korver, Brent \nHeemskerk, and Jonathon Cox were named to the MVC's scholar-athlete \nteam. Four of the five Bulldog starters have a GPA above 3.0. In \naddition, Emmenecker was named the ESPN Scholar Athlete of the year for \nNCAA Men's Division I basketball, with a 3.97 GPA and four majors.\n  It goes without saying that behind a great college team are great \ncoaches and administrators. Keno Davis is in his first year as a head \ncoach. He's been named the Missouri Valley Conference Coach of the \nYear, and Sporting News Coach of the Year. Just 36 years old, Keno \nlearned from his father, Dr. Tom Davis, who retired as Drake's head \ncoach in 2007, and was a longtime head coach at the University\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\nof Iowa. I have great respect for the Davis family, and I'm so glad \nthat they have rebuilt the Drake program. Keno and his wife Krista \nbecame parents during the season, too. Assistant coaches Chris Davis, \nRodell Davis and Justin Ohl have obviously spent hours fine-tuning \ntheir talented and intelligent team.\n  I also need to congratulate Drake's president Dr. David Maxwell and \nAthletic Director Sandy Hatfield Clubb for their support of the men's \nbasketball program. They have helped rebuild Drake's basketball program \nwhile maintaining high academic standards. We all know how hard that is \nin college sports today. Drake is a shining example of how a team can \nwin on the court and in the classroom.\n  Dolph Pulliam, a member of Drake's one and only Final Four team, has \nserved as an inspiration to the current Bulldogs. Dolph and his team \nplayed Lew Alcinder, known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar today, and UCLA back \nin 1969 and only lost by 3 points. Since his playing days, Dolph has \nremained in the Des Moines area, working for the university and \nbroadcasting their games on the radio. And he is quite a presence with \nhis huge smile and blue leather suit. I know he has influenced the \ncurrent Drake players, thanks to encouragement from Dr. Tom Davis to \nhelp them all rekindle the fires of great basketball.\n  So I want to again extend my congratulations to the Drake University \nmen's basketball program, and to their students and fans who've never \nlost faith in them. It has been a joy to watch their success, and I \nhope that they continue winning during March Madness. I also hope that \nthese young men will serve as an example to the young people in Iowa, \nto show that it is entirely possible to maintain high academic \nstandards and winning ways on the court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2127-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN TRIBUTE TO BYRON JANIS\n\n   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the \naccomplishments and inspirational life of Byron Janis as he approaches \nhis 80th birthday later this month.\n  I learned about Mr. Janis's upcoming milestone from his good friend \nDick Thornburgh, the former Attorney General of the United States. Mr. \nThornburgh was a key advocate during the administration of George \nHerbert Walker Bush for enactment of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, ADA, and I was proud to be the chief sponsor of the ADA in the \nSenate.\n  A Pennsylvania native, Mr. Janis is renowned as one of the world's \nmost talented concert pianists. In addition, his perseverance is a \nsource of inspiration to countless Americans. By the age of 20, his \nvirtuosity at the piano was so extraordinary that he performed a sold \nout debut at New York's famed Carnegie Hall.\n  Later, Mr. Janis was chosen to be the first individual to represent \nthe United States in a cultural exchange with the Soviet Union. \nRemarking on this mission, The New York Times wrote that ``if music \ncould replace international politics, Byron Janis could consider \nhimself an ambassador.''\n  In the decades since, Byron Janis has dazzled audiences worldwide. He \nhas performed for numerous U.S. Presidents, and has been honored with \ncountless awards from around the globe.\n  However, perhaps Byron Janis's greatest contribution to America lies \nnot in his musical talent but rather in the example he has set of an \nindividual responding to adversity with grace and courage, and with a \ntruly indomitable spirit.\n  In 1973, he was diagnosed with arthritis in his hands and wrists, \nwhich could have ended his career as a pianist. But Mr. Janis refused \nto be stymied or stopped. As he put it, ``I have arthritis--it doesn't \nhave me.''\n  He continued to play for 12 years before disclosing his arthritis at \na White House performance. That same day, Mr. Janis assumed the role of \nAmbassador for the Arts for the Arthritis Foundation.\n  Through his continued performances and other appearances, he has \nraised awareness as well as funds to support the foundation's noble \ncause. To this day, audiences continue to be captivated by Byron \nJanis's musical talents, even as they are impressed by his amazing \npersistence in the face of adversity.\n  March 24 will be Byron Janis's 80th birthday. And this year also \nmarks the 60th anniversary of his debut at Carnegie Hall.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ncontributions of Business Executives for National Security, BENS.\n  Since 1982, this national organization has been a primary channel \nthrough which American business leaders have contributed their special \nexperience and talent to help build a more secure nation. Founded by \nbusiness tycoon Stanley A. Weiss, BENS operates on the principle that \nAmerica's national security is everybody's business. BENS is a highly \nrespected nonpartisan organization of senior executives and \nentrepreneurs dedicated to enhancing our national security by \nimplementing proven practices of the private sector.\n  Working with Congress and the Department of Defense, BENS helps \nprotect the American homeland and build a more efficient and effective \nmilitary. As the United States continues to confront domestic and \ninternational threats, BENS proves more important than ever before.\n  BENS has provided distinguished service to the Nation for over a \nquarter century. This service includes reforming the business of \ndefense, protecting the homeland, tracking terrorist funding, and \nbanning chemical weapons. BENS helps our Armed Forces by slashing \nbureaucracy, streamlining operations, and cutting waste, making more \nfunds available for urgent priorities such as military readiness and \nmodernization.\n  BENS is a pioneer in homeland security creating innovative \npartnerships around the country that civic-minded companies that \nprovide assistance to local and State governments in times of \nemergency. BENS works with the Department of the Treasury to improve \nAmerica's ability to locate and suspend suspicious financial activities \nthat fund terrorism.\n  BENS is a strong advocate of the Chemical Weapons Convention to \neliminate the chemical weapons stockpile by 2012, reducing the chances \nsuch weapons will be used against the United States through a terrorist \nattack.\n  Mr. President, I ask my distinguished colleagues in the Senate to \njoin me in recognizing BENS and their commitment to national security \ninterests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2127-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2127-S2128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO PORTLAND STATE VIKINGS\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today, as a proud Oregonian, I \ncongratulate the Portland State University men's basketball team on a \nstellar performance last night. The PSU Vikings capped a five-game \nwinning streak by soundly defeating the Northern Arizona University \nLumberjacks 67 to 51 to win the Big Sky Conference Tournament and \nadvance to the NCAA Tournament.\n  This achievement marks the Vikings' first trip to the ``Big Dance,'' \nand an important moment to recognize their collective talents. I think \nI speak for all Oregonians when I say that we are greatly impressed by \nthe hard work these young men and their coaches have put into achieve \nthis victory.\n  I congratulate this team not only for their athletic achievement, but \nalso for putting Oregon's largest university on the map of collegiate \nsports. I know the PSU Vikings, who have lost only twice in 2008, will \nbe an excellent representative of our home State in the national \ntournament.\n  Certainly this victory is just the beginning for the members of this \nteam. I look forward to hearing of their successes not only in \nathletics but in any endeavor they choose to take on in the future.\n  Mr. President, allow me to specifically mention the names of all the \ncoaches and players who have made my\n\n[[Page S2128]]\n\nState so very proud: Julius Thomas, Deonte Huff, Andre Murray, Mickey \nPolis, Jeremiah Dominguez, Dominic Waters, Brian Curtis, Tyrell Mara, \nKyle Coston, Dupree Lucas, Phil Nelson, Justynn Hammond, J.R.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan urging Congress to reject legislation that would \n     preempt the authority of the Great Lake states to curb the \n     release of ballast water; to the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 86\n\n       Whereas, Ballast water discharges from ships entering the \n     Great Lakes are the leading pathway for the introduction of \n     aquatic invasive species. Since the opening of the St. \n     Lawrence Seaway in 1959, ocean-going ships have introduced \n     more than 30 new species to the Great Lakes; and\n       Whereas, once introduced and established, aquatic invasive \n     species are nearly impossible to eliminate and costly to \n     control. Zebra mussels and other aquatic invasive species \n     introduced from ballast water have irrevocably changed the \n     Great Lakes and directly cost cities and industries--and \n     indirectly cost Great Lakes residents--tens of millions of \n     dollars per year to control; and\n       Whereas, current federal ballast water regulations designed \n     to protect the Great Lakes are ineffective. At least eleven \n     new aquatic invasive species have been introduced from \n     ballast water since current requirements for ballast water \n     exchange with open ocean water went into effect, including \n     the recent introduction of viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) \n     that directly threatens the $4.5-billion Great Lakes fishery; \n     and\n       Whereas, the ocean-going shipping industry has shown little \n     urgency over the last two decades to develop and install \n     ballast water treatment technology, even as it introduced \n     more and more aquatic invasive species to new regions. \n     Rather, the industry has continuously fought efforts in the \n     United States Congress, state legislatures, and the courts to \n     require expeditious treatment of their ballast water. For \n     every year treatment is not required for ballast water, an \n     additional one to two new species, with unknown but \n     potentially devastating impacts, make the Great Lakes their \n     permanent home; and\n       Whereas, the state of Michigan has succeeded in identifying \n     and requiring treatment technologies that would provide \n     additional protection to the Great Lakes; and\n       Whereas, Michigan and other states bear primary \n     responsibility for protecting the health and safety of their \n     citizens and the integrity of natural resources for their \n     citizens. The Congress of the United States acknowledged the \n     authority for the Great Lakes states to act unilaterally to \n     protect and preserve the waters of the Great Lakes Basin in \n     the federal Clean Water Act and the National Invasive Species \n     Act, as affirmed this past summer by the United States \n     District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan; and\n       Whereas, Federal ballast water legislation, such as the \n     Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007 (H.R. 2830) and the \n     Ballast Water Management Act of 2007 (S. 1578), would preempt \n     Michigan's efforts to protect its waters from further \n     degradation. Preempting state actions before strong federal \n     treatment standards are in place would leave the Great Lakes \n     vulnerable to future invasions and would trample on \n     fundamental states' rights to protect their natural \n     resources. This shortsighted approach undermines the millions \n     of dollars and thousands of hours spent each year working to \n     restore the Great Lakes to a healthy, self-sustaining system; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2007 and the \n     Ballast Water Management Act of 2007 would also set a \n     precedent for future federal actions that restrict state \n     authority to protect essential natural resources. Clearly, \n     Michigan and other states are best suited to make decisions \n     that keep waters safe, clean, and healthy for its residents \n     with regulations, when needed, above and beyond minimum \n     federal requirements; now, therefore, be it further\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to reject legislation that would preempt \n     the authority of the Great Lakes states to curb the release \n     of ballast water; and be it further.\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-294. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Maine urging Congress to \n     ensure funding for veterans' health care; to the Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     provides medical care for all veterans of the United States \n     Armed Forces; and\n       Whereas, the funding for this health care is passed each \n     year by the United States Congress as part of the \n     discretionary budget; and\n       Whereas, this health care is seriously underfunded; and\n       Whereas, this serious and now chronic shortfall affects the \n     veterans' access to quality medical care services; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     and our Nation have a duty to serve our veterans and have \n     entered into a contract, absolute and irrevocable, to provide \n     them with proper health care: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that full funding for health care for veterans of the \n     United States Armed Forces be passed and that all parties \n     involved do their utmost to see that those who served their \n     Nation are given the health care they deserve; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W.

SUMMER YOUTH JOBS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a temporary $1,000,000,000 investment in summer \n     employment for youth, through the summer youth jobs program \n     supported under this section, will create up to 1,000,000 \n     jobs for economically disadvantaged youth and stimulate local \n     economies;\n       (2) research from Northwestern University has shown that \n     every $1 a youth earns has an accelerator effect of $3 on the \n     local economy;\n       (3) there is a serious and growing need for employment \n     opportunities for economically disadvantaged youth, as \n     demonstrated by statistics from the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics stating that, in December 2007--\n       (A) the unemployment rate increased to 5 percent, as \n     compared to 4.4 percent in December 2006;\n       (B) the unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds rose to \n     17 percent, as compared to 13 percent in December 2006; and\n       (C) the unemployment rate for African-American 16- to 19-\n     year-olds increased 5 percent in 1 month, jumping to 34.7 \n     percent, as compared to 20 percent in December 2006;\n       (4) summer youth jobs help supplement the income of \n     families living in poverty;\n       (5) summer youth jobs provide valuable work experience to \n     economically disadvantaged youth;\n       (6) often, the summer jobs provided through the program are \n     an economically disadvantaged youth's introduction to the \n     world of work;\n       (7) according to the Center for Labor Market Studies at \n     Northeastern University, early work experience is a very \n     powerful predictor of success and earnings in the labor \n     market, and early work experiences raises earnings over a \n     lifetime by 10 to 20 percent;\n       (8) participation in a summer youth jobs program can \n     contribute to a reduction in criminal and high-risk behavior \n     for youth; and\n       (9)(A) summer youth job programs benefit both youth and \n     communities when designed around principles that promote \n     mutually beneficial programs;\n       (B) youth benefit from summer youth jobs that provide them \n     with work readiness skills and that help them make the \n     connection between responsibility on the job and success in \n     adulthood; and\n\n[[Page S2139]]\n\n       (C) communities benefit when youth are engaged productively \n     during the summer, providing much-needed services that meet \n     real community needs.\n       (b) Appropriations.--Out of any money in the Treasury not \n     otherwise appropriated, and in addition to any funds \n     appropriated under any provision of Federal law other than \n     this section, there is appropriated to the Secretary of Labor \n     for youth activities under the Workforce Investment Act of \n     1998 (29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.), $1,000,000,000, which shall be \n     available for the period of April 1, 2008 through December \n     31, 2008, under the conditions described in subsection (c).\n       (c) Conditions.--\n       (1) Use of funds.--The funds appropriated under subsection \n     (b) shall be used for summer employment opportunities \n     referred to in section 129(c)(2)(C) of such Act (29 U.S.C. \n     2854(c)(2)(C)).\n       (2) Limitation.--Such funds shall be distributed in \n     accordance with sections 127 and 128 of such Act (29 U.S.C. \n     2852, 2853), except that no portion of such funds shall be \n     reserved to carry out 128(a) or 169 of such Act (29 U.S.C. \n     2853(a), 2914).\n       (3) Measure of effectiveness.--The effectiveness of the \n     activities carried out with such funds shall be measured, \n     under section 136 of such Act (29 U.S.C. 2871), only with \n     performance measures based on the core indicators of \n     performance described in section 136(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I) of such \n     Act (29 U.S.C. 2871(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I)).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 2756. A bill to amend the National Child Protection Act of 1993 to \nestablish a permanent background check system; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nHatch and Senator Specter to introduce the Child Protection \nImprovements Act of 2008. This bill will expand and make permanent the \nnational child safety pilot program that we passed as part of the \nPROTECT Act back in 2003. This bill is, in my view, an absolutely \nessential step towards developing a comprehensive approach to protect \nour Nation's children.\n  Human service organizations rely on volunteers and employees to \nprovide services and care to children. These individuals coach soccer \ngames, mentor young people, run youth camps, and much more. \nApproximately 61 million adults currently volunteer--with 27 percent \ndedicating their volunteer service to education and youth programs. By \nvolunteering, they necessarily gain very close, often unsupervised \naccess to our children. Of course, the vast majority of these people \nhave the best interest of our children at heart--and we need as many \nvolunteers as we can get. But, at the same time, we have to understand \nthat bad people will take any step they can to gain access to children \nand many attempt to do this by volunteering.\n  Congress has previously attempted to ensure that States make FBI \ncriminal history record checks available to organizations seeking to \nscreen employees and volunteers who work with children, through the \nNational Child Protection Act of 1993 and the Volunteers for Children \nAct. However, according to a report from the Attorney General, these \nlaws ``did not have the intended impact of broadening the availability \nof checks.'' A 2007 survey conducted by MENTOR/National Mentoring \nPartnership found that only 18 States allowed youth mentoring \norganizations to access nationwide Federal Bureau of Investigation \nbackground searches. And, even when states do provide access to \nbackground checks, it can be expensive and time consuming.\n  With the PROTECT Act pilot we decided to give some groups a direct \nline towards obtaining a national background check from the FBI and \nobtaining a fitness determination by the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children to see whether the applicant could present a \npotential threat to children. Thanks to the hard work and commitment of \nNCMEC, the FBI, MENTOR/National Mentoring Partnership, and others this \npilot program has proven incredibly effective. During the course of the \npilot, we conducted roughly 37,000 background checks. Of these checks, \n6.1 percent of prospective volunteers were found to have a criminal \nrecord of concern--including very serious offenses like sexual abuse of \nminors, assaults, murder, and serious drug offenses. In all, this \nrepresents over 2,200 dangerous people we prevented from working as \nvolunteers with children. In addition, over 40 percent of the \nindividuals with criminal records had committed an offense in a state \nother than where they were applying to volunteer, meaning that a state-\nonly search would not have found relevant criminal records. In my view, \nthis speaks to the urgent need of expanding this pilot to more groups \nand towards making the program permanent.\n\n  Despite these successes, the pilot was limited in several respects. \nThe pilot was limited in scope with only a few youth-serving entities \nable to participate, and irregularities with respect to the annual \nappropriations process made it extremely difficult to operate the \nprogram to its fullest extent. With the legislation, we are introducing \ntoday, we build upon the lessons learned by taking the following steps: \nmake the program permanent, which will help ensure that long-term \ninvestments are made to make the program effective and inexpensive; \nestablish an Applicant Processing Center, APC, to assist youth serving \norganizations with the administrative tasks related to accessing the \nsystem, such as obtaining a fingerprint and handling billing with the \nFBI; and permanently establish and upgrade the fitness determination \nprocess at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n  In addition, we authorize the collection of a small surcharge to pay \nthe FBI fee and offset the expenses incurred by National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children and the Applicant Processing Center. \nWith literally millions of volunteers working with our Nation's youth \nevery year, it is imperative to provide a mechanism to allow more \nyouth-serving organizations access and ensure a steady stream of \nresources to allow the program to grow toward the goal of protecting \nmore children. This bill will do that.\n  Before closing, I want to touch on fee for service component which is \nadded to this bill. Of course, the goal has always been that the checks \nhave to be fast, inexpensive, and accurate for these checks to be \nsuitable for non-profit organizations. By adding a small surcharge to \nthe fee the FBI charges, we maintain that goal while expanding access. \nThe bottom line is this--youth-serving organizations have told us that \nthe ability to consistently obtain background checks and fitness \ndeterminations is critical and they will pay a little more to have \naccess. Because Federal resources are simply not sufficient to provide \nwide access, and because the ebb and flow of the appropriations process \ncreates instability with respect to how many checks can be completed, \nwe felt that a small surcharge was the right approach.\n  Even with the surcharge, we still keep the cost very low. The bill \ncalls for a fee no greater than $25 or the actual costs of preparing \nthe application, running the background check by the FBI, and making \nthe fitness determination by NCMEC for nonprofits. The applicant \nprocessing center created in this bill will collect this fee and make \nsure that all the costs are offset. And the goal is that this fee will \noffset all of the costs so that we can grow a system that is available \nto a wide range of entities that work with children. As of today, the \nAmerican Camp Association, the Afterschool Alliance, the America's \nPromise Alliance, Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, Boys and Girls \nClubs of America, Communities In Schools, Inc., First Focus, MENTOR/\nNational Mentoring Partnership, and YMCA of the USA all agree with this \napproach.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes $5 million in 2009 for startup costs \nand to develop new processes and technologies to automate and \nstreamline the functions to keep costs down. And, while it's not a part \nof this legislation, I hope that we can get some of our great \ntechnology companies to help us with this effort by possibly donating \nsome of their time, expertise, and ingenuity towards helping us \nautomate the process--especially with the fitness determination process \nat the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children which is a \ntime consuming, labor-intensive process involving the manual review of \ncriminal rap sheets. We formed a similar public-private partnership \nwhen we established the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and I hope \nwe will be able to replicate that success here. Once we get this bill \npassed, I will be reaching out to some of our best technology companies \nto see if they can help us ensure that these checks remain inexpensive \nand\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\navailable for as many youth-serving groups as possible.\n  I would once again like to thank my colleagues Senator Hatch's and \nSenator Specter's work on crafting this bill. We proved that we can \nhelp protect children at a low cost with the pilot program, and I \nbelieve that this bill will help expand access to a greater number of \ngroups so that we can grow that number of protected children \nexponentially. To me, this is exactly the kind of service that the \ngovernment owes to its people, and I look forward to its prompt passage \nbefore the expiration of the pilot program on July 30th, later this \nsummer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2756\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Protection \n     Improvements Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 2006, 61,200,000 adults (a total of 26.7 percent of \n     the population) contributed a total of 8,100,000,000 hours of \n     volunteer service. Of those who volunteer, 27 percent \n     dedicate their service to education or youth programs, or a \n     total of 16,500,000 adults.\n       (2) Assuming recent incarceration rates remain unchanged, \n     an estimated 6.6 percent of individuals in the United States \n     will serve time in prison for a crime during their lifetime. \n     The Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System of \n     the Federal Bureau of Investigation maintains fingerprints \n     and criminal histories on more than 47,000,000 individuals, \n     many of whom have been arrested or convicted multiple times.\n       (3) A study released in 2002, found that, of individuals \n     released from prison in 15 States in 1994, an estimated 67.5 \n     percent were rearrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor \n     within 3 years. Three-quarters of those new arrests resulted \n     in convictions or a new prison sentence.\n       (4) Given the large number of individuals with criminal \n     records and the vulnerability of the population they work \n     with, human service organizations that work with children \n     need an effective and reliable means of obtaining a complete \n     criminal history in order to determine the suitability of a \n     potential volunteer or employee.\n       (5) The large majority of Americans (88 percent) favor \n     granting youth-serving organizations access to conviction \n     records for screening volunteers and 59 percent favored \n     allowing youth-serving organizations to consider arrest \n     records when screening volunteers. This was the only use for \n     which a majority of those surveyed favored granting access to \n     arrest records.\n       (6) Congress has previously attempted to ensure that States \n     make Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal history record \n     checks available to organizations seeking to screen employees \n     and volunteers who work with children, the elderly, and \n     individuals with disabilities, through the National Child \n     Protection Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 5119 et seq.) and the \n     Volunteers for Children Act (Public Law 105-251; 112 Stat. \n     1885). However, according to a June 2006 report from the \n     Attorney General, these laws ``did not have the intended \n     impact of broadening the availability of NCPA checks.''. A \n     2007 survey conducted by MENTOR/National Mentoring \n     Partnership found that only 18 States allowed youth mentoring \n     organizations to access nationwide Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation background searches.\n       (7) Even when accessible, the cost of a criminal background \n     check can be prohibitively expensive, ranging from $5 to $75 \n     for a State fingerprint check, plus the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation fee, which ranges between $16 to $24, for a \n     total of between $21 and $99 for each volunteer or employee.\n       (8) Delays in processing such checks can also limit their \n     utility. While the Federal Bureau of Investigation processes \n     all civil fingerprint requests in less than 24 hours, State \n     response times vary widely, and can take as long as 42 days.\n       (9) The Child Safety Pilot Program under section 108 of the \n     PROTECT Act (42 U.S.C. 5119a note) revealed the importance of \n     performing fingerprint-based Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     criminal history record checks. Of 29,000 background checks \n     performed through the pilot as of March 2007, 6.4 percent of \n     volunteers were found to have a criminal record of concern, \n     including very serious offenses such as sexual abuse of \n     minors, assault, child cruelty, murder, and serious drug \n     offenses.\n       (10) In an analysis performed on the volunteers screened in \n     the first 18 months of the Child Safety Pilot Program, it was \n     found that over 25 percent of the individuals with criminal \n     records had committed an offense in a State other than the \n     State in which they were applying to volunteer, meaning that \n     a State-only search would not have found relevant criminal \n     results. In addition, even though volunteers knew a \n     background check was being performed, over 50 percent of the \n     individuals found to have a criminal record falsely indicated \n     on their application form that they did not have a criminal \n     record.\n       (11) The Child Safety Pilot Program also demonstrates that \n     timely and affordable background checks are possible, as \n     background checks under that program are completed within 3 \n     to 5 business days at a cost of $18.\n\n     SEC. 3. BACKGROUND CHECKS.\n\n       The National Child Protection Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 5119 \n     et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating section 5 as section 6; and\n       (2) by inserting after section 4 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 5.

A bill to provide for Kindergarten Plus programs; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nenhance opportunities for low-income children entering school. Today, I \nam introducing the Sandy Feldman Kindergarten Plus Act of 2008.\n  The Kindergarten Plus Act will provide children below 185 percent of \nthe poverty line with additional time in school during the summer \nbefore, and the summer after, their traditional kindergarten school \nyear to ensure that they enter school ready to succeed.\n  Too many low-income children enter school unprepared because they \nhave not had access to educational resources such as books and other \ntools for learning. Arriving at school already behind, many of these \nchildren find it difficult, if not impossible, to catch up academically \nto their more affluent peers.\n  When we consider the achievement gap between low-income children and \ntheir wealthier peers, it immediately becomes clear that we must do a \nbetter job of preparing these children for school. To prepare them for \nsuccess, we need to expose them to classroom practices earlier, \nintroduce them to critical educational concepts, and familiarize them \nwith school activities such as story or circle time. Ultimately, we \nneed to provide these students with a solid foundation that allows them \nto enter school with the skills necessary to become strong students.\n  Only 39 percent of low-income children, compared to about 85 percent \nof high-income children, can recognize letters of the alphabet upon \narrival in kindergarten. Moreover, low-income children often have a \nmore limited vocabulary. By the time they are in first grade, children \nin low-income families have, on average, 5,000 words in their \nvocabulary. In contrast, children from more affluent families enter \nschool with vocabularies of about 20,000 words. These startling \ndiscrepancies should tell us that more needs to be done to help all \nchildren enter school with an equal opportunity for success. \nKindergarten Plus strives to provide these opportunities and to lessen \nthe achievement gap by providing low-income children more support and \nadditional exposure to high-quality schooling.\n  This legislation was named after Sandy Feldman. As many of you know, \nSandy was a tireless advocate for children and public education. Her \ncommitment to social justice and her focus on early childhood education \nled her to develop the concept for this legislation, and it was Sandy \nwho spent countless hours developing the details to ensure this would \nbe a high-quality initiative. I was honored to have worked with Sandy \nin developing the initial legislation and am proud that this bill bears \nher name.\n  I am joined today in introducing this legislation by my colleagues \nSenators Lieberman and Durbin. This bill is supported by the American \nFederation of Teachers, National Education Association, Council of \nGreat City Schools, the Children's Defense Fund, Service Employees \nInternational Union, American Federation of State, County and Municipal \nEmployees, National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral \nAgencies, and Easter Seals. I urge my colleagues to join my effort and \ncosponsor this legislation. I encourage them to help launch low-income \nchildren on the path to school success.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2759\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Kindergarten Plus Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Kindergarten has proven to be a beneficial experience \n     for children, putting children on a path that positively \n     influences their learning and development in later school \n     years.\n       (2) Kindergarten and the years leading up to kindergarten \n     are critical in preparing children to succeed in elementary \n     school, especially if the children are from low-income \n     families or have other risks of difficulty in school.\n       (3) Disadvantaged children, on average, lag behind other \n     children in literacy, numeracy, and social skills, even \n     before formal schooling begins.\n       (4) For many children entering kindergarten, the \n     achievement gap between children from low-income households \n     compared to children from high-income households is already \n     evident.\n       (5) Eighty-five percent of beginning kindergartners in the \n     highest socioeconomic group, compared to 39 percent in the \n     lowest socioeconomic group, can recognize letters of the \n     alphabet. Similarly, 98 percent of beginning kindergartners \n     in the highest socioeconomic group, compared to 84 percent of \n     their peers in the lowest socioeconomic group, can recognize \n     numbers and shapes.\n       (6) Once disadvantaged children are in school, they learn \n     at the same rate as other children. Therefore, providing \n     disadvantaged children with additional time in kindergarten, \n     in the summer before such children ordinarily enter \n     kindergarten and in the summer before first grade, will help \n     schools close achievement gaps and accelerate the academic \n     progress of their disadvantaged students.\n       (7) High quality, extended-year kindergarten that provides \n     children with enriched learning experiences is an important \n     factor in helping to close achievement gaps, rather than \n     having the gaps continue to widen.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance the \nnational defense through empowerment of the National Guard, enhancement \nof the functions of the National Guard Bureau, and improvement of \nFederal-State military coordination in domestic emergency response, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am pleased again to join my friend \nand colleague Senator Kit Bond of Missouri in bringing to the Senate \nanother matter of importance to the missions of the National Guard and \nto the dedicated men and women of the Guard who perform these missions.\n  Today we are introducing the National Guard Empowerment and State-\nNational Defense Integration Act of 2008. We introduce this legislation \non behalf of the 91-member U.S. Senate National Guard Caucus, which we \nco-chair. The military is still not structured properly to respond to \nthe domestic emergencies that we know will come again. This legislation \nwould take us tangible steps forward in correcting that. Our bill would \nsharpen the Defense Department's focus on helping the National Guard \nrespond to domestic emergencies.\n  This legislation is a new phase in our bipartisan and bicameral drive \nto empower the Guard for successfully meeting the challenges that our \nStates and the Nation are asking the Guard to meet. It would clear away \nbureaucratic cobwebs in the Defense Department's organizational \nstructure to improve decision making on homeland defense issues that \ninvolve the Guard. This bill builds on some of the strong provisions \nenacted from the previous version of the Guard Empowerment Bill in the \nrecently enacted fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization Bill. By \nempowering the National Guard through more responsibilities, \nauthorities, and new lines of control, this bill focuses the Defense \nDepartment's attention on this critical realm of domestic defense. The \nbill structures potential military operations within the U.S. in a way \noutlined by the Constitution, ensuring local and State control--not \nFederal control--in these emergencies.\n  We know that the military--the active duty force, the National Guard, \nand the Reserves--has an important role in responding to emergencies at \nhome, events like natural disasters. The events of Hurricane Katrina \nand so many other situations have amply underscored that reality. Our \ncivilian authorities will continue to want to tap into the resources, \npersonnel, and expertise, and there is no question that we need a \nsystem that permits that. The debate taking place, mostly behind the \nscenes and within the walls of the Pentagon, has been about how we \nstructure that response. The goal must be an effective response in line \nwith the Constitution. Our national charter protects our basic \nliberties and places sovereignty in the hands of the people through \ngovernment with adequate checks and balances, splitting administration \namong Federal, State, and local levels.\n  This Empowerment Bill would be effective because it drives to enhance \nthe National Guard, our first military responders. This force has \nstepped up during dire situations time and time again. The National \nGuard takes its responsibility to carry out relief missions at home as \nseriously as it takes its missions abroad as the nation's primary \nmilitary reserve. The National Guard is a locally based force, spread \nout in armories and readiness centers across the country. The Guard can \nflow forces among States through the Emergency Management Assistance \nCompacts process, which helped make the force one of the few shining \nlights in the darkness of the response to Hurricane Katrina. The \nNational Guard has units that specialize in civil support, including \nhighly trained, full-time teams located in every one of our States. The \nbottom line is that the Guard has shown that it can do this mission and \ndo it superbly.\n\n  The approach of the Empowerment Bill is constitutional because it \nproperly involves every layer of Government. It is our mayors, our \npublic safety chiefs, and our Governors who are responsible for the \nsecurity of their communities. Under our governmental system, they are \nthe ones that should be in control of emergency situations and any \nFederal assets that come in should be strictly in support of them--\ncertainly not the other way around. The Guard is a State force that \nworks closely with these civilian authorities all the time. The Guard, \nwhich serves under the command of the Governors, is part and parcel of \nthe community. The Guard knows that it is civilians, including their \nelected leaders and the populace, who are the ultimate decision-makers \nin these situations.\n  Our bill includes several key provisions. To improve the quality of \nadvice at the highest levels, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau \nwould gain a full seat on the Joint Chief of Staff, a key advisory body \nwhere insufficient attention is paid to homeland defense matters. The \nbill would ensure that U.S. Northern Command remains a Federal military \nheadquarters that truly supports the Governors and the initial Guard \nresponse in an emergency, providing for the Governors to have tactical \ncontrol over any active duty and Reserve assets that might be operating \nin their home State during an emergency. The National Guard Bureau is \nenhanced in another section which specifically gives the National Guard \na separate budget to purchase domestic defense-oriented items. The \nBureau would carry out its responsibilities in close cooperation with a \nnewly\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\nestablished planning committee and council that integrally involves the \nStates' Adjutants General. And the bill assigns several key command and \ndeputy command positions to National Guard officers who have experience \nin homeland defense and domestic emergency response matters.\n  This fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization Bill ushered in several \nimprovements to the National Guard, including an elevation of the \nBureau Chief to the rank of four-star general. The National Guard \nBureau is now more a joint agency than a sub-branch of the Army and the \nAir Force, though the Guard remains a key part of the Army and Air \nForce's Total Force. The Deputy Commander or Commander of U.S. Northern \nCommand now must come from the ranks of the National Guard. These are \nfar-reaching steps, though I remain concerned that the Department has \nyet to implement these provisions, not even filling the four-star \nposition yet.\n  Together, last year's enacted organizational changes and those put \nforth in this bill will fundamentally improve our preparations for an \nemergency, and ensure an effective, swift, and constitutional response \nwhen another emergency occurs.\n  Our National Guard has never let our country down, and--once again--\nwe cannot let our Guard down. I urge prompt attention and action on \nthis vital legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nsupporting material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2760\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Your legislation is the logical next step in fully \n     codifying the initiatives that had their birth two years ago \n     in the National Guard Empowerment Act.\n       With the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for 2008, many of the substantive elements of ``empowerment'' \n     for the National Guard have been presented to the Department \n     of Defense for immediate implementation in accordance with \n     the wishes of the Congress. We are eagerly awaiting their \n     timely response.\n       Meanwhile, we support the additional well-reasoned \n     legislative remedies contained in your new bill that will \n     knit together the missing pieces of the empowerment concept. \n     In our view, empowerment for the National Guard is simply a \n     restatement, in contemporary language, of the reliance placed \n     on the National Guard by the framers of the United States \n     Constitution in Article 1, Section 8.\n       Thank you for leading this effort for the American people.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Stephen M.

This legislation will take the next logical step in \n     advancing the gains of the National Guard Empowerment Act and \n     ensuring the intent of that legislation is met.\n       We understand and appreciate just how hard you and the \n     entire Guard Caucus worked to gain passage of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for 2008, which gave birth to \n     ``empowerment'' for the National Guard. However, the \n     realization of empowerment has been slow to materialize. With \n     the introduction of this legislation, we are hopeful that the \n     Department of Defense will act in accordance with the wishes \n     of the Congress.\n       Again, we thank you for your new bill which will serve to \n     complete the vision of the empowerment concept, which had its \n     genesis two years ago with the original National Guard \n     Empowerment Act. It is clear that empowerment for the \n     National Guard remains a priority of the Congress.\n       We thank you for your continuing efforts on the National \n     Guard's behalf.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Francis D.

These valuable and necessary provisions must be \n     addressed and are addressed in your legislation.\n       Our association stands firm in support of your action to \n     remedy this error of omission. The lack of respect of the \n     leadership of the National Guard by service secretaries and \n     leaders, the consistent under-funding of National Guard \n     appropriations accounts, and the intentional lack of \n     communication and coordination all have the possibility of \n     being rectified by this legislation by making the Chief a \n     full partner in the decision-making and appropriations \n     process.\n       Thank you for taking legislative action that is not only \n     timely, but unfortunately necessary, and long overdue. We \n     look forward to working with your staff as this legislation \n     works its way into law.\n       Working for America's Best!\n\n                                             Michael P.

A bill to prioritize the provision of assistance to combat \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria to in-need countries; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the \nreauthorization of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, also \nknown as PEPFAR.\n  The program authorized in 2003 provided $15 billion over 5 years to \nthe cause of AIDS relief in parts of the world ravaged by that disease. \nPEPFAR was a demonstration of the American people's desire to help \nthose in need.\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\n  The 2003 legislation was also a demonstration of the American \npeople's desire that their generosity not be wasted, as they have seen \nbefore with so many other aid programs. To that end, the legislation \nrequired that the lion's share of the funds be devoted to treatment of \npatients in need.\n  It encouraged accountability and transparency and it funded programs \nthat could demonstrate results, such as the requirement that one third \nof prevention funds be spent on abstinence education programs--a \ndecision that has kept countless persons from getting infected with HIV \nsince 2003.\n  It is therefore mind boggling to me that recent reauthorization \nproposals the bill passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee last \nweek and the bill scheduled for mark up by the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee today--would take such giant steps backward.\n  The bill originally introduced in the House would have eliminated the \nconscience clause, which protects humanitarian and medical \nprofessionals involved in these programs from having to participate in \nprevention and treatment methods that they find morally or religiously \nobjectionable. Wisely, this provision was kept in the bill passed by \nthe House committee, though it is substantially watered down--to the \npoint of being nonbinding--in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nbill.\n  The original House bill struck the requirement that organizations \nthat receive PEPFAR grants be opposed to prostitution and sex \ntrafficking. That these commonsense provisions were even in danger of \nbeing dropped in the reauthorization of PEPFAR is sadly telling. It \nappears the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chose not to challenge \nsuch an unimpeachable provision of law.\n  And, unlike the majority on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, \nwhich backed down from including many troubling provisions on abortion \nand family planning demanded by far left groups, it appears the Senate \nCommittee bill would pander to the so-called ``family planning'' \nagenda.\n  I am also deeply troubled that both the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee reauthorization \nproposals remove the requirement that at least fifty-five percent of \nthe funds in the program be spent on treatment of AIDS patients. This \nprovision was an important check on bureaucratic wastefulness and \n``make work'' and it must be preserved.\n  Additionally, the requirement that thirty-three percent of PEPFAR \nprevention funds be spent on abstinence education, removed by the \nmajority in last year's omnibus appropriations process, has not been \nrestored in either of these two reauthorization proposals. In fact, all \nthat remains in the tatters of that requirement in either of these \nbills is something only a bureaucrat could love: in the event a future \nAIDS coordinator chooses to ignore abstinence education, a report must \nbe sent to Congress.\n  What is more, both of these reauthorization proposals include \nprovisions that appear to undermine protections for intellectual \nproperty, the same protections that are necessary to ensure that \ninnovation and research into life-saving medications continue.\n  While I am sure the sponsors of these two proposals are well-meaning, \nthey further increase support for TB and malaria programs, even though \nthe U.S. is already the largest contributor to TB and malaria programs \nthrough the Global Fund. Sadly, the Global Fund has become synonymous \nwith graft and multilateral bureaucratic waste in many countries. We \nshould not be duplicating those existing programs. We owe it to the \nAmerican taxpayer, and those people suffering from these dreaded \ndiseases, to fix the problems that abound in the Global Fund.\n  Lastly, but most significantly, both reauthorization proposals more \nthan triple the expenditure for PEPFAR--something we simply cannot \nafford. PEPFAR 2003 authorized $15 billion over 5 years for emergency \nAIDS relief. Not satisfied with a mere doubling of this program as \nrequested, both of these proposals would provide $50 billion over 5 \nyears.\n  As I have noted already, the American people are a generous people. \nOur annual foreign aid budget reflects this generosity. However, this \nability to give is not limitless.\n  Need I remind my colleagues, our economy is in distress. The \npresidential candidates on the other side are calling for a Federal \nGovernment bailout of homeowners facing foreclosure: with $50 billion, \nwe could provide 235,157 homeowners with such a bailout.\n  Moreover, Congress just passed, and the president just signed, a \nprogram to provide Americans with checks intended to stimulate the \neconomy. While I have doubts that this plan will succeed, I note that \nwith this $50 billion, 157 million tax filers could be given rebate \nchecks of $318.47.\n  Alternatively, with $50 billion, we could ``fully fund'' both No \nChild Left Behind and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \nat their authorized levels for one year.\n  Congress is beginning the annual budget cycle and we are daily \nconfronted with requests for more and more federal spending. Already, \nkey leaders in the budget process are threatening that if they don't \nget their way on domestic spending, they will add their spending to the \nforthcoming but overdue War Supplemental or will short circuit the \nbudget process with a continuing resolution or yet another omnibus. \nAgreeing to this massive increase is not the way to discipline what is \nalready shaping up to be a budget train wreck.\n  Governing is about choosing. By agreeing to this increase to $50 \nbillion, neither the House nor Senate committees are governing. They \nare taking the easy course of action: spending.\n  I supported the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in 2003. I \ncould reluctantly support doubling that amount over the next five \nyears. But adding another $20 billion on top of that is too much.\n  We cannot lose sight of the sacrifices of millions of Americans who \nwork hard and pay the taxes that support these programs. $50 billion is \ntoo much.\n  I cannot support a bill that so dramatically spends beyond what we \ncan afford and so wantonly ignores accountability and transparency \ntools that safeguard the generosity of the American people.\n  This legislation can still be salvaged.\n  Yesterday, I cosponsored legislation with the Senator from Oklahoma, \nDr. Coburn, and the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Burr, that sets \nsome key principles that must be a part of the reauthorization.\n  Earlier today, I introduced a bill that would prohibit the extension \nof PEPFAR funds away from their core purpose, helping the neediest \ncountries. This legislation must also be a part of the reauthorization \nof PEPFAR.\n  I support the PEPFAR program and I believe that it is worth passage \nif funded at a responsible authorization level with at least the kind \nof commonsense policy, accountability, and transparency provided in the \n2003 bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 2767. A bill to provide for judicial discretion regarding \nsuspensions of student eligibility under section 484(r) of the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to add \njudicial discretion to the Higher Education Act Aid Elimination \nPenalty. Since 1998 the law prevents any student convicted of \npossession of a controlled substance from receiving Federal financial \naid.\n  Since the penalty was enacted, approximately 200,000 low to middle\nincome students seeking a college education have been disqualified from \nreceiving Federal financial assistance. In many cases, these are \ncommitted young people who simply want to make better lives for \nthemselves. In order to be eligible for financial aid in the first \nplace, these students have proven they can perform academically. \nUnfortunately, they have made the mistake many young people have made \nexperimenting with drugs.\n  Just like every Senator in this chamber, I want to help keep \nAmerica's young people from making this mistake and jeopardizing their \nhealth and their futures. We should all work to enact policies that \neffectively deter dangerous drug use. But this is a sophisticated and \ncomplicated issue and it cannot be solved by blunt measures such as the \nAid Elimination Penalty.\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\n  Any drug abuse expert will tell you that helping someone get off of \ndrugs or stay away from trying them requires a variety of approaches. \nIn some cases the fear of consequences, such as the Aid Elimination \nPenalty, may be enough. But in many other cases, counseling, \nrehabilitation, and positive reinforcement may offer more effective \nways to achieve this goal.\n  Our laws should reflect the need for varied approaches. \nUnfortunately, the Aid Elimination Penalty does not. It is a blunt tool \nthat sweeps all cases into the same one size fits all solution. There \nis little distinction under this law as to whether the drug possession \nis a major or minor violation and to what degree the infraction affects \nthe community at large; Teenagers bowing to peer-pressure for the first \ntime are treated the same as serious drug users disrupting their \ncommunities. This means that while in some cases we are penalizing \nchronic drug abusers, we are also penalizing good students who will \nmature and have a better chance of rectifying their mistakes by \ncontinuing their education.\n  What is most disturbing is how the consequences of the penalty can \nnegatively impact the course of a student's life. Many students \naffected by the Aid Elimination Penalty are forced to leave school \nsince it is no longer affordable without financial assistance. Data \nfrom the National Center of Education Statistics demonstrates that many \nof these students will not continue their education: 36 percent of \nstudents who leave 4-year institutions do not return within 5 years and \n50 percent of students who leave 2-year institutions do not return \nwithin 5 years. For these students, denial of Federal college \nassistance will only force them from school, and may set them on an \neven more self destructive course of increased drug use and abuse. In \nthese cases, the Aid Elimination Penalty actually backfires and serves \nto undermine our efforts to prevent the use and abuse of drugs.\n  That is why I am introducing this legislation to insert judicial \ndiscretion into the current law. My bill would make the penalty \ndependent on the ruling of a judge, allowing them to weigh the value of \nimplementing the penalty as part of other sanctions and punishments on \na case by case basis. This will enable the judge to deny student \nfinancial aid if the situation merits it, and if he or she believes it \nis the most effective or even the only way to help a student get \ncontrol of his or her life. This legislation would also grant judges \nthe ability, based on the circumstances, to determine that continuation \nof a college education, in conjunction with rehabilitation and possibly \nother sanctions, offers both the student and the community the best \npossible outcome. This is the way the rest of the criminal justice \nsystem works and it is the way the Aid Elimination Penalty should be \nimplemented. With this change we can fine tune our approach to this \nproblem and minimize the negative unintended consequences of current \nlaw. I urge my colleagues to see the wisdom of this approach and help \nme to refine the law to be more effective in protecting our communities \nand ensuring deserving students the opportunity to advance their \neducation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2767\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide a temporary increase in the maximum loan \nguaranty amount for certain housing loans guaranteed by the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that would rectify \nan oversight made in the recent passage of the Economic Stimulus Act of \n2008. If enacted, this bill will allow thousands of veterans to realize \nthe American dream of owning a home. Senators Reid, Durbin, Burr, \nRockefeller, Murray, Obama, Sanders, Brown, Baucus, Clinton, Kerry, and \nBoxer join me in offering this legislation.\n  The VA Home Loan Guaranty was part of the original GI Bill in 1944. \nIt was signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and provided \nveterans with a federally guaranteed home loan with no down payment. \nSo, as World War II was ending, landmark legislation made the dream of \nhome ownership a reality for millions of returning veterans. They were \nable to build new homes and otherwise begin new lives following their \nservice and with the assistance of the Federal Government.\n  Today, more than 25 million veterans and servicemembers are eligible \nfor VA home loan guarantees. Eligibility extends to veterans who served \non active duty for a minimum of 90 days during wartime or a minimum of \n181 continuous days during peacetime, and have a discharge other than \ndishonorable. Members of the Guard and Reserve who have never been \ncalled to active duty must serve a total of 6 years in order to be \neligible. Certain surviving spouses are also eligible for the housing \nguarantee.\n  The amount of the home loan guaranty was last adjusted by the \nVeterans Benefits Act of 2004. The maximum guaranty amount was \nincreased to 25 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit \ndetermined under section 305(a)(2) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage \nCorporation Act for a single family residence, as adjusted for the year \ninvolved. Using that formula, since the Freddie Mac conforming loan \nlimit for a single family residence in 2008 is $417,000, VA will \nguaranty a veteran's loan up to $104,250, or 25 percent of the Freddie \nMac limit. This guaranty exempts homeowners from having to make a down \npayment or secure private mortgage insurance.\n  The newly-enacted Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, however, temporarily \nreset the Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA home loan guarantee limits \nto 125 percent of metropolitan-area median home prices, without \nreference to the VA home loan program. This had the effect of raising \nthe Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac limits to nearly $730,000, in the \nhighest cost areas, while leaving the VA limit of $417,000 in place.\n  The measure I am introducing today would correct the oversight in the \nEconomic Stimulus Act and extend the temporary increase to veterans as \nwell.\n  Unlike the economic stimulus legislation, my legislation would extend \nthe temporary increase to December 31, 2011, rather than just through \n2008. This would enable more veterans to utilize their VA benefit to \npurchase a home. In fact, VA expects that there would be an increase of \napproximately 4,313 loans as a result of increasing the VA loan limit \nthrough December 2011.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure, so that this \nimportant group of Americans might reap the benefits of an increased \nhome loan guaranty in this time of economic uncertainty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2768\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This bill will \nprovide penalties for those who are caught trying to slaughter \n``nonambulatory'' or downed animals for food, and will improve public \nnotification procedures for voluntary food recalls.\n  First, this bill would ban the slaughter of ``nonambulatory'' animals \nfor use in food.\n  Second, it would establish a graduated penalty system providing \nincentives for slaughter facilities to follow the law regarding \nnonambulatory animals; and; third, in the event of a meat or poultry \nrecall, it would direct the USDA to release the names of establishments \nthat have received the recalled products so consumers can more easily \nidentify products that could be harmful.\n  Animals that are sick and too weak to stand or walk on their own \nshould not be slaughtered and used for food.\n  The safety of our food supply is too important to take any chances.\n  Processing downed animals poses a health risk especially to \nvulnerable populations, those who have compromised immune systems, and \nthe very young and elderly who rely on our Government food inspection \nsystem to protect them against foodborne illness.\n  On February 17, 2008, the Westland/Hallmark Meat Company in Chino, \nCA, issued a recall of over 143 million pounds of beef products that \nwere processed at their plant.\n  This came after the Humane Society of the U.S. released a video \nshowing workers abusing nonambulatory cows to get them on their feet \nfor slaughter.\n  The recall brought to the forefront the risk associated with \nprocessing sick or injured animals for human consumption.\n  The potential health risk of slaughtering downed animals became a \npublic concern in late 2003 when a cow imported from Canada was found \nto have BSE, mad cow disease.\n  In an effort to keep BSE infected beef out of the food supply, USDA \nbanned all nonambulatory cattle from being slaughtered regardless of \nthe reason.\n  Since then, the regulation banning nonambulatory cattle from \nslaughter has been revised to allow USDA veterinarians discretion on a \ncase-by-case basis to allow downed cattle into the food supply.\n  Clearly, establishments have an incentive to keep all the animals \ndelivered to their facility ambulatory for slaughter.\n  This legislation provides the incentive for an establishment to \nfollow the laws and regulations governing the humane handling of \nnonambulatory animals by offering a graduated penalty system for \nnoncompliance.\n  For a first violation, in addition to temporarily suspending USDA \ninspection, a fine will be assessed and will be based on a percentage \nof the establishment's gross income.\n  A second violation will suspend USDA inspection services for 1 year.\n  A third violation will withdraw the establishment's Grant of \nInspection permanently, effectively closing the operation.\n  Additionally, to aid in recovering all of the meat products that are \nrecalled, the USDA will be required to promulgate regulation to release \nthe names of establishments that have received recalled products.\n  This will help distributors, retailers and consumers better identify \nproducts that have been recalled to aid them in getting those products \noff their shelves and out of their homes.\n  We must ensure that those who process our food provide the safest, \nmost wholesome products possible to consumers, and when a recall is \nnecessary, we must provide the best notification systems for consumers \nto take action.\n  This bill will take us one step closer to a safer more wholesome food \nsupply system.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join us in support of this important \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Hagel, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Bayh, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Casey, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2771. A bill to require the President to call a White House \nConference on Children and Youth in 2010; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce with \nSenator Hagel legislation that would reinstate the White House \nConference on Children and Youth. This Conference was originally \ncreated by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909, and continued every 10 \nyears through 1970. Despite funding in 1981 and reauthorization \nlegislation in 1990, no conference has been held since that 1970 \ngathering. It is time to renew our commitment to America's children and \nresurrect the oldest White House Conference in U.S. history.\n  Similar to the White House Conference on Aging, this symposium would \nbe the culmination of nationwide events held over a 2-year span. Just \nas with the first White House Conference, this summit would focus on \nchild welfare issues. The legislation authorizes a conference to be \nheld in 2010, and establishes a bipartisan, bicameral policy committee, \nincluding members selected by the next administration. To promote and \ninform the conference and to engage stakeholders, State and local \nevents would be held around the country in 2009. These events and the \nconference would focus specifically on child welfare including the \nrange of issues from prevention, intervention to permanency including \nreunification, kinship care and adoption. Participants would also \ninclude state officials, court and legal representatives, providers, \nchildren, tribal representatives and other parties affected by or \ninvolved with the child welfare system. By connecting these \nstakeholders through this conference, we can improve the lives of \nchildren throughout the country.\n  Previous conferences have led to major policy improvements in child \nwelfare. The Children's Bureau was established after the first \nconference, and recommendations were made that deemphasized the \ninstitutionalization of children and encouraged the growth of adoption \nagencies. In 1919, the White House Conference initiated standards for \nchild welfare, and ten years later it created a 19-point charter to \naddress the needs of our children.\n  We look forward to comparable achievements from the conference in \n2010, and hope that you will join with us in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2771\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``White House Conference on \n     Children and Youth in 2010 Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 2005 there were over 3,000,000 reports of child \n     abuse and neglect. Only 60 percent of the children from the \n     substantiated reports received follow-up services, and 20 \n     percent of such children were placed in foster care as a \n     result of an investigation.\n       (2) Each year there are nearly 900,000 substantiated \n     reports of child abuse and neglect.\n       (3) Each year approximately 60 percent of such \n     substantiated reports are reports of neglect, 30 percent are \n     physical or sexual abuse reports, and more than 20 percent \n     are reports that involve other forms of abuse.\n       (4) Almost 500,000 children (including youth) were in \n     foster care at the end of fiscal year 2004 and nearly 800,000 \n     spent at least some time in foster care during the year.\n       (5) While 51,000 children are adopted from the foster care \n     system each year, more than 117,000 children are waiting to \n     be adopted.\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\n       (6) Each year approximately 22,000 youth leave the foster \n     care system not because they have found permanent placements, \n     but because they have reached the age at which foster care \n     ends.\n       (7) The child welfare system includes State and local \n     governments, tribal governments, child welfare agencies, \n     child welfare caseworkers, private agencies, social workers, \n     the courts, volunteer court-appointed special advocates, \n     mental health and health care professionals, educators, and \n     advocates.\n       (8) There is an overrepresentation of certain populations, \n     including Native Americans and African-Americans, in the \n     child welfare system.\n       (9) The number of children being raised by grandparents and \n     other relatives is increasing and exceeds 6,000,000 children. \n     The Government recognized that kinship care is a permanency \n     option through the enactment of the Adoption and Safe \n     Families Act of 1997.\n       (10) The State courts make key decisions in the lives of \n     children involved in the child welfare system, including \n     decisions about whether children have been victims of child \n     abuse, whether parental rights should be terminated, and \n     whether children should be reunified with their families, \n     adopted, or placed in other settings.\n       (11) The child welfare system will never fully address its \n     primary mission unless the courts are an integral and \n     functioning component of a statewide system of care and \n     protection.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of Congress that--\n       (1) the Government should work jointly with the States and \n     their residents to develop recommendations and plans for \n     action to meet the challenges and needs of children and \n     families involved with the child welfare system, consistent \n     with this Act;\n       (2) in developing such recommendations and plans, the \n     persons involved should emphasize the role of the Government, \n     State and local child welfare systems, State and local family \n     court systems, child welfare advocates, guardians, and other \n     key participants in such child welfare systems, with a goal \n     of enhancing and protecting the lives and well-being of \n     children and families who are involved with such child \n     welfare systems; and\n       (3) Federal, State, and local programs and policies should \n     be developed to reduce the number of children who are abused \n     and neglected, to reduce the number of children in foster \n     care, and to dramatically increase the number of children in \n     permanent placements through family reunification, kinship \n     placement, and adoption.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF THE CONFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Call the Conference.--The President shall \n     call a White House Conference on Children and Youth in 2010 \n     (referred to in this Act as ``the Conference''), to be \n     convened not later than 18 months after the selection of the \n     last member of the Policy Committee established in section 4, \n     to encourage improvements in each State and local child \n     welfare system, and to develop recommendations for actions to \n     implement the policy set forth in section 2(b).\n       (b) Planning and Direction.--The Secretary shall plan, \n     convene, and conduct the Conference in cooperation with the \n     heads of other appropriate Federal entities, including the \n     Attorney General, the Secretary of Education, and the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n       (c) Purposes of the Conference.--The purposes of the \n     Conference are--\n       (1) to identify the problems and challenges of child abuse \n     and neglect, and the needs of the children and families \n     affected by decisions made through the child welfare system;\n       (2) to strengthen the use of research-based best practices \n     that can prevent child abuse and neglect with a special focus \n     on younger children;\n       (3) to strengthen the use of research-based best practices \n     that can increase placement permanency for children removed \n     from their homes, including practices involving family \n     reunification, kinship placement, and adoption;\n       (4) to promote the role of State and local family courts in \n     each State child welfare system;\n       (5) to develop recommendations that will reduce the number \n     of children who are in out-of-home care and who fail to leave \n     foster care before the age of majority, and recommendations \n     that will reduce the over representation of certain \n     populations in the child welfare system;\n       (6) to examine the role of the Government in building an \n     equal partnership with State, local, and tribal entities in \n     order to assist with, and encourage, State, local, and tribal \n     coordination;\n       (7) to develop such specific and comprehensive \n     recommendations for State-level executive and legislative \n     action as may be appropriate for maintaining and improving \n     the well-being of children in such system; and\n       (8) to review the status of recommendations regarding child \n     welfare made by previous White House conferences.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to provide for the appointment of additional Federal \ncircuit and district judges, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I join with Senator Hatch to \nintroduce a bipartisan bill to address the resource needs of our men \nand women on the Federal judiciary and people around the country by \nauthorizing additional U.S. courts of appeals and district court \njudgeships. It has been 18 years since the last time a comprehensive \njudgeship bill was enacted to address the growth in the workload of the \nFederal judiciary by adding new Federal judgeships. That legislation \nestablished 11 additional circuit court judgeships and 61 permanent and \n13 temporary district court judgeships.\n  Since 1990, case filings in our Federal appellate courts have \nincreased by 55 percent and case filings on our district courts have \nrisen by 29 percent. Without a comprehensive bill, Congress has \nproceeded to authorize only a few additional district court judgeships \nand extend temporary judgeships when it could. For instance, in 2002 we \nwere able to provide for 15 new judgeships in the Department of Justice \nauthorization bill. However no additional circuit court judgeships have \nbeen created since 1990 despite their increased workload.\n  In 2006, the weighted number of filings in district courts, which \ntakes into account an assessment of case complexity, were 464 per \njudgeship, well above the Judicial Conference's standard. The same \nyear, the national average circuit court caseload per three-judge panel \napproached the record number of 1,230 cases, recorded a year earlier.\n  Our Federal judges are working harder than ever, but in order to \nmaintain the integrity of the Federal courts and the promptness that \njustice demands, judges must have a manageable workload. The bill that \nwe are introducing today would add 12 permanent circuit court \njudgeships, 38 permanent district court judgeships, and convert five \nexisting temporary judgeships into permanent positions. These \nadditional judgeships would address the significant increase in \ncaseloads that the Federal courts have seen over the nearly two decades \nsince the last comprehensive judgeship bill was enacted. It is based on \nthe recommendations of the Judicial Conference and its analysis of \ncaseloads and needs.\n  Our bipartisan bill would also add 14 temporary district court \njudgeships, two temporary circuit court judgeships, and extend one \nexisting temporary district court judgeship. These additional temporary \njudgeships allow Congress some flexibility with regard\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\nto future judgeship needs. If caseloads continue to increase, Congress \nhas the option to introduce legislation making permanent or renewing \nthese temporary judgeships.\n  By providing that these new judgeships become effective the day after \nthe inauguration of the next President, we attempt to insulate this \neffort from partisan politics.\n  This bill has the support of the Judicial Conference and Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle. I thank Senators Feinstein and Schumer for \njoining us in this effort. A comprehensive bill to respond to the \nincreasing workload of our Federal judiciary is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2774\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--This Act (including the amendments made by \n     this Act) shall take effect on January 21, 2009.\n       (b) Coordination Rule.--The amendments made by this Act \n     shall take effect after the amendment made by section \n     509(a)(2) of the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007 \n     (Public Law 110-177; 121 Stat 2543).\n\n  MR. HATCH. Mr. President, Americans are blessed to have the best and \nmost independent judicial system in the world. In our constitutional \nframework, Congress has responsibility to both make the laws and ensure \nthat the judiciary tasked with interpreting and applying those laws has \nthe appropriate resources. This includes addressing the staffing and \ncompensation needs of the judicial branch, and we should strive to do \nso without political gambles or speculation about the outcome of a \nPresidential election.\n  For that reason, when I chaired the Judiciary Committee I sponsored \nand cosponsored judgeship bills in 2000 when Bill Clinton was President \nand in the 108th Congress under the current President. And that is why \nI am cosponsoring this bill with Senator Leahy, the current Judiciary \nCommittee, chairman. It is based on the judicial conference's \nassessment of their needs, not on backroom political deals, and it \nreflects the changes to the allocation of appeals court seats made in \nS. 378, the Court Security Improvement Act, which I also cosponsored.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Obama, Mr. Harkin, and Mrs. \n        Clinton):\n  S. 2775. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nSocial Security Act to treat certain domestically controlled foreign \npersons performing services under contract with the United States \nGovernment as American employers for purposes of certain employment \ntaxes and benefits; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Representatives Ellsworth and Emanuel \nand Senator Obama and I are introducing the Fair Share Act of 2008 \nwhich ends the practice of U.S. Government contractors setting up shell \ncompanies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes. On March 6 \n2008, Farah Stockman of the Boston Globe reported that Kellogg, Brown \nand Root Inc. KBR, has avoided payroll taxes by hiring workers through \nshell companies in the Cayman Islands. The article estimates that \nhundreds of millions of dollars in payroll taxes have been avoided a \ndisturbing, yet not all too surprising discovery.\n  KBR is an American engineering and construction company, formerly a \nsubsidiary of Halliburton, based in Houston, TX. Throughout its \nhistory, KBR and its predecessors have won numerous contracts with the \nUnited States military. In recent years, however, many of these \ncontracts have been called into question based on everything from \nwasteful spending to mismanagement and lack of competition. The evasion \nof payroll taxes is yet one more serious misstep.\n  The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U.S. Government \ncontractors setting up shell companies in foreign jurisdictions to \navoid payroll taxes. The legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code \nand the Social Security Act to treat foreign subsidiaries of U.S. \ncompanies performing services under contract with the U.S. Government \nas American employers for the purpose of Social Security and Medicare \npayroll taxes. The legislation will apply to foreign subsidiaries of a \nU.S. parent. The degree of common ownership applied by the legislation \nis 50 percent, meaning that the U.S. parent would have to own more than \n50 percent of the subsidiary.\n  In addition, the legislation addresses the situation in which a U.S. \nsubsidiary of a foreign corporation subcontracts with its foreign \nsubsidiary to perform a contract with the U.S Government. In this \nsituation, the legislation would apply to wages paid by the foreign \nsubsidiary to its U.S. employees. The legislation does not address the \nsituation in which the foreign parent contracts directly with the U.S. \nGovernment. Present law will continue to apply to totalization \nagreements. The legislation applies to services performed after the \ndate of enactment.\n  The bottom line is this: Federal contractors should not be allowed to \nuse tax loopholes to avoid paying U.S. Medicare and Social Security \ntaxes on behalf of their American employees working in Iraq. \nFurthermore, KBR should not have a competitive advantage over its U.S. \ncompetitors because it sets up sham corporations to avoid paying its \nfair share of U.S. payroll taxes. Failing to contribute to Social \nSecurity and Medicare thousands of times over is not shielding the \ntaxpayers they claim to protect, it is costing our citizens.\n  At a time when as much as $300 billion per year in taxes goes \nuncollected by the government, and by some estimates more than a third \nof that money may be related to corporations using offshore tax havens, \nwe should close every loophole possible.\n  Just last week, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, went to \nthe Caymans to investigate U.S. companies' offshore operations. The GAO \nwent to look at the buildings where U.S. corporations locate shell \ncorporations. These corporations are often nothing more than a computer \nfile. According to the Boston Globe, the KBR Cayman Island corporations \ndo not even have an office or a phone number. I commend Senators Baucus \nand Grassley for requesting this investigation.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I will continue working to \nclose corporate loopholes that are fueled by greed.

A bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation \nAct of 1977 to clarify that uncertified States and Indian tribes have \nthe authority to use certain payments for certain noncoal reclamation \nprojects: to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill important to \npublic health and safety and the environment in the West. This \nlegislation addresses a recent interpretation by the Department of the \nInterior, DOI, which restricts the ability of states to use certain \nfunds under the Abandoned Mine\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\nLand, AML, Program authorized by the Surface Mining Control and \nReclamation Act, SMCRA, for non-coal mine reclamation.\n  The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 contained amendments to \nSMCRA reauthorizing collection of an AML fee on coal produced in the \nU.S. and making certain modifications to the AML program. Under this \nprogram, which is administered by DOI, funds are expended to reclaim \nabandoned mine lands, with top priority for protecting public health, \nsafety, general welfare, and property and restoration of land and water \nresources adversely affected by past mining practices. The program is \nlargely directed to abandoned coal mine reclamation, but under section \n409 of SMCRA, limited funds have been available to address non-coal \nmine sites.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of the Interior has interpreted the \namendments in a manner that limits the ability of western states to use \ncertain funds under SMCRA to address significant problems relating to \nnon-coal abandoned mines, despite the fact that these funds had \npreviously been available for these purposes.\n  Section 409 of SMCRA, provides that states may address public health \nand safety hazards at abandoned mine sites, both coal and non-coal. \nWestern states such as New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah, have prioritized \nthe use of AML funds to undertake the most pressing reclamation work on \nboth coal and non-coal mine sites. While activities on non-coal sites \nhave consumed a relatively insignificant portion of the funding \nprovided for the overall AML program, the results in terms of public \nhealth and safety in these states is considerable, and there is \nsignificant work yet to be done. For example, New Mexico alone has over \n15,000 remaining mine openings with a vast majority of these being non-\ncoal. All AML-related fatalities in the State in the last few decades \nhave been at non-coal mine sites.\n  I disagree with this interpretation by DOI. This result was not the \nintention of those of us working on the SMCRA amendments, and I believe \nthe interpretation is in error. First, OSM's interpretation disregards \nthe fact that section 409 was left unamended by the Congress. \nFurthermore, this interpretation is inconsistent with assurances \nrepeatedly given to us by OSM during the consideration of the \nlegislation that non-coal work could continue to be undertaken with \nthese AML funds. Finally, the interpretation has the unacceptable \nresult of requiring states to devote funds to low priority coal sites \nwhile leaving dangerous non-coal sites unaddressed.\n  The bill that I am introducing today would correct this problem by \nmodifying the language of SMCRA to clarify that the funding would be \navailable for noncoal reclamation as it was prior to the passage of the \namendments in 2006. Under the bill, western, non-certified States could \ncontinue to use the payments comprising their so-called previously \nunappropriated state share balances for noncoal reclamation.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation, which has \nimportant implications for abandoned mine clean-up in the West.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2779\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the per resident payment floor for direct graduate medical \neducation payments under the Medicare program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n   Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to discuss a critical \ninfrastructure issue facing our Nation. As our population ages, we will \nneed more health care professionals. We are already seeing shortages in \ncritical areas such as nursing.\n   The Council on Graduate Medical Education, COGME, has also strongly \nadvised that we need to train more physicians. COGME recommends that \nthe number of physicians entering residency programs increase by 3,000 \nover the next 10 years to partially remedy an anticipated shortfall of \n85,000 physicians by 2020.\n   Yet for many of my teaching hospitals, there is a problem in how \nthey are reimbursed through the Medicare Program for training the next \ngeneration of doctors. Their ``graduate medical education'' \nreimbursement GME, is based on data collected over 30 years ago that no \nlonger reflects current costs and increasing needs. Over 30 Michigan \nteaching hospitals lose more than $18 million a year as a result of \nMedicare's outdated policy. Insufficient funding makes it very \ndifficult for hospitals to train a workforce sufficient to care for the \ngrowing Medicare population.\n   Congress has recognized that this formula has caused unfairness in \nGME payments. In 1999, Congress set a minimum payment level at 70 \npercent of the national average, and in 2000, Congress raised the \nminimum payment level again to 85 percent of the national average.\n   The bill I am introducing today with my colleague, Senator Bunning, \nmerely raises the  floor again to 100 percent of the national average \nover a 3-year period. Teaching hospitals could use the additional money \nto make up shortfalls or pay for additional residents to train.\n\n   I am pleased to have the support of the American Osteopathic \nAssociation as well as many of Michigan's premier medical schools and \nacademic medical centers.\n   I look forward to working with my colleagues on ensuring that our \nNation's teaching hospitals are the envy of the world and that we have \nthe physician workforce we need for the future.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Statewide campus system, Michigan State University \n           College of Osteopathic Medicine,\n                                                   March 10, 2008.\n     Hon. Debbie A. Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: The Statewide Campus System at \n     Michigan State University is a consortium of 26 hospitals in \n     Michigan. Its primary purpose is to provide medical education \n     to nearly 1,300 interns, residents, and fellows within our \n     state. Support for the training of these physicians comes \n     primarily from federal financing through the Medicare \n     program. We are acutely aware how our training institutions \n     are disadvantaged by the current operations of the DGME \n     payment system. Many of our hospitals receive less than the \n     national average from Medicare that is used to offset medical \n     education. Public demands for increased patient safety and \n     competency assessment of procedural skills performed by \n     residents are unfunded mandates that we are now challenged to \n     provide.\n       We are aware that Congress has addressed this issue in \n     piecemeal fashion in moving the reimbursement level from 70 \n     percent to 85 percent of the locally adjusted national \n     average. Congress further recognized in the Medical \n     Modernization Act of 2003 by adding a provision that the \n     redistributed postdoctoral positions be reimbursed at 100 \n     percent of the national average. The next logical step is to \n     level the playing field so that teaching institutions can be \n     compensated in accordance with their regionally adjusted \n     average and use the additional funds to expand our \n     educational commitments to residents.\n       The Statewide Campus System is supportive of your efforts \n     to introduce legislation that would increase Medicare's \n     Direct Medical Educational payments at 100 percent for those \n     hospitals whose historical costs are less than the national \n     average. We welcome and endorse legislation that has the same \n     impact sponsored in the 109th Congress, S. 2289/H.R. 4371.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               Mark Cummings, PhD,\n     Associate Dean, SCS.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            University of Michigan\n\n\n                                                Health System,\n\n                                                   March 11, 2008.\n     Hon. Debbie A. Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of Michigan's hospitals \n     disadvantaged under Medicare's Direct Graduate Medicare \n     Education payment system, we strongly endorse\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\n     your legislation to address the longstanding inequities for \n     graduate medical education to be introduced on the Senate \n     floor on March 13, 2008.\n       As you know, Medicare's formula for paying hospitals that \n     operate teaching programs is based on data from the early \n     1980s which are significantly below current costs and \n     increasing needs. Insufficient funding makes it very \n     difficult for hospitals to train a workforce sufficient to \n     care for the growing Medicare population.\n       In our state, 34 teaching hospitals lose more than $18 \n     million a year as a result of Medicare's out-dated policy. \n     More than 600 hospitals nationwide also receive less than the \n     national average payment from Medicare for the direct costs \n     of providing graduate medical education.\n       Congress has addressed this problem over the past 7 years \n     in various incremental ways. In 2000, Congress included \n     provisions in the ``Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefit \n     Improvement and Protection Act'' (BIPA) to raise the floor \n     for direct graduate medical education payments from 70 \n     percent of the locality adjusted national average to 85 \n     percent. In the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, Congress \n     again recognized the flaws in Medicare's payments to teaching \n     hospitals by including a provision requiring that any \n     resident positions redistributed to other hospitals be \n     reimbursed at 100 percent of the national average.\n       The legislation would continue on this important path by \n     increasing Medicare's Direct Graduate Medical Education \n     (DGME) payments to hospitals to 100 percent of the national \n     average per resident for facilities whose historical costs \n     are less than the national average. In short, Medicare should \n     pay for the average cost of operating a training program so \n     no hospitals receive less than Medicare's fair share of the \n     costs of operating a medical education program. We appreciate \n     your leadership on behalf of the teaching hospitals, the \n     physicians we train, and the patients we serve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Douglas Strong,\n                                   Chief Executive Officer, UMHHC.\n                                              American Osteopathic\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 2008.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jim Bunning,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Stabenow and Bunning: On behalf of the 61,000 \n     osteopathic physicians represented by the American \n     Osteopathic Association (AOA), I am pleased to inform you of \n     our support for your legislation, which would amend title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act to increase the per resident \n     payment floor for direct graduate medical education payments \n     under the Medicare program. We applaud your leadership and \n     strongly support your efforts.\n       Numerous academic and advisory bodies, including the \n     Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), have issued \n     reports showing that there will be an inadequate number of \n     physicians to meet patient demands by the year 2020. This \n     shortage of physicians comes at a time when the Nation's \n     senior population and the number of Medicare beneficiaries is \n     growing at a rapid rate. While the precise number of \n     physicians needed is debatable, there is little doubt that \n     the Nation's graduate medical education system limits our \n     ability to meet the future physician workforce needs.\n       Currently, one in five medical school students in the \n     United States is enrolled in a college of osteopathic \n     medicine. The Nation's colleges of osteopathic medicine \n     currently graduate 3,000 new osteopathic physicians annually. \n     This number will increase to approximately 3,500 in 2008 and \n     is projected to be greater than 4,500 by 2013.\n       Please be assured that we are committed to educating and \n     training quality physicians that are capable of meeting the \n     health care needs of the nation. However, we must increase \n     the payment floor for direct graduate medical education \n     payments.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership on this issue. The AOA \n     and our members stand ready to assist you in securing the \n     enactment of this important legislation. Please do not \n     hesitate to call upon the AOA for assistance as you move \n     forward on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Peter B. Ajluni, DO,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Debbie A. Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jim Bunning,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Senators Stabenow and Bunning: On behalf of the Coalition \n     for DGME Fairness, thank you very much for introducing direct \n     graduate medical education (DGME) legislation.\n       We stand together in strong support of your legislation so \n     that we can continue to train a workforce sufficient to care \n     for the growing Medicare population. Medicare pays less than \n     its fair share for the costs of educating doctors in more \n     than 600 hospitals across the country.\n       Your legislation would address the outdated methodology and \n     longstanding inequity by increasing the Direct Graduate \n     Medical Education (DGME) payment--for hospitals whose \n     historical costs are less than the national average--to 100 \n     percent of the national average per resident amount. Medicare \n     pays hospitals for operating teaching programs based on costs \n     reported in the early 1980s. These payments bear little, if \n     any, relationship to the actual cost of operating training \n     programs in the 21st century.\n       Twice before (1999 and 2001), Congress made incremental \n     improvements in DGME payments for these hospitals, \n     implementing a floor at 70 percent and then raising it to 85 \n     percent of the national average. In the Medicare \n     Modernization Act of 2003, Congress again recognized the \n     flaws in Medicare's payments to teaching hospitals by \n     requiring that unused residency positions redistributed to \n     other hospitals be paid 100 percent of the national average. \n     This legislation would complete Congress's work to address \n     this inequity.\n       On behalf of our physicians, hospitals, and the patients we \n     serve, we commit to work diligently with you to see this \n     legislation enacted.

Mr. President, I am proud to be introducing legislation \ntoday with Senator Stabenow that will benefit many of the teaching \nhospitals across the Nation, including 20 facilities in the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Teaching hospitals play a critical role in educating, inspiring, and \npreparing our young doctors to meet the challenges of their new \nprofession. Although necessary, this training adds to the cost of \npatient care. That is why Medicare pays these hospitals for its share \nof cost of training new physicians through payments known as direct \ngraduate medical education payments--or DGME payments.\n  Unfortunately, there is some inequity in how DGME payments are \ncalculated. The legislation we are introducing today takes steps to \nadequately reimburse all hospitals for the cost of training new \nphysicians.\n  Teaching hospitals initially reported their direct costs to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services in the mid-1980s. These \nreported amounts are now the basis for which each teaching hospital is \nreimbursed.\n  Unfortunately, there was a disparity in the types of costs each \nhospital reported, which has lead to large variations in payments \nbetween hospitals. Hospitals are also being reimbursed on data that is \n20 years old.\n  To help rectify this problem, in 1999 Congress established a floor \nfor calculating Medicare payments for DGME at 70 percent of the \nnational average. In 2001, Congress raised the floor to 85 percent of \nthe national average.\n  The legislation Senator Stabenow and I are introducing today would \nbring all of Medicare's DGME hospitals up 100 percent of the national \naverage over a 3-year period. This would affect about 600 hospitals \nacross the Nation that are currently being reimbursed below the \nnational average, including the 20 in Kentucky.\n  I am glad we are introducing this legislation today and hope my \ncolleagues can take a close look at it. Adequately paying our teaching \nhospitals is critically important, and this bill would benefit many \nhospitals across the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2784. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to \nextend the food labeling requirements of the Nutrition Labeling and \nEducation Act of 1990 to enable customers to make informed choices \nabout the nutritional content of standard menu items in large chain \nrestaurants; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, the Menu \nEducation and Labeling Act, on behalf of myself and my colleagues, Ms. \nFeinstein of California, and Mr. Kennedy of Massachusetts.\n  Poor nutrition and obesity are a major public health problem in the \nU.S. The issue is far from merely cosmetic. It is medical and economic. \nDiet-related disease are prevalent in the U.S. Cardiovascular disease, \nwhich is the leading cause of death in the U.S., is clearly linked to \npoor diets. Type-2 diabetes, results in amputation, blindness, and \npremature death.\n  Diet is also clearly associated with rising rates of overweight and \nobesity. More than 65 percent of American adults are overweight, and \nmore than 30 percent are clinically obese. We lead the world in this \ndubious distinction, which is growing worse. Increasingly the problem \nstarts in childhood. According to the Institute of Medicine, since \n1963, obesity rates have quadrupled among older children ages 6 to 11 \nyears, and tripled for adolescents between the ages of 12 and 19. If we \ndo not change course, kids attending school today will be the first \ngeneration in American history to live a shorter lifespan than their \nparents\n  The obesity epidemic has far-reaching consequences. Overweight people \nhave an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers and \nother illnesses. Sixty percent of overweight youth already have at lest \none risk factor for heart disease, which is the leading cause of death \nin the U.S. Obesity also causes or contributes to $117 billion a year \nin health care and related costs, more than half borne by taxpayers.\n  There is no single solution to the complex problem of poor nutrition \nand diet-related disease, but we must start taking meaningful steps to \naddress this growing problem by giving people the tools necessary to \nconsume healthier diets. The legislation that we are introducing today \nwill extend nutrition labeling beyond packaged foods to include foods \nat chain restaurants with 20 or more locations, as well as food in \nvending machines. This common-sense idea will give consumers a needed \ntool to make wiser choices and live healthier lives.\n  In 1990, Congress passed the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, \nNLEA, requiring food manufacturers to provide nutrition information on \nnearly all packaged foods. The impact has been tremendous. Not only do \nnearly three-quarters of adults use the food labels on packaged foods, \nbut studies indicate that consumers who read labels have healthier \ndiets.\n  American adults and children now consume a third of their calories at \nrestaurants and nutrition and health experts say that rising caloric \nconsumption and growing portion sizes are causes of obesity. However, \nrestaurants were excluded from the Nutrition Labeling and Education \nAct. Consumers say that they would like nutrition information provided \nwhen they order their food at restaurants, yet, while they have good \nnutrition information in supermarkets, at restaurants they can only \nguess.\n  Similarly, vending machine food sales also play a large role in \ncontributing to the diets of Americans. Over the last three decades \nvending machine sales have shot up 85 percent after inflation. Most \nvending machine sales include foods of low nutritional value.\n  The Menu Education and Labeling Act will require fast-food and other \nchain restaurants to provide point of sale information on calories, \nsaturated fat, trans fat, and sodium and will require point of sale \nlabeling of calories on foods sold in vending machines.\n  I would also like to note that last night, one of the true lions of \nthe Senate, my old friend Howard M. Metzenbaum from Ohio, passed away. \nSenator Metzenbaum was a good friend and a great senator. One of his \ngreat achievements in the Senate is that he was the author of and the \ndriving force behind the Nutrition Education Labeling Act, which first \nestablished nutrition labeling for packaged foods. The bill that we are \nintroducing today builds upon Senator Metzenbaum's work on nutrition \nlabeling, and in honor of his work and his distinguished career, I am \nnaming this bill after him.\n  Let there be no doubt: poor nutrition in America is indeed an \nepidemic, and it is continuing to grow. This is a public health crisis \nand we must address it. Although this bill alone will not end poor \nnutrition or halt rising obesity in its tracks, it provides consumers \nwith an important tool with which to make better choices about the food \nthat they and their children consume.\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 2786. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to health care under the Medicare program for \nbeneficiaries residing in rural areas; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Medicare \nRural Health Access Improvement Act of 2008.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to continue ongoing efforts to \nensure that Americans in rural areas have access to health care \nservices. Much has been done in the past to improve access to rural \nproviders such as hospitals and doctors. Much more still needs to be \ndone.\n  I hold town meetings in each of the 99 counties in the great State of \nIowa every year. As many know, Iowa is largely a rural State, and a \nsignificant concern that I consistently hear during these meetings is \nthe difficulty my constituents experience in accessing health care \nservices. As the former chairman and currently the ranking member of \nthe Finance Committee, it has, therefore, been a priority for me to \nimprove the availability of health care in rural areas.\n  In Iowa, as in many rural areas across the country, hospitals are \noften\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\nnot only the sole provider of health care in rural areas, but also \nemployers and purchasers in the community. Moreover, the presence of a \nhospital is essential for purposes of economic development because \nbusinesses check to see if a hospital is in the community in which they \nmight set up shop. As you can see, it is vital that these institutions \nare able to keep their doors open.\n  In previous legislation, Congress has been able to improve the \nfinancial viability of rural hospitals. For instance, the creation and \nsubsequent improvements to the Critical Access Hospital designation has \ngreatly improved the financial health of certain small rural hospitals \nand ensured that community residents have access to health care.\n  However, there are still a group of rural hospitals that need help. I \nam referring to what are known as ``tweener'' hospitals, which are too \nlarge to be Critical Access Hospitals, but too small to be financially \nviable under the Medicare hospital prospective payment systems. These \nfacilities are struggling to stay afloat despite their tireless \nefforts. Like in many communities across the country, the staff of \ntweener hospitals and their community residents take great pride in the \nquality of care at these facilities. I have heard countless stories of \nthe exemplary work tweener hospitals in Iowa perform not only as \nproviders of essential health care, but also as responsible members of \ntheir communities. It is for this reason that many provisions in this \nbill are intended to improve the financial health of tweener hospitals \nand ensure that people have access to health care.\n  Most tweener hospital are currently designated as Medicare Dependent \nHospitals and Sole Community Hospitals under the Medicare program. \nThere are provisions, both temporary and permanent, included in this \nbill that would improve Medicare payments for both types of hospitals. \nThis includes improvements to the payment methodologies so that \ninpatient payments to these facilities would better reflect the costs \nthey incur in providing care. Improvements are also proposed in this \nbill to Medicare hospital outpatient payments for both Medicare \nDependent Hospitals and Sole Community Hospitals so they would both \nshare the benefit of hold harmless payments and add-on payments.\n  Also, a major driver of the financial difficulties that tweener \nhospitals face is the fact that many have relatively low volumes of \ninpatient admissions. This bill would improve the existing low-volume \nadd-on payment for hospitals so that more rural facilities with low \nvolumes would receive the assistance they desperately need.\n  Over the years, many have commented that it is simply unfair for many \nrural hospitals to receive only a limited amount of Medicare \nDisproportionate Share Hospital, or DSH, payments while many urban \nhospitals are not subject to such a cap. This bill would eliminate the \ncap for DSH payments for those rural hospitals for a 2-year period.\n  There are also other provisions that would continue to help rural \nhospitals. The rural flexibility program would be extended for an \nadditional year. Certain rural hospitals that are paid on a cost basis \nfor the outpatient laboratory services they provide would continue to \ndo so on a permanent basis. And Critical Access Hospitals that provide \noutpatient laboratory services would be paid 101 percent of their costs \nregardless of whether the specimen was collected from a patient of the \nCAH or whether the specimen was collected in a skilled nursing facility \nor clinic associated with the CAH.\n  This legislation also seeks to improve incentives for physicians \nlocated in rural areas and increase beneficiaries' access to rural \nhealth care providers. It includes provisions designed to reduce \ninequitable disparities in physician payment resulting from the \nGeographic Practice Cost Indices, or adjusters, known as GPCIs. \nMedicare payment for physician services varies from one area to another \nbased on the geographic adjustments for a particular area. Geographic \nadjustments are intended to reflect cost differences in a given area \ncompared to a national average of 1.0 so that an area with costs above \nthe national average would have an index greater than 1.0, and an area \nbelow the national average would have an index less than 1.0. There are \ncurrently three geographic adjustments: for physician work, practice \nexpense, and malpractice expense.\n  Unfortunately, the existing geographic adjusters result in \nsignificant disparities in physician reimbursement which penalize, \nrather than equalize, physician payment in Iowa and other rural states. \nThese geographic disparities in payment lead to rural states \nexperiencing significant difficulties in recruiting and retaining \nphysicians and other health care professionals due to their \nsignificantly lower reimbursement rates.\n  These disparities have perverse effects when it comes to realigning \nMedicare payment to reward quality of care. Let me put that into \ncontext. Iowa is widely recognized as providing some of the highest \nquality health care in the country yet Iowa physicians receive some of \nthe lowest Medicare reimbursement due to these inequitable geographic \nadjustments. Medicare reimbursement for some procedures is at least 30 \npercent lower in Iowa than payment for those very procedures in other \nparts of the country. That is a significant disincentive for Iowa \nphysicians who are providing some of the best quality care in the \ncountry, and it is fundamentally unfair. Congress needs to reduce these \ndisparities in payment and focus on rewarding physicians who provide \nhigh quality care.\n  The inequitable geographic payment formulas have also exacerbated the \nproblems that rural areas face in terms of access to health care. Rural \nAmerica today has far fewer physicians per capita than urban areas. The \nGPCI formulas are a dismal failure in promoting an adequate supply of \nphysicians in States such as Iowa, and more severe physician shortages \nin rural areas are predicted in the future.\n  The legislation I am introducing today makes changes in the GPCI \nformulas for work and practice expense to reverse this trend. It \nestablishes a 1.0 floor for the physician work and practice expense \nadjustments. It also revises the calculation of the work and practice \nexpense formulas to reduce payment differences and more accurately \ncompensate physicians in rural areas for their true practice costs. We \nmust act now to help rural States recruit and retain more physicians so \nthat beneficiaries will continue to have access to needed health care.\n  Congress has previously enacted a number of other provisions to \nimprove Medicare payment for health care professionals and providers in \nrural areas that will expire soon. This bill extends the five percent \nincentive payments for primary care and specialty physicians in \nscarcity areas through December 2009. It also extends the existing \npayment arrangements which allow independent laboratories to bill \nMedicare directly for certain physician pathology services.\n  The bill includes several new provisions to improve beneficiary \naccess to health care services. It increases rural ambulance payments \nby 5 percent for the next 18 months. It permanently increases the \npayment limits for rural health clinics. It allows hospital-based renal \ndialysis centers and skilled nursing facilities to provide telehealth \nservices. It also allows physician assistants to order post-hospital \nextended care services and to serve hospice patients.\n  Finally, the bill would protect rural areas from being adversely \naffected by the new Medicare competitive bidding program for durable \nmedical equipment. It would ensure that home medical equipment \nsuppliers who provide equipment and services in rural areas and small \nmetropolitan statistical areas, MSAs, with a population of 600,000 or \nless can continue to serve the Medicare program by exempting these \nareas from competitive bidding. We must ensure that rural areas \ncontinue to have medical equipment suppliers available to serve \nbeneficiaries in these areas.\n  Mr. President, as you can see, we still have much to do when it comes \nto ensuring access to health care in rural America. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on this important matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na summary of the bill.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\n          Medicare Rural Health Access Improvement Act of 2008\n\n\n             Title I--Provisions Relating to Medicare Part A\n\n      Section 101. Extension of Medicare Rural Hospital \n         Flexibility Grant Program.\n        Current Law\n        Presently, the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant \n     Program is authorized for $35 million from FY2005 through \n     FY2008.\n        Explanation of Provision\n        The provision would extend this grant program through \n     FY2009.\n      Section 102. Improvements to the Medicare Dependent Hospital \n         (MDH) Program.\n        Current Law\n        MDHs are small rural hospitals with a high proportion of \n     patients who are Medicare beneficiaries (have at least 60% of \n     acute inpatient days or discharges attributable to Medicare \n     in FY1987 or in two of the three most recently audited cost \n     reporting periods). An MDH cannot be a Sole Community \n     Hospital (SCH) and must have 100 or fewer beds. Until October \n     1, 2006, MDHs were paid at the wage-adjusted national \n     standardized amount or, if higher, 50% of their adjusted \n     FY1982 or FY1987 hospital specific costs. Starting for \n     discharges on October 1, 2006, an MDH would be able to elect \n     payments based on its FY2002 hospital specific costs if that \n     would result in higher Medicare payments. Also, starting for \n     discharges on October 1, 2006, an MDH that elected to be paid \n     using its hospital-specific costs would have its payments \n     based on 75% of those costs.\n        Explanation of Provision\n        Starting for discharges on October 1, 2008 until October \n     1, 2011, an MDH that elects to be paid using the national \n     standardized amount would not have that per discharge payment \n     amount adjusted by an area wage adjustment unless such \n     adjustment will result in improved payments to the MDH. \n     Starting for discharges on October 1, 2008 until October 1, \n     2011, those MDHs would have their payments based on 85% of \n     their hospital specific costs.\n      Section 103. Rebasing for Sole Community Hospitals (SCHs).\n        Current Law\n        Medicare payments to SCHs for inpatient hospital services \n     are made on the basis of the federal per discharge payment \n     amount or on the basis of its updated hospital-specific per \n     discharge amount from FY1982, FY1987, or FY1996, whichever \n     would result in the largest payment.\n        Explanation of Provision\n        Starting for discharges on October 1, 2008, SCHs would be \n     able to elect payment based on their FY2002 hospital-specific \n     payment amount per discharge. This amount would be increased \n     by the annual update starting in FY2008.\n      Section 104. Temporary Improvements to the Medicare \n         Inpatient Hospital Payment Adjustment for Low-volume \n         Hospitals.\n        Current Law\n        Under Medicare's Inpatient Prospective Payment System \n     (IPPS), certain low-volume hospitals receive a payment \n     adjustment to account for their higher costs per discharge. A \n     low volume hospital is defined as an acute care hospital that \n     is located more than 25 road miles from another comparable \n     hospital and that has less than 800 total discharges during \n     the fiscal year. Under current law, the Secretary is required \n     to determine an appropriate percentage increase for these \n     low-volume hospitals based on the empirical relationship \n     between the standardized cost-per-case for such hospitals and \n     their total discharges to account for the additional \n     incremental costs (if any) that are associated with such \n     number of discharges. The low-volume adjustment is limited to \n     no more than 25 percent. Accordingly, under regulations, \n     qualifying hospitals (those located more than 25 road miles \n     from another comparable hospital) with less than 200 total \n     discharges receive a 25% payment increase for every Medicare \n     discharge.\n        Explanation of Provision\n        This provision would make a temporary adjustment that \n     would provide payments in FY2009 and FY2010 to more low-\n     volume hospitals. A low-volume hospital could be located more \n     than 15 road miles from another comparable hospital and have \n     2,000 discharges of individuals entitled to or enrolled for \n     Medicare Part A benefits. The Secretary would determine the \n     applicable percentage increase using a linear sliding scale \n     ranging from 25% for low-volume hospitals below a certain \n     threshold to no adjustment for hospitals with greater than \n     2,000 discharges of individuals with Medicare Part A \n     benefits.\n      Section 105. Temporarily Lifting the Disproportionate Share \n         Hospital (DSH) Adjustment Cap.\n        Current Law\n        Medicare will increase its payments to hospitals that \n     qualify for a DSH adjustment. In many instances, the size of \n     a hospital's DSH adjustment will depend upon the number of \n     patient days provided to poor Medicare patients or Medicaid \n     patients (DSH patient share). However, small urban hospitals \n     and many rural hospitals have their DSH adjustment capped at \n     12%.\n        Explanation of Provision\n        The provision would eliminate the DSH adjustment cap for \n     these hospitals for discharges occurring in FY2009 and \n     FY2010. For discharges on or after October 1, 20010, the DSH \n     adjustment cap would revert to 12%.\n\n\n            Title II--Provisions Relating to Medicare Part B\n\n      Section 201. Extension and Expansion of the Medicare \n         Hospital Outpatient Department Hold Harmless Provision \n         for Small Rural Hospitals.\n        Current Law\n        Small rural hospitals (with no more than 100 beds) that \n     are not Sole Community Hospitals (SCHs) can receive \n     additional Medicare payments if their outpatient payments \n     under the prospective payment system are less than under the \n     prior reimbursement system. For CY2006, these hospitals will \n     receive 95% of the difference between payments under the \n     prospective payment system and those that would have been \n     made under the prior reimbursement system. The hospitals will \n     receive 90% of the difference in CY2007 and 85% of the \n     difference in CY2008.\n        Explanation of Provision\n        The provision would establish that in CY 2009 and CY 2010, \n     small rural hospitals, including Medicare Dependent Hospitals \n     and SCHs, would receive 100% of the difference between \n     payments made under the Medicare Hospital Outpatient \n     Prospective Payment System and those made under the prior \n     reimbursement system.\n      Section 202. Expansion of the Medicare Hospital Outpatient \n         Department Add-on Payment for Rural Sole Community \n         Hospitals (SCHs).\n        Current Law\n        Under Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and \n     Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), the Secretary was required \n     to study to determine whether the costs incurred by rural \n     hospitals were greater than urban hospitals and whether the \n     prospective payment system (PPS) for hospital outpatient \n     departments (HOPD) accounted for those cost differences. The \n     Secretary was authorized to provide a payment adjustment for \n     rural hospitals by January 1, 2006 if such an adjustment was \n     warranted. Starting in CY2006, rural SCHs have had their \n     Medicare payments for outpatient services increased by 7.1%.\n        Explanation of Provision\n        This provision would establish that the Secretary's \n     authority to provide a payment adjustment would apply to \n     services furnished in 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Medicare \n     statute would be amended so that SCHs and Medicare Dependent \n     Hospitals (MDHs) in rural areas would receive a 7.1% increase \n     in payments for covered HOPD services for services starting \n     January 1, 2009. The increase would be applied before \n     calculating outliers and coinsurance. The Secretary would be \n     able to revise this percentage starting for services \n     furnished after January 1, 2010 through promulgation of a \n     regulation. The increase would not apply to pass-through \n     drugs and biologicals. The increased payments as they relate \n     to SCHs and MDHs would not be implemented in a budget-neutral \n     manner.\n      Section 203. Permanent Treatment of Medicare Reasonable \n         Costs Payments for Certain Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory \n         Tests Furnished to Hospital Patients in Certain Rural \n         Areas.\n        Current Law\n        Generally, hospitals that provide clinical diagnostic \n     laboratory services under Part B are reimbursed using a fee \n     schedule. Hospitals with under 50 beds in qualified rural \n     areas (certain rural areas with low population densities) \n     receive 100% of reasonable cost reimbursement for the \n     clinical diagnostic laboratories covered under Part B that \n     are provided as outpatient hospital services. Reasonable cost \n     reimbursement for laboratory services provided by these \n     hospitals will expire on July 1, 2008.\n        Explanation of Provision\n        This provision would add Section 1833(v) to the Social \n     Security Act which would make reasonable cost reimbursement \n     for laboratory services provided by qualified rural hospitals \n     permanent starting July 1, 2008. The Secretary would be \n     required to apply the current rules that are used to \n     determine whether clinical diagnostic laboratory services are \n     furnished as an outpatient Critical Access Hospital service \n     (without regard to amendments enacted in this legislation.)\n      Section 204. Clarification of Payment for Clinical \n         Laboratory Tests Furnished by Critical Access Hospitals \n         (CAHs).\n        Current Law\n        Medicare outpatient covered clinical laboratory services \n     are generally paid based on a fee schedule. Clinical \n     diagnostic laboratory services provided to patients who \n     receive services directly from CAHs on an outpatient basis \n     are paid 101% of reasonable costs. Clinical laboratory \n     services provided by CAHs to those who are not patients are \n     paid on the basis of the Medicare fee schedule. In no \n     instance are Medicare beneficiaries liable for any \n     coinsurance or deductible amounts.\n        Explanation of Provision\n        Under this provision, clinical diagnostic laboratory \n     services furnished by a CAH starting in January 1, 2009 would \n     be reimbursed at 101% of costs as outpatient hospital \n     services without regard to whether the specimen was collected \n     from a patient of the CAH or whether the specimen was \n     collected in a skilled nursing facility or clinic that is \n     owned by or co-located with the CAH.\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\n      Section 205. Extension of Medicare Incentive Payment Program \n         for Physician Scarcity Areas.\n        Current Law\n        MMA provided for an additional 5% in payments for certain \n     physicians in scarcity areas for the period January 1, 2005 \n     through December 31, 2007. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP \n     Extension Act of 2007 (MMSEA) extended these payments through \n     June 30, 2008. The Secretary was required to calculate, \n     separately for practicing primary care physicians and \n     specialists, the ratios of such physicians to Medicare \n     beneficiaries in the county, rank each county (or equivalent \n     area) according to its ratio for primary care and specialists \n     separately, and then identify those scarcity areas with the \n     lowest ratios which collectively represented 20% of the total \n     Medicare beneficiary population in those areas. The list of \n     counties was to be revised no less often than once every \n     three years unless there were no new data. There would be no \n     administrative or judicial review of the designation of the \n     county or area as a scarcity area, the designation of an \n     individual physician's specialty, or the assignment of a \n     postal zip code to the county or other area. The listing of \n     counties appeared in Appendix I and Appendix J of the 2005 \n     physician fee schedule update.\n        Explanation of Provision\n        The provision would extend the add-on payments through \n     December 31, 2009.\n      Section 206. Revisions to the Work Geographic Adjustment \n         Under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule.\n       Current Law\n        Medicare's physician fee schedule assigns relative values \n     to services that reflect physician work (i.e., the time, \n     skill, and intensity it takes to provide the service), \n     practice expenses, and malpractice costs. The relative values \n     are adjusted for geographic variations in costs. The adjusted \n     relative values are then converted into a dollar payment \n     amount by a conversion factor.\n        The geographic adjustment factors are indices that reflect \n     the relative cost difference in a given area in comparison to \n     a national average. An area with costs above the national \n     average would have an index greater than 1.00 while an area \n     with costs below the average would have an index below 1.00. \n     The physician work geographic adjustment factor is based on a \n     sample of median hourly earnings in six professional \n     specialty occupational categories. Unlike the other \n     geographic adjustments, the work adjustment factor reflects \n     only one-quarter of the cost differences in an area. The \n     Secretary is required to periodically review and adjust the \n     geographic indices.\n        MMA required the Secretary to increase the value of any \n     work geographic index that was below 1.00 to 1.00 for \n     services furnished on or after January 1, 2004 and before \n     January 1, 2007. TRHCA extended the provision for an \n     additional year, through December 31, 2008, and MMSEA \n     extended the provision for an additional six months, for \n     services provided before July 1, 2008.\n        Explanation of Provision\n        Subsection (a) would extend the 1.0 work floor through \n     December 31,2009. Subsection (b) would recognize the equality \n     of physician work in all geographic areas and eliminate \n     differing work index values by establishing a national value \n     of 1.0, effective 2010.\n      Section 207. Revisions to the Practice Expense Geographic \n         Adjustment Under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule.\n        Current Law\n        Medicare's physician fee schedule assigns relative values \n     to services that reflect physician work (i.e., the time, \n     skill, and intensity it takes to provide the service), \n     practice expenses, and malpractice costs. The relative values \n     are adjusted for geographic variations in costs. The adjusted \n     relative values are then converted into a dollar payment \n     amount by a conversion factor.\n        The geographic adjustment factors are indices that reflect \n     the relative cost difference in a given area in comparison to \n     a national average. An area with costs above the national \n     average would have an index greater than 1.00 while an area \n     with costs below the average would have an index below 1.00. \n     The practice expense geographic adjustment is calculated by \n     measuring variations in employee wages, office rents, and \n     miscellaneous. The Secretary is required to periodically \n     review and adjust the geographic indices.\n        Explanation of Provision\n       Subsection (a) would establish a practice expense floor of \n     1.0 for 2009 by requiring the Secretary to increase the value \n     of any practice expense geographic index that was below 1.0 \n     to 1.0 for services furnished on or after January 1, 2009 and \n     before January 1, 2010. Subsection (b) would reduce the \n     geographic adjustment for practice expense to 50 percent of \n     the current adjustment for employee wages and rent, effective \n     2010.\n     Section 208. Extension of Treatment of Certain Physician \n         Pathology Services Under Medicare.\n       Current Law\n       BBA 97 specified that independent labs that had agreements \n     with hospitals on July 22, 1999, to bill directly for the \n     technical component of pathology services could continue to \n     do so in 2001 and 2002. The provision has been periodically \n     extended. TRHCA extended the provision through 2007, and \n     MMSEA further extended it through June 30, 2008.\n       Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would be extended through December 31, 2009.\n     Section 209. Extension of Increased Medicare Payments for \n         Rural Ground Ambulance Services.\n       Current Law\n       Ambulance services are paid on the basis of a national fee \n     schedule, which is being phased in. The fee schedule \n     establishes seven categories of ground ambulance services and \n     two categories of air ambulance services. The payment for a \n     service equals a base rate for the level of service plus \n     payment for mileage. Geographic adjustments are made to a \n     portion of the base rate.\n       Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would provide for an increase in the rates \n     otherwise established for ground ambulance services of 5% in \n     rural areas for the period July 1, 2008-December 31, 2009.\n     Sec. 210. Adding Hospital-Based Renal Dialysis Centers \n         (Including Satellites) As Originating Sites for Payment \n         of Telehealth Services.\n       Current Law\n       Medicare may cover a telehealth service for beneficiaries \n     who are located (i) in an area designated as a rural health \n     professional shortage area; (ii) in a county that is not \n     included in a Metropolitan Statistical Area; or (iii) at an \n     entity that participates in a federal telemedicine \n     demonstration project that has been approved by (or receives \n     funding from) the Secretary of Health and Human Services as \n     of December 31, 2000. If a beneficiary is located in those \n     areas, counties, or entities, then the beneficiary is \n     permitted to receive telemedicine at one of the following \n     sites: (1) a physician or practitioner's office; (ii) a \n     critical access hospital; (iii) a rural health clinic; (iv) a \n     federally qualified health center; or (v) a hospital.\n       Explanation of Provision\n       This provision would permit a hospital-based or critical \n     access hospital-based renal dialysis center (including \n     satellites) to serve as a telemedicine site. The provision \n     would be effective for services furnished on or after January \n     1, 2009.\n     Section 211. Expansion of Telehealth Services to Skilled \n         Nursing Facilities.\n       Current Law\n       Medicare covers certain services including professional \n     consultations, office and other outpatient visits, individual \n     psychotherapy, pharmacological management, psychiatric \n     diagnostic interview examinations and end stage renal disease \n     related services delivered via an eligible telecommunications \n     system. The originating site (the location of the beneficiary \n     receiving the telehealth service) can be a physician or \n     practitioner's office, a critical access hospital, a rural \n     health clinic, a federally qualified health center, or a \n     hospital. The originating site must be in a rural health \n     professional shortage area or in a county that is not in a \n     metropolitan statistical area or at an entity that \n     participates in a specified federal telemedicine \n     demonstration project.\n       Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would permit otherwise qualifying skilled \n     nursing facilities to be the originating site for the \n     provision of covered telehealth services furnished on or \n     after January 1, 2009.\n     Section 212. Rural Health Clinic Improvements.\n       Current Law\n       Most rural health clinics (RHCs) receive cost-based \n     reimbursement from Medicare, subject to per-visit payment \n     limits and certain productivity standards. Each year the \n     limit is increased by the percentage increase in the Medicare \n     Economic Index (MEI). For CY2007, the RHC upper payment limit \n     is $74.29 per visit.\n       Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would establish the RHC upper payment limit \n     at $92 per visit in 2009. The limit would be increased in \n     subsequent years by the limit established for the previous \n     year increased by the percentage increase in the MEI \n     applicable to primary care services.\n     Section 213. Exemption for suppliers in small MSAs and rural \n         areas.\n       Current Law\n       The MMA established Medicare competitive bidding for \n     durable medical equipment, supplies, and other items. The \n     Secretary is required to establish competitive acquisition \n     areas, but has discretion to exempt rural areas and areas \n     with low population density within urban areas that are not \n     competitive, unless a significant national market exists \n     through mail order for a particular item or service. The \n     programs are required to be phased-in so that competition \n     under the programs occurs in 10 of the largest metropolitan \n     statistical areas (MSAs) beginning in 2007, 80 of the largest \n     MSAs in 2009, and remaining areas after 2009.\n       Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would require the Secretary to exempt rural \n     areas and small MSAs with a population of 600,000 or less. \n     Competitively bid prices would not apply to rural and small \n     MSAs exempted under this section. The provision would be \n     effective as if included in the MMA, other than for contracts \n     entered into pursuant to implementation of competitive \n     bidding prior to September 1, 2008.\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\n     Section 214. Permitting Physician Assistants to Order Post-\n         Hospital Extended Care Services and to Provide for \n         Recognition of Attending Physician Assistants as \n         Attending Physicians to Serve Hospice Patients.\n       (a) Ordering Post-Hospital Extended Care Services.\n       Current Law\n       In a skilled nursing facility (SNF), Medicare law allows \n     physicians, as well as nurse practitioners and clinical nurse \n     specialists who do not have a direct or indirect employment \n     relationship with a SNF, but who are working in collaboration \n     with a physician, to certify the need for post-hospital \n     extended care services for purposes of Medicare payment. \n     Section 20.2.1 of Chapter 8 of the Medicare Benefit Policy \n     Manual defines post-hospital extended care services as \n     services provided as an extension of care for a condition for \n     which the individual received inpatient hospital services. \n     Extended care services are considered ``post-hospital'' if \n     they are initiated within 30 days after discharge from a \n     hospital stay that included at least three consecutive days \n     of medically necessary inpatient hospital care.\n       Explanation of Provision\n       The provision would allow a physician assistant who does \n     not have a direct or indirect employment relationship with a \n     SNF, but who is working in collaboration with a physician, to \n     certify the need for post-hospital extended care services for \n     Medicare payment purposes.\n       (b) Recognition of Attending Physician Assistants as \n     Attending Physicians to Serve Hospice Patients.\n       Current Law\n       Under the Medicare program, hospice services may only be \n     provided to terminally ill individuals under a written plan \n     of care established and periodically reviewed by the \n     individual's attending physician and the medical director \n     (and by the interdisciplinary group of the hospice program). \n     For purposes of a hospice written plan of care, Medicare \n     defines an attending physician as a physician or nurse \n     practitioner who may be employed by a hospice program and who \n     the individual identifies as having the most significant role \n     in the determination and delivery of medical care to the \n     individual at the time the individual makes an election to \n     receive hospice care.\n       For an individual to be eligible for Medicare-covered \n     hospice services, the individual's attending physician (not \n     including a nurse practitioner) and the medical director (or \n     physician member of the interdisciplinary group of the \n     hospice program) must each certify in writing that the \n     individual is terminally ill at the beginning of the first \n     90-day period of hospice.\n       Explanation of Provision\n       For purposes of a hospice written plan of care, the \n     provision would include a physician assistant in the \n     definition of an attending physician. The provision would \n     continue to exclude physician assistants from the authority \n     to certify an individual as terminally ill.\n       Both provisions would apply to items and services furnished \n     on or after January 1, 2009.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n        Coleman, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Cardin, Mr. Brown, Ms. Collins, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Reid, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S.J.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to offer \na resolution to designate March 25, 2008, as National Cerebral Palsy \nAwareness Day.\n  Cerebral palsy is a group of chronic, neurological disorders that \nappear in infancy or early childhood and permanently affect body \nmovement and muscle coordination necessary to maintain balance and \nposture. Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to one or more specific \nareas of the brain, usually occurring during fetal development; before, \nduring or shortly after birth; or during infancy. The top two risk \nfactors for the disorders are premature births and multiple births, and \ndespite the introductions of modern prenatal testing, improved \nobstetric care, and newborn intensive care technologies, the rate of \nincidence has increased in the United States. These disorders are not \ncaused by problems in the muscles or nerves but, instead, faulty \ndevelopment or damage to motor areas in the brain.\n  Cerebral palsy currently affects children at a rate of 1 in 278 and \nan estimated 800,000 Americans. The majority of children who have \ncerebral palsy are born with it, rather than developing the disorder \nover time; however, it may not be detected for months or years. Over \nseventy-five percent of individuals with cerebral palsy also have one \nor more additional developmental disability including epilepsy, \nintellectual disability, autism and visual impairments or blindness. \nThe disorders are not progressive and non-communicable.\n  Currently, there is no cure for cerebral palsy. There are treatments, \nhowever, which can serve to alleviate some of the symptoms. Treatments \nnow include physical and occupational therapy; speech therapy; drugs to \ncontrol seizures, relax muscle spasms, and alleviate pain; surgery to \ncorrect anatomical abnormalities or release tight muscles; braces and \nother orthotic devices; wheelchairs and rolling walkers; and \ncommunication aids such as computers with attached voice synthesizers.\n  It is essential that more research be conducted on ways in which to \nprevent and treat cerebral palsy. As Chairman of the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I led the \neffort to double funding for the National Institutes of Health, NIH. \nFunding for the NIH has increased from $11.3 billion in fiscal year \n1995 to $29.2 billion in fiscal year 2008. In 2007, the NIH provided \n$16 million for cerebral palsy research, which is a $4.5 million \nincrease over 2000, when the NIH provided $11.5 million. The Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, recently conducted a study on \nthe prevalence rates of cerebral palsy across the nation and found\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\nthe rates to be much higher than originally expected. This report will \nhelp the CDC to provide a more comprehensive picture of cerebral palsy \nand advance efforts to provide better services for these children.\n  Raising awareness of cerebral palsy is integral in the fight against \nthis debilitating condition. I encourage my colleagues to work with \nSenator Casey and me to designate March 25, 2008 as ``National Cerebral \nPalsy Awareness Day.''\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am proud to submit, along with Senator \nSpecter, this resolution declaring March 25 as National Cerebral Palsy \nAwareness Day. With this resolution, it is my hope that we can increase \neducation and public awareness about cerebral palsy among the general \npublic and the medical community.\n  Cerebral palsy, commonly referred to as CP, is not one disorder but \nmany. It includes any number of neurological disorders that may appear \nin infancy or early childhood and permanently affect body movement and \nthe muscle coordination necessary to maintain balance and posture. CP \nis caused by damage to one or more specific areas of the brain, usually \noccurring during fetal development, or before or during birth or \nshortly thereafter.\n  Although most children with CP are born with it, it is often not \ndetected until months or years later. The Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention estimate that about 10,000 babies will develop cerebral \npalsy each year in the United States. According to the March of Dimes, \nabout 2 to 3 children per 1,000 have cerebral palsy.\n  An estimated 800,000 people in the United States have CP. The average \nlifetime cost of cerebral palsy is estimated at nearly $1.5 million. \nThis includes expenses associated with additional doctor visits, speech \nand physical therapy, surgery, prescription drugs, transportation, \nemergency room visits, residential care, and other needed expenses. \nChildren with cerebral palsy need much more attention than other \nchildren do. They have special needs for movement, interaction, and \ncommunication and require daily assistance and therapy. Many times, \nparents do not know where to turn.\n  Clearly, children and families affected by cerebral palsy need our \nhelp, our understanding, and resources for research and treatment. The \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention have recently released \ninformation showing that the incidence of cerebral palsy is increasing \nand the rate is now about 1 in 278 children. While we presently have no \ncure for cerebral palsy, we do have treatments that will do much to \nimprove a child's abilities to live the fullest life possible. Most \nchildren with CP have the capacity for intellectual and emotional \ndevelopment, sometimes far beyond what others may expect of them. Life \nmay be more challenging and stressful, but that should not prevent \nthese children from getting all the help and resources we can offer \nthem and their families.\n  Scientists and researchers are hopeful that we will achieve a \nbreakthrough in treating cerebral palsy. But to do so, we must make \nthis disorder a priority in our research and medical communities.\n  Every child and adult with cerebral palsy faces unique challenges and \ntheir treatment and therapy must be tailored to meet their own unique \nneeds. But they do have one thing in common--they all share an \nintrinsic value and worth as human beings and children of God, equal to \nthe value and worth of any other human being on this Earth. Many times, \nindividuals with disabilities in one area have great gifts in other \nareas. With loving attention and care--and with more research into \ntreatments and assistive resources--individuals with cerebral palsy can \naccess their own unique gifts and full potential.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MEDICAID \n                   ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Medicaid program provides essential health care and \n     long-term care services to approximately 60,000,000 low-\n     income children, pregnant women, parents, individuals with \n     disabilities, and senior citizens. It is a Federal guarantee \n     that ensures the most vulnerable will have access to needed \n     medical services.\n       (2) Medicaid provides critical access to long-term care and \n     other services for the elderly and individuals living with \n     disabilities, and is the single largest provider of long-term \n     care services. Medicaid also pays for personal care and other \n     supportive services that are typically not provided by \n     private health insurance or Medicare, but are necessary to \n     enable individuals with spinal cord injuries, developmental \n     disabilities, neurological degenerative diseases, serious and \n     persistent mental illnesses, HIV/AIDS, and other chronic \n     conditions to remain in the community, to work, and to \n     maintain independence.\n       (3) Medicaid supplements the Medicare program for about \n     7,500,000 low-income elderly or disabled Medicare \n     beneficiaries, assisting them with their Medicare premiums \n     and co-insurance, wrap-around benefits, and the costs of \n     nursing home care that Medicare does not cover. The Medicaid \n     program spends over $100,000,000,000 on uncovered Medicare \n     services.\n       (4) Medicaid provides health insurance for more than one-\n     quarter of America's children and is the largest purchaser of \n     maternity care, paying for more than one-third of all the \n     births in the United States each year. Medicaid also provides \n     critical access to care for children with disabilities, \n     covering more than 70 percent of poor children with \n     disabilities.\n       (5) More than 21,000,000 women depend on Medicaid for their \n     health care. Women comprise the majority of seniors (64 \n     percent) on Medicaid. Half of nonelderly women with permanent \n     mental or physical disabilities have health coverage through \n     Medicaid. Medicaid provides treatment for low-income women \n     diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer in every State.\n       (6) Medicaid is the Nation's largest source of payment for \n     mental health services, HIV/AIDS care, and care for children \n     with special needs. Much of this care is either not covered \n     by private insurance or limited in scope or duration. \n     Medicaid is also a critical source of funding for health care \n     for children in foster care and for health services in \n     schools.\n       (7) Medicaid funds help ensure access to care for all \n     Americans. Medicaid is the single largest source of revenue \n     for the Nation's safety net hospitals, health centers, and \n     nursing homes, and is critical to the ability of these \n     providers to adequately serve all Americans.\n       (8) Medicaid serves a major role in ensuring that the \n     number of Americans without health insurance, approximately \n     47,000,000 in 2006, is not substantially higher. The system \n     of Federal matching for State Medicaid expenditures ensures \n     that Federal funds will grow as State spending increases in \n     response to unmet needs, enabling Medicaid to help buffer the \n     drop in private coverage during recessions.\n       (9) The Bush Administration has issued several regulations \n     that shift Medicaid cost burdens onto States and put at risk \n     the continued availability of much-needed services. The \n     regulations relate to Federal payments to public providers, \n     and for graduate medical education, rehabilitation services, \n     school-based administration, school-based transportation, \n     optional case management services.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that administrative regulations should not--\n       (1) undermine the role the Medicaid program plays as a \n     critical component of the health care system of the United \n     States;\n       (2) cap Federal Medicaid spending, or otherwise shift \n     Medicaid cost burdens to State or local governments and their \n     taxpayers and health providers, forcing a reduction in access \n     to essential health services for low-income elderly \n     individuals, individuals with disabilities, and children and \n     families; or\n       (3) undermine the Federal guarantee of health insurance \n     coverage Medicaid provides, which would threaten not only the \n     health care safety net of the United States, but the entire \n     health care system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4334.

Also transmitted \nfor the information of the Senate is the report of the Department of \nState with respect to the proposed Protocol.\n  The proposed Protocol would eliminate withholding taxes on cross-\nborder interest payments. In addition, the proposed Protocol would \ncoordinate the tax treatment of contributions to, and other benefits \nof, pension funds for cross-border workers. The proposed Protocol also \nincludes provisions related to the taxation of permanent \nestablishments, so-called dual-resident corporations, income derived \nthrough certain entities that are considered fiscally transparent, and \nformer U.S. citizens and long-term residents. The proposed Protocol \nfurther strengthens the existing Treaty's provisions that prevent the \nTreaty's inappropriate use by third-country residents. The proposed \nProtocol also provides for mandatory resolution of certain cases before \nthe competent authorities.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe proposed Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.

Res. 485) relative to the death of Howard \n     Metzenbaum, former United States Senator from the State of \n     Ohio.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sherrod Brown be added \nas an original cosponsor of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Senator Howard Metzenbaum was a \nprogressive visionary whose strong support for America's workers and \nconsumers left a lasting mark on our Nation. His determination to stand \nfor a more just America in the Senate was an inspiration to me and \neveryone with whom he served. His influence and the example he set \nstill resound strongly in the Senate chamber today.\n  I deeply appreciate how much support and guidance Senator Metzenbaum \ngave to me when I came to the Senate in 1993. He had a wonderful way of \nbringing progressives in Congress together, and I will always be very \ngrateful for that.\n  He was a force to be reckoned with on the Senate floor--earning the \nnickname ``Senator No'' through ingenious tactics to stop legislation \nthat threatening to hurt American workers and consumers. He was known \nfor never backing down from a Senate floor fight, and his opposition \nspelled trouble for almost any bill.\n  America's workers had no better friend and ally in Congress than \nSenator Metzenbaum, who sponsored the law requiring 60 days advance \nnotice for a plant closing. Whenever Congress acts to help those \nAmerican workers struggling in a difficult economy, we are building on \nSenator Metzenbaum's legacy.\n  He also took on Washington's most powerful interests in an \nunrelenting\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\npush to stop the wasteful spending that destroys the public's trust in \nelected officials. In this way, former Senator Metzenbaum laid the \nground work for those of us who continue the fight to rein in wasteful \ngovernment spending. His later service as the chairman of the Consumer \nFederation of America was a testament to his strong commitment to \nconsumer advocacy.\n  Howard Metzenbaum was such a distinguished Member of this body, both \nbecause he served the people of Ohio so well, and because he set such \nan outstanding example of courage and commitment to those of us who had \nthe privilege to serve with him. I join my colleagues, the State of \nOhio, and the entire Nation in paying tribute to this great American.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble be \nagreed to en bloc, and the motions to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 485) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 485\n\n        Whereas Howard Metzenbaum served the people of Ohio with \n     distinction for 8 years in the Ohio State Legislature;\n        Whereas Howard Metzenbaum served the people of Ohio with \n     distinction for 18 years in the United States Senate;\n        Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow \n     and deep regret the announcement of the death of the \n     Honorable Howard Metzenbaum, former member of the United \n     States Senate.\n        Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate communicate \n     these resolutions to the House of Representatives and \n     transmit an enrolled copy thereof to the family of the \n     deceased.\n        Resolved, That when the Senate recesses today, it stand in \n     recess as a further mark of respect to the memory of the \n     Honorable Howard Metzenbaum.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have spent a lot of time today with the \nPresident's Chief of Staff, Josh Bolten. I have said before, he is a \nvery pleasant man. We worked for a long time today trying to work \nourselves through the nominations. I think we made great progress. I \nthink we have teed things up to do even more when we come back after 2 \nweeks.\n  To show my good faith, when Mr. Bolten said he wanted to work with \nus, I approved Mr. Filip, who the Attorney General said was very \nimportant to him. Judge Filip left a Federal judgeship and is now \nacting as the Attorney General's Chief of Staff, for lack of a better \nword.\n  So we have made progress. And even through this that we have done \ntoday, I, in good faith, threw in some people I thought were important, \neven though we did not have them done--and that was not part of the \noriginal deal--and that was to confirm the head of the Internal Revenue \nService. But we have done that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/13/senate-section/article/S2190-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2190-S2194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Ferguson, which was \n     received by the Senate and appeared in the Congressional \n     Record of March 3, 2008.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the time before the 2-week Easter \nrecess, we continue to make progress in filling high level vacancies at \nthe Department of Justice. Today, the Senate will confirm three \nnominations to important positions at the Department, including \nnominations of David Hagy to be Director of the National Institute of \nJustice; Ondray Harris to be Director of the Community Relations \nService; and William Joseph Hawe to be U.S. Marshal for the Western \nDistrict of Washington.\n  I thank Senator Cardin for chairing the hearing on these nominations. \nWe continued our work in connection with high-ranking Department of \nJustice nominees earlier this week when Senator Kennedy chaired our \nhearing on the nomination of Grace Chung Becker to be Assistant \nAttorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division. The Civil \nRights Division is entrusted with protecting precious rights of \nAmericans, including our fundamental right to vote and our rights \nagainst discrimination. That hearing was the seventh the committee has \nheld since last September on executive nominations, as we continue to \nwork to restock and restore the leadership of the Department of Justice \nin the wake of the scandals of the Gonzales era.\n  A little more than a year ago, the Judiciary Committee began its \noversight efforts for the 110th Congress. Over the next 9 months, our \nefforts revealed a Department of Justice gone awry. The leadership \ncrisis came more and more into view as Senator Specter and I led a \nbipartisan group of concerned Senators to consider the U.S. attorney \nfiring scandal, a confrontation over the legality of the \nadministration's warrantless wiretapping program, the untoward \npolitical influence of the White House at the Department of Justice, \nand the secret legal memos excusing all manner of excess.\n  This crisis of leadership has taken a heavy toll on the tradition of \nindependence that has long guided the Justice Department and provided \nit with safe harbor from political interference. It shook the \nconfidence of the American people. Through bipartisan efforts among \nthose from both sides of the aisle who care about federal law \nenforcement and the Department of Justice, we joined together to press \nfor accountability. That resulted in a change in leadership at the \nDepartment, with the resignations of the Attorney General and many \nhigh-ranking Department officials.\n  The partisan accusations of ``slow walking'' nominations that the \nPresident engaged in at the White House recently, in which he used \nRepublican Senators and nominees as political props, are belied by the \nfacts. They are about as accurate as when President Bush ascribed \nAttorney General Gonzales' resignation to supposed ``unfair treatment'' \nand having ``his good name . . . dragged through the mud for political \nreasons.'' The U.S. Attorney firing scandal was of the administration's \nown making. It decimated morale at the Department of Justice. A good \nway to help restore the Justice Department would be for this \nadministration to acknowledge its wrongdoing.\n  What those who say we are ``slow-walking'' nominations do not say is \nthat as a result of the mass resignations at the Justice Department in \nthe wake of the scandals of the Gonzales era, the committee was holding \neight hearings on high-ranking replacements to restock and restore the \nleadership of the Department of Justice between September of last year \nand this month, including confirmation hearings for the new Attorney \nGeneral, the new Deputy Attorney General, the new Associate Attorney \nGeneral, and so many others. Of course those 5 months also include the \nDecember and January holiday period and break between sessions.\n  What is being ignored by the President and Senate Republicans as they \nplay to a vocal segment of their Republican base is that we have worked \nhard to make progress and restore the leadership of the Department of \nJustice. In the last few months, we have confirmed a new Attorney \nGeneral, a new Deputy Attorney General, held hearings for several other \nhigh-ranking Justice Department spots, and voted them out of the \nJudiciary Committee. Today we continue that progress with three more \nexecutive nominations confirmed.\n  We could have made progress even sooner, had the Republican members \nof the Judiciary Committee not effectively boycotted our business \nmeetings in February and obstructed our ability to report the O'Connor \nnominations and other high-ranking Justice Department nominations as \nwell as judicial nominations. I adjourned both our February 14 and \nFebruary 28 meetings for lack of a quorum.\n  It is vital that we ensure that we have a functioning, independent \nJustice Department. In January, the Judiciary Committee held our first \noversight hearing of the new session and the first with new Attorney \nGeneral Michael Mukasey. We held another oversight hearing this month \nwith FBI Director Mueller. These are more steps forward in our efforts \nto lift the veil of White House secrecy, restore checks and balances to \nour government, and begin to repair the damage this administration \ninflicted on the Department, our Constitution, and fundamental American \nvalues.\n  We continue to press for accountability even as we learn startling \nnew revelations about the extent to which some will go to avoid \naccountability, undermine oversight, and stonewall the American \npeople's right to the truth. We find shifting answers on issues \nincluding the admission that the CIA used waterboarding on detainees in \nreliance on the advice of the Department of Justice; the destruction of \nWhite House emails required by law to be preserved; and the CIA's \ndestruction of videotapes of detainee interrogations not shared with \nthe 9/11 Commission, Congress or the courts. The only constant is the \ndemand for immunity and unaccountability among those in the \nadministration. This White House continues to stonewall the legitimate \nneeds for information articulated by the Judiciary Committee and others \nin the Congress, and contemptuously to refuse to appear when summoned \nby congressional subpoena.\n  In spite of the administration's lack of cooperation, the Senate is \nmoving forward with the confirmation of these executive nominations. \nWith the confirmations today, we will have confirmed 26 executive \nnominations, including the confirmations of 9 U.S. attorneys, 5 U.S. \nmarshals, and the top 2 positions at the Justice Department so far this \nCongress.\n  Of course, we could have made even more progress had the White House\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\nsent us timely nominations to fill the remaining executive branch \nvacancies with nominees who will restore the independence of Federal \nlaw enforcement. There are now 19 districts across the country with \nacting or interim U.S. attorneys instead of Senate-confirmed, \npresidentially appointed U.S. attorneys. For more than a year I have \nbeen talking publicly about the need to name U.S. Attorneys to fill \nthese vacancies to no avail.\n  I was disappointed but not surprised to see the administration return \nto tired political attacks. What better time than right now, when the \neconomy is slipping farther off the tracks, when the President's budget \nshows record annual deficits, with Osama bin Laden still at large, when \ngas prices rise well beyond $3 a gallon, when we lost 63,000 jobs last \nmonth, and when a mortgage crisis grips many parts of the country. I \nwish the President would put aside his partisan playbook and work with \nus to address the priorities of ordinary Americans.\n  We have seen what happens when the rule of law plays second fiddle to \na President's agenda and the partisan desires of political operatives \nand it is a disaster for the American people. Both the President and \nthe Nation are best served by a Justice Department that provides sound \nadvice and takes responsible action, without regard to political \nconsiderations--not one that develops legalistic loopholes to serve the \nends of a particular administration.\n  I congratulate the nominees and their families on their confirmations \ntoday.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Kristine Svinicki\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my great pleasure \nwith the Senate confirmation of Kristine Svinicki to serve as a \nCommissioner of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  As you may know, Ms. Svinicki is both a longtime resident of my \nState, and a staff member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, which \nI have had the privilege to serve on for over 28 years.\n  During her time with the Senate Armed Services Committee, Ms. \nSvinicki served with distinction, immersing herself in nuclear energy \nmatters. Her tireless efforts proved invaluable in our committee's \nwork, and her service has been appreciated by not only me but by the \nother members of the Armed Services Committee--on both sides of the \naisle.\n  It is not well known in some quarters, but the Armed Services \nCommittee has jurisdiction over approximately two-thirds of the \nDepartment of Energy--including the very sizable nuclear weapons \nproduction sites and laboratory complex, as well as the extensive \nenvironmental program to clean up the legacy of nuclear contamination \ncreated during the Cold War. These are the programs which I hired \nKristine to staff.\n  With her extensive background and experience in nuclear matters both \nat the Department of Energy, where she worked prior to joining the \nArmed Services Committee, and subsequently in her work here in the \nSenate, Ms. Svinicki is uniquely poised to take on this next challenge.\n  It is my sincere belief that Kristine Svinicki will be a favorable \naddition to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and I am pleased the \nfull Senate agrees. I appreciate the overwhelming support given to her \nby this body, and I know she will do all in her power to honor the \ntrust placed in her by the President, the Senate, and the American \npeople.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, these have been approved; is that right?\n  Mr. BROWN. They have been.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just to show that we are trying to work with \nthe President's Chief of Staff, as I indicated earlier, we put this in. \nEven though it wasn't part of the original agreement I had with Mr. \nBolten, we added Doug Shuma, Commissioner of the Internal Revenue \nService--I am looking for Mr. Sullivan--and John J.
