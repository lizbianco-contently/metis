Mr. President, yesterday there was a vote, as we all knew \nthere would be--an overwhelming vote--to proceed to legislation to stem \nthe tide of global warming. This strong bipartisan vote came only after \nthe Republicans forced us to file cloture and use more of the Senate's \nvaluable time. Another filibuster. This is, as I have said before, \nfilibusters on steroids. We have never, ever, in the history of our \ngreat country, had as many filibusters as this Republican minority has \ninitiated. In a short 10 months, the 2-year record for filibusters was \nbroken by this Republican minority. They have stopped or slowed down \neverything they could. They have even forced us to file cloture on \nthings they agree on. Why? Because it eats up valuable time.\n  We now have 12 weeks left until our adjournment time. There is so \nmuch to do--so much to do. We are interested in doing the people's \nbusiness. The Republicans are interested in stalling--stalling. As an \nexample, today we should be on this piece of legislation, but, no, they \nare going to do as they have done time and time again: use 30 hours.\n  For everyone listening, what does this mean? The rules of the Senate \nare that once you file cloture--first of all, it takes a couple days to \nfile cloture. You have to let it wait for a couple days. Now, why would \nthey make us file cloture on this bill? It is bipartisan; it is \nsponsored by Senator Warner and Senator Lieberman, but they have done \nthis. So after we file cloture, we come in and we have a vote. \nRemember, we waste those days while cloture is ripening. Then, to make \nit even more absurd, the rule is that after cloture is invoked, you \nhave 30 hours. They make us use that 30 hours. It is wasted time. There \nis no reason we can't be on this bill.\n  I spoke to one of the Republican leaders yesterday, and he said: \nWell, we want more time to debate the bill. No one is taking any debate \ntime away from anybody. But shouldn't we be on the bill? So I say time \nruns out tonight, shortly before midnight, on the 30 hours. In the \nmorning, we are going\n\n[[Page S4902]]\n\nto be on this bill. That means we are going to have to stay in until \nmidnight tonight. That is up to the Republicans. That is up to the \nminority. But we are going to start legislating on this bill tomorrow \nmorning. As everyone knows, the rules around here allow me to have the \nright of recognition, first recognition. We are going to start \nlegislating in the morning.\n  I am happy if there is a need for more debate on the bill. This is an \nimportant bill. We should have all the debate; people should be able to \nmake their statements. I am not trying to disallow anyone from making \ntheir statement, but let's at least legislate, as we should in this \nmost serious body, the greatest debating--they say--body in the world, \nthe Senate of the United States.\n  This strong bipartisan vote came, as I have indicated, after \nRepublicans forced us to file cloture and use 2 days of Senate time, as \nI have already outlined. It forces us to waste 2 days for a vote they \noverwhelmingly supported. Now, the Republicans are forcing us to burn, \nas I have indicated, another 30 hours of procedural time before we can \nbegin debate. That is two filibusters and more than 3 days of valuable \nSenate time wasted, all for a vote that most Republicans supported. We \nshould have been on the bill, at the very least, last night.\n  Why would Republicans set these roadblocks to progress? I have \noutlined why. They are still in a snit because the American people \nsurprised everyone and we are in the majority. It is a slim majority, \nbut we are in the majority. We believe the people's business should be \nthe issue at hand.\n  I have said many times Republicans have every right to vigorously \ndebate and oppose legislation on which they have disagreements. That is \nhow the legislative process is supposed to work. The majority \nintroduces a bill, the two sides engage in debate and, in many cases, \nsome type of compromise is reached. Legislation is the art of \ncompromise. Then a vote is taken and whoever has the most votes--then \nwe have a winner and a loser. But most of the time, if you are moving \nforward, there are only winners, there are no losers.\n  The Republicans have every opportunity to debate this bill in public \nand negotiate it in private. That is what we would like to do. If there \nis some way they think this can be compromised, condensed, made bigger, \nwe are willing to work with them. This is a bipartisan bill. It is \ntheir legislative right and obligation--I understand that--to convince \nSenators who are in disagreement to join with them. But the \nunprecedented Republican filibustering we have seen renders the \nlegislative process difficult--difficult. Seventy-two times, and add to \nthis almost every time we have had to do 30 hours--sometimes twice.\n  So I think the American people are clearly seeing the picture. The \npicture is the Republicans are wanting to maintain the status quo. They \nare treading water until President Bush leaves. The good news for the \nAmerican people is there are only 7 months of that left. I think it is \nclear what has happened. You see in Louisiana, you see in Mississippi, \nyou see in Illinois, three heavily Republican House seats went \nDemocratic. Why? Because the American people see what is going on, just \nas they see that global warming is here. The American people aren't \ngoing to get lost in cap and trade. What they are concerned about is \nemissions, lowering emissions. They know it is a problem. They know \nwhat is going on in Congress is a problem. That is why we have seen \nthese special elections go overwhelmingly Democratic in places where \nthe Republicans always used to win.\n\n  On this legislation, I say to my friends, let's debate the \nlegislation, let's try to work to pass it. Let's try to move forward on \nit. Stop running out the clock. Engage in the legislative process so we \ncan continue to work toward making the American dream affordable for \nour country's struggling families once again.\n  The price of gasoline during the 7 years and 5 months President Bush \nhas been President has gone up 250 percent--250 percent. In Nevada, you \ncan still find a place to buy gas for less than $4 a gallon, but it is \nnot easy. One of my friends I went to high school with called me--Teddy \nSandoval, a wonderful guy. I have known him my whole life. He called \nme. I thought he was having some personal problem, and he was. Do you \nknow what it was? He said: Harry, I bought a diesel truck because \ndiesel fuel was so low, and now I can't afford to fill it anymore \nbecause diesel has gone way up.\n  Diesel. I saw over the holiday we just had, the week off we had, in \nCalifornia and Nevada diesel fuel was as much as $4.50 a gallon. My \nfriend told me he had been in New York, and it was $5.15 a gallon for \ndiesel fuel.\n  So I plead with my Republican friends: Let us move forward on this \nlegislation. I have said I don't want to use this term ``fill the \ntree,'' but we have to have some recognition from the Republicans that \nwe are going to legislate seriously. Do you remember what happened last \ntime when we said let's have an open amendment process? There was a \nrush to the floor to try to help John McCain on the flawed piece of \nlegislation he had. Thinking the GI bill of rights is too generous--too \ngenerous--they rushed to the floor to support John McCain's flawed GI \nbill of rights. Now, fortunately, Democrats and Republicans saw it was \nflawed. It took a lot of procedural time. The Republicans, which was \nnever done--never done previously, rarely done previously--would come \nwith a piece of their legislation and file cloture. That was a \nprerogative that was left to the majority. That was the way it was \naround here.\n  So unless we have some agreement that we are going to legislate \nappropriately on this bill, then I think we are going to have to step \nback and see what we can do because it will appear very clearly that \nthe Republicans are not at least willing to engage in that regard and \nthat they are not willing to engage in serious legislation.\n  There have been 72 Republican filibusters, and we are going up, not \ndown. That is not good for the country. It is not good for the Senate. \nI don't think it is good for my Republican colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4902-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I heard the distinguished majority leader \ncriticize the Republicans for wanting to have a debate on this piece of \nlegislation. Frankly, I think we would be remiss in our duties if we \ndidn't discuss this important piece of legislation, as complex and \ndifficult a topic as it is and, frankly, ask questions that I know our \nconstituents would ask of us were\n\n[[Page S4903]]\n\nwe to vote for or against this particular legislation.\n  I, for one, make no apologies for doing what I consider to be my \nduty, and I think all of us would do well to ask questions about this \nlegislation, which proposes a $6.7 trillion pricetag--that is trillion; \nnot billion, not million but trillion, $6.7 trillion.\n  We talk about what Congress has been doing. Let me mention what \nCongress has not been doing and what the Senate has not been doing.\n  It has been 109 days since the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nwas not reauthorized, which has hampered our ability to listen in on \nterrorist-to-terrorist communications.\n  We have spent 560 days since American businesses and farmers have \nbeen disadvantaged by not taking up the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. \nFor my State alone, it is roughly $2.3 billion a year. But my \nproducers, farmers, and manufacturers are disadvantaged by tariffs on \nthose goods when they are imported into Colombia, even though Colombian \ngoods bear zero tariffs coming into the United States. We ought to fix \nthat.\n  So it has been 560 days since that condition has existed. It has been \n705 days since some judicial nominees have been waiting for a vote. It \nhas been 771 days since Speaker Pelosi went campaigning before the 2006 \nelection and said, if elected, the Democrats would deliver a \ncommonsense solution to the price of gasoline and the pain consumers \nwere feeling at the pump. That was 771 days ago. Yet there has been no \nproposal by our friends in the majority to actually come up with a \ncommonsense solution to help ease the pain at the pump. Instead, we \nhave a bill which--while I don't question the motivation for the bill \nsince we are all concerned about the environment, I do think it is \nimportant that we ask questions about a bill that carries such a high \npricetag and which will have the impact of actually increasing the cost \nof energy--gasoline and electricity--rather than reducing it.\n  I must say that last week, like all the rest of my colleagues, I went \nback home and had a chance to visit with a number of my constituents. \nOf course, high gasoline prices was the No. 1 issue on their minds. \nEven though my State is doing relatively well compared to the rest of \nthe country, with about a 4.1-percent unemployment rate, we have seen \nsome softening in the housing market, but generally speaking, my State \nis prospering. We are grateful for that. But even people who have jobs \nand feel as though they are doing pretty well otherwise are still \nfeeling their paychecks shrink as a result of rising energy costs.\n  I am wondering why we are now on a piece of legislation that, rather \nthan reducing the cost of their gasoline or electricity, will actually \nincrease it. Right now, the average price of a gallon of gasoline \nacross the country is right at $4 per gallon.\n  As I talked to my constituents last week around the State, they asked \nme: What is Congress going to do to finally take action to lower those \nprices?\n  Well, unfortunately, I had to tell them we only got 42 votes on a \nprovision on a bill--the Domenici amendment--which would actually have \nincreased our use of American energy and reduced our dependency on \nimported oil from some of our enemies, such as Hugo Chavez from \nVenezuela and Ahmed Amadi Nejad from Iran, which are part of OPEC.\n  By our inaction in Congress, we are driving up that cost because, \nsince 1982, we have been putting vast American reserves of energy out \nof bounds through a moratorium that was enacted on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, through our unwillingness to explore and develop oil \nshale in the West and our unwillingness to allow the State of Alaska to \ndevelop its own energy reserves in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \nSo it is easy for me to understand, seeing that disconnect between what \nmy constituents are concerned about--high prices of energy, including \ngasoline--having to come back and debate a bill that will drive up \nthose costs even further--it is easy to see why more and more people \nbelieve Congress is totally disconnected from reality. Congress appears \nto have very little relevance to the issue that concerns the American \npeople the most, and that is the family budget.\n  I want to be clear about one matter though. The debate about our \nenvironment is one well worth having. Of course, we can all do better \nand should do better in being good stewards of the environment, \nconserving energy and reducing waste. Reducing dependency on foreign \noil and bringing down prices at the pump are needed too. My fear is \nthat this important issue is rapidly becoming just another tired \npolitical game.\n  Taking care of the environment is not a Republican versus Democrat \nissue. It should not be about partisan politics. Haven't we learned by \nnow that the American people are fed up with the games in Washington \nand want real solutions?\n  Well, yesterday, the majority leader and the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senator Boxer, were criticizing \nthe fact that we wanted to use some of the time today to ask questions \nabout this important legislation so that we could educate ourselves and \nour constituents about what is in this very complex piece of \nlegislation. But I do have some questions I hope will be answered in \nthis week's debate.\n  First of all, how much will this bill cost? I have read estimates \nthat this bill's pricetag is somewhere in the $6.7 trillion range. I \nfear that if that is correct, this is simply too costly of a burden to \nput on the American people. This is especially true when I believe more \ncost-effective solutions are available. I think we should balk at any \npiece of legislation that carries a pricetag of $6.7 trillion. Perhaps \nI have not been in Congress long enough to be jaded by such talk, and I \nhope I never am, but I still have trouble grasping the enormity of a \nnumber like $1 trillion. Now we are talking about $6.7 trillion. People \nin Congress tend to toss those numbers around like it is pocket change. \nBut this is real money coming out of the budgets of real people--the \nAmerican people.\n  I would like to know why $6.7 trillion, and what is that money going \nto be spent for?\n  Why do we have to opt for a cost in that range when there are more \ncost-effective solutions available, such as tax credits for developing \nrenewable energy, clean energy, like solar energy and wind energy? Why \naren't we doing more to develop our nuclear energy capacity to create \nelectricity, which is carbon free? Why aren't we doing that instead of \nspending $6.7 trillion?\n\n  I want to know what the impact of this legislation would be on our \neconomy and on the family budget. Already we have seen--as a result of \nthe inaction of Congress over this last 771 days, since our Democratic \ncolleagues said they had a commonsense plan to reduce the price of \ngasoline at the pump--the average American family lose $1,400 in \nincreased gasoline costs as a result of the rise in gasoline prices \nover that same period of time.\n  Now, some estimates are that Texas families--my constituents--would \npay an additional $8,000 if we pass this piece of legislation. That \nincludes, some estimates say, a 145-percent increase in electricity \ncosts and a 147-percent increase in gasoline costs. That is at least \n$5.30 a gallon at a time when gasoline is $3.98 a gallon.\n  Is it really true the proponents of this legislation want to raise \nthat to $5.30 a gallon? It seems to me we are going in the wrong \ndirection, not the right direction.\n  At the same time, it is estimated this legislation, if passed, would \nactually cause more than 300,000 Texans to lose their jobs. Overall, \nestimates indicate this bill could cost the economy in my State--one of \nthe States that is actually doing very well from an economic point of \nview--more than $50 billion in additional costs.\n  Mr. President, we cannot afford another wet blanket on our economy \ncaused by higher taxes and more expenses coming out of the family \nbudget and more pressure on our job creators that provide people an \nopportunity to put food on the table.\n  Another question I have is, if the United States of America decides \nto impose this costly burden on ourselves, will China and India \nlikewise impose the same burden on their energy industry? Of course, \nbooming industrial giants such as China and India both have 1 billion-\nplus people. We know we are increasingly in a global competition and \nnot only with India and China but the entire planet.\n\n[[Page S4904]]\n\n  Why in the world would we impose a costly piece of legislation in the \namount of $6.7 trillion on the American people and raise electricity \ncosts and gasoline costs and depress the gross domestic product of this \ncountry, putting people out of work, if our major global competitors \nare going to get off scot-free and not likewise constrain their economy \nby imposing these sorts of burdens on themselves?\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to know on what basis do the \nproponents of the legislation believe this bill will have its intended \neffect? If human beings contribute to climate change, which I will not \ndebate--I assume we do in some way or another--why have these targets \nbeen proposed? What is the science to justify those? What if those \ntargets are reached, albeit at a cost of $6.7 trillion, with rising gas \nand electricity costs and a depression effect on our gross domestic \nproduct? How do we know, and where is the science that says, this bill \nwill actually have its intended effect, particularly if China and \nIndia, our global competitors, don't participate?\n  The Wall Street Journal has dubbed this legislation ``the most \nextensive Government reorganization of the American economy since the \n1930s.'' It seems to me this is something we should debate and examine \nand we should ask questions about so that we will know what the effect \nof this bill will be if it is passed.\n  We have already seen that Congress is not exactly omniscient when it \ncomes to the energy area, where we have subsidized corn-based ethanol \nas an alternative to renewable sources of energy. The fact is, we found \nthere are unintended consequences when we use food for fuel.\n\n  How do we know this particular bill, the Boxer climate tax bill, will \nnot have unintended consequences? I fear it may not have the intended \neffect of reducing carbon emissions, and it may have some of the \nunintended and disastrous side effects I have already outlined.\n  If we are certain this is the right approach to protecting the \nenvironment, where is the evidence? Yesterday, the distinguished \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and today the \nmajority leader, complained about the fact that we want to use some \ntime today to ask these questions and get answers. We should not be \nasked nor should the American people be asked to accept this on faith: \nDon't worry, trust us. It reminds me of the most fearsome words in the \nEnglish language: We are from the Government, and we are here to help. \nIf that is true, the American people ought to see the evidence that \nwill justify this huge expenditure of their money, the huge increase in \nprices of energy, and the depressing effect on the economy, why that is \nnecessary, and whether it will actually work as intended. Where is the \nevidence?\n  Senator Boxer, the distinguished chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, said the rising cost would not be a problem \nbecause of tax offsets she has included in this bill. She assured us \nthis bill contained almost $1 trillion of tax relief, so that if we do \nsee some of the increases in energy costs in the early years--\nelectricity, for example--we can offset that. It almost boggles the \nimagination that the primary author of this legislation, Senator Boxer, \nwould essentially concede that there will be rising energy costs as a \nresult of this legislation and say we ought to spend $1 trillion more \nof the taxpayers' money to provide offsets for relief. This huge, \ncomplex bill deserves all the scrutiny we can give it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to say, first of all, that \nI share some of the great concerns of my colleague from Texas.\n  Today, I rise to address the legislative proposal introduced by \nSenators Lieberman and Warner to address global climate change. Like \nmany of my colleagues, I share the urgency to take proactive steps to \naddress this challenge we have.\n  That said, I have serious reservations about the proposal. I think it \nis overly aggressive, vastly outpacing what technology can provide and \nthus ensuring enormous economic pain on the country, and it is overly \nbureaucratic and cumbersome in its implementation, representing an \nunprecedented expansion of Government power and a massive bureaucratic \nintrusion into American lives that will have a profound effect on \nbusinesses, communities, and families.\n  The EPA has stated in answer to a letter I sent them that this \nprogram will take between 300 and 400 people to implement, whereas the \nacid rain provision takes just under 30.\n  The major failure of this legislation is it fails to harmonize our \ncountry's economic energy and environmental objectives, and the \nconsequences to American interests could be devastating.\n  The international aspect of this problem is particularly troublesome. \nThe developing world is currently undertaking an intensive expansion of \nenergy infrastructure and escalating industrial and commercial \nexpansion to meet the demands of growing domestic and international \nmarkets. The developing nations' combined emissions shortly will exceed \nthe developed nations' combined emissions.\n  In 2007, ``[t]he International Energy Agency issued a . . . report \nprojecting global energy demand would increase by more than one-half by \n2030, and that `Developing countries . . . contribute 74 percent of the \nincrease in global primary energy use . . . China and India alone \naccount for 45 percent of that increase.' ''\n  China puts on line two coal-fired plants every week--two coal-fired \nplants every week. In June, the Netherlands Environmental Assessment \nAgency announced that China's 2006 CO2 emissions surpassed \nthose of the United States by 8 percent. With this, China tops the list \nof CO2-emitting countries for the first time and, by the \nway, years ahead of the projections that were made a couple of years \nago.\n  Much like China, those countries with large domestic reserves of \ncoal--and that includes the United States--will continue to use it. It \nis unrealistic to assume that the world would turn its back on this \nabundant resource. We must take this reality into account, and this can \nbe done by jump-starting the technology that is needed to produce the \nenergy we need in an environmentally sound manner.\n  Recognizing the international dynamic of this problem, the Lieberman-\nWarner proposal attempts to impose a tariff-like requirement to hold \ncarbon credits for goods entering the United States from countries that \ndo not control their emissions. The U.S. Trade Representative has \nquestioned the plan's efficacy, and China, Mexico, and Brazil have \nsignaled that the policy could begin a trade war. Indeed, top officials \nfrom the European Union and the United Nations have also raised doubts \nabout whether the U.S. trade penalties would harm the prospects of a \nnew global warming agreement.\n  But even if the provision is WTO compliant, it will not address the \nunderlying competitiveness issues the United States would face from the \nhigher fuel, feedstock, and electricity prices the bill would impose on \nU.S. manufacturers.\n  A better approach is needed. Americans are already struggling with \nthe increase in their cost of living due to higher prices for gasoline, \nhome heating fuel, electricity, food, and health care, and this bill \nwould only make things worse. I wish some of the sponsors would go back \ninto their respective constituencies to hear the complaints from most \npeople--middle-class people, poor, the retirees--whose standard of \nliving is being reduced in the country today because of these costs.\n  We cannot tolerate policies that harm our economy and drive \nbusinesses overseas. If those businesses locate in countries that do \nnot share our environmental objectives, then we are worse off on two \ncounts: Fewer jobs in the United States and no benefits at all to the \nenvironment.\n  Over my strenuous objections, this bill was voted out of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee without an analysis of the \neconomic impacts on the country from either the EPA or the Energy \nInformation Office. Today, we have at least a dozen analyses of the \nbill from a wide variety of groups, and they are all about the same.\n  EPA's analysis predicts that by 2030, annual losses in gross domestic \nproduct could be as high as $983 billion, and by 2050, those losses \nwould grow to $2.8 trillion. To put this into perspective,\n\n[[Page S4905]]\n\nCBO projects the Federal budget for this year will be $2.9 trillion. \nThat means the potential impact losses from this legislation in 2050 \nwould equal that spent on everything we intend to spend this year from \nSocial Security to national defense. Think about it.\n  In order to meet the caps of the bill, the analysis assumes \naggressive growth in nuclear and other clean energy technologies at \nrates that are widely regarded as unachievable and, from my \nperspective, unbelievable. For example, they predict a 150-percent \nincrease in nuclear power by 2050. Today, there are 104 operating \nplants, meaning that we have to build up to another 150 new plants by \n2050. The Energy Information Office said, when they did the analysis, \nthat we would have to build 220 of them by 2030 in order for these caps \nto be realistic. These assumptions are unrealistic and mask the true \ncost of implementing the bill.\n  In regard to nuclear power, I recently published a paper in the \nNuclear News on the steps we need to take to launch a nuclear \nrenaissance. I am going to make certain that each Member receives a \ncopy of this paper. But bringing vast amounts of new nuclear power on \nline will not be a layup shot. For example, there is only one company \nand one plant in the world that makes the vessels and forges for \nplants. Recently, we anticipated new plants would cost about $5 \nbillion. The new cost is $7 billion per copy. Today, we have pending at \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission 9 applications for 15 new plants \nthat, if constructed, would not come on line until 2015, 2016, and \n2017. Honestly, we are going to be lucky to have 30 new nuclear \npowerplants by 2030.\n  In regard to what we call capture carbon and sequestration--the \ntechnology that is needed--no commercial experience or testing at scale \nhas been done. DOE says it will take 10 years before the seven large-\nscale demonstration tests are complete to look at sequestration. DOE \nsaid that a more robust geological assessment will not be complete \nuntil 2015. Liability and critical infrastructure issues remain \nunanswered, and DOE says commercial CCS may not be available for 20 \nyears.\n  The connection between the costs of the program and the availability \nof clean energy technology is clear. As EIA points out:\n\n       The . . . timing of the development, commercialization, and \n     deployment of low-emissions electricity generating \n     technologies such as nuclear power, coal with CCS, and \n     dispatchable renewable power is a major detriment of the \n     energy and economic impacts of 2191.\n\n  I want to repeat that.\n\n       The . . . timing of the development, commercialization, and \n     deployment of low-emissions electricity generating \n     technologies such as nuclear power, coal with [carbon capture \n     sequestration], and dispatchable renewable power is a major \n     detriment of the energy and economic impacts of 2191.\n\n  The Cleveland Plain Dealer, which is the largest newspaper in the \nState of Ohio, this Sunday editorialized on this bill. The title is \n``This carbon bill isn't the answer.'' It goes on to say:\n\n       The bill, as conceived, will just bore new holes into an \n     already battered economy. . . .\n       Coal-dependent states with partially deregulated energy \n     prices--Ohio, for instance--would take a double hit in \n     economic dislocations and electricity price spikes, with \n     barely any financial cushions to make the disruptions more \n     palatable. The bill also lacks the kind of consumer fairness \n     and flexibility necessary to avoid fuel-price shocks and \n     damage to manufacturing nationwide.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this editorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Plain Dealer, June 1, 2008]\n\n                   This Carbon Bill Isn't the Answer\n\n       The latest version of a bill that would mandate a carbon \n     emissions cap-and-trade system for utilities and others using \n     high-carbon coal is due to come before the full U.S. Senate \n     on Monday. It could be voted on before the end of the week.\n       To judge from the intensity of lobbying, you'd think it was \n     a proposal to make it easier to exit Iraq, corral oil prices, \n     revive the economy, spur renewable energy investments and end \n     unemployment.\n       You'd be wrong on all counts.\n       The bill, as conceived, will just bore new holes into an \n     already battered economy.\n       It also doesn't have a prayer of becoming law. There is no \n     companion legislation in the House, and President Bush \n     threatens a veto if one materializes.\n       Neither of Ohio's senators has said he supports it, and the \n     big push by environmentalists to try to swing one of those \n     likely nays--the one belonging to freshman Democrat Sherrod \n     Brown--is all about symbolism over substance. In failing to \n     compromise on issues of regional equity repeatedly \n     highlighted by Ohio's other senator, George Voinovich, the \n     bill's supporters evince crass disregard for the economic \n     realities of hard-hit manufacturing states.\n       Neither Brown nor Voinovich denies the need to reduce \n     carbon emissions and address global warming.\n       That need is increasingly urgent, given recent findings by \n     scientists within the formerly skeptical Bush administration \n     on how accelerating climate change is beginning to impact \n     Americans' well-being.\n       Yet the hammer-and-tong approach of the Senate bill--\n     originally sponsored by Democrat Joe Lieberman of Connecticut \n     and Republican John Warner of Virginia and recently tweaked \n     by Democrat Barbara Boxer of California--lacks even a \n     semblance of balance.\n       Coal-dependent states with partially deregulated energy \n     prices--Ohio, for instance--would take a double hit in \n     economic dislocations and electricity price spikes, with \n     barely any financial cushions to make the disruptions more \n     palatable. The bill also lacks the kind of consumer fairness \n     and flexibility necessary to avoid fuel-price shocks and \n     damage to manufacturing nationwide.\n       Those who have watched the Europeans' cap-and-trade system \n     deteriorate into a nightmare of bureaucratic costs, \n     nonsensical investments in outdated factories in China and \n     puzzling price spikes in which the utilities were the only \n     clear winners can be excused for scratching their heads over \n     why cap-and-trade remains the ``only'' idea worth pursuing.\n       Surely there are less cumbersome, more equitable ways of \n     making carbon emissions more expensive, and thus spurring \n     investment in new technologies, without breaking the banks of \n     both small-town and industries Ohio.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the paper I have written on the nuclear renaissance.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Nuclear News, March 2008]\n\n                Making the Nuclear Renaissance a Reality\n\n                        (By George V. Voinovich)\n\n       In September, for the first time in over 30 years, a \n     license application to build a new nuclear power plant was \n     filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Three more \n     applications soon followed. The NRC expects to receive 18 \n     more applications within the next two years for a total of \n     more than 30 new reactors. Although no applicant has yet made \n     a firm commitment to build, a number of them have made \n     significant investments, such as ordering long-lead \n     construction items. Internationally, the resurgence seems to \n     be moving at a faster pace. According to the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency, there are 34 reactors in various stages \n     of construction in 14 countries.\n       The underlying political climate for nuclear power has \n     changed over the past several years, influenced by a \n     confluence of factors: the growing demand for electricity, \n     sharp increases in the prices of natural gas and oil, and the \n     increased emphasis on clean energy. Recent government \n     policies, such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005, have \n     certainly helped in stimulating private sector investment for \n     new nuclear as part of a portfolio of ``environmentally \n     clean'' energy projects. At the state level, legislation has \n     passed or is being considered in Georgia, Iowa, Wisconsin, \n     Florida, Virginia, Kansas, South Carolina, and Texas \n     recognizing the value of a diverse energy portfolio that \n     includes new nuclear plants. These factors have created an \n     environment in which nuclear has once again emerged as a \n     viable (perhaps one of only a few) energy source for baseload \n     generating capacity.\n       Currently, 50 percent of our electricity comes from coal, \n     19 percent from nuclear, 19 percent from natural gas, 9 \n     percent from renewable sources such as hydro, solar, and \n     wind, and 3 percent from oil. Of these, coal and nuclear \n     (with average capacity factor of about 90 percent) have been \n     the backbone of baseload generating capacity, since they are \n     capable of providing a steady flow of power to the grid at \n     low cost and high efficiency. Solar and wind power plants \n     produce electricity only when conditions are right; when the \n     sun sets or the wind calms, their output drops, regardless of \n     the demand for electricity. Natural gas power plants are too \n     expensive to run as baseload plants due to volatility in \n     natural gas prices.\n       According to the Energy Information Agency, U.S. \n     electricity consumption is projected to grow from 3821 \n     billion kilowatt-hours in 2005 to 5478 billion kilowatt-hours \n     by 2030, an increase of more than 43 percent. To be sure, we \n     must have greater efficiency, more demand-side management, \n     and more renewable energy, but we must also have clean coal \n     and nuclear generating capacity to sustain our $ll-trillion-\n     a-year economy. With increasing environmental constraints, \n     particularly the desire for caps on carbon emissions, \n     expanding nuclear's share of baseload seems logical. The 104 \n     nuclear power plants operating today represent over 70 \n     percent of the nation's emission-free generation portfolio, \n     avoiding 681 million metric tons of CO2, compared \n     with 13.1 million tons for wind and 0.5 million tons for \n     solar.\n\n[[Page S4906]]\n\n       So it is no accident that there is a growing realization \n     among environmentalists, scientists, the media, think tanks, \n     and policymakers that nuclear power must play an important \n     role in harmonizing the country's need for energy \n     independence, economic competitiveness, and a healthy \n     environment. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), chairwoman of \n     the Environment and Public Works Committee, recently stated: \n     ``I am a pragmatist. The vast majority of the members on my \n     committee support nuclear power, and so do the majority in \n     the Senate. . . . I don't think there is any question that we \n     are going to be seeing new plants.'' Patrick Moore, one of \n     the founders of Greenpeace, also caused a stir last year when \n     he declared that ``nuclear energy is the only large-scale, \n     cost-effective energy source that can reduce emissions while \n     continuing to satisfy a growing demand for power . . . and \n     these days it can do so safety.'' They have come to a similar \n     conclusion: If we are to meet the growing electricity needs \n     in this country and also address global climate change, \n     nuclear power has a crucial role to play.\n       Despite these positive developments, a number of formidable \n     challenges to realizing a nuclear renaissance remain, \n     particularly in the areas of regulatory uncertainty, \n     financing, availability of human capital, expansion of the \n     domestic supply chain infrastructure, and nuclear waste \n     management. I intend to take steps, together with other \n     stakeholders, to turn these challenges into opportunities. My \n     hope is that these steps will serve as a road map to making \n     the nuclear renaissance a reality.\n\n\n                         regulatory uncertainty\n\n       Processing 22 or more new plant license applications \n     concurrently on schedule in a thorough manner will be a \n     monumental challenge for the NRC, which has not seen this \n     type of major licensing action in the past 25 years or so. \n     That is why as chairman of the Senate Environment and Public \n     Works Committee's Subcommittee on Clean Air and Nuclear \n     Safety between 2003 and 2006, and now as ranking member, I \n     have focused a great deal of time and effort on making sure \n     that the NRC is gearing up to meet this challenge and avoid a \n     bottleneck. My management philosophy since my days as mayor \n     of Cleveland and governor of Ohio hasn't changed: Place the \n     right people to run the agencies and departments, provide \n     them with the resource and tools necessary to do their jobs \n     effectively and efficiently, and then hold them accountable \n     for results.\n       Together with Sen. Tom Carper (D., Del.) and Sen. Jim \n     Inhofe (R., Okla.), I introduced a number of bills--the \n     Nuclear Fees Reauthorization Act of 2005 (S. 858), the \n     Nuclear Safety and Security Act of 2005 (S. 864), and the \n     Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 2005 (S. 865)--to provide \n     the NRC with what it needs in terms of legislative reforms, \n     human capital, and other resources to do its job effectively \n     and efficiently. These pieces of legislation were enacted \n     into law as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Among \n     other things, these bills authorized the NRC to take \n     innovative steps to attract both young talent and retired \n     experts to address the agency's anticipated shortages in \n     technical capabilities.\n       The NRC's licensing process has been completely overhauled. \n     All regulatory approvals are now received up front based on a \n     completed plant design, before construction starts and \n     significant capital is placed at risk. Under the old process, \n     repeated construction delays and massive cost overruns were \n     common as applicants struggled to stay ahead of evolving \n     regulatory requirements and design changes. The old process \n     required two separate permits--one to begin construction of \n     the plant, and one to operate it--allowing multiple \n     opportunities for delay. Some multibillion-dollar facilities \n     stood idle for years while licensing proceedings ground \n     slowly to completion. The new process requires only a single \n     combined construction and operating license (COL) for both \n     functions. There are opportunities for public participation \n     in the new process, but most of those occur before \n     construction begins, when such participation is most \n     productive.\n       While the new licensing process is a significant \n     improvement over the old process, a level of healthy \n     skepticism remains by virtue of the fact that the new process \n     has not yet been tested. Given the complexities involved, it \n     is perfectly reasonable to expect some wrinkles during the \n     NRC's review of the first few applications under the new \n     process. In my view, the level of success and certainty in \n     the process will depend in large part on the discipline with \n     which the process is implemented by both the NRC and the \n     applicants.\n       Finally, and perhaps most important, the composition and \n     the stability of the commission will be more critical than \n     ever before. Senator Carper and I will work with the \n     administration and the Senate leadership to ensure that \n     future appointees have a balanced and objective view \n     regarding nuclear power and its role in harmonizing the \n     country's need for energy independence, economic \n     competitiveness, and a healthy environment.\n\n\n                               Financing\n\n       The nuclear industry's major financing challenge is the \n     cost of new baseload nuclear power plants relative to the \n     size of the companies that must make those investments. \n     Unregulated generating companies and regulated integrated \n     utilities represent different business models, and those \n     differences influence how these companies approach nuclear \n     plant financing. Regulated companies expect to finance \n     nuclear plants in the same way they finance all major capital \n     projects, with state regulatory approval and reasonable \n     assurance of investment recovery through approved rate \n     charges. These companies must know--before construction \n     begins--that their investment in a new nuclear plant is \n     judged prudent and can be recovered. Unregulated companies \n     rely on debt financing with a highly leveraged capital \n     structure. Since the estimated cost of a new nuclear plant \n     ($5 billion to $6 billion) is a significant fraction of the \n     company's assets, it is in effect a bet-the-company decision.\n       To help overcome these obstacles, the Energy Policy Act of \n     2005 provides key incentives for investments in new nuclear \n     plants: a production tax credit of $18 per megawatt-hour for \n     the first 6000 megawatts of new nuclear capacity; regulatory \n     risk insurance against delays in commercial operation caused \n     by licensing or litigation for up to $500 million for the \n     first two plants and $250 million for the next four; and loan \n     guarantees up to 80 percent of the cost of projects, such as \n     nuclear plants, that reduce emissions. While the production \n     tax credit certainly improves the financial attractiveness of \n     a project during its commercial operation, and regulatory \n     risk insurance provides a safety net in case of regulatory \n     delays, it is the loan guarantee provision that makes the \n     difference for unregulated companies in deciding whether or \n     not to build. Properly implemented, this loan guarantee \n     program allows unregulated companies building nuclear plants \n     to employ a more leveraged capital structure at reduced \n     financing costs, which then benefits consumers through lower \n     rates for the price of electricity.\n       I have worked hard to make the loan guarantee program \n     perform as Congress intended in the Energy Policy Act of \n     2005--that is, to attract sufficient private capital at low \n     cost. In addition to meeting with key administration \n     officials, including then Office of Management and Budget \n     Director Rob Portman and Energy Secretary Sam Bodman, in \n     2007. I introduced the Voinovich-Carper-Inhofe Amendment (SA-\n     1575) to the Energy Bill (H.R. 6) to allow loan guarantees of \n     100 percent of the loan amount for capital-intensive projects \n     such as nuclear and clean coal, provided that the borrower \n     pays for the loan subsidy costs. Although this amendment did \n     not make it into the final version of the Energy Bill, the \n     administration recently issued a final rule that in effect \n     adopts the intent of the Voinovich-Carper-Inhofe amendment.\n       I have also been working with the Senate appropriators to \n     increase the fiscal year 2008 cap on the aggregated value of \n     the guaranteed loans. On June 15, together with Senators \n     Carper and Inhofe, I sent a letter to the appropriators \n     urging them to increase the cap from $9 billion (as called \n     for in the president's budget) to an amount sufficient to \n     cover all qualified and worthy energy projects, including new \n     nuclear, clean coal, renewable energy, and energy efficiency \n     projects. The appropriators responded by increasing the cap \n     to $38.5 billion, with $18.5 billion for new nuclear, $6 \n     billion for clean coal-based power generation and \n     gasification plants that incorporate carbon capture and \n     sequestration, $2 billion for advanced coal gasification, $10 \n     billion for renewable energy, and $2 billion for a uranium \n     enrichment facility.\n       Another critical factor for the successful implementation \n     of the loan guarantee program is a transparent methodology \n     for calculating the credit subsidy cost to be paid by project \n     sponsors. Such costs should be reasonable and commercially \n     viable. I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues and \n     the administration to make sure the loan guarantee program is \n     working the way it is intended to work. The need for \n     government-sponsored investment incentives should be only \n     temporary. Once it is shown that new plants can be built to \n     schedule and budget, the sector will take care of itself. I \n     don't want to create a ward of the state, but rather to \n     overcome initial hurdles and nurture a sector that makes \n     economic and policy sense on its own.\n\n\n                  Human capital and job opportunities\n\n       Senator Carper and I recently held a nuclear energy \n     roundtable with representatives from organized labor, \n     industry, academia, professional societies, and government \n     agencies. The roundtable was very productive as it raised an \n     awareness of the impending shortage of the skilled workers \n     needed to support the nuclear renaissance. Government, \n     industry, and labor efforts in the development of a skilled \n     workforce must be coordinated in order to align with \n     anticipated investment in new plants. Each new nuclear plant \n     will require 1400-1800 workers during construction, with peak \n     employment of as many as 2300 workers. Skilled tradesmen in \n     welding, pipefitting, masonry, carpentry, sheet metal, and \n     heavy equipment operations--among others--all stand to \n     benefit. If the industry were to construct the 30 reactors \n     that are currently projected, 43,400 to 55,800 workers would \n     be required during construction, with peak employment of up \n     to 71,300 workers. Everyone at the roundtable agreed that the \n     construction of more than 30 new reactors over the next 15 to \n     20 years could present an enormous challenge for the nuclear \n     industry.\n       The roundtable resulted in a number of recommendations to \n     turn this challenge into an opportunity, including the \n     following: (1) use recent retirees as instructors, mentors,\n\n[[Page S4907]]\n\n     and advisors; (2) provide more flexibility to a younger \n     generation of workers; (3) invest in building a pipeline of \n     future workers by front-loading recruitment and training--the \n     philosophy of ``just-in-time'' inventory does not work \n     with human capital; (4) identify all existing public and \n     private-sector training programs, and then leverage and \n     fund those that are successful (e.g., Helmets to Hardhats \n     and the Building Construction Trade Department's training \n     program); and (5) provide adequate and consistent funding \n     in science and technology for universities and colleges.\n       Successful follow-through on these suggestions requires a \n     collaborative effort from the federal and state governments, \n     industry, organized labor, and academia. Congress has \n     demonstrated leadership in addressing some of these workforce \n     challenges. The recently enacted America Competes Act \n     establishes a solid policy framework for addressing the \n     science, technology, engineering, and math workforce \n     challenges identified in the National Academies' report, \n     Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing \n     America for a Brighter Economic Future. Sen. Jeff Bingaman \n     (D., N.M.) and I fought to restore federal funding to support \n     nuclear science and engineering programs at universities \n     across the country in FY 2007 and FY 2008.\n       Senator Carper and I are planning a follow-up roundtable in \n     mid-2008 to align investment and workforce development \n     initiatives to ensure the collaboration and coordination of \n     government, industry, and labor efforts in developing the \n     energy-related skilled work force, and to solicit input on \n     legislative support.\n\n\n               Expanding the domestic manufacturing base\n\n       In the three decades since the last nuclear plant was \n     ordered and the two decades since the bulk of the nuclear \n     plant construction was completed in the United States, the \n     nuclear design, manufacturing, and construction industry has \n     significantly declined. The leading U.S. firms have either \n     ceased operation, consolidated, or become subsidiaries of \n     non--U.S. parent companies. The companies that remain have \n     survived by retrofitting and maintaining existing U.S. \n     plants.\n       Initially, it will not be possible to manufacture all of \n     the major plant components required of new nuclear plants in \n     the United States. Successfully bringing the planned 30 or \n     more new nuclear reactors on line, however, requires the \n     reestablishment of the construction and component supply \n     industries, as well as the supplier network needed to support \n     those industries--from the steam generators and reactor \n     vessel heads to the thousands of valves, pumps, heat \n     exchangers, and other parts used in a nuclear plant. The \n     potential for growth in the manufacturing sector and \n     manufacturing jobs to support the construction of 30 new \n     nuclear plants is staggering.\n       I am a strong advocate for government policies that \n     encourage private-sector investment in the manufacturing of \n     various components and pieces of equipment for the energy \n     sector. This includes the nuclear industry, as well as other \n     energy technologies the nation will need, such as carbon \n     capture and sequestration. The United States has long been a \n     leader in innovation and advanced manufacturing. We need to \n     promote policies that take advantage of the growth of our \n     energy sector and of American ingenuity, productivity, and \n     entrepreneurship by encouraging the manufacturing industries \n     that will support future energy development to produce their \n     products in the United States.\n       I introduced the Voinovich-Carper-Inhofe Amendment (SA-\n     1683) to the Energy Bill (H.R. 6) to make American-\n     manufactured nuclear components, parts, and service-related \n     jobs available to foreign markets. The support of our House \n     colleagues--Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Ranking \n     Member Joe Barton (R., Tex.) of the House Energy and Commerce \n     Committee--was instrumental in getting this piece of \n     legislation passed and signed into law. This legislation is \n     anticipated to spur growth in U.S. manufacturing for new \n     international commercial nuclear power plants, create highly \n     skilled jobs across the United States, and provide American \n     companies and workers access to foreign markets that have \n     long been dominated by foreign competitors.\n\n\n                         Managing nuclear waste\n\n       The U.S. high-level radioactive waste management program \n     under the Department of Energy has faced several challenges \n     for many years. First, a redirection of the program has \n     occurred with every change in administration. Second, a \n     majority of the Nuclear Waste Fund revenues are consistently \n     applied to support congressional budgetary priorities rather \n     than their intended purposes. Third, the annual \n     appropriations process provides for ongoing opportunities for \n     those opposed to the direction of the program to interfere \n     with its success.\n       At the time the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was signed into \n     law in 1982, the direct disposal of spent fuel as a national \n     policy was established on the premise that the existing fleet \n     of nuclear plants would operate only through their initial \n     40-year license and then be retired, with no new plants being \n     built. This was during the post-Three Mile Island accident \n     era, when nearly 100 planned nuclear plants were canceled. \n     Today, the story is vastly different, with most nuclear \n     plants likely to extend their operating lives to at least 60 \n     years. Also, there may be as many as 30 new nuclear power \n     plants planned in the next 15 to 20 years.\n       I held a subcommittee hearing in September 2006 to examine \n     both short- and long-term options for the nuclear waste \n     issue. One of the options discussed was a program to \n     determine whether the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel \n     should be adopted in some form, rather than the current \n     policy of direct disposal. Through reprocessing, uranium and \n     plutonium recovered from spent fuel can be recycled into new \n     fuel. Reprocessing also serves to significantly reduce the \n     volume of material requiring geologic disposal. Reprocessing \n     technology has been used on a commercial scale for many years \n     in a number of countries. The renewed interest in an expanded \n     role for nuclear power in the climate change debate further \n     emphasizes the importance of reexamining U.S. policies \n     related to the nuclear fuel cycle. I believe we should not \n     remain solely fixated on a waste solution that was designed \n     for a different day.\n       Another idea presented at the hearing involves long-term \n     interim storage perhaps complementing a spent fuel recycling \n     program. While permanent disposal at Yucca Mountain or a \n     similar facility remains a long-term imperative, the \n     combination of short-term on-site storage and longer-term \n     interim storage of spent fuel gives us time to complete the \n     technology development needed to safely and securely recycle \n     spent nuclear fuel.\n       Senator Carper and I plan to hold a roundtable to solicit \n     input from various stakeholders to help us develop a \n     legislative proposal with the following objectives in mind: \n     (1) implement an accountable and sustainable governance \n     structure to execute the federal government's \n     responsibilities under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act; (2) \n     enable the investigation of recycling spent nuclear fuel with \n     appropriate consideration of safety, nuclear proliferation, \n     environmental, energy supply, and economic factors; and (3) \n     ensure that the fees paid into the Nuclear Waste Fund are \n     applied for their intended purpose--i.e., the disposal of \n     radioactive wastes produced by the generation of electricity \n     from nuclear power--in a manner insulated from political \n     influences.\n       I believe that the safe and secure growth of nuclear energy \n     is essential if we are to harmonize the country's need for \n     energy independence, economic competitiveness, and a healthy \n     environment. Nuclear power is growing in the world, and our \n     own energy needs can serve as a springboard to rebuild U.S. \n     technology and manufacturing capabilities to something \n     approaching the leadership the nation once enjoyed, \n     contributing to foreign markets as well as supporting our \n     own. I intend to work with my colleagues in the Senate to \n     build bipartisan support and leadership for making the \n     nuclear renaissance a reality.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, while coal and manufacturing States pay \ntheir neighbors and the Government to stay in business, the bill \nestablishes trillions of dollars in new entitlements, earmarks--\nearmarks--with money flowing to over 30 new Government spending \nprograms, constituting, as the Wall Street Journal recently pointed \nout, one of the largest tax-and-spend bills in the Nation's history.\n  Based on EPA's analysis, this bill would raise over $6 trillion from \nthe allowance auction from owners and operators of utilities and \nfactories that have to purchase allowances to stay in business. But the \ncost of purchasing these allowances would be passed on to consumers as \nhigher prices, which will, as the CBO points out, amount to a \nregressive tax hitting low- and middle-income working families. In my \nState, they predict that by 2012, the cost of electricity will go up 50 \npercent, the cost of natural gas 80 percent, and the cost of gasoline \nwill go up 30 percent. Some of my constituents say: How can the cost of \ngasoline go up? I point out to them that we have refineries that refine \noil. With this bill, they are going to have to buy allowances, and \nthose allowances will increase the cost of your gasoline 30 percent. \nDid you hear that? A 30-percent increase in gasoline costs as a result \nof this legislation. Give me a break.\n  Despite the severe economic damage Lieberman-Warner would impose on \nthe U.S. economy, the policy would do little to address global climate \nchange. EPA's--this is not some conservative group out there--analysis \nindicates the policy will reduce global concentrations of \nCO2 less than 5 percent by 2095.\n  Addressing climate change will require a technology revolution \ncentered on the way we produce and use energy. The theory behind \nLieberman-Warner is that the more painful it is on business, the faster \nCO2 reductions will occur. I believe the solution to this \nproblem lies in our ability to increase access to clean energy. Instead \nof using the power of the Government to increase energy cost, we should \nuse it to decrease barriers to investments and clean energy solutions.\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\n  The United States took a lot of flak from countries for our not \nsigning Kyoto, but I am pleased the Bush administration has been moving \nforward with some new initiatives. And while we didn't sign Kyoto, we \ndo have a base of international activities to build on, and one of them \ncould provide the basis for becoming a multinational effort, giving all \ncountries a vested interest in technology advancement and deployment.\n  The thing we have to remember is that, above all, the developing \nworld desires sustained economic growth. Slowing down economic \ndevelopment to address climate change is not an option they are willing \nto pursue, and we cannot force it upon them. If we are going to be \nsuccessful in addressing the challenge of climate change, we have to \nset a realistic vision for the developing world, using what Richard \nArmitage and Joseph Nye referred to as smart power. When they testified \nbefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on April 24, 2008, they \nargued that the world:\n\n        . . . looks to the U.S. to put forward better ideas rather \n     than just walk away from the table.\n\n  This was the perception after Kyoto, and it could be the perception \nagain today if we do not find a way to engage the developing world.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The United States needs to rediscover how to be a smart \n     power, which matches vision with execution and \n     accountability, and looks broadly at U.S. goals, strategies, \n     and influence in a changing world.\n\n  And they rightly conclude that our:\n\n        . . . challenges can only be addressed with capable and \n     willing allies and partners.\n\n  Without willing partners in China and India, we cannot be successful \nin addressing climate change. Technologies development and promotion \nshould drive our national climate policy. It is the only rational path \nforward. It is the only way to deal with emissions from rapidly \nexpanding coal-based economies such as China and India, that readily \nadmit they have no intention of accepting binding emission targets.\n  The public interest and private sector communities agree that the \ncrucial factor that will determine whether we have an effective climate \npolicy is the extent that policy will encourage the development and \ndeployment of needed technology. Regulation without sufficiently \navailable technology will result in high cost for American consumers \nwhile offering little hope that developing nations will answer the call \nto reduce their emissions.\n  In conclusion, I agree that we need to act quickly to address climate \nchange, but we must be smart about how we proceed. I am hoping after \nthis year's debate, we can come together--come together--on a \nbipartisan basis, to draft a bill that doesn't impose unilateral \nactions that hurt our economy and drive jobs overseas but rather jump-\nstarts technology, engages our international partners through \ncollaborative multinational efforts to develop and deploy the clean \nenergy technologies that everyone recognizes are necessary to solve \nthis global environmental problem.\n  I appreciate the Chair giving me an extra minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4908-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4908-S4910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HIGH COST OF ENERGY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wanted Sara Sanders to come \nover here and be on the floor while I am speaking, because this \nphotograph is of her hometown, Madison, FL, in Madison County, which is \nin north Florida. If you examine this photograph of downtown Madison, \nhere is the old courthouse, and across U.S. 90 is this Shell gasoline \nstation.\n  This photograph is from a couple of days ago, and you can see that \nregular is $4.09.9 a gallon, and premium is $4.33.9 a gallon. This is \ncertainly a record for Florida, and it is especially a record for the \nrural parts of Florida, which Madison County, part of north Florida, is \na part of.\n  Last week, when we were in recess, I did 18 townhall meetings all \nover the State of Florida, and I can tell you our people are hurting. \nThey are hurting because they are having difficulty making financial \nends meet. Our people are hurting and are having difficulty making \ntheir paycheck go far enough. Our people, particularly those who have \nto drive long distances and don't have any alternative of mass transit \nto get to work, are having difficulty being able to afford getting to \nwork. That is symbolized by this photograph of a couple of days ago in \nMadison, FL--$4.10 for a gallon of regular gas.\n  Where is it going to go? Well, I wish to have you look at this \nparticular chart. Now, this indicates to us what has happened to the \nprice of gas over the last 8 years. In January of 2001, the price of \ngas was at $1.47. Seven and one-half years later, the price at the end \nof May was $3.94 a gallon. This is a national average. As that \nphotograph reflected, it has exceeded, even in rural parts of America, \n$4 a gallon.\n  It rocked along here at less than $1.50 for a couple of years. Then, \nin 2003, it jumped above $1.50 and started to gradually climb. Then, in \n2005, it spiked up right after Katrina. As a matter of fact, overnight, \nwhen Katrina hit, it went from about $2.65 to up over $3. It gyrated \nback and forth, exceeding that $3 limit, and look what has happened in \nthe last month or 2 months. It has gone from less than $3 a gallon all \nthe way up to $4 a gallon.\n  There is something that is going on, and people are sick and tired \nbecause they are frustrated they can't afford this. By the way, Florida \nis a microcosm of America. A lot of America has moved to Florida and, \ntherefore, when you look at a representative sampling of this country, \nour State is a microcosm. And having been all over the State for all of \nthese townhall meetings this past week, I can tell you that people's \nfrustrations are turning to anger. They do not know what to do, but \nthey want their Government to act.\n  Now, what do we do? Well, I must say it is very interesting that we \nhear coming from parts of the energy sector the same old story: We have \nto drill more. If you could drill more and you could get it to market \nimmediately, that would certainly bring some relief. But when that is \nsaid, the full story isn't told. Because when the oil companies say \nthey want to drill more, and that supply and demand will take care of \nthe problem, what they fail to say--and they fail purposely to say \nthis--is that there are 33 million acres under lease that are submerged \nlands--33 million acres--of which they haven't drilled. It is there. \nThey have not drilled.\n  Of course, a side issue here is the constant pressure to come in and \ndrill off of our coast, off of the east coast of the United States and \noff of the west coast. But there are 33 million acres under lease, \nsubmerged, that are already available. Plus, there are another 34 \nmillion acres that are either owned or leased on lands that have not \nbeen drilled. Now, you don't hear that, but that is a fact. Of those 33 \nmillion acres that are submerged, and that are under lease and ready to \nbe drilled, or to go through the process of leasing, they ignore the \nfact that we worked out a compromise 2 or 3 years ago where we would \nadd an additional 8.3 million acres of submerged lands in the Gulf of \nMexico that could be leased. We kept that away from the military \ntraining area, which is most of the Gulf of Mexico off of the State of \nFlorida.\n  All that submerged land is there for drilling, but of course we hear \nthe same old refrain from over the years: Well, let's drill. Let's \ndrill our way out of the problem. The fact is that is a red herring to \nget us off of the ultimate solution to this problem. The answer is not \njust drill, the answer is alternative energy sources.\n  Now, let me put it another way. The United States has only 3 percent \nof the world's oil reserves, but the United States consumes 25 percent \nof the world's oil production. If you only have 3 percent of the \nworld's oil reserves but you are consuming every day 25 percent of the \nworld's oil production, doesn't that suggest to you that you can't \ndrill your way out of the problem; that you ought to be looking to \ndifferent solutions?\n  I am going to suggest a few. But first I want to go back in history. \nWhat has happened in America? First, we had a wake-up call. Remember, \nit was back in the early 1970s. The OPEC cartel was formed and they \ndecided to have an oil embargo, and so the price of oil jumped per \nbarrel something like from the $2 or $3 a barrel price to suddenly $10 \nand\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\na little more, and the long gas lines occurred. There was world oil \npanic and we vowed we were going to do something about it. As a matter \nof fact, the President of the United States at the time said, We are \ngoing to make ourselves energy independent.\n  Well, here we are, 3\\1/2\\ decades later, and it is not the United \nStates that is energy independent, it is Brazil that is energy \nindependent. In those early 1970s, after that scare, when we vowed we \nwere going to do something about it, we went back to sleep. Then in the \nlate 1970s, we had another wake-up call. This wake-up call was the \nIranian hostage crisis. Remember how the oil markets got jittery and we \nstarted having the long lines at the gas stations again, and we said, \nWe are going to do something about this energy independence on foreign \noil? Then what happened? We collectively, as a nation, went back to \nsleep.\n  Cheap oil was part of the problem. It seduced us, even though that \ncheap oil was continuing to get a little more expensive. So, then, we \nget up to the end of the decade of the 1980s and Saddam Hussein \nsuddenly moves on Kuwait and takes over another country and their oil \nfields. We had another crisis and oil spikes again. The Nation was in \nan energy crisis. Our foreign oil supplies were being threatened, and \nwe make another vow that we are going to do something about it. And \nwhat happens? We allow ourselves to be lulled by the sweet dulcet tones \nof being reliant on a cheap energy source, even though it was getting \nhigher and higher, and we go back to sleep.\n  Then we turn the century. Suddenly, we have September 11. Then we \nhave Afghanistan. Then we have the Iraq war. All of those oil supplies \nin that region of the world are threatened and, suddenly, everyone is \ngetting jittery. At the same time, China is emerging as an industrial \npower, and so is India. They are demanding more and more of the world's \noil supplies and the supplies are getting tighter and tighter and the \nprice starts going up and up. Still, on the Senate floor with my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from California, as I have assisted her \nfor the last 8 years, each year trying to increase miles per gallon in \nthe fleet average of our automobiles, we are not able to get the votes \nto pass it. We allow ourselves to be lulled and lulled back to sleep.\n  Finally, because of the way this gas price spiked after Katrina to \nover $3, finally we were able to marshal the political will so that we \ncould change the miles per gallon, a modest change, to 35 miles per \ngallon from 25 miles per gallon--although that 25-miles-per-gallon \nstandard set in the 1980s was illusory because light trucks and SUVs \nwere exempt. We were able to get to a new standard to include all and a \nfleet average of 35 miles per gallon--but it would not be fully phased \nin, over the period of the next 12 years, until the date of 2020.\n  Before I offer some additional solutions, why has oil, as measured in \ngas prices, gone, in just a few months, from $3 a gallon to over $4 a \ngallon?\n  Is the President indicating that I do not have any further time, Mr. \nPresident? Is the Presiding Officer indicating I do not have any \nfurther time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. No. The Senator has spoken for 15 \nminutes. I was consulting with the Parliamentarian to see if there were \nlimits. There were none.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That was my understanding. Mr. President, does \nthe Senator from California want to speak?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Through the Chair to the Senator from Florida, I am \nthe first speaker on the global warming bill. Do what you need to do. I \nthank the Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am having a good time doing it, too. I will \nwrap up within the next 5 or so minutes.\n  Why, then, other than what we have already talked about--the \ntightness of the world's oil market--why, in just the last couple of \nmonths, has it spiked from $3 a gallon to over $4 a gallon? Why, in \nMadison, FL, a rural part of Florida, 2 days ago, was regular gas at \n$4.10?\n  Part of that reason, of course, is what we have talked about, the \nworld tightness. Part of it is that the United States relies on oil \nfrom foreign shores for 60 percent of its daily consumption of oil from \nplaces such as the Persian Gulf and Nigeria and Venezuela--the Persian \nGulf, roughly 20 percent of our oil supply; Nigeria, 12 percent of our \ndaily supply; Venezuela, 14 percent of our daily supply. I have just \nmentioned three very unstable parts of the world. That is part of the \nskittishness of this world oil market. But there have to be additional \nreasons.\n  How about the weakness of the dollar? You know what we could do about \nthat? Here is a solution. We could start bringing our budget back into \nbalance instead of going out where spending is here but revenues are \nonly here and the difference each year we have to borrow. Guess whom we \nare borrowing from--China and Japan. They are buying our debt in order \nfor us to meet our expenditures. If we bring that budget back into \nbalance, we can start strengthening our dollar, which will help us in \nthis overall global market of oil since oil is sold in U.S. dollars.\n  But I think the biggest part of this spike is that we have world oil \nmarkets that are buying futures contracts, and the speculators are \nspeculating up the price as they bid up the price, and they are not \nhaving to put down a substantial amount of money. They are only putting \ndown about 6 percent of the total oil contract, so 94 percent they are \nbasically getting on future credit, and that means they can bid up that \nprice.\n  The question is, Are we going to get in and start checking out these \ncommodities exchanges? Are we going to get a Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission that will crack the whip, that will examine this speculation \ndriving up the price?\n  We passed a part 2 weeks ago in the farm bill that is now law that \nwill close that Enron loophole that occurred in the year 2000, that \nexempted Enron and others from oversight in the trading markets for \nenergy. That certainly has allowed that speculation to go on. We got a \nlittle victory there, on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  The bottom line is, if we are going to solve this problem we have to \nhave the political will. This Senator will be speaking about the \nLieberman-Warner bill later on, but there is all kinds of inflammatory \nrhetoric about how this is going to jack up the price of gasoline and \nof oil.\n  But the fundamental problem is we have to have the political will to \nstart going to alternative sources in order to break the stranglehold \nof dependence on oil and particularly foreign oil. That means we are \ngoing to have to go to alternative sources such as biofuels. We are \ngoing to have to pour the money into research and development on \ncellulosic ethanol. Ethanol, of course, we can mix in our existing cars \nwith gasoline, and that yields much less consumption of oil.\n  In the new vehicles, the new cars, you can take 85 percent of ethanol \nand mix it with 15 percent of gasoline. Just think how much less is the \nuse of oil. Or you put all of that mixture--85 ethanol, 15 gasoline--\ninto a hybrid, and what about a plug-in hybrid? Suddenly you have \nexpanded your equivalent miles per gallon of oil consumed to upwards of \nseveral hundreds of miles. We have the technology to do this. The \nquestion is, Do we have the political will? That is what I bring us \nback around to.\n  There is a lot of inflammatory rhetoric about how, if you try this \nnew thing or you try that new thing--don't do it. Go back on the old, \nreliable oil. I have seen frustration grow into anger out there as I \nfaced my constituents and tried to give them hope this past week in \nthose 18 townhall meetings. They need hope. We need to help provide \nthat hope.\n  The next President of the United States needs to help provide that \nhope. I want to be a part of that solution, to provide that hope. This \nSenator is going to continue to speak out against those voices that \nwould say: No, no, just do it the same old way.\n  It is time for change. It is time for bold ideas. It is time for \nresearch and development. It is time to take the competitive genius of \nAmerica, this Yankee ingenuity, our ability to create, our ability in \nour technological prowess--it is time to utilize all of those assets \nand to break through to a new beginning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 7 minutes remaining in\n\n[[Page S4910]]\n\nmorning business. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, it is my understanding there is an \nagreement that I would be the first speaker on global warming. I have \nabout 21 minutes. I could use 7 of them now. If the Senator from \nOklahoma--I see him on the Senate floor--if he would prefer some time \nin morning business, I am prepared to yield to him, and then if I could \nbe recognized as soon as we go to the bill?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think we are working on a unanimous consent request \nright now. Why don't you go ahead and use the remaining time in morning \nbusiness, and then you will be the first speaker to use the remaining \nof that 21 minutes or whatever you want, and that 14 minutes will come \nout of the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am going to yield back the morning \nbusiness time so we can go to the bill and I will be able to speak \nwithout interruption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4910-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order of \nspeakers after morning business, prior to the recess for caucus \nluncheons, be as follows: Senator Feinstein for up to 20 minutes, \nIsakson for up to 15 minutes, Corker for up to 20 minutes, Specter for \nup to 15 minutes; Kerry for up to 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nclimate change legislation sponsored by Senators Joe Lieberman and John \nWarner and the managers' substitute amendment offered by my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Barbara Boxer.\n  I congratulate all three of them. This is not an easy road. I want \nparticularly to thank the chairman of the committee for her work. She \nhas been open, she has been consultative, she has asked to meet with \nMembers, she has asked for Members' participation in the work. She has \nbeen both strong and solid in her leadership.\n  After years of debating about the science underlying the warming of \nour planet, today marks a momentous step because for the first time we \nare considering comprehensive legislation to address global warming in \na comprehensive manner. I believe the time has come for the Senate to \npass legislation to tackle this problem.\n  The bill represents the most comprehensive opportunity we have in \nthis Congress to help curb our carbon footprint and take meaningful \naction to prevent catastrophic climate change--and nobody should \ndisbelieve that is coming. The fact is this: Global warming is \nhappening. It has already begun to inflict changes on the world as we \nknow it. If you read the newspapers, if you watch television, or if you \nsimply take a look around, it is undeniable. Just look at weather \npatterns. More destructive and deadly storms, such as the cyclone that \nhit Burma and the tornadoes that have devastated parts of the Midwest, \nare happening. Species are beginning to disappear. The Fish and \nWildlife Service has just announced that the polar bear has been placed \non the endangered species list because of global warming.\n  Its habitat is literally melting away. Polar icecaps are melting. The \nNorthwest Passage was navigable for the first time last summer. The \nArctic Circle could be ice free by 2030. The West is running out of \nwater. Scientists at UC San Diego believe there is a 50-50 chance that \nLake Mead, a key source of water for 8 million people in the \nSouthwestern United States, will be dry by 2021, if the climate \nchanges, as expected, and its use is not curtailed. Projections suggest \nthat both Antarctica and Greenland could melt at the same time. If that \nwere to happen, the seas would rise by 20 feet. So we are feeling the \neffects of warmer weather. Five out of the past 5 years and 19 out of \nthe last 20 have been the warmest on record.\n  The Western United States is receiving the brunt of warming. This is \nbecause the West's average temperature is 70 percent greater than the \nplanet as a whole. So the Earth's temperature has warmed 1 degree over \nthe past century, but it has warmed 1.7 degrees in the 11-State Western \nregion, and it is only getting warmer. Take a look at this map.\n  Here is why. Carbon dioxide doesn't dissipate in the atmosphere. It \nremains for 30, 40, 50, 100 years. The atmosphere is a shell around the \nEarth, and carbon dioxide has been growing since the Industrial \nRevolution in this atmosphere. So the question becomes, how much will \nthe Earth warm? This very question is at the heart of why we need \nclimate change legislation, because scientists tell us we can make a \ndifference to impact how much the Earth will warm. We can't stop \nwarming, but we can slow it down. But if we are to do even that, we \nhave to act soon and decisively. I truly don't believe there is a \nminute to waste.\n  To stabilize the climate and to prevent catastrophic warming, \nscientists say we need to begin by reducing emissions by 65 to 80 \npercent below 1990 levels--that is 65 to 80 percent below what we have \nput into the atmosphere in 1990--and do all this by the middle of the \ncentury. That translates into a goal of 1,450 parts per million of \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Vice President Al Gore told me \nrecently there is some new science out that we actually may need to \nlimit carbon emissions to 350 parts per million, which is even \nstronger. There is new science out that shows the Earth is warming even \nfaster than was originally predicted. We need to contain the warming to \n1 to 2 degrees. We will still experience significant but manageable \nchanges, but if we fail to act, the Earth's temperature could rise 5 to \n9 degrees or more. Those results are catastrophic and irreversible.\n  I tell constituent breakfasts about the Earth. Most people believe \nthe Earth can't change. But, in fact, planets do change. Look at Mars, \nlook at the Earth 250 million years ago, when there was one mass on \nEarth only. The Earth is subject to change. That change can be \ndramatic, and warming affects that change. This is a gamble we cannot \nafford to take. The truth is, though, there is no silver bullet. There \nis no one thing that will turn the tide. We need to go clean and green \nin driving, in heating, in cooling, in building, and fueling. We need \nto move away from fossil fuels. We need the Lieberman-Warner \nlegislation.\n  By 2050, this bill would reduce emissions by 63 percent below 2005 \nlevels or 57 percent below 1990 levels. So the legislation sets us on \nthe path toward meaningful greenhouse gas reductions. It does so in a \nway that encourages innovation and makes the investment in cleaner \nenergy and green practices across the entire economy. Importantly, it \nalso includes important provisions to keep our economy strong. The \nbottom line: This legislation is a major step in the right direction. \nIt is the most significant thing we can do right now to help prevent \ncatastrophic climate change.\n  Let me take a few moments to talk about what the bill does. There are \ntwo ways to deal with this. One is a carbon tax. Most scientists want \nthe carbon tax, but most people believe a new tax is not going to \nhappen. The other alternative is a cap-and-trade system, much as Europe \nhas been doing and much as the Northeastern States have been doing to \ndeal with acid rain. They have reversed acid rain by 45 percent through \ntheir cap-and-trade system. This legislation establishes a cap-and-\ntrade system for roughly 86 percent of the economy. It includes the \nelectricity sector, manufacturing, transportation, and natural gas. It \nwould be\n\n[[Page S4911]]\n\nthe world's most comprehensive effort to address global warming to \ndate. It controls emissions in more sectors of our economy than \nEurope's carbon control program. It would restore American leadership \nin the fight to protect our planet.\n  Here is how it works. In 2012, emissions are capped at 2005 levels. \nThey begin to ratchet down 2 percent per year. By 2020, emissions would \nbe 19 percent below current levels. By 2050, emissions would be cut to \napproximately 63 percent below 2005 levels by 2050, or 57 percent below \n1990 levels. That is the cap part. The trade part of the bill allows \nfor the trading of allowances, which are permits to release 1 metric \nton of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. It is a proven system. It is \nworking well right now in the United States to control acid rain and \nsmog pollution. It has given companies flexibility to innovate and \nembrace new technologies.\n  Under the bill, the pollution permits are allocated in a way that \ntransitions our economy toward a low-carbon future. In the early years, \none-third of the allowances will be allocated to polluting industries \ncovered by the bill to assist with their transition to less carbon-\nintensive technologies. So one-third goes to those who pollute to help \nthem convert. Revenue produced by selling allowances at auction will be \nused to invest in low-carbon technology development and deployment.\n  The bill funds carbon capture and sequestration, renewable energy, \nand other low-carbon technologies for producing electricity. That is a \ngood thing. It funds efforts to retool car factories, to produce more \nefficient vehicles and ventures to develop cellulosic biofuels, two \nsteps essential to reducing vehicle emissions. It funds efforts to \nincrease the efficiency of buildings, homes, appliances, and it rewards \nStates that produce significant emission reductions.\n  In later years, this bill refocuses its assistance toward worker \ntraining and financial relief for consumers. It is a good bill. It \nassists those in coastal and arid States who will have to adapt to sea \nlevel rise and rainfall loss. So it makes our world better off, but it \nalso helps those who may have to shoulder an undue burden.\n  Here is the bottom line: This cap-and-trade bill significantly \nreduces emissions. It funds new technologies. It deploys existing low-\ncost options. It contains costs. It mitigates negative impacts. It \neffectively combats climate change, while protecting our quality of \nlife.\n  I wish to take a few moments to talk in detail about some of the key \nprovisions of the bill that are of particular note. First, the \nlegislation includes language to establish Federal oversight for the \nnew carbon market. This is something I learned, as a Californian in the \nWestern energy crisis, that we need to do. A $100 billion market for \nthe trading of carbon emissions is going to spring up as this cap-and-\ntrade system is established. We need to be prepared. Just as there are \nthose who manipulate the price of oil and the price of gas--and we in \nCalifornia found that out to the tune of $40 billion--this new market \ncould attract Enron-like manipulation, fraud or excessive speculation, \nunless we take preventive action. This month Congress finally passed \nlegislation in the farm bill to close the Enron loophole to protect \nelectronic energy markets. It took us 6 years after the Western energy \ncrisis to achieve that. It is time to learn from these mistakes. We \nneed to take steps now to ensure that the market functions with \ntransparency, as well as antifraud and antimanipulation provisions from \nthe get-go.\n  Specifically, this legislation requires the President to establish an \ninteragency working group, the carbon market working group. It is made \nup of the heads of the following agencies: the EPA, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and the Treasury Department. Within \n270 days of enactment of the bill, the working group would establish \nthe regulatory framework for the market and recommend necessary \nregulations that ensure enforcement of core market oversight \nprinciples. These principles would include ensuring market transparency \nin price, volume, and other trading data--all of it made available to \nthe public--requirements for recordkeeping, an audit trail which, up to \nthis point, doesn't exist on the electronic marketplace--but thanks to \nthe Enron loophole closure bill, it will exist--and finally, preventing \nfraud, manipulation, and excessive speculation.\n  I was pleased to hear the Commodities Futures Trading Commission is \nnow taking a look at excessive speculation in the oil market as a \nreason for the drive up of prices of gasoline. I will bet anything \nthere is excessive speculation in that market today. These regulations \nwould be fully enforceable by existing market oversight agencies, and \nviolators would be subject to significant penalties. So it is critical \nwe protect these markets from the outset. We cannot afford to delay.\n  Secondly, the bill promotes green practices for farmers and \nforesters. This is something I am very interested in. California is the \nlargest ag State. The legislation includes language I authored to fund \nresearch on innovative and cost-effective methods for farmers and \nforesters to store carbon in the soil.\n  It is believed that farming and forestry practices to sequester \ncarbon in the soil hold great potential to reduce our carbon footprint, \nand this is particularly true in my State. But the fact is, we do not \nyet know enough about the best ways to carry out carbon sequestration.\n  So this legislation would help shed light on a number of practices \nfarmers and foresters can take to sequester carbon. The research would \nbe funded through allowances for agriculture in the cap-and-trade \nsystem established by the Lieberman-Warner legislation. Some of these \npractices could include several methods popular in my State, including \nrow crop practices such as conservation tillage--this is a picture of \nit--permanent crop practices, including planting cover crops during the \nwinter season, and using prunings for bioenergy production rather than \nchipping, mulching, or burning the material, and practices to reduce \nthe digestion-related emissions of methane gas from cattle and \nlivestock. Once we understand which of these innovative methods is the \nmost cost effective, farmers could then sell low-cost offset credits to \ncompanies that need to reduce their emissions. So this is a win-win.\n  Third, this bill promotes low-carbon fuels through a low-carbon fuels \nstandard. Similar to the Clean Fuels and Vehicles Act, which Senator \nSnowe and I introduced last year, this would require each major oil \ncompany selling gasoline in the United States to reduce the average \nlife-cycle greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy in their \ngasoline. The provision ensures that the car and truck emissions go \ndown as we increase the use of low-carbon renewable fuel, such as \ncellulosic ethanol. By improving the renewable fuel standard, which \nrequires the use of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2020, it \nassures that the climate benefits of this provision are realized.\n  My conclusion and my bottom line: Confronting global warming will \nrequire action on a broad scale. To those in this body who are \ndissenters, I say this: If we do not do it, when the science has \ncoalesced, when the science tells us the time is limited, when the \nscience tells us we cannot stop it because it does not dissipate--we \nmust move away from carbon, and we must move to other kinds of fuels, \nand do so quickly, and we must take these steps to aid the conversion \nof American industry. Also, most important, this bill will signal that \nthe United States, after a long period of doing nothing, is prepared to \nstand up tall and to lead.\n  I thank Senator Warner and Senator Lieberman for this legislation. I \nknow the senior Senator from Virginia is on the floor. I know he is \ngoing to retire at the end of the year. I want him to know very \npersonally from me how much I respect him.\n  I respect your leadership on this issue, Senator Warner. I think it \nleaves you a great legacy. I only hope we will do justice to you by \npassing this legislation here today. So thank you so much for your \nleadership.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might just speak for 2 minutes.\n  I thank my colleague from California. I say to her, it has been a \npleasure to work with you and to continue\n\n[[Page S4912]]\n\nto work with you in the Senate. Our primary responsibilities are on the \nIntelligence Committee, but you are a very diversified Senator and can \nseize many subjects and provide your expertise for the benefit of this \nChamber. I thank you for your thoughtful, personal remarks and your \nvery informative speech given this morning.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nspeak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That order has already been \nentered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to commend the Senate for \nassessing what is the most important issue confronting the United \nStates of America today; that is, energy, its contribution to the \nenvironment, its costs, its availability, its future, and its impact on \nthe economy.\n  I rise today to thank a number of people who have contributed to the \nbody of knowledge I want to try to recite as best I can today: Michael \nQuiello, Caroline McLean, and Duncan Hill of my staff; Annie Caputo of \nthe staff of the EPW; and three individuals back in Georgia, two alive \ntoday, one, unfortunately, who is deceased: Carl Knobloch, a \ndistinguished man in our State of Georgia, who is probably the most \nardent advocate for open and green space and the preservation of our \nenvironment of any one I know; Mr. Chris Sawyer, who is a distinguished \nlawyer, who represents many national organizations and many \nconservation organizations; and Mr. Bob Shearer. Bob passed away last \nyear, but in the 1970s he had led the Georgia Power Company during the \ntime it built the Plant Vogtle, a nuclear energy plant in Georgia that \ntoday provides affordable, reasonable, reliable, and inexpensive energy \nwithout emitting any carbon into the atmosphere.\n  Mr. President, I could not agree more with Senator Feinstein's remark \nthat it is time for us to put all of the issues and all of the \nsolutions on the table. It is time for us to talk about everything we \nneed to do to improve our environment, make energy more affordable, and \nprotect our economy.\n  I think it is ironic that the legislation that will be before us is a \npiece of legislation that leaves out two subjects that are critical to \nbeing accomplished in what the bill portends. First, it basically \nleaves out any provisions for nuclear energy or the expansion of \nelectricity through nuclear power. Second, it gives no attention to the \nsingle way we know to sequester carbon today. It talks about carbon \nsequestration in a prospective way but does not talk about the single \nway we sequester carbon today, which happens to be through Mother \nNature.\n\n  So for just a second I wish to talk about nuclear power, and I wish \nto talk about conservation and open and green space. Both are included \nin two amendments that at some point in time in the debate I hope to be \nable to offer.\n  First nuclear--and Senator Warner was kind enough to share with me an \namendment he plans to offer on nuclear, which is a recitation of a \nnumber of facts that ironically I am going to recite in my remarks--and \nI commend him for doing that--the most important of which is that today \nin America, 73 percent of the noncarbon-emitting energy generated in \nthis country is generated by nuclear. That 73 percent saves 700 million \nmetric tons of carbon from going into the atmosphere.\n  You would think if you already know you are saving 700 million metric \ntons of carbon from going into the atmosphere and you know that 73 \npercent of your noncarbon-emitting energy is coming from nuclear, it \nwould seem that if you want to reduce carbon emissions and carbon in \nthe atmosphere, you would empower nuclear energy.\n  I think we should do that because regardless of your philosophy on \nglobal warming and climate change, carbon is making a difference, and \nit is in our geopolitical interest and it is in our environment's \ninterest to reduce carbon--geopolitically because we buy less from \nChavez, Ahmadinejad, and Putin, where we get a majority of our oil \ntoday. That is the geopolitical issue, and that is good for us to do. \nEnvironmentally, they are not exactly sure at Greenland what all is \nhappening, but they are sure the carbon isotopes and the ice borings \nare much higher today than they were 30 years ago, and that is the one \nchange.\n  So it is important to reduce carbon. But to leave out the single way \nwe know to do it best, to leave out the empowerment of nuclear energy, \nto talk about it only in terms of reference and not in terms of action \nis, to me, disappointing.\n  The amendment I will offer--which I offered in committee--does a \nnumber of things.\n  First of all, it provides incentives for nuclear energy in terms of a \n10-percent investment tax credit for the production of a new nuclear \npowerplant. By the way, solar tax credits today are 30 percent. This is \none-third of the tax credit for solar. But 10 percent is a good \nincentive, and these plants are huge investments. That is No. 1.\n  Second is accelerated depreciation or recovery of investment over 5 \nyears. That is appropriate.\n  Third, loan guarantees--loan guarantees and standby help--for an \nindustry that in the 1970s, when Government stalled it and investment \ndollars went away, absolutely almost went bankrupt trying to continue \nto build the plants that today emit carbon-free energy in the United \nStates of America.\n  Those three provisions--the standby loan guarantee, the investment \ntax credit of 10 percent, and the 30 percent in terms of depreciation \nand the 5-year depreciation recovery--make perfectly good sense, \nincentivize nuclear, and reduce the emission of carbon into the \natmosphere.\n  I have a chart I will put up. It is very interesting on these \nsubsidies, by the way. There are a lot of antinuclear people who talk \nabout how the Government should not subsidize nuclear. Well, we \nsubsidize almost every form of energy. Today in America, $24.34 of \nevery megawatt hour produced by solar is a tax incentive, a Federal \nsubsidy. On wind, $23.37 is a Federal subsidy on every megawatt hour. \nFor nuclear, it is $1.59. That is the level of subsidy. Ten times or \nreally twelve times the nuclear subsidy is what you pay for solar and \nwind, which give you 27 percent of your carbon-free electric energy, \nwhile nuclear gives you 73 percent.\n  The bill also deals with empowering the workforce. When we evacuated \nnuclear energy generation in the 1970s, something else evacuated in \nAmerica, and that was the construction of nuclear equipment, and that \nincludes all the employees the industry would need in a revitalized \nindustry. So we focus on that and talk about trying to bring that back \nto the United States of America and to empower our workforce so we can \nbuild safe, reliable nuclear energy plants in the 21st century.\n  I have a number of quotes from the following members, in public \ndebate, when we debated this nuclear amendment in the EPW Committee. \nSenator Lautenberg, Senator Baucus, Senator Cardin, Senator Carper, \nSenator Warner, and Senator Lieberman all made comments endorsing and \nembracing the fact that nuclear is a part of the solution. I would ask \ntoday, if it is a part of the solution, why is it not a part of the \nLieberman-Warner climate change bill?\n  On conservation, for just a second. Carbon sequestration is something \nwe need to perfect, and we do not know how to do it yet. We think we \ncan find some caverns in the earth and we can sequester it there, but \nwe are not quite sure. The technology is not there yet, nor is the \ncost, but we hope we can do it. But Mother Nature has been sequestering \ncarbon for all time because that is the way the balance in our \nenvironment works. That is one of the issues.\n  So I have an amendment to propose which is a conservation easement \ntax credit amendment to incentivize the United States of America over \nthe next 5 years through $25 billion in refundable tax credits to \ngenerate a fund to buy conservation easements in open and green space \nthroughout the United States of America.\n  Since the founding of our country, 15 percent of our forest and open \nspace and green space is gone forever to an impervious surface known as \nurban development. If that continues, then our own natural carbon \nsequestration system will be broken. So it is important, while we still \nhave the open and green space, while we know where our wetlands are, \nwhere our rivers and waterways are, where our important ecosystem lands \nare, that we create a\n\n[[Page S4913]]\n\nmechanism for those lands to be protected, but not one where the \nGovernment goes and buys it--it costs you a lot of money to buy all \nthis land--instead, to have a program where you create refundable tax \ncredits, very much like the low- and moderate-income housing tax \ncredits, $5 billion a year for 5 years, to be sold in the market, to \nraise the money for which you, in turn, allow 501(c)-qualified \norganizations, like the Trust for Public Land, the Conservancy, et \ncetera, the capital to go to out and, according to a statewide plan, \nbuy conservation easements to protect in perpetuity those areas \ncritical to our ecosystem and our country and, in fact, our \nenvironment.\n  It would seem to me that when you debate the most topical issue of \nthe day, the most controversial issue of the day--the thing everybody \nwants to talk about--if you know there is only one way to sequester \ncarbon, and that is through the natural process of nature--and \nprotecting open and green space does that--and you know the only major \nsupplier of carbon-free energy is nuclear, that you would make an \ninvestment in this act by seeing to it that you empower the future of \nthe country to focus on conservation and nuclear and all the other \nsources available.\n  I am a Republican. I am not one who likes to throw partisanship out \nin any debate. I think you ought to win something on merit. But I think \nwe and our party and the Democrats and their party need to look at this \nissue in a different perspective. A lot of us have our biases. It is \ntime to put our biases aside. If there is a known solution out there \nwhere we can reduce carbon, expand our energy availability, and reduce \ncosts, we ought to embrace it. Nothing should be off the table. Solar \nshouldn't, wind shouldn't, nuclear shouldn't, renewable shouldn't, \nbiodiesel shouldn't; whatever it is, synthetic fuels, we should act \nnow, and we should act boldly to see to it that while we work for the \nbest interests of our environment, we work for the best interests of \nour citizens.\n\n  Our citizens today are paying more for gas and energy than they have \never paid before, and there is no end in sight. We have a debate today \nthat if this bill passed in its form, it would raise that cost even \nmore; by some estimates, $1.50 a gallon more. We are talking about \nserious business here. We need to be serious as Members of the Senate, \nas Members of the most deliberative body in the world, and make sure \nevery option is on the table. For this Senator, that means expanding \nconservation easements for better sequestration of carbon naturally, \nand it means by reempowering the nuclear energy business to see to it \nthat the one source of reliable, safe, carbonless energy that we know \ntoday in the United States is empowered for the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to commend our distinguished \ncolleague from Georgia. I listened very carefully, and I appreciate his \nreference to the fact that I will be offering at the earliest possible \ntime an amendment to lay some foundation in this proposed legislation \naddressing nuclear power.\n  As I listened to what the Senator from Georgia said, I basically \nagree. But as the Senator well knows, if we were to have included these \nprovisions, either during the course of the committee markup or indeed \nnow in the amendment process, we would get blue-slipped. This type of \nlegislation, which I support, I say to the Senator, must originate--as \nhe well knows having served--in the House of Representatives and then \ncome to the Senate.\n  So as colleagues follow this and say to themselves: This Senator \nbrings forth very constructive proposals, why didn't the managers put \nthat in the bill, I think you would have to agree with me we would be \nfaced with a blue-slip problem and our bill would come to a dead halt.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished \nSenator's--may I address the distinguished Senator through the Chair?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I appreciate the generous comments of the \nSenator from Virginia and the work he has put into this, and I would \npublicly acknowledge that in the committee and privately. The Senator \nhas stated eloquently to me his support for the concept of expanding \nand empowering nuclear energy.\n  I also understand what our block is: the blue slip. I referred in my \nclosing remarks: We have to start putting our biases aside to allow the \nfull debate to take place on what we are going to do to lower energy \ncosts and reduce carbon. If we talk about nuclear being good but aren't \nwilling to address it and somebody is going to blue-slip or put a hold \nor kill a bill simply because it has nuclear in it, then we are not \nserious, in my judgment, about reducing the cost of energy, reducing \nthe amount of carbon or dealing with the problem ahead. I am not \nspeaking to the distinguished Senator from Virginia because I know \nwhere his head and his heart are, and Senator Lieberman has expressed \nthe same thing. But there are others--there are biases on both sides. \nWe need to put our biases away and allow every viable alternative to be \ndebated on the floor of the Senate and voted on. Up until the time we \ndo that, we are wasting our time and, unfortunately, we are wasting a \nlot of our taxpayers' money who are paying exorbitant prices for the \nproblem today.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator knows that Exelon \nhas given its support to this bill and also NRG and they are coal and \nnuclear and Exelon is nuclear. So I wonder if my friend understands \nthat Senator Warner is going to do an amendment, as he has said from \nday one, and I am sure you will help him with that amendment. The \namendment probably has a very excellent chance of passing.\n  I wish to make sure my friend knows companies that build nuclear \npowerplants endorse this bill without any changes, although there are \ngoing to be more changes. Under some of the modeling, I wonder if my \nfriend has looked at what the projections are for building nuclear \npowerplants without one amendment on this bill. Does my friend know the \nanswer to my question? Has he looked at some of the modeling that we \nhave gotten from this administration on this point?\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I am \naware some of the companies that are in the nuclear business have \nendorsed this, and let me say this--and if I stand to be corrected, I \nwould appreciate the Senator correcting me. But those who are heavily \ninvested in nuclear that are operating today are in support of this \nbecause they are going to sell their carbon credits to those who are \nnot heavily invested in nuclear and are generating coal. That \nmotivation is a motivation that is economic as much as anything else.\n  What I would like to see is for us to get everybody on a level \nplaying field, where we have more nuclear and we have less coal and we \nhave less gas and we have less oil-generating electricity. Then we will \nbe better off. So this is a winners and losers game in terms of the \ncarbon tax or the carbon credits. Those who have a low-carbon footprint \nare going to have credits to sell and those who have a high-carbon \nfootprint who use coal or oil are going to have to pay a lot of money \nto buy it. That is why there are some biases in these industries that \nare for and against.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I might ask unanimous consent for 5 \nminutes so the three of us can engage because I think this is a very \nimportant point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First of all, I think for my friend to say these two \ncompanies have no future plans to build powerplants or expand the \nplants, that makes no sense. I haven't read their annual report, but \nfor him to say the only reason is because they are going to make some \nmoney off the allowances--I don't think he is looking at the plans for \nthese companies, No. 1, but they can speak for themselves.\n\n[[Page S4914]]\n\n  The second part, which my friend didn't answer, is that in the \nmodeling we have seen, without one amendment, it looks as if there will \nbe built, over the period of the lifetime of this bill, 150 nuclear \nplants. So without one amendment--and there are going to be \namendments--and I have never been a great fan of nuclear energy. For \none reason, I worry about the waste. I worry about the waste. I worry \nabout having all this waste. So that is my issue. I have said many \ntimes there are a few of us who care about that, and there are others \nwho seem to feel comfortable it is totally safe. We will have that \ndebate.\n  But the fact is, when you pass legislation such as this, there is a \nwinner. The winner goes to those energy sources that don't produce \ncarbon just on its face. That is why we give so much for clean coal, \nbecause we are trying to make sure we keep going with coal and that it \nis clean coal.\n  So I would say to my friend, and then I will yield my time to Senator \nWarner to go back and forth--I am pleased he came over here. I love \nworking with Senator Isakson. He is a friend. He is a pal. We don't see \neye to eye on this particular issue because I believe that to have \npeople who are nuclear powerplant proponents say this bill doesn't do \nenough, means they haven't looked at what the projections are ipso \nfacto because it is a clean energy source, in terms of carbon. I wished \nto make that point. But I wish to thank my friend for the tenor and \ntone of his remarks.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I would say to my \ngood friend from Georgia, I have talked extensively with a wide range--\nas you have--of the industrial individuals who represent nuclear plants \ntoday and are forthcoming. The chairman is quite correct. A number of \nthese companies are planning to go ahead boldly and courageously and \nbuild new plants. Given the uncertainties of where they are going to \nget the parts, can they be manufactured in the United States; given the \nuncertainties as to whether there are enough trained people to operate \nthese plants, they are going ahead. So I don't believe it is just a \nprofit motive.\n  But as I talk to these individuals, it is clear to me they are \nwatching the jurisdiction of the Energy Committee as having a great \nproportion of the nuclear responsibility; the Tax Committee, and they \ncautioned against trying to do too much in this bill for fear of \ninterrupting a process that is in place with the Energy Committee, the \nTax Committee, and such other committees as deal with nuclear power \nbecause that responsibility does spread over quite a number of \ncommittees within the Senate. So we could not simply put into our bill, \nrecommended by way of amendment at this time, such a comprehensive \namendment because we know it is disruptive to the work that apparently \nis going on in other committees as it relates to nuclear power.\n  But perhaps I will reflect on this as to whether I could add in my \namendment, or the Senator from Georgia might wish to modify my \namendment and take those portions of his which do not impact blue \nslip--I think that is something we don't want to get tangled up with--\nand doesn't infringe on the jurisdictions of the other committees and \nsee if we can make it work.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner. To Chairman \nBoxer, first of all, if I said--I very well could have--if I said I \nknew they weren't going to build more powerplants in the future, I \ndidn't mean to say that. What I meant to say was those nuclear \ncompanies that were the most supportive were the ones that were way \nahead in the building of nuclear plants already generated far more \ncarbonless energy because of that and were going to sell their \ncredits--and I am a business guy; I think making money is a great \ndeal--are going to sell their credits to those companies that are more \ncoal- and carbon-producing friendly.\n  You are right, I didn't talk about the modeling. The modeling does \nproject more plants in the first 42, 43 years of the life of the bill \nto 2050. However, I would submit to you, a modernized nuclear title \nwould allow those plants to come on safely, more quickly, and could \nmore quickly address the carbon issue than the way we are currently \ncaught in this conundrum of the antinuclear versus the pronuclear, so \nwe do nothing to empower an industry that we know generates 73 percent \nof our carbonless energy today.\n  But I thank the distinguished chairman for her patience, the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia for his contribution. I look \nforward to working with you in any way I can to hopefully move us \nforward.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again, I commend our colleague for a very \nconstructive contribution to the dialogue on this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Lieberman-Warner \nClimate Act. I understand I have 20 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. CORKER. I ask that the Chair notify me when I have 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  I wish to say I am very excited to be on the floor today. I have \ntremendous respect for the sponsors of this bill and all those who have \nbeen involved for some time. I think everybody knows by this point that \nwhile there are a number of arguments regarding the bill that is on the \nfloor, I choose not to debate the science. I accept the fact that we as \na country and we as a world need to address this issue.\n  I came to the Senate to focus on the big issues our country has to \ndeal with. I saw this as one of those issues. For that reason, a year \nago, I accompanied Senator Bingaman to Brussels, to Paris, and to \nLondon, where I sat down with carbon traders and with European \nCommission members. I met with cement manufacturers, utility providers, \nand all those involved, if you will, in this debate in Europe.\n  I also was fortunate enough to accompany the chairman, Senator Boxer, \nto Greenland to see the poster child, if you will, of what this debate \nin some ways is about. Ever since that time, I have been fixated, if \nyou will, on the goal of figuring out a way that we as a country can \nput in place policies that allow our GDP growth, we can continue to \nensure a better standard of living for those coming after us, having \nenergy security as a country, and making sure we have climate security \nall at the same time. That has been my goal. I have seen, actually, \nthis debate that is taking place this summer right now as a tremendous \nopportunity for us to come together as a country and to focus on those \nthings.\n  Some of what I saw in Europe were unintended consequences, things \nsuch as fuel-switching that took place, when people move from coal to \nnatural gas and all of a sudden found themselves very dependent on an \nunfriendly government--Russia--to supply natural gas and using that \npolitical clout, if you will, over some of those countries that were \ndependent. So I have worked with Senator Warner and with others to try \nto craft legislation that I think works for our country.\n  I see this as a tremendous opportunity; I do. A lot of people think \nthis is not a good time to be talking about climate change legislation. \nThey say that because we have $4 gasoline at the pumps, this is a \nterrible time to be talking about legislation of this nature. I \nactually think this is a perfect time to be talking about it. I think \nthere is a passion in our country, exhibited by the chairman, to \naddress the issue of climate change. I think there are many people in \nour country who feel that same way. I think Americans throughout our \ncountry, seeing the prices at the pump, are feeling very vulnerable as \nit relates to their own energy security and realize that we as a \ncountry need to have a comprehensive energy policy that we do not have \ntoday. So I see this tremendous opportunity for these two groups who \nhave been at odds for so many years--actually generations--to actually \ncome together and to do something that is good for our country, both \nfrom the standpoint of the environment but also making sure our country \nis energy secure.\n  Now, I am going to say something I know that may not be that well \nreceived, but I think this bill, unfortunately--and with all the \nrespect that I have for the sponsors--I think this bill unfortunately \nsquanders that opportunity.\n\n[[Page S4915]]\n\n  The reason I say this bill squanders that opportunity, instead of \naddressing those two things I mentioned in a pure fashion, we have \nresorted to the old-time politics of making sure we support various \ninterest groups around our country and spread trillions of dollars \naround the country to try to win support for this bill. I think that is \na shame.\n  I plan to offer some amendments I will discuss at the right time. Let \nme make sure the American people understand what happens with cap-and-\ntrade legislation. Most Senators do. What this bill contemplates is \ncapping the amount of carbon emissions our country emits, and then \nreducing that cap over time, from the year 2012 to the year 2050, and \nestablishing a price for that carbon by creating an auction. It would \nbe much like if Senator Domenici and I and Senator Warner decided we \nwere going to create a company, and what we did was allocated ourselves \nshares of that company, and in order to make the company grow, we sold \npublic shares in the marketplace. Those shares would generate income \ninto our company and allow us to grow, if that is what we wanted to do. \nBut the day we went public, it would enrich us. Those allocations of \nshares we allocated to ourselves would enrich us immediately because \nthey become marketable securities.\n  Obviously, what this bill does is, No. 1, takes trillions of dollars \ninto the Treasury beginning in 2012 through an auction process; in \nother words, we sell carbon allowances on the public market. On the \nvery day that occurs, the allowances that are talked about as if they \nmean nothing become marketable securities, and they enrich all of those \nentities that receive those allocations. That is where I think this \nbill misses the mark.\n  The auction proceeds that come in with this bill--let's be fair and I \nwill not use words that are demagogic--when we pass cap-and-trade \nlegislation, we all understand it increases the cost of energy that is \ngenerated through fossil fuel. That is a fact. That is petroleum, \ndiesel, coal, ethanol, all of those things that, when they are \nconsumed, emit carbon and will cost more on day one. So the American \npublic is going to be paying for that.\n  Everything Americans buy--if this bill passes--that has something to \ndo with energy will increase. When they go to the gas pump, it will \ncost more. When they pay their utility bills at the end of the month, \nit will cost more. When they buy food and clothing, it will cost more.\n  What this bill, unfortunately, does is takes in trillions of \ndollars--by the way, the EPA has modeled this based on a price of $22 \nper ton for carbon in the beginning. I want people to understand that \ntoday, in essence, in London carbon is selling for $41 a ton. Based on \nthe modeling, this bill, over its life, transfers wealth of $6.7 \ntrillion. But if it were, say, based on the prices of carbon today in \nLondon, it might be as much as $13 trillion.\n  We all know if this bill passes, every American will pay more for \nenergy, and I understand that. By the way, I want everybody in this \nbody to know I am open to discussing cap-and-trade legislation that \ntakes our country in the right direction. What I am so opposed to--and \nI am so saddened by the fact that this bill does this--is this bill \ntakes trillions into our Treasury and then, in a prescribed way, much \nof it in nondiscretionary spending, spends that money from the year \n2012 through the year 2050. We have talked a lot about earmarks in this \nbody. This is, in fact, the mother of all earmarks--to make sure I am \nneutral, it is the mother and father of all earmarks. This, in essence, \ncreates an entitlement program from 2012 through 2050. I don't \nunderstand, if proponents want to affect our climate, why they don't \ntake those trillions in and then immediately redistribute all of those \ndollars back to the American citizens. The reason is--and I am sad to \nsay this--this bill attempts to win support of the American people and \ninterest groups throughout our country by the same old thing that has \ngotten our country in trouble today, and that is spreading this money \naround to the various interest groups throughout the country and \nprescribing the spending in a way that I don't know of any bill since \nMedicare or Social Security. I don't know of a bill that has done this \nto this extent in modern times.\n  Another piece that goes unnoticed is the allocation process. This \nbill allocates out to entities all across this country carbon \nallowances. Those are marketable securities. It is the same as owning a \nshare in IBM. It is a tremendous transference of wealth. Twenty-seven \npercent of the allocation in this bill goes to entities that have \nnothing to do with emitting carbon. I have no idea why we would do that \nin legislation of this nature. I think it is reprehensible. One of the \nreasons we see so many people walking the halls of our Senate offices \nin tailored suits, carrying nice briefcases, is that people who are in \nthe know--I know the Senator mentioned some of these companies--realize \nthis is a tremendous transference of wealth. If they sit at the table \nand they have something to do with how these allowances are allocated, \nthat might be better for them even in operating their companies, as \nwell, because we are creating a situation that transfers trillions of \ndollars of wealth.\n  I am going to be offering some amendments, and I am disturbed that \nsome of the sponsors have indicated these are poison pill amendments. I \nhave focused solely on the policies of this bill. I have never used \ndemagogic language to describe this bill--never. I have never tried to \ndebate the science. I am trying to focus on the policies of the \nlegislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORKER. I will yield when I finish. I know the Senator has spent \na tremendous amount of time on this, and I respect that.\n  The reason we have cap-and-trade legislation being discussed is the \nfact that we want to limit the amount of carbon emissions that come out \nof our country. So one of the other pieces of the bill that, to me, is \ntruly offensive is that this bill allows for something called \ninternational offsets, which is nothing more--again, I will go into \nthis in detail when I offer an amendment--this is something that \nencourages companies in our country to go through a loophole so they \ndon't have to pay the full price of carbon, and actually spend billions \nof dollars in countries such as China, where we already have tremendous \ntrade deficits.\n  I absolutely have no understanding of why we would permit that in a \nbill such as this, which is being designed to limit carbon emissions in \nour country. These international offsets have been documented to be \nfraudulent. We have had tremendous problems in working through the \nUnited Nations to administer these programs. I have no idea why \ninternational offsets, which have been so fraudulent and have nothing \nwhatsoever to do with lowering emissions in our country, would be part \nof this bill.\n  Let me say, in general, I realize we are not going to pass a bill \nthis year, in all likelihood. I think that, in many ways, is \nregrettable. I think we as a country, right now today, when the \nAmerican people are feeling very vulnerable--and right now we have many \nSenators in the Chamber who have such a passion as it relates to \nclimate security--I think it is regrettable that we cannot come \ntogether and, as a part of this legislation, add many components--for \ninstance, that one which Pete Domenici from New Mexico led us on--and \ncreate a bill that doesn't just address climate but also addresses our \ncountry's energy security.\n  The American people are looking to us right now to act like adults. I \nhave to say I am not sure that as a country, for the last several \nyears, for some period of time, we have owned up to our country's major \nproblems. We have not done that. We have a tremendous opportunity in \nthis body this week and next week to address our country's \nenvironmental issues simultaneously with energy security. I think that \nis what the American people are looking to us to do.\n  I regret the fact that this bill, instead of being about climate \nsecurity, instead of being about something that drives our country \ntoward using technology that would cause our country to be energy \nsecure, has ended up being about money. It has ended up setting up a \ncommand-and-control economy.\n  Look at these various wedges on this pie chart. I could show many \nmore. It is an amazing thing that from the year 2012 through the year \n2050, over a trillion dollars of this money is pre-prescribed. It is \namazing that, as it relates\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\nto technology, there is a five-person board that has been set up to \ndecide where the trade of dollars will be spent. I cannot imagine this \nbody--I cannot imagine it--approving legislation of this type.\n  What I hope will occur is that the American people will become aware \nof what this debate is about. I hope all of us will have a constructive \ndebate in this body. My goal and hope is that we as a body will come \ntogether around climate change and energy security in an appropriate \nway and in such a way so those generations coming after us will have a \nbetter quality of life.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  (Several Senators addressed the Chair.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time does the Senator from Tennessee have \nremaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Three and a half minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Kerry wishes to question the \nSenator, if it is OK with the Senator from Tennessee. After that, I \nwish to be recognized for unanimous consent requests and perhaps an \nadditional minute or two, to be followed by Senator Warner for 2 \nminutes and Senator Domenici for 2 minutes. And then----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania will \nstate his inquiry.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is my understanding that I have 15 minutes at 12:15, \nwhich I have been waiting for all morning.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, following the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to have 2 minutes to do unanimous consent requests \nbefore my friend starts. I know Senator Warner wishes 2 minutes. The \nremaining time would be between the Senator from Tennessee and the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am agreeable to defer my 15 minutes, \nwhich is scheduled to start at 12:15, for 2 minutes for Senators Boxer \nand Warner. I don't understand what followed that. So I wish to proceed \nat that time with that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, that is exactly what I said.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I understand, the Senator from Tennessee \nhas some time left. I did rise to ask a question. The Senator said he \nwould be happy to answer the question.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Reserving the right to object, I don't know what the \nrequest is.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will reiterate it. It is that Senator Corker finish his \n3\\1/2\\ minutes and do a colloquy back and forth with Senator Kerry; \nthat immediately following that, I have some time to make some \nunanimous consent requests and have a minute to comment on what has \ntranspired, and that be followed with 2 minutes for Senator Warner. So \nfar we are 3 minutes delaying Senator Specter. Senator Domenici said he \ndid want some time, or did not?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say, I am going to ask the Senator from \nTennessee to yield to me a minute of his time to answer a question, or \nask a question on his time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nintend to object, I have already said I would be willing to yield 2 \nminutes to Senator Boxer and 2 minutes to Senator Warner, where Senator \nBoxer then added some amorphous language about an exchange between the \nSenator from Tennessee and the Senator from Massachusetts. I don't \nunderstand what that is and how long.\n  If I may finish, Mr. President. If I may finish.\n  Mr. CORKER. I will take my time back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have been waiting a while. I would like to have my \ntime which has been locked in and for which I have been waiting. Beyond \nthe yielding to Senator Boxer for 2 minutes and Senator Warner for 2 \nminutes, I will object to anything further.\n  Mr. KERRY. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator from \nTennessee, 3\\1/2\\ minutes, has expired. Is there objection to the \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will you restate the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry: How did his time expire?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Through this conversation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This conversation is automatically charged to him?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes, he had the floor.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, if I could, I think what they have asked \nfor is 3\\1/2\\ minutes plus 4 minutes, for 7\\1/2\\ minutes. The Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania, whom I admire and respect--I have sat here many \ntimes waiting for every Senator on this floor to speak. This is an \nimportant topic, and I hope he will allow Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle to have a little discussion right now for 7\\1/2\\ minutes, and \nthen we will stop.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be glad to add to the 4 minutes 3\\1/2\\ additional \nminutes which Senator Corker asked for on the condition that be the \nextent of it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the unanimous \nconsent request? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, I believe, is recognized for a \nquestion for the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Tennessee \ncalling this bill a spending bill--in fact, an entitlement bill. I ask \nthe Senator from Tennessee--I believe the Senator from Tennessee voted \nfor farm subsidies. I believe the Senator from Tennessee voted for \ncapital gains tax reduction. I believe the Senator from Tennessee voted \nfor the oil and gas depreciation.\n  I would like to know from the Senator from Tennessee, if those are \nnot subsidies, how he distinguishes incentives that change behavior \nthat are market driven. You either take advantage of it or you don't. \nNobody commands and controls. It is up to the individual company. Why \nis the effort to have a transfer of a payment that is an incentive for \ndifferent behavior any different from any of those things for which the \nSenator from Tennessee has voted?\n  Mr. CORKER. Actually, I am glad the Senator from Massachusetts \nbrought that up. That is the portion of cap-and-trade legislation that \nI believe is appropriate. Unfortunately, what this bill does is it \ntakes in trillions of dollars and then pre-prescribes how that money is \nspent, going out into areas to people who have nothing whatsoever to do \nwith emitting carbons. Twenty-seven percent of the allocations go out \nto entities in this country that have nothing whatsoever to do with \nemitting carbon. That is a huge unnecessary transference of wealth.\n  I would like to yield some time to Senator Domenici. I answered the \nquestion, and I would love to debate the Senator further on the floor. \nI know we have the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say to everyone in the Senate, \nin all honesty, they ought to have a chance to hear the Senator from \nTennessee. If they haven't, they ought to read what he said because \nthere is no question that I, as a rather informed Senator, had no idea \nwhat this bill does until I listened to him and then looked at it.\n  It is absolutely incredible that we are thinking of a bill such as \nthis to solve climate change when, as a matter of fact, it is going to \nbe the biggest redistribution of wealth we have ever adopted in this \nSenate, and we are not even sure it will accomplish anything very \nsignificant toward the reduction of carbon dioxide as an impediment to \nclimate change.\n  I cannot understand why we would be doing this. One little piece is a \ncommission of five men who will distribute allocations pursuant to this \nlegislation, totally at their discretion, a trillion dollars or more. \nWho on God's Earth would think that is in this bill?\n\n[[Page S4917]]\n\nBut it is. I commend him. I hope he comes here two or three times and \nexplains again in more detail what this bill does.\n  I am not against legislation for climate change, but I am convinced \nthat we better do something for the American people on bridging crude \noil use, crude oil development, putting some of the things we need in \nplace for energy before we put this legislation in place. I think the \nAmerican people will soon understand that.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. CORKER. Let me just say, I hope we have further debate. I respect \npeople on both sides of the aisle. Surely, we can come up with a way to \nmake sure our environment is appropriately dealt with and that we have \nenergy security----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time has expired.\n  Mr. CORKER.--and not cause this to be a burden on Americans as it is \nby prespending trillions of dollars.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time has expired. The Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we all respect each other, but I have to \nsay, I don't think my friend from Tennessee understands this bill at \nall. All I can say is, he couldn't understand it because the biggest \npiece of this bill, OK, is funds for the American people, a big tax \ncut. If my friend opposes a tax cut, he ought to say it. It is a huge \ntax cut for the American people to help them deal with the increases in \ngas prices.\n  Right now, under this President, we have seen a 250-percent increase \nin the cost of a gallon of gas, just in 7 years. We have no resources. \nThis bill gives us the resources. It gives us consumer relief.\n  My friend from Tennessee used very harsh words, in my opinion, to \nattack a bill that really does address the issue of global warming, \naddresses the issue of energy independence. And for him to call it \ncommand and control is rather a joke since we specifically rejected a \ncarbon tax and we allowed the free market to set a price on carbon.\n  As to Senator Domenici's statement, again, he says it will do \nnothing. Read the modeling. We do what we have to do in this country to \nexert the leadership to decrease these greenhouse gases, and we do it \nin a way that has won the support of business, labor, and huge numbers \nof people across this country, including the U.S. Conference of Mayors \nand Republican and Democratic Governors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when we resume after \nlunch that I be recognized to speak for up to 30 minutes, followed by \nSenator Inhofe to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding, \nthere was an order in place----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I thought I had 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator does.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then at the appropriate time the Chair directs me, I will \nuse the 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I simply would like to ask we modify that \nrequest because I was going to follow, but we have chewed up a lot of \ntime now and we have our caucuses. I am happy to go after Senator \nInhofe and Senator Boxer, or I am happy to go before, whatever they \nprefer, but I think we ought to do it after the caucuses now at this \npoint. I ask the Chair what her pleasure is.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If my colleague agrees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the understanding was that Senator Specter \nwould be next for 15 minutes, and after that, the Senator from \nMassachusetts. If it is the Senator's preference to wait until \nafterwards, I have no objection to that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And Senator Warner has 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there an objection to the \nrequest as modified?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, what is the pending unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. To allow the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Oklahoma to each have 30 minutes after \nwe come back from the recess.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Followed by Senator Kerry.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. To be followed by the Senator from \nMassachusetts. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thought you said it was OK.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let's just try a new one. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senator from Virginia be recognized for 3 minutes, followed by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is this morning, now.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All this takes place prior to the break for lunch.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there a request that we go past 12:30?\n  Mr. INHOFE. My unanimous consent request, I say to the distinguished \nleader, would postpone the 12:30 recess for lunch for about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I will just say, I have no problem if the lunches don't \nstart until 20 till 1, but anything other than that, I respectfully \nhave to say I hope people can come after the Senate picture this \nafternoon. I know comparing it to global warming, it is not a very \nimportant issue. Staff has worked some 6 weeks to set up this place to \ntake the picture at 2:15. Both caucuses have a lot to talk about. \nSenator Kerry has agreed to wait until after lunch. That will be fine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. For the record, we have not \ndisposed of the unanimous consent request. But if my mathematics is \ncorrect, that unanimous consent request will take us up to 15 before 1. \nIs there objection to the unanimous consent request by the Senator from \nOklahoma? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer. Mr. President, I say to my \ngood friend, this has been an excellent debate he engendered on this \nfloor. This is what we should have. This is the only way we are going \nto resolve this issue of global warming. I urge the managers to \nconsider building in a little block of time after speakers, such as \nthere can be some colloquy taking place rather than just one speaker, \nanother speaker, reading a speech or delivering a speech. This is what \nit is all about.\n  Mr. President, I say to my good friend, he and I have worked on this \nissue over a period of about 2 or 3 months. I have worked on it for 8 \nmonths. I don't claim any special credit. But if the Senator feels so \nbadly about this bill, why haven't he and others brought to the floor a \ncompanion bill to replace this and to solve the problems he has? It is \none thing to come in here and hail damnation on what we have done by \nmeans of putting this bill together, but if it is going to be a \nconstructive process, show us--\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me finish the statement, and I will yield the floor--\na comprehensive bill that will work to the satisfaction of a majority \nof the people here. For example, you talk about this board, seven men. \nLet's say there might be a woman or two on it.\n  Mr. CORKER. I didn't say ``men.'' I said five people.\n  Mr. WARNER. The point is, if we look at section 435 of the bill, it \nsays that chart the Senator has up there has to be approved by the \nCongress.\n  Mr. CORKER. It can only be vetoed.\n  Mr. WARNER. Nevertheless, you omitted any reference to the fact that \nCongress has a hand. If you look at the amendment I have thrown in, the \nPresident of the United States, at any time he or she desires, can go \nin and change that. So it is not as if we have unleashed this bill in \nperpetuity. There are a number of checks and balances in this bill to \nprotect the very issues that the Senator states.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, if I may proceed, because my name has been \nbrought forth, for 60 seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. First of all, this bill, in black and white, prespends \nover $1 trillion with no congressional oversight. The Senator from \nVirginia is right on the one portion to which he was referring. We can \neither veto it or approve\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\nit, but we have no say-so on how those technology moneys are spent.\n  I object to the comment about me being a Johnny-come-lately. I have \nbeen very transparent about this legislation. I have authored three \nvery detailed amendments, sent them to every colleague in this Senate, \nand have given the background to them. I have been totally transparent \nthroughout this process. I have made public presentations about the \nthree amendments that I think would make this bill far better--things \nthat people call poison pills. I think the Senator knows I certainly \nhave not come to this debate at a late time, and I plan to offer those \namendments.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I agree with what the Senator has said.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. It has been a little tough getting \nthese 15 minutes, but I am glad to have them.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator showed courtesy in getting them.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I sought recognition to discuss a number \nof amendments which I will be proposing to offer. I intend to offer an \namendment on emission caps because of my concern that the emission caps \nwhich are set in the Lieberman-Warner bill cannot be obtained.\n  I believe the problem of global warming is a major problem and we \nought to deal with it, but I think we have to deal with it within the \nrealistic bounds as to what the technology would permit, and it is \ngoing to be very difficult to get 60 votes to oppose cloture, and if a \nlegislative proposal is on the floor which is unattainable, we are \ngoing to end up getting nothing. So it is my intention to take the \nemission caps from the Bingaman-Specter bill and offer them as an \namendment to the Lieberman-Warner bill.\n  I intend to offer a second amendment--a cost-containment safety-valve \namendment. This amendment will include the so-called technology \naccelerator mechanism which has been included in the Bingaman-Specter \nbill, and will provide a very important safeguard on the legislation.\n  I intend to offer a third amendment on international competitiveness. \nIt is vital that we not structure legislation which will put United \nStates industry at a substantial disadvantage. On February 14, I \ntestified before the Senate Finance Committee on this subject, noting \nthat China wishes to have 30 years, and by that time there will be no \nsteel industry. So there have to be restrictions on steel \nillustratively coming in the United States, and this amendment on \ninternational competitiveness will deal with that subject.\n  I intend further to offer an amendment captioned ``Process Gas \nEmissions,'' because there is no technological alternative to a \ncompany's annual requirement to submit emissions allowances.\n  Finally, there is a potential fifth amendment, which I am not yet \ncertain about, and that would involve the pathway to the future for \ncoal amendment.\n  The statement was made earlier in the past half hour about Senators \nnot understanding this bill. I think that is a real problem. This is an \nextraordinarily complex bill. We have had the Warner-Lieberman bill, \nthen we have had the Boxer bill, a second bill, and now I understand \nthere is going to be a third substitute. So as we are working through \nthe amendments which I have articulated, it is a difficult matter, with \nthe topography changing and with the underlying bill changing, and it \nis my hope this bill will remain on the floor with procedures to give \nSenators sufficient time to take up the very important matters which \nare at hand.\n  The first and most fundamental one is to have enough debate so that \nthere is an understanding of the bill. I agree with my distinguished \ncolleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, who a few moments ago asked \nfor time so there could be debate and an exchange. Too often speeches \nare made on this floor without an opportunity for debate and \nquestioning and cross-questioning to get to the very important matters. \nThere has been some speculation that the procedure that will be \nemployed by the majority leader--so-called filling the tree--would \npreclude further amendments. I hope that will not be done here. \nRegrettably, it has become a commonplace practice, going back with \nRepublican majority leaders and Democratic majority leaders, so that \nthe filling of the tree has made a very fundamental change in Senate \nprocedure, which traditionally has been that a Senator could offer an \namendment on any subject at any time and get a vote.\n  When the tree is filled, obviously matters cannot be debated and \nefforts for cloture cannot move forward. This is a matter which has \nawaited a fair amount of time. It is complex. And if Senators are not \nable to offer amendments, such as the amendments which I am proposing \nto offer, there is no way to find out what the merits of the bill are \nand what the merits of the amendments are.\n  On the subject of filling the tree, I have had for months now an \namendment on a rules change filed with the rules committee which would \nalter the authority of the majority leader to employ the so-called \nprocedure of filling the tree.\n  Another concern which is related has been the shift in the practice \nof the Senate on the filibusters. There had been a tradition in the \nSenate that when somebody offered a bill, and there was opposition and \nthe opposition intended to conduct a filibuster--that is to deny a vote \nunless 60 votes were obtained to cut off debate--that there would be \nthat kind of debate. Most recently, we have seen the practice employed \nthat if someone says there is an intent to have a filibuster, there is \na motion to proceed for cloture on a filibuster, there is a 20-minute \nvote, and when cloture is not invoked, the matter is eliminated.\n  Recently, we had a very serious piece of legislation coming to the \nfloor which sought to change a ruling of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States on the rights of women to obtain relief, where the \nSupreme Court had imposed a 6-month statute of limitations in a \nsituation where the woman who sought relief didn't even know she had a \ncause of action within the 6 months. Well, that matter came and went so \nfast on the Senate floor that nobody knew what it was about. Had the \nproponents of that legislation debated it, brought it to public \nattention, and had the opponents of the legislation, who wanted to \nfilibuster it, engaged in extended debate, the public would have \nunderstood what was going on.\n  So the matter of having adequate time to debate this very complex \nlegislation is very important. And if there is to be any possibility of \nfinding 60 Senators to coalesce around a cloture petition, 60 Senators \nto agree on legislation, Senators are going to have to have an \nopportunity to offer their amendments. There is great therapy in being \nable to offer an amendment, even if it is not accepted. But we can \nhardly engage in a practice of filling the tree, where Senators are not \npermitted to offer amendments, and expect to have this bill move \nforward, people understand it, and find 60 Senators who are willing to \ncome together on the very important piece of legislation which is at \nhand.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be included in the \nRecord at this time a summary of the sheet of the five potential \namendments I intend to offer, and an explanation of the amendment on \nthe cost-containment safety valve, an explanation on the amendment on \ninternational competition, an explanation on the amendment on process \ngas emissions, and the single sheet which explains the proposal on a \npossible pathway to the future for the expanded use of coal amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Potential Specter Amendments\n\n       Emissions Caps/Targets Amendment.--Substitute the Bingaman-\n     Specter (S. 1766) emissions limits in place of the Lieberman-\n     Warner limits.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Lieberman-Warner                     Bingaman-Specter\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2012--cap at 2005 level...................  2012--cap at 2012 level.\n2020--15% below 2005 (1990 levels)........  2020--cap at 2006 level.\n2030--30% below 2005......................  2030--cap at 1990 level.\n2050--70% below 2005......................  2050--60% below 2006\n                                             contingent on international\n                                             effort.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Cost-Containment Safety-Valve Amendment.--Include the so-\n     called ``safety valve'' or Technology Accelerator Mechanism \n     that was included in the Bingaman-Specter bill; that \n     provision states that if the price for an allowance for each \n     ton of greenhouse gas\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\n     (Carbon Dioxide equivalent) being traded on the open market \n     reaches a certain level, then regulated entities have the \n     option of purchasing additional allowances directly from the \n     government at a set price; specifically, we set the price at \n     $12 per ton, rising 5% over inflation annually.\n       International Competitiveness Amendment.--Address the \n     standard used to determine if our trading partners are taking \n     ``comparable action''; restrict an Administration's ability \n     to simply waive requirements on importers; bring the \n     compliance date in line with the start of the program (i.e. \n     2012, rather than 2014 in the new version--changed from 2020 \n     in the original); revise provisions added for ``downstream'' \n     products that may ironically result in exempting the \n     ``upstream'' inputs like steel; include all countries, not \n     just large emitters; and equalize the ability of U.S. and \n     foreign entities to purchase international allowances to meet \n     the requirements.\n       Process Gas Emissions Amendment.--Clarify that process \n     gases for which there is no technological alternative will \n     not be counted in a company's annual requirement to submit \n     emissions allowances.\n       Pathway to the Future for Coal Amendment.--Potentially \n     including provisions: Providing technology funding and \n     incentives; adding a carbon dioxide storage liability \n     framework; adding a safety-valve; aligning emissions caps/\n     targets with technology; improving allocations; addressing \n     duplicative State programs; and other issues.\n\n\n                    Emissions Caps/Targets Amendment\n\n       As I stated yesterday, I have serious concerns about the \n     stringency of the emissions reductions in the Lieberman-\n     Warner ``Climate Security Act.'' There is great concern in \n     the industrial, electric, and general business sectors that \n     these emissions levels are unattainable without serious \n     demand destruction in the form of lost jobs and production in \n     the U.S. that would result from higher cost.\n       If we do not set the emissions caps at a reasonable level, \n     the supply and demand situation set up under a cap-and-trade \n     program will impose high costs by definition. I intend to \n     propose an amendment to substitute the Bingaman-Specter (S. \n     1766) emissions limits in place of the Lieberman-Warner \n     limits. This will more closely align technology development \n     with the emissions reduction targets.\n       In my view, the most important thing our nation can do is \n     start a mandatory climate change reduction program as soon as \n     possible. If we wait until there is consensus among important \n     stakeholders from both sides of the equation, we will lose \n     another year or two or three that we frankly do not have.\n     Emissions targets/caps\n       Bingaman-Specter 2012--cap at 2005 level.\n       2012--cap at 2012 level 2020--15% below 2005 (1990 levels).\n       2020--cap at 2006 level 2030--30% below 2005.\n       2030--cap at 1990 level 2050--70% below 2005.\n       2050--60 percent below 2006 contingent on international \n     effort.\n\n\n                cost-containment safety-valve amendment\n\n       Senator Bingaman and I worked very hard to find the right \n     balance between starting the U.S. on an emissions reduction \n     path, but protecting the economy;\n       We are talking about taking unilateral action on a global \n     problem reducing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the \n     atmosphere; we cannot solve this problem alone and until a \n     comprehensive international agreement is in place, the U.S. \n     remains at risk of competitive disadvantages.\n       If some proponents of climate change legislation are \n     correct in their predictions, the cost of domestic action on \n     the problem will not be high.\n       However, if costs are above what Congress determines in \n     unacceptable, there must be an adequate mechanism to keep the \n     program in line with what the U.S. economy can handle; I \n     intend to offer an amendment to include the so-called \n     ``safety valve'' or Technology Accelerator Mechanism that was \n     included in the Bingaman-Specter bill; that provision states \n     that if the price for an allowance for each ton of greenhouse \n     gas (Carbon Dioxide equivalent) being traded on the open \n     market reaches a certain level, then regulated entities have \n     the option of purchasing additional allowances directly from \n     the government at a set price; specifically, we set the price \n     at $12 per ton, rising 5% over inflation annually; this \n     protects the economy, while still sending the necessary price \n     signal to industry that there is an escalating price to \n     carbon that must be factored in investment decisions; I am \n     open to a debate about the appropriate level at which to set \n     such a safety-valve;\n       Unfortunately, opponents of this provision have flatly \n     attacked it without addressing the question of what an \n     appropriate price trigger would be; I was very glad to hear \n     Chairman Boxer state on the Senate floor yesterday thanking \n     Senator Bingaman and me for our proposal on this subject. She \n     described it as ``what I thought was a very important off \n     ramp. The one thing I didn't agree with them on is the price \n     they picked for the price of carbon.''\n       I hope this is an indication that we can finally have a \n     legitimate debate about this important protection for the \n     U.S. economy and consumers.\n       While Senator Boxer inserted a new ``cost containment \n     auction,'' I believe the new cost containment provisions \n     require extensive review and a true safety-valve should be \n     added.\n       Senator Warner provided leadership in adding provisions to \n     empower the President to alter the program, but I fear this \n     still provides too much discretion and would potentially be \n     used after adverse effects have already happened.\n\n\n                international competitiveness amendment\n\n       Senator Bingaman and I included key international \n     provisions in our bill. These provisions were based on a \n     proposal from American Electric Power (AEP) and the \n     International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW).\n       Senators Lieberman and Warner included our provisions in \n     their legislation as well; The purpose of these provisions is \n     to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions occurring outside the \n     U.S. do not undermine our efforts to address global climate \n     change and we further want to encourage effective \n     international action.\n       As first introduced, if eight years after the enactment of \n     the U.S. program, it is determined that a given major \n     emitting nation has not taken comparable action, the \n     President at that time is authorized to require that \n     importers of greenhouse-gas-intensive manufactured products \n     (iron, steel, aluminum, cement, glass, or paper) from that \n     nation submit emissions credits of a value equivalent to that \n     of the credits that the U.S. system effectively requires of \n     domestic manufacturers.\n       I testified before the Senate Finance Committee on February \n     14th of this year on these provisions. It is my view that \n     since the provisions treat imports the same as domestic \n     products, I believe they are compliant with GATT and would \n     survive a WTO challenge. Now, I understand that modifications \n     of this proposal are found in the Boxer substitute.\n       As my staff and various industries review the language, \n     there remain concerns that the provisions may still require \n     changes to ensure their effectiveness; specifically, I am \n     considering offering an amendment to: Address the standard \n     used to determine if our trading partners are taking \n     ``comparable action''; restrict an Administration's ability \n     to simply waive requirements on importers; bring the \n     compliance date in line with the start of the program (ie. \n     2012, rather than 2014 in the new version--changed from 2020 \n     in the original); revise provisions added for ``downstream'' \n     products that may ironically result in exempting the \n     ``upstream'' inputs like steel; include all countries, not \n     just large emitters; and equalize the ability of U.S. and \n     foreign entities to purchase international allowances to meet \n     the requirements.\n\n\n                    process gas emissions amendment\n\n       It is my understanding that some emissions resulting from \n     production of energy-intensive manufacturers like steel and \n     cement would be exempted because there is no feasible \n     technological alternative;\n       For example, the use of carbon is irreplaceable to the \n     processes and the metallurgical reactions necessary to \n     produce virgin steel. Carbon, in the form of coal or coke, is \n     used as a reducing agent to strip oxygen molecules from iron \n     ore, producing iron, the basic building block of steel, and \n     carbon dioxide. Without carbon there can be no steel.\n       Without this exemption, given current technology, the only \n     way to substantially reduce emissions in the integrated steel \n     industry is to reduce production and employment.\n       Cooperative efforts are underway between the steel industry \n     and the U.S. Department of Energy to find technologies to \n     produce steel with far less carbon emissions, but they are \n     far from commercial viability.\n       I intend to offer an amendment to clarify that process \n     gases for which there is no technological alternative will \n     not be counted in a company's annual requirement to submit \n     emissions allowances.\n       This exemption will only impact a very small percentage of \n     U.S. emissions, but will protect an essential industry that \n     will play a major role in the energy sector expansion that \n     would result upon passage of this bill or even in its absence \n     given rising energy demand.\n\n\n                pathway to the future for coal amendment\n\n       I am considering offering an amendment to address the \n     serious shortcomings in the Lieberman-Warner bill in terms of \n     providing a pathway to the future for coal;\n       I am concerned that the bill does not provide sufficient \n     funding or incentives for carbon capture and storage (CCS) \n     and advanced coal technologies; It is my understanding that \n     the Boxer substitute replaces the original Lieberman-Warner \n     advanced coal research program with a ``kick-start program'' \n     that dramatically cuts carbon capture and storage technology \n     funding. According to the National Mining Association, the \n     substitute provides 85% less funding through 2030 for \n     advanced coal and sequestration development, and eliminates \n     all funding for carbon storage demonstration projects.\n       Without adequate funding for these priorities, the result \n     is likely to be severe reductions in U.S. coal use--America's \n     most abundant energy resource.\n       Further, the substitute dramatically reduces the number and \n     rate of bonus allowances for CCS deployment from the previous \n     Lieberman-Warner bill. The Bingaman-Specter bill was the \n     first to create this incentive for early deployment of carbon \n     capture and storage technologies. I am told the substitute \n     reduces CCS bonus allowances 19 percent through 2030 compared \n     to levels in Lieberman-Warner which were already \n     insufficient.\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\n       Broadly, the Boxer substitute fails to harmonize the \n     timeline for emission reductions with the availability of \n     commercially deployed technologies necessary to reduce \n     emissions.\n       I look forward to working with my colleagues and the coal \n     industry to find the right balance between imposing a \n     mandatory cap on carbon emissions while ensuring the future \n     of coal.\n       Some issues we need to consider are: Providing technology \n     funding and incentives;\n       Adding a carbon dioxide storage liability framework; adding \n     a safety-valve; aligning emissions caps/targets with \n     technology; improving allocations; address duplicative State \n     programs; and others.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say that my friend from Pennsylvania has \nbeen a great leader on this, and I am ready right now, as is Senator \nWarner, as is Senator Lieberman, to start debating amendments. \nUnfortunately, the Republican leadership has said we need to run out 30 \nhours, so we are not going to be able to begin the amendment process. \nBut it runs out tonight and, hopefully, first thing in the morning we \nwill start with the amendment process.\n  Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request, signed off on by \nSenator Inhofe and myself, and I ask unanimous consent that the order \nof speakers for this afternoon's debate on the motion to proceed to the \nclimate bill be as follows: Boxer, 20 minutes; Inhofe, 30 minutes; \nKerry, 20 minutes; Barrasso, 15 minutes; Whitehouse, 15 minutes; \nGrassley, 15 minutes; Casey, 15 minutes; Enzi, 20 minutes; Carper, 30 \nminutes; Alexander, 20 minutes; Warner, 20 minutes; Bond, 20 minutes; \nLieberman, 30 minutes; Vitter, 15 minutes; Nelson of Florida, 15 \nminutes; and Craig, 15 minutes.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that following each speaker, the \nbill manager or their designee from the opposite side of the previous \nspeaker have up to 5 minutes for a rebuttal statement prior to the next \nspeaker listed above being recognized.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator would add me for 15 minutes on that list, I \nwould appreciate it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Happy to do that. And, Senator, I will add a Democrat \nbefore you, and you will be the next Republican after Senator Craig, \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, in a moment I wish to make a motion, \nbut I would like to say as a prelude, for 6 years I have worked on \nlegislation to provide for notification in the event of a data breach. \nDuring that period of time, 43 States have passed their own \nlegislation. We would not know of data breaches if it were not \nparticularly for the State of California which has put forward action \non several of them.\n  The bill went to the Judiciary Committee. It has been heard in the \nJudiciary Committee. With the cooperation and support of the chairman \nof that committee, Senator Leahy, the bill has come out unanimously and \nhas been pending before this body. There are holds on the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 180, S. 239, data breach modifications; \nthat the committee-reported amendment be considered and agreed to, the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table, without further intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I \nwill object--I value the interest and effort Senator Feinstein has put \ninto this bill. I have also worked on this issue for some time. Last \nyear, I think my bill cleared the committee by unanimous consent, and \nthis year her bill is out on the floor. There are some differences. I \ncommit to Senator Feinstein, post my objection today, that we will try \nto work together to see if we can reach accord. There are some \ndifferences that are significant and some I am sure we can work out. So \nwe will just have to give a good-faith effort at it.\n  I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I could respond to something the Senator \nfrom California said, I commend Senator Feinstein for her efforts. She \nhas worked very hard on this privacy matter. I realize there are some \nwho want to block it. If you are a person who has had your identity \nstolen, if you have had your computer hacked, and somebody has gone \ninto your bank account or somebody has ruined the chances of your \nchildren getting into a college, all from identity theft, you would be \nrushing down here to vote for this bill. I hope my friends on the other \nside of the aisle, Republican Senators, will stop objecting. I hope we \ncan pass this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4920-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4920-S4959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CLIMATE SECURITY ACT OF 2008--MOTION TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is it appropriate at this time to yield some \nof my time? I have an hour postcloture; is it appropriate now to yield \nthat to someone?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. REID. I yield \\1/2\\ hour to the Senator from California, Mrs. \nBoxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, to remind the first few speakers, what we \nhave is Boxer for 20 minutes, and I plan to yield 5 of those minutes to \nSenator Durbin, then a rebuttal by Senator Inhofe or his designee, then \nSenator Inhofe for 30 minutes, then a rebuttal by our side, then \nSenator Kerry for 30 minutes.\n  I have found this debate so far to be very interesting and very \nheartfelt. What I would like to do before I yield a few minutes of my \ntime to Senator Durbin is kind of take it to where it has gone thus \nfar. So far we have had a vote to proceed to this matter, a very strong \nvote to do that, 74 votes yes. That is good.\n  What isn't so great is, we are kind of being slow-walked by the \nRepublican leadership in such a way that we can't start the amendment \nprocess which, as we all know, is crucial on a bill of this nature. So \nthat is disappointing.\n  I think the debate has been very interesting, and I would like to \nrelate where I think it is at this point.\n  Those of us who believe the Boxer-Lieberman-Warner proposal makes \nsense believe it is time to change the status quo as it relates to our \nenergy policy in this country. What we have now with our dependence on \nfossil fuels is an energy policy which is now getting very costly \nbecause of increased demand in the world, because of speculation, \nbecause of a lot of reasons, and it is also polluting the planet to the \npoint where we see the global warming impacts already starting.\n  My colleague, Senator Feinstein, was brilliant today, both at a press \nconference and on the floor, in talking about what is already happening \nin the West with our snow pack, with lakes that are disappearing, with \nthe problems we are having. We know, if we listen to the scientists--\nand the scientists are in agreement, and I am glad that my colleagues \non the other side\n\n[[Page S4921]]\n\nare not debating whether global warming is happening; they have, it \nseems to me, accepted that fact--that we have a choice. Either we \ncontinue what we are doing today with the same kind of energy sources \nwe have, with the buildup of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon \npollution or we move forward and say: How can we tackle this issue in a \nway that saves the planet, saves the species?\n  By the way, 40 percent of God's creatures may be extinct if we don't \nact. How are we going to do this in such a way that our grandchildren \nand their children don't face a disastrous situation where the planet \nbecomes inhospitable. We have the numbers, how many thousands more \npeople will die of heat stroke. We have the numbers, and the numbers \ncome from the Bush administration. So how do we do this in a way that \nsaves the planet, cuts down on pollution and, by the way, gives us \nalternatives to energy we now have which, in the long run, will be \ncheaper, more reliable, and make us completely energy independent?\n  I believe what our bill does is achieve those goals. We fight global \nwarming. At the same time, we bring about an economic renaissance from \ninvestments in new technologies that will make us energy independent. \nTo me, it is a pretty stark choice. Either you are for the status quo \nand you are going to find an excuse not to be for this bill or you are \ngoing to take a look at this bill, which is a tripartisan bill--a \nDemocrat, an independent, a Republican bringing it to the Senate--\nreflective of America, reflective of the span of our views in this \nNation.\n  The one thing I hear--again, it must be out of some talking point \nsomebody wrote over there on the other side--is gas prices. Don't do \nthis bill because of gas prices.\n  I am going to show you what has happened to gas prices without this \nbill. I want you to look at this. This is what has happened under \nGeorge Bush's watch. We have seen gas prices go all the way up to $3.94 \nfrom $1.50, and that, in 7\\1/2\\ years, is a 250-percent increase. That \nis what our people are upset about.\n  My colleagues on the other side know this. They have done nothing \nabout this. I am going to ask my assistant majority leader to talk \nabout this. How many times we have begged them, do something about big \noil. Return the money to the people. Investigate what is happening with \nspeculation. No, they won't do anything. But what they are saying is, \nand what the Bush administration is saying is, if you pass this bill, \nthis Climate Security Act, gas prices are going to go up.\n  Folks, they are going to go down. Worst case scenario that the \nPresident picked up, they will go up 2 cents a year. That is the worst \ncase scenario. But that is going to be offset by the fuel economy bill \nthat the President himself signed.\n  I am looking at Senator Carper, the Presiding Officer. He worked hard \non that, with Senator Feinstein, Senator Inouye, and Senator Kerry, \nthose of us on the Commerce Committee. That will be offset. The truth \nis, the stark truth is, you pass this bill, we are going to see a \nreduction in gas prices. We are going to have alternatives, and we are \ngoing to see jobs created. We are going to see new companies starting. \nWe are going to see the genius of America take hold if only we have the \ncourage--not to come on this floor and make a bogus argument about an \nissue they did nothing about, but if we have a real debate on what this \nbill means.\n\n  So at this time, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes of those 13 minutes to \nthe Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I extend my gratitude to Senator \nBoxer for her extraordinary leadership on this issue, a bipartisan \nissue, with Senator Lieberman, Senator Warner, and so many others on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  In the history of our country and of this great institution, the \nSenate, there have been many occasions when Senators have come to the \nfloor and spoken of threats to the security of the United States of \nAmerica. Those threats usually came in the form of dictators or \nideologies such as communism and fascism, and we mobilized American \nopinion behind fighting those threats. We asked great sacrifices from \nour people to come forward to make sure future generations would enjoy \nthe freedoms and opportunities we enjoy today, which many take for \ngranted.\n  The debate today is about another threat, a very real threat, to the \nfuture not only of the United States but to all the countries in the \nworld. It is a common threat. This bill is about reducing carbon \npollution that causes global warming. It uses free market incentives to \nprotect American jobs and creates international sanctions for those \ncountries that do not participate. It is a tried and true approach. We \nhave used this very same approach, as this bill suggests, to \nsuccessfully reduce acid rain. So we know it works. We know how \ncompelling it is for us to move on it, and move on it quickly. Delay on \nthis subject will mean even greater sacrifices in the future. In fact, \nit may reach a point where it is not even feasible to address the \nissue.\n  We are all concerned about the cost of fuel, whether it is gasoline \nor diesel fuel or heating oil or jet fuel. The stark reality is, this \nbill will bring us to a new attitude and a new approach: more fuel \nefficiency, driving the same miles using less fuel, with less carbon \npollution, and fewer emissions.\n  This bill drives us forward in a positive way to deal with the needs \nof our economy and to keep the costs of energy within the grasp of \nfamilies and businesses and farmers.\n  Secondly, the bill focuses on creating new jobs, the jobs of our \nfuture. In this country and in the world will be jobs that really look \nto the environment as a major element in costing out things. It is no \nlonger just the cost of bringing a ton of steel halfway around the \nworld from China. It is also the carbon cost of transporting that steel \nthat has to be taken into consideration. That is a very real cost.\n  When we start thinking in terms of fuel efficiency, the United States \ncan use the same kind of entrepreneurial spirit and innovative spirit \nthat has been such a successful engine to our economy in the years gone \nby, whether it has been the Silicon Valley or medical technology. The \nUnited States can lead again because we have the economy and the talent \nto get in the front of this parade and to stay there when it comes to \njob and business creation.\n  It is also a question of public health. We know global warming is \ngoing to create an environment where many will suffer; pulmonary \ndisease, such as asthma, cancers, such as melanoma, are going to \nincrease if we do not get serious about this issue. I think we \nunderstand that. For the good of our children and grandchildren, and \nfor our desire to make sure they have better and longer lives than \nourselves, this bill is extremely important.\n  Finally, this whole issue of global warming is an issue that really \naddresses stability in our world. It is no surprise that some of the \ntinder boxes--and I do not mean any pun by that--some of the tinder \nboxes in the world today are countries in desperate straits trying to \nfind water for their people. It is a huge issue in the Middle East. It \nis also an issue in Africa. When that issue has become its most \nextreme, we find genocide in Darfur, we find turmoil in other parts of \nthe world and instability. Coming to grips with global warming, \nstabilizing our global climate, is a way for us to try to bring some \npeace and stability to this world.\n  When you think about the parameters of this debate, could you think \nof anything more serious? How can we face our children and \ngrandchildren if we do not honestly debate this issue, if we do not \nstep up and say: On our watch, at our time, our generation did the \nright thing?\n  We cannot undo what has been done in the past, generations gone by, \ncenturies in the past. But we are responsible for now and for the \nfuture.\n  This is our chance to move forward. I beg my colleagues, even if you \nfind differences and difficulties with the bill, let's work together.\n  Senator Warner, I am glad you are here. We would not be here without \nyou, and that is a fact. You have shown a bipartisan spirit to address \nthis issue, and you have taken a little bit of grief\n\n[[Page S4922]]\n\nfrom your side of the aisle. Well, trust me, many of us appreciate your \nleadership on this issue, and it will be long remembered.\n  In that spirit--Senator Warner, Senator Lieberman, Senator Boxer, and \nothers--we need to say to future generations: We can come together, \nboth parties, and take on this challenge successfully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his comments. But \na short time ago there was a colloquy on the floor, and someone said \nthey felt----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I did.\n  Mr. WARNER. There was a slow roll. I immediately went back to consult \nwith my leadership, and that is not the case. The reason for not going \nto amendments today seems to me to be a valid one; that is, a number of \nSenators wish to speak. The list is up to 18 now, and they want to \nspeak in such a way that is not feasible if we are in an amending \nposture.\n  So I thank the distinguished chairman on this matter because I do \nbelieve we have made some progress today. We have had good, \nconstructive speeches. Senator Corker spoke, Senator Isakson spoke on \nthis side, and colleagues on your side. I think Senator Kerry was about \nto speak.\n  Mrs. BOXER. He is going to speak.\n  Mr. WARNER. So I think, Mr. Chairman, we are making some good, solid \nprogress in the Senate and can rightfully take pride in what we have \ndone thus far. Would you agree with me?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. President, I wonder how much time I have left of my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. Senator Warner is speaking on my time, then? Which is \nfine.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have nothing further to say.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, it is fine. I say to Senator Warner, I believed we \nwere slow-walking it only because we are so anxious to get to the \namendments. But I hear what you are saying--if this is real. We are \ngoing to have some good debate today. This is the list of Senators on \nboth sides. This is good.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that would not be possible if we were in \nan amendment posture. We could not get all those Senators in.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, let me say, I welcome everyone to the floor.\n  Let me conclude my little part today at this time by saying we have \nseen the faith communities come out very strongly for the Boxer-\nLieberman-Warner bill--the Evangelical Environmental Network, the \nEvangelical Climate Initiative, the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops, the National Council of Churches, the Religious Action Center \nof Reform Judaism, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, the \nInterfaith Power and Light Campaign. These are just some.\n  I think we have had some very wonderful meetings with them and press \nconferences with them. The way they look at the world is this: It is \nGod's creation that is at stake, and they feel very moved and very \nbound to respond. It is rare you see this kind of coalition coming \nforward. But they look at God's creatures, and they say: We have a \nresponsibility. They look at human beings all over the world who will \nsuffer mightily if we do not get a grip on this global warming because \nwe know, with rising sea levels, we will have refugees who will be \nstranded. We know in our own country we will have thousands die of heat \nstrokes. We will have many thousands die from vectors and problems of \nnew kinds of amoebas and so on that will now be present in the warmer \nwaters.\n  We had an incident, and I believe it was at Lake Havasu, where we had \nsome little child who went swimming and got a brain infection, who got \nthat because the waters are getting warmer. So this is not theoretical. \nIt is real.\n  Here, as shown in this picture, is a beautiful creature, the polar \nbear and people say: Oh, is this all about saving the polar bear? It is \nabout saving us. It is about saving our future. It is about saving the \nlife on planet Earth. And, yes, it is about saving God's creatures.\n  I remember sitting just a few feet away, at our hearings, from the \nscientists who said 40 to 50 percent of God's species could be extinct \nif we do not act. Now, that is not something we can turn away from, at \nleast in my opinion. Here is this magnificent creature in peril because \nof the disappearing ice.\n  I also think we have to remind ourselves that global warming is a \nnational security issue. I know when Senator Warner became involved in \nit, it was in great part because of this. A report conducted by the \nCenter for Naval Analysis found that the United States could more \nfrequently be drawn into situations of conflict to ``provide stability \nbefore conditions worsen and are exploited by extremists. . . . The \nU.S. will find itself in a world where Europe will be struggling \ninternally, with large numbers of refugees washing up on its shores, \nand Asia in serious crisis over food and water. Disruptions and \nconflict will be endemic features of life.''\n  Look, this is not a quote from Senator Boxer or Senator Kerry or \nSenator Lieberman or Senator Warner, who care about this bill. This is \na quote from the Center for Naval Analysis. This is very serious. This \nis, Implications for U.S. National Security, commissioned by the \nDepartment of Defense in October 2003. Here we are in 2008, and we have \na long way to go to get this bill done.\n  So I would say in my remaining few minutes that you are going to hear \npeople come to the Senate floor and say: If we do this bill, it is \ngoing to imperil jobs. Well, nothing could be further from the truth.\n  You look at Great Britain, where they have reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions by 15 percent since 1990, and their economy grew 40 percent. \nMr. President, 500,000 new jobs were created.\n  The Apollo Alliance here at home said we are going to see thousands \nand thousands of new jobs created. We have a study of the impacts of \nCalifornia's global warming law: 89,000 new jobs projected. I can tell \nyou right now, we are in a tough time in California because of the \nhousing crisis, OK. A lot of folks being laid off are going to work for \nthe 450 new solar companies that have sprung up in California.\n  If you look at the top manufacturing States for solar, it is Ohio, \nMichigan, California, Tennessee, and Massachusetts. So these jobs are \ngoing all over America.\n  Look at all of labor supporting our bill. It is remarkable: the \nOperating Engineers, the Building and Construction Trades, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. They understand we \nwill be building a new infrastructure for our new energy which is going \nto result in lower energy prices.\n  Our local governments support action--the Conference of Mayors; the \nNational Association of Clean Air Agencies; the Climate Communities, \nwhich is a coalition of cities, towns, counties, and other communities.\n  Not only will we see lower gas prices as a result of this \nlegislation, but we are going to see amazing job growth. It occurred in \nGermany, just as it occurred in Great Britain.\n  Here we see this group that came together to support us saying: \n``Prompt action on climate change is essential to protect America's \neconomy, security, quality of life and natural environment.'' I want to \nreiterate this. You are going to hear predictions of gloom and doom.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 20 more seconds to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You are going to hear predictions of doom and gloom. But \ndo you know what? Either these folks have not read the bill or they are \nreading off talking points that were made to start a political fight. \nWe should come together across party lines. We should pass this bill.\n  I look forward to hearing from the rest of my colleagues.\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask the Presiding Officer, since we do \nnot have anyone to rebut us, is it possible to go to Senator Kerry at \nthis time? Would that be possible? I ask unanimous consent that we go \nto Senator Kerry, since we do not have the other side here. Or, \nactually, I ask unanimous consent to go to Senator Lieberman for 3 \nminutes, followed by Senator Kerry for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, the Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4923]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my \ncolleagues.\n  I rise to build on something that Chairman Boxer just said about the \nnational security implications of the global warming problem.\n  Last week I had the privilege to attend an Asian-Pacific Security \nConference in Singapore, which is called the ``Shangri-la Dialogue.'' \nAt that conference, there were high-ranking defense officials from just \nabout every country in the Asian-Pacific region, large or small. I \nnoticed on the schedule of meetings there was a session on climate \nchange. So this intrigued me because, again, this was a defense group, \nan international security group.\n  I went to the conference, and it was quite something. Our friends in \nthe Asian-Pacific region are deeply concerned about the possible \nconsequences of global warming and anxious that the world unite to \nprotect them and us from the worst of it. A gentleman leader in the \nDefense Department of Singapore said they have begun to negotiate with \nEuropean experts in the construction of dikes, because they think if \nthey can build adequate dikes, they can probably withstand a rising sea \nlevel which they believe will happen--probably will happen, according \nto the best science--of a meter. But if the water rises above a meter, \ntheir leaders have concluded that as much as a third of Singapore could \nbe under water. There was a gentleman there from the Defense Department \nof Bangladesh who said they are beginning to try to make plans for \nconfronting a migration of as many as 5 million people in Bangladesh \nwho will be forced by rising tides to leave their homes--5 million \npeople.\n\n  Now, I say by reference, we don't think about those extraordinary \neffects of global warming, but if seas rise--to say the obvious, the \nUnited States has enormous coastlines and our low-lying areas will be \nsubject to consequences that could be severe to the way of life of the \npeople there. There has been a trend in our country of people moving to \nthe coast, millions and millions and millions. If we don't do something \nabout global warming soon, the life they lead will be severely \ncompromised, and that is what this bill is all about--trying to avoid \nthat.\n  I thank the chairman, Senator Boxer, for stressing that this is not \nonly an environmental protection bill, this is not only an economic \ngrowth bill; this is a national security bill.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank my colleague, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. Let me begin by thanking first Senator \nBoxer for her unbelievable leadership in this effort, as well as \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Warner, all of whom have worked \ndiligently on the Environment and Public Works Committee. As everybody \nknows, there are some shared committee assignments with respect to this \nissue--the Commerce Committee and the Energy Committee--but I think \nthere has been a superb effort of bringing everybody together under one \nroof, and that has largely been because of Senator Boxer's \ndetermination to get us to this point.\n  We are here to debate what is absolutely--and it is interesting. We \nhear it from colleague after colleague on the other side of the aisle. \nThey say: Oh, yes, we have to do a global climate change bill; yes, \nthis is a critical issue. Then they add the caveat: But not this bill, \nnot this time; then not providing a genuine effort or alternative to \nsay this is how it could work.\n  It is also interesting to note there has been a huge shift in America \nwith respect to this issue. Major Fortune 500 companies support the \nfundamental underlying precept of this bill. They haven't necessarily \nall landed on this bill yet, but they support the notion that we put a \nmarket-based mechanism in place whereby the marketplace will decide how \nrapidly and how each individual company will decide to reduce its \nemissions. What is important here is that we are creating a framework--\nand not a new framework. This is not something sort of brought out of \nthe sky untested that is a new theory. We have been doing this since \n1990 when we passed the Clean Air Act and successfully reduced sulfur \ndioxide, the cause of acid rain, and successfully reduced it at about a \nquarter of the cost that most of the naysayers predicted.\n  So I think our colleagues on the other side of the aisle frankly come \nhere with a particular burden of proof. They have been wrong over the \ncourse of 25 or 30 years. They have been wrong when they opposed water \ntreatment facility efforts at the Federal level, when they opposed air \nquality treatment at the Federal level, and each time when we have \nproceeded forward because we had forward-leaning leadership, Republican \nand Democratic alike--it is important to note that the Clean Air Act \nwas reauthorized under President George Herbert Walker Bush, who \nunderstood the importance of moving forward. So we have shown that this \nmechanism, which was created to deal with acid rain, works. It is the \nlaw of our land today. The marketplace is doing it today. Companies are \nparticipating in this today. This is a proven mechanism whereby the \nmarketplace--not the Government--will decide at what rate and who bears \nwhat burden and people are free to choose within an economic benefit \nhow they proceed.\n  What is at stake today is whether Washington and this institution can \nrise above partisanship and break with the old entrenched interests and \nfinally start to come together to solve what is undoubtedly the most \nurgent and profoundly complex challenge we face--how we protect this \nplanet we live on. We have been down this road before. Twenty years ago \nI participated in the first hearings that were ever held in the Senate \nwhich Al Gore--then Senator Gore--chaired, with several other Senators, \nand we looked at this issue of climate change in the Commerce \nCommittee. Ever since then, the story at the Federal level has been one \nof disgraceful denial, delay, back-scratching for specialized \ninterests, and a buck-passing that has brought us perilously close to a \nclimate change catastrophe. We have witnessed a failure of leadership \nin our time, and here on the floor of the Senate this week, at this \nmoment--now--we Senators have the ability to reverse that.\n  Today, all of the scientific evidence--I am not going to say too much \nabout it, but I cannot sort of frame this debate for the next days \nwithout saying something about it--all of the scientific evidence is \ntelling us we can't afford to delay the reckoning with climate change \nany longer. All of the science is already telling us we have waited too \nlong. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric levels \nof carbon dioxide have increased from 280 parts per million to now 380 \nparts per million. Today, we know not as a matter of guesswork--we know \nas a matter of scientific fact, incontrovertible fact--we know the \natmospheric carbon levels are higher than they have been at any time in \nthe past 800,000 years. How do we know it? Because scientists have been \nable to bore down into ice core and measure the carbon dioxide levels \nthat have been preserved in the ice over those years, as well as other \ntime-measuring mechanisms. That accumulation translates into an \nincrease in global temperatures of about .8 degrees centigrade.\n  Now, because this carbon dioxide that we put up into the atmosphere \nhas a life--it continues to live--as nuclear materials have a half life \nof thousands of years, carbon dioxide has a life of anywhere from 80 to \n100 years. So what we have already put into the atmosphere will \ncontinue to do the damage it is already doing, unless somehow, by a \nmiracle of science or a miracle, there is a method discovered in order \nto go backwards. So we are looking at another .7 to .8 degrees of \ntemperature increase that we can't stop. That brings us to about 1.4, \n1.5 degrees of centigrade increase.\n  Why is that figure important? I will tell you why that figure is \nimportant. Because there is a scientific consensus of thousands of \nscientists across the planet that is telling us that as a matter of \npublic policy, to avoid the potential of a tipping point--they can't \ntell us with a certainty that the tipping point is at 1.9 degrees or 2 \ndegrees or 2.3, but they are telling us that their best judgment is \nthat to avoid a tipping point of catastrophe on the planet, we must \nhold the temperature increase of the Earth to 2 degrees centigrade and \nto 450 parts per million of greenhouse gases. So we are looking at now \nbeing at 380, we have a cushion of going to 450; we already know we \nhave\n\n[[Page S4924]]\n\nrisen 100 in the Industrial Revolution, but the Industrial Revolution \ndidn't have China and India and the rest of the world industrializing \nas it is today. So we are staring at the potential of a much greater \ninput of carbon dioxide, much greater input of greenhouse gases unless \nwe take steps now, with the United States leading, in order to lower \nthe levels of emissions and ultimately stabilize them at a level that \nis sustainable in terms of the science of our planet.\n  Two weeks ago I brought several of our country's top climate \nscientists to brief us in advance of this debate. Now, those \nscientists--scientists are by profession conservative people. They have \nto be. If you are going to be accepted as a top scientist, your reports \nare peer reviewed, they are analyzed, they are looked at by others \nin the same field and judged as to their methodology and the \nconclusions they draw. The fact is we have something like 920 peer-\nreviewed reports, all of which say we have to do what we are seeking to \ndo here on the floor now. And there isn't one report--not one peer \nreview--to the contrary. There is not one report that suggests humans \naren't doing what we are doing and that we don't have to stop doing it \nnow or face the potential of catastrophe.\n\n  The fact is these scientists also told us that what they predicted 2 \nyears ago, 3 years ago, 4 years ago is completely eradicated now by the \nrate at which the evidence from Mother Earth herself is coming back. \nEarth is telling us that we are now seeing a degradation at a rate that \nis far greater than those scientists predicted. In fact, the science \nprojected a general decline in the Arctic Ocean in 2001. Well, guess \nwhat. The 2007 IPCC Report sounded significantly more alarm bells, \nsaying:\n\n       Late summer sea ice is projected to disappear almost \n     completely towards the end of the 21st century.\n\n  Less than a year after that report, in January of this year, another \nreport found that a seasonal ice-free--ice-free--Arctic Ocean might be \nrealized as early as 2030. I am told that the scientists who study this \ntopic now believe it could even happen sooner, but that is what they \nare comfortable telling us publicly. Scientists are observing a 30-\npercent increase in the acidity of oceans with a devastating impact on \nocean life, literally destroying the ocean food chain from the bottom \nup. Scientists project that 80 percent of living corals will be lost in \nour lifetime. The impact of the acidity--the acidity, for those who \ndon't follow it, comes from the greenhouse gases. We put them up in the \nair, they travel around the world, they rain, it gets into the clouds, \nrains and comes down into the ocean, or spills as particulates into the \nocean. The result is that acidification reduces the ability of \ncrustaceans in the ocean to form their shells. So starfish, lobsters, \nclams, crabs, coral reefs, all of these things that rely on their \nability to form shell are threatened as a consequence of the increase \nof acidity in the oceans.\n  What is more, scientists know that the oceans act as a storage center \nfor carbon dioxide. In the jargon of global climate change, it is \ncalled a ``sink'' because the carbon dioxide sinks into it and \ndisappears. What we know is the oceans do this. What we don't know is \nwhere is the kickback point in the oceans. When are the oceans full and \nthey start to spit it back out because they can't contain it anymore? \nWell, I tell you what: Sound the alarm bell. Because scientists in \nAntarctica found that that is already happening; that there is a \nregurgitation of carbon dioxide in the Antarctic they didn't anticipate \nand which now sends warning signals about the rest of the oceans.\n  Even the Bush administration's own top scientists last week laid out \na chilling assessment. They said the following: Floods, drought, \npathogens and disease, species and habitat loss, sea level rise, and \nstorm surges that threaten our cities and coastlines are what we are \nlooking at unless we begin to reduce the global greenhouse gases.\n  The effects of climate change are now apparent on every single \ncontinent. It is being witnessed in very tangible and unexpected ways. \nFor instance, if you are a hunter in South Carolina and you like to go \nduck hunting, today the only reason South Carolina has real duck \nhunting to offer is because of farm ducks, not because of the migration \nthat used to take place. It is the same thing in Arkansas, with the \npopulation of the waterfowl that is significantly reduced. The Audubon \nSociety has reported a 100-mile swathe of migration of vegetation, of \ngrowth. In Alaska, we are seeing millions of acres of spruce destroyed \nby beetles that used to die because of the level of the cold, but \nAlaska has warmed more than any other part of the United States, and \nthe result is they now infest those trees. There are consequences that \nnone of us can even properly define or imagine. But prudence dictates \nthat, knowing this is the course we are on, we need to do something \nabout it. We need to do something about it now.\n  The instability of the permafrost, increasing avalanches in mountain \nregions, and warmer and dryer conditions in the Sahelian region of \nAfrica are leading to a shortening of growth seasons. Yesterday, there \nwas a huge meeting of the U.N. to discuss food shortages taking place \nin various parts of the world. Up to 30 percent of plant and animal \nspecies are projected to face extinction if the increase in global \ntemperature exceeds 1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius.\n  The impacts are not limited to species and ecosystems. Last week, the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture released a new study projecting that the \nrise of concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere will \nsignificantly disrupt water supplies, agriculture, forestry, and \necosystems in the United States for decades to come. By midcentury, \nanticipated waterflows in much of the West is going to decline by an \naverage of 20 percent. Already in the West--to listen to our Senators \nfrom the West talk about the drought and the problems they have of \nlakes that are now drying up--all these are concerns we need to address \nhere.\n  The same report says that, by 2060, forest fires and the seasonal \nseverity rating in the Southeast is projected to increase from 10 to 30 \npercent and 10 to 20 percent in the Northeast. The impact on \ninfrastructure will be severe. In March, the U.S. Department of \nTransportation found that the projected sea level rise in the gulf \ncoast would put substantial portions of the region's transportation \ninfrastructure at risk. Storm surges in the gulf coast will flood more \nthan half the area's major highways, almost half the rail miles, 29 \nairports, and virtually all ports.\n  The question before the Senate now is, How do we turn this prediction \nof danger into opportunity? And it is opportunity. I don't think to \nanybody it is ``pie in the sky'' when they think about the \npossibilities of what we can do for our health as a nation, for our \nenvironment, for our obligation to future generations, for our \nsecurity, for our energy policy, and for the price of gasoline. All \nthese things can be driven in the right direction if we make the right \nchoices in the Senate in this next week.\n  The fact is the Climate Security Act that Senators Boxer, Lieberman, \nWarner, myself, and others bring to the floor is a bill that puts us on \nthe right path. No one agrees with every compromise that is made in \nthis bill. We all understand that. We all agree on the importance of \naction, though. We all agree on the importance of getting something \ndone now.\n  This is a strong and flexible piece of legislation. It will reduce \nthe emissions, the gases, the carbon dioxide that creates global \nwarming by 19 percent by 2020 and 71 percent by 2050. That will lead to \nan overall reduction that meets targets well within the range of the \nreduction that scientists tell us is necessary to avoid catastrophic \nimpact on climate change.\n  In the next days, I hope we can work with our colleagues. If you have \nan objection to the bill and you have a better way of coming about it, \nthat is what we are looking for. That is legislating in the best \ntradition of this institution. What we don't want to do is have people \ncome to the floor and say this is the most important issue, we have a \nbetter way of doing it, but the better way never appears. It is never \nframed in an appropriate amendment that seeks to do other than kill the \nbill. We have the ability to be able to frame this in a responsible \nway.\n  I have concerns and others have concerns that the cost-containment \nauction, when coupled with the borrowing and offset provisions--I wish \nto make\n\n[[Page S4925]]\n\nsure it has the potential to lower the target in the early years of the \nprogram. I don't want to see us avoid responsibility for years to come. \nSo I hope to work with the bill's authors, and maybe we can develop a \nmechanism to make sure we maintain the short-term targets as directed \nby the scientists, while at the same time providing adequate cost \ncertainty. But the overall structure of this bill provides important \nincentives to create a clean energy economy in our country. It directs \nauction proceeds--and this is important to understand. This is not a \nbill that goes out and taxes Americans and says you have to pump a \nwhole bunch of money into the Federal budget so the Government can do \nsomething. That is not what happens here. This bill creates a \nmarketable unit of reduction of carbon dioxide. By providing that, \npeople will be able to buy and trade in those units. The money that \ncomes from that purchase and trading is money that is then directed to \nhelp States make the transition, to help soften the transition for \ncompanies, to help provide the technology and the research and \ndevelopment that speeds us down the road to the creation of alternative \nand renewable fuels.\n  There are only three ways to deal with global climate change. One is \nto move to alternative and renewable fuels. Two is to come up with a \nway of having clean coal technology quickly. Three, it is through \nenergy efficiency mechanisms.\n  The United States is literally the worst of all participating nations \nat this point, in terms of energy efficiencies. You can travel to \nEurope or to Asia and go up to an escalator and it is not working and \nyou think you have to call somebody to fix it, but when you get near \nit, the escalator starts to move. When you get off and nobody else is \ncoming, it stops. That is energy efficiency. We don't do that. Ours \nturn 24 hours a day, no matter whether people are there--unless they \nare turned off. It is the same thing with lights. When you walk out of \na hotel room in some other places and it is dark and you shut your \ndoor, the lights go on. As you walk down the hallway, lights go on in \nfront of you and off in back of you. When you get onto the elevator, \nthe lights go out. We don't do that. There are countless efficiencies \nwe can put into buildings, fleets, automobiles, and into the use of \nenergy. The McKinsey report--that company is a well-respected profit-\nmaking company in America--tells us that we can get anywhere from 40 \npercent to 75 percent of all of the savings we need in order to deal \nwith this crisis just from energy efficiency.\n\n  What are people waiting for? If we moved down that road, we would be \ndoing better than by doing nothing. This bill provides very important \nincentives to capture and seek restoration of carbon itself. It targets \n$14 billion to expedite the near-term development of these facilities. \nIt focuses on the need to support communities here and abroad, in order \nto adapt to the problems of climate change.\n  I wish to highlight the fact that $68 billion in this bill is devoted \nto reducing emissions from deforestation. A lot of people don't realize \nthat cutting down forests is one of the biggest contributions to carbon \ndioxide. Deforestation and forest degradation is an enormous \ncontributor that we have to turn around. Many of us wish the number was \nmore, but we think it is enough to be able to get moving and start down \nthat road and have an impact.\n  My colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee hope to address this \nissue in greater depth because deforestation accounts for 20 to 25 \npercent of global emissions. We need to help other countries move in \nthe right direction.\n  When you look beyond the details of the allocation formulas and the \noffset verification procedures, this bill sends a critical message to \nour economy. I have spent a lot of time, as have the chairman and \nSenator Lieberman, meeting with businesses across the country. I have \ntalked to the Business Roundtable. I have met with the U.S. Climate \nAction Partnership companies. These are Fortune 500 companies, such as \nDow Chemical, DuPont, British Petroleum, American Electric Power, and \nFlorida Power and Light. While they don't all agree with every piece of \nthis bill yet, they all agree they want the Congress to pass a program \nwhere we are helping the marketplace to solve this problem by creating \na system where you trade these units of carbon dioxide reductions and \nwhere you have a cap on the total level of emissions in order to push \npeople to go out and adopt this program.\n  What this program does is provide certainty to the marketplace. If \nyou talk to those on Wall Street today, they will tell you what they \nwant is certainty. They want to know what is the pricing of carbon. \nThis allows the marketplace to adjust and set the price of carbon. It \nallows the marketplace to come up with the mechanisms and indeed drives \na lot of venture capital money into the efforts to create the \nalternative renewable fuels that are the better long-term economic \nresponses to global climate change and to the imperatives to reduce \nemissions.\n  In addition, let me say my colleagues, with all due respect, have \ncontinually overestimated and overstated what the costs of doing this \nwould be. I wish to refer back to the acid rain debate. I was part of \nthose negotiations. I remember sitting in a room off the Senate floor \nwith former Senator George Mitchell, Bill Reilly, John Sununu, and \nothers, and we negotiated. The very people who today stand up and say \ndon't do this, it is going to cost too much, are the same people who, \nin 1990, said don't do it, it will cost too much. They came in with \nindustry-driven figures. The industry-driven figures said it is going \nto cost $8 billion and will take 8 years, and you are going to bankrupt \nAmerica. To the credit of George Herbert Walker Bush, he didn't buy \ninto those figures; he accepted the figures of the environmental \ncommunity, which came in and said it is not going to cost $8 billion; \nit will be about $4 billion and it will take about 4 years. To the \ncredit of President Bush, we did it. They were all wrong because it \ncost $2 billion or so and took about 2\\1/2\\ years. It was 25 percent of \nthe cost that was predicted. Why? Because nobody is able to predict \nwhat happens went the United States of America sets a national goal and \nwe start to target our technology and innovation and move in a certain \ndirection.\n  What I am hearing from our venture capitalists and scientists is they \nare already moving in that direction. They are already exploring \nunbelievable alternative fuels. If this passes, we will create much \nmore incentive and energy behind that race to find those alternatives. \nI predict there will be two or three ``Google'' equivalents created in \nthe energy field in the next 10 to 15 years if we pass this bill and \nstart moving in this direction.\n  There are plenty of economists out there to document what I said. \nNicholas Stern, former chief economist at the World Bank, said the \ninvestment of 1 percent of GDP can stave off a 5- to 20-percent loss of \nGDP. So when colleagues say to us don't do this because it is going to \ncost too much, they don't ever tell you it is going to cost more not to \ndo it. It is going to cost us much more not to do it. Every year we \ndelay and wait, we drive up the curve of what we have to grab back to \nreduce in order to meet the target goals. So, in effect, delaying will \nmake it more dangerous, as well as more expensive, because you are \ngoing to have to grab back more and faster in order to make up the \ndifference. Frank Ackerman at Tufts recently updated the Stern model. \nHe found that four global warming impacts alone--hurricane damage, real \nestate losses, energy costs, and water costs--will come with a price \ntag of 1.8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, or almost $1.9 \ntrillion annually, by the end of the century. Bill Nordhaus, at Yale \nUniversity, and Robert Samuelson, of the Washington Post, might take \nissue with some of Stern's methods, but the larger point is there; that \nthose are huge figures, much bigger figures, being quoted on the \ndownside of not doing anything rather than the cost of doing something.\n  In the end, addressing global climate change is going to be good for \nAmerican business, and those businesses that are supporting it \nunderstand it is going to be good for American business. We can \nactually market our technologies. We can get involved in technology \ntransfer with other countries. We can rejoin the global community in an \neffort to act responsibly. Once we put a cap on carbon, we can expect \nan explosion of new technologies which will take advantage of that new \nmarket.\n\n[[Page S4926]]\n\n  The fact is, I think that is one of the most exciting things I have \nrun into. I met recently in Massachusetts with 45 Massachusetts green \nenergy companies. We have companies that are taking construction waste \nright now and they are turning construction waste into clean fuels and \nselling electricity. That could spell the end of dumpsites as we have \nknown them in America, of landfills if we take that product and turn it \ninto energy that is clean.\n  We have a battery manufacturer in Watertown, MA. That battery is \npowering a car for the distance of 40 miles of travel. The length of \nthe average American commute is 40 miles. So if we were to push these \nbatteries out in the marketplace, the average commuter in America could \ngo through the entire day barely touching a drop of gasoline. People \ntoday who cannot fill up their tank completely because their credit \ncard shuts off would all of a sudden be filling it up once a month or \nmore. That is the future of America.\n  The price of fuel is going to go down because, in fact, this bill \nlowers our imports by almost 8 million barrels a day. If we do that, it \nis inevitable that we will be paying less money and lowering the price \nof gasoline. The fact is, to not do it is to see a continued increase \nat a rate the American people cannot afford.\n  I mentioned this in the caucus earlier today. I met a week ago with \nDr. Craig Venter, who is the person in the private sector who did the \nmapping of the human genome. They are taking the knowledge they now \nhave from the mapping of the genome and are using that to apply it in \nbiology, to synthetic biology where, through certain microbio processes \nas well as through photosynthesis, they are now taking carbon dioxide \nand using it as a feedstock for the creation of new fuel. If that \nworks, that is just a total game changer--a total game changer--if we \ncan actually take carbon dioxide, which is the biggest problem we face \nwith respect to global climate change, and turn it into something that \nis positive in a fuel alternative.\n  There is more to say on this issue. There will be more to say in the \nnext days. I look forward to this debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in 2006, the renewable sector of energy in \nAmerica generated 8.5 million new jobs, nearly $970 billion in revenue, \nover $100 billion in industry profits, and more than $150 billion in \nincreased tax revenues at all levels of government.\n  One study found that with a serious commitment to an aggressive clean \nenergy strategy, we could create 40 million jobs and $4.5 trillion in \nrevenue by the year 2030, which is not even the end of the period this \nbill seeks to address in terms of reductions. We can create millions of \njobs at every single level of our economy. We can create jobs for \nscientists, jobs for professors, jobs for people in the software and \ncomputerware business, jobs that come all the way down the food chain \nin terms of every aspect of American life and particularly in the \ninfrastructure and construction industries where we would be building \nthe new plants and new facilities and the new delivery systems for all \nof this technology.\n  This is the future. This is the future we can see because we have \nbeen there before. The United States has transitioned in fuels before. \nWe used to do everything by burning wood, and then after we burned all \nthe wood around our cities and learned we could not do it anymore, we \ndiscovered oil. We used to use whale oil from Nantucket, MA, and lit \nmost of the streets in New England. Then we moved to a mix of items, \nincluding hydro, coal, even nuclear ultimately.\n  We are in that next transition now. I remind my colleagues that one \nof the sheiks who helped organize the oil cartel years ago said the \nstone age did not end because we ran out of stones, and the oil age \nwill not end because we have run out of oil. The oil age will end \nbecause global climate change and global warming are sending us a \nmessage about what is happening to this planet.\n  We have a God-given responsibility. You can read Genesis or Isaiah or \nany of the other parts of the prophets, and there are enough references \nto our responsibilities as individual human beings to be the guardians \nof the Earth, to protect this creation. That is why many Evangelicals \nand others are supporting this bill, because they understand that \nresponsibility. Anybody here, whether they are religious or not, ought \nto understand the fundamental responsibility we have not to see 30 \npercent of the species wiped out and whatever possibilities of disease \ncures with any one of those species as yet undefined and untested.\n  This is the greatest challenge we are to face. We are staring in the \nface of opportunities where the United States has the ability to \nstrengthen our economy, provide more jobs, save fuel, provide \nalternatives for people, reduce the cost of day-to-day life, and, in \nthe end, live up to our responsibilities as legislators.\n  I remind my colleagues of what President Kennedy once said of the \nrace to the Moon when he challenged America to go there. There were a \nlot of doubters and a lot of people who thought it was a pipe dream. \nPresident Kennedy himself was not absolutely certain, did not know for \nsure we could do it, but he believed in America. He said this is a \nchallenge we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, \nand one which we intend to win. And he said we have to do it not \nbecause it is easy but because it is hard. That is the kind of spirit \nthis Congress and this Senate ought to show now. This issue is a lot \neasier, frankly, than going to the Moon, and the United States has \nproven we can do the former. Now we need to do what we can to reduce \nthe emissions that create global warming and threaten all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, in dealing with climate change, there \nare certain principles I always apply in assessing the approach to this \nissue. One is that our Nation will continue to need and depend on \nfossil fuels. Fossil fuels must be a part of any effort to achieve a \ncleaner energy future. There is no way we can get there without them. \nNo. 2 is a strong American economy, one that creates jobs, that creates \nnew technologies. That is critical to developing the tools we need to \ncapture and sequester carbon. China and India will not address carbon \nemissions until such technologies are developed. And No. 3, we cannot \nafford to hurt the very regions, the very industries, and the very \nworkers who will provide that technology through hard work and \ninnovation.\n  In terms of economic impact, I have serious concerns with the \nLieberman-Warner approach as currently written. According to a recent \nstudy done by the National Association of Manufacturers, the negative \neconomic impact to the Rocky Mountain West and to my home State of \nWyoming is very real and significant. The impact is perhaps the \ngreatest in terms of high gasoline prices for folks all across the \nRocky Mountain West. Gasoline prices for western families will increase \nsignificantly under this bill.\n  Every day, folks in the Rocky Mountain region are going to have to \ndrive long distances. They do it to get to work. They do it to shop for \nfood. They do it to go to school. The distances, in many places, are \nmuch greater than they are in other parts of the country. My home State \nof Wyoming ranks at the top of the list of all the States in terms \nof vehicle miles traveled on a per capita basis. I drive these roads \nevery weekend visiting folks in Gillette, Riverton, Cheyenne, and \nCasper. They are hours apart. Westerners are rightfully upset about how \nmuch they are paying at the pump. I am sure my colleagues' constituents \nare too. Letters come in every day from all across Wyoming asking when \nWashington is going to help them. Yet we hear in testimony from the \nEnergy Information Agency that gas prices under this bill could go up \nanywhere from 40 cents to $1 a gallon. Others are predicting it could \ngo up even higher than that. Whichever estimate you choose, whichever \none you choose to look at, gas prices are going to go up under this \nbill.\n\n  Why will it be even worse in the Rocky Mountain States? Partly \nbecause the West and Rocky Mountain West rely on small refiners for \ntheir fuel. It is not uncommon in the Rocky Mountain West to have the \nlocal gasoline station in these small towns be\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\njust across the road from the small refiner. Towns depend on these \nrefiners for their fuel. They provide the fuel for the families of the \nWest. Without the small refiners, Wyoming and the Rocky Mountain West \nwould have to ship our gasoline in from out of State.\n  The small refiners do not fair very well under this bill. They have \nto compete with the large refineries for a small portion of the \nallowances. Without additional help, they will go under and an entire \nregion of the country will pay even more significant increases in the \nprice of their fuel.\n  Some may try to lump small refiners in with the big oil companies \nthat actually produce the oil. The small refiners have to buy their oil \nfrom that oil producer. These small refiners are paying $125 to $130 a \nbarrel for oil, and it is having a devastating impact on them. Some \nhave suggested that they simply pass along the cost to the consumer. \nTell that to the folks in the West who are already being punished at \nthe pump.\n  This part of it is not a partisan issue at all. I plan to offer an \namendment I am working on with Members of both sides of the aisle----\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I will yield, if I may, at the end of the presentation.\n  I want to work with others to offer this amendment because this \naffects everyone in the Rocky Mountain West.\n  Gas prices have reached the point where people are simply driving \nless. Family vacations and school field trips are being canceled. \nPeople are working 4 days a week but longer hours each day. Why? \nBecause of the high cost of fuel.\n  Some may say: Great, we want people to drive less. Some may say: Hey, \nhave your constituents take alternative transportation, public \ntransportation, such as the subway or bus. As many of you know, we in \nthe West have spectacular, majestic rural areas that many of you enjoy \non your vacations. We ask you to come and visit our national parks, our \nmany State forests and monuments. But these majestic natural places \ncome with a cost: there is no subway.\n  High gasoline prices are just one of the many major negative economic \nimpacts to the West under this bill. Job loss is another major factor. \nThe National Manufacturers Association study projects that Wyoming \nwould lose between 2,000 and 3,000 jobs by 2020 and double that by \n2030. Montana would lose between 4,000 and 6,000 jobs in 2020, double \nthat by 2030. Utah would lose 10,000 to 15,000 jobs in 2020, double \nthat by 2030. The numbers in the West go on and on. What kinds of jobs \nwill be lost? Jobs in the energy sector, jobs that pay well, jobs with \npensions, jobs with health insurance--the kinds of jobs we should be \nprotecting in this country.\n  Westerners are being told by the supporters of this bill: Don't \nworry, green-collar jobs will replace the jobs lost in the West. Where \nis that written? What guarantee can you point to in this bill that a \nfamily in Gillette or Laramie or Riverton or Cheyenne is going to get a \ngreen-collar job? And what is a green-collar job? Will they get the job \nthe minute they lose the one they have now? How long will they have to \nwait? Will they have to uproot their family and move to find work? \nWhere is it written in this bill that the pay and the benefits of the \nso-called green-collar job will be equal to the job the bill takes \naway? The reality is it is not written anywhere.\n\n  In terms of energy costs, the situation is not very good for the \nRocky Mountain States. Wyoming is among the top five States in what are \ncalled heating degree days. That is a measure of what it takes to heat \na home all throughout the year. If you have been through a Wyoming \nwinter, you would understand why. The most vulnerable people in my \nState, the seniors, people on fixed incomes, cannot afford to have \ntheir energy bills increased.\n  Why are we asking people all across the country to pay more of their \nhard-earned dollars on high gas prices and energy prices in this bill? \nI frankly cannot answer that, except to say, That is Washington for \nyou.\n  But it gets worse for Wyoming. According to a National Association of \nManufacturers' study, Wyoming coal would face a severe decline. That \ntoo would result in lost jobs, broken family budgets, and displacement. \nAs I have said, fossil fuels, including coal, are vital to our energy \nsecurity. We need to make them cleaner because they will remain a vital \npart of America's energy mix. Clean coal technology is still a work in \nprogress. It will take time to perfect. The men and the women of \nWyoming who are the backbone of the coal industry are essential to \nproviding clean coal technology to America.\n  America simply cannot tolerate the lost jobs and the high energy \nprices that will come from dramatic decreases in coal production under \nLieberman-Warner. As I stated in the beginning, we need to have a \nstrong economy. We need an economy that creates jobs and fosters \ninnovation. That is how to provide the clean energy technologies we \nneed.\n  It is not only the Rocky Mountain West that is going to be hard hit \nby this legislation. The Energy Information Agency testified before the \nMemorial Day recess in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee that the larger price impacts occur from Lieberman-Warner in \nthose regions of the country that are most reliant on coal. So that is \nalso the South. It is also the Midwest. That is rural America.\n  The median income in Wyoming is $46,000 a year. Wyoming family \nbudgets are predicted to lose between $1,000 and $3,000 a year in \nincome over the next 13 years and double that by 2030 under this bill. \nMany families in Wyoming would have to dedicate $1 out of $5 from their \nfamily budget for energy costs under this bill. This is what rural \nAmerica can expect under this bill. Sadly, it appears the impacts of \nthe bill hit lower income families the hardest. It doesn't have to be \nthis way. I truly believe we can address climate change. There are \nbetter ways and more economically friendly approaches, and those ways \nthat can make a real difference.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced legislation to address climate \nchange. I believe overlooked in the debate are greenhouse gases that \nare currently in the atmosphere--the gases that are currently \ncontributing to the warming of the planet. The best science tells us it \nis a factor. To what extent, we are not sure. It would seem to me a \nworthy approach to find a way to remove existing greenhouse gases from \nthe atmosphere and permanently sequester them. This is the other end of \nthe problem. Now, to accomplish this, we are going to need to invest \nthe money to develop the technology. The approach my legislation takes \nis to address this through a series of financial prizes, where we set \ntechnological goals and outcomes. The first to meet each criteria would \nreceive Federal funds and international acclaim. The prizes would be \ndetermined by a Federal commission under the Department of Energy. The \ncommission would be comprised of climate scientists, physicists, \nchemists, engineers, business managers, and economists. They would be \nappointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate. \nThe awards would go to those, both public and private, who achieve \nmilestones in developing and applying technology, technology that could \nsignificantly help to slow or to reverse the accumulation of greenhouse \ngases in the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases would have to be \npermanently sequestered, and sequestered in a manner that would be \nwithout significant harmful effects.\n  I believe this approach is only one example of how we can tackle the \nproblem of climate change in an economically acceptable way without \nsacrificing real progress. I hope as we begin this debate on this \nissue, more Members of this body embrace approaches that address \nclimate change while protecting jobs, family budgets, and the \nindustries we count on today.\n  I have repeatedly asked questions during the hearings in both the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee on this bill about what the impact will be on my \nhome State. To date, I have not been able to get a straight answer. I \nam relying on the State-specific numbers that we have available. If you \ndon't like the National Association of Manufacturers' numbers, then try \nthe Heritage Foundation. The Heritage Foundation is predicting major \njob losses in the Rocky Mountain West. The study says\n\n[[Page S4928]]\n\nWyoming will lose 1,100 jobs by 2025, and Utah will lose over 5,000 by \nthat same year, with Montana losing 1,800. Most of those will be \nmanufacturing jobs. And those are the numbers that predict job losses \neven if everything in the bill goes according to plan, including full \nimplementation of clean coal technology.\n  It is important to note that gas prices nationally will go up 25 \npercent under Lieberman-Warner, according to the Heritage Foundation. \nAnother source, the Energy Information Agency, testified at the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and said gas prices would go up 40 \ncents to $1.\n  As Americans, we have always looked within ourselves for solutions. \nWe have always had confidence in American ingenuity and American \ncreativity to deal with the challenges of the future. Yes, we want to \nprotect our environment; and, yes, we want a strong economy. It just so \nhappens that the one does rely on the other.\n  It has been said that the environmental movement in the United States \nwas born out of America's prosperity. Americans who had benefited from \npost-World War II prosperity began to become more concerned with clean \nair, with clean water, and with land management. Since then, a \nprosperous America has also been an environmentally conscious America. \nNothing could be more true in terms of addressing climate change. Let's \nkeep our economy strong, let's use our untapped human potential and \nAmerican spirit to develop the technological solutions we need.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, does the Senator still have time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand we have 5 minutes; is that correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Why don't you take 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask the Senator, first, is he aware that the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers' report allows for zero technological \nadvances; that it has no technological advances taken into account \nwhatsoever? Does the Senator believe, in fact, the United States is not \ngoing to make any technological advances in the days ahead?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, every study--every study--points to lost \njobs and higher energy prices, higher gasoline prices, whether it is \nthe Heritage Association or the National Association of Manufacturers. \nI have looked at study after study after study. I have read the books \nand visited with experts around the country and around the world, and \neverything I am seeing and reading takes me in that direction, and that \nis that gas prices will be going up and jobs will be lost.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, again, it is not true that every study says \nthat. In fact, the EPA study itself comes out with about a .04 change \nin GDP at a time when the GDP is going up 97 percent according to our \nown administration. So it is simply not accurate to say that every \nreport says that.\n  Secondly, I wish to know on what scientific study the Senator bases \nthe notion that we are going to get the carbon dioxide out of the \natmosphere in time to be able to deal with the predictions of what is \nhappening, which require us to move immediately to deal with emissions. \nCould the Senator tell us what scientific report says we can get it out \nin time to meet this challenge? And does the IPCC, the 2,000 scientists \nwho have been working on this for years now, suggest that is an \nalternative?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, that is why I introduced the GEAR Act \nearlier this year and gave a speech from this Chamber at this desk \ntalking about giving the same kind of prizes that allowed people 500 \nyears ago to understand longitude so ships could sail the seas; the \nsame kind of prizes Charles Lindbergh was searching for when he flew \nacross the ocean. It is those kinds of prizes and incentives that say, \nLet's get our best minds working on this. I don't know what the \ntimetable is. I have talked to the scientists, and I say, Let's put in \nincentives, and that is why I brought that bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. The answer is, there is no study. The answer is, there is \nno serious scientist who is suggesting we can meet the needs of global \nclimate change and conduct some long-term analysis of whether we can \nget it back out of the atmosphere. It doesn't exist. It is nonexistent.\n  Secondly, the analysis used by the National Association of \nManufacturers has a skewed oil price which completely cooks these \nnumbers; and it is a report which has no allowance whatsoever for any \ntechnological advancement. That is not representative of the United \nStates of America when we talk about the technologies I talked about. \nMoreover, they are the same people who came in in 1990 with those crazy \npredictions of what it was going to cost us to do the other.\n  I think the people who relied on people who were wrong years ago have \na bigger burden of proof to come to the floor now and show us they have \na study that actually makes sense.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was hopeful to have 5 minutes, and I \nknow Senator Inhofe is going to take a lot of time to rebut, so I ask \nunanimous consent to take 5 minutes now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have to say it is amazing to me how a \nSenator from a place that is almost ground zero on global warming could \nstand up here and be so negative, very unlike his Governor.\n  I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record the testimony of the \nHon. David D. Freudenthal, Governor of the State of Wyoming, before the \nHouse Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Testimony of the Honorable David D. Freudenthal, Governor, State of \n Wyoming, Before the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and \n                             Global Warming\n\n\n                               Greetings\n\n       Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of the Select Committee \n     thank you for the opportunity to appear before you and \n     comment on the future of coal under carbon cap and trade. \n     This is really a discussion on carbon management, more \n     particularly carbon capture and sequestration, which \n     inevitably leads to a discussion of the role of coal in \n     fueling the American and international economy.\n\n\n                           Wyoming in Context\n\n       Please allow me to place my comments in the factual context \n     of Wyoming as a state committed to both energy production and \n     environmental protection. I find people in Congress are most \n     familiar with our two national parks--Yellowstone and Grand \n     Teton--and our role as the leading coal producing state in \n     the nation with production of 446 million tons of low sulfur \n     coal in 2006.\n       What is generally not as well known are the other forms of \n     energy Wyoming produces. Depending on the day of the week and \n     the mood of our friends in Oklahoma, we are either the second \n     or third largest natural gas producing state in the country \n     with annual production a bit over two trillion cubic feet or \n     about 10% of the domestic supply. Wyoming has for several \n     years been the largest producer of uranium in the country \n     with approximately 2 million pounds a year of yellowcake \n     (uranium concentrate) produced. We currently rank in the top \n     quartile of states in wind generation, and have an estimated \n     8,000 megawatts of developable wind when the transmission \n     constraint is released. Two projects have been announced \n     recently which will add approximately 200 megawatts of \n     capacity and at least 10 wind power projects are in various \n     stages of review and development with state regulatory \n     agencies. We produce about 53 million barrels of oil annually \n     placing Wyoming in 7th place among the states.\n       Put another way on a net BTU exporting basis, subtracting \n     state consumption from state production, Wyoming is by far \n     the largest energy exporting state in the nation providing \n     about 10 quadrillion BTUs or roughly 10% of the country's \n     energy supply. [See attached graphic]\n\n\n                            Coal in Context\n\n       My purpose today is not to argue, but to recognize some \n     fundamental realities.\n       Like it or not, coal is going to be used in America and the \n     world for some time to come. Even without any new coal fired \n     plants there are 1,522 existing generating plants consuming \n     over one billion tons of coal per year. Over the next twenty \n     years, new and replacement generating capacity is forecast at \n     292 gigawatts, the equivalent of 25 coal-fired power plants \n     each year. While conservation and efficiency programs are \n     forecast to make a real dent in the rate of growth of \n     electricity consumption, we are going to need every form of \n     energy we can harness including clean coal, natural gas and \n     renewable resources. Non-hydro renewable resources of wind, \n     solar and geothermal meet less than 1% of our energy needs \n     today. Fossil fuel sources provide over 80%. For the\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\n     foreseeable future, carbon based resources are a necessity if \n     we want to keep the lights on. Hence, any serious carbon \n     management effort must include aggressive support for carbon \n     capture and sequestration.\n\n\n                               Who Pays?\n\n       Without question, long term carbon management is going to \n     cost a lot of money. Private and public sector investment \n     will be redirected and those costs will ultimately fall to \n     taxpayers and consumers. Carbon capture and sequestration \n     will also consume significant energy in the capture \n     processes, compression and transportation which of course \n     will add to operating costs. It would seem an appropriate \n     policy goal then to pick those processes most likely to yield \n     the greatest effectiveness at least cost to the consumer/\n     taxpayer.\n       Consumer energy costs are not a trivial matter in my state. \n     A recent analysis we completed suggests that the lowest \n     income quartile, those households earning less than $25,000 \n     per year pay about 16% of their income for energy. Those in \n     the highest quartile pay on average 2-3% of their income for \n     energy. So those that can least afford it. pay 7 to 8 times \n     as much a portion of their income for energy as most of us in \n     this hearing room. Imagine what happens if the cost of energy \n     rises 15, 20 or 25 percent and that differential begins to \n     rise exponentially. In my small state that would affect over \n     51,000 households or 25% of my constituents. That means \n     nearly 130,000 people are going to have to make very hard \n     choices about how they spend scarce dollars. As policy makers \n     we cannot ignore this issue in our search for solutions.\n\n\n                           No Silver Bullets\n\n       It is clear the public attitude is changing with respect to \n     greenhouse gas management and as proof you need look no \n     further than the ads surrounding the Sunday morning talk \n     shows. Company advertising now talks about how green they \n     are, not how efficient they are, or how much growth they \n     enjoy. Other advertisements publicly shame firms which make \n     money off of projects or companies which do not meet the \n     ``green'' test. And much of the public conversation is about \n     increased consumption of natural gas in lieu of coal.\n       But even the current shift to natural gas is not without \n     carbon implications. Burning natural gas has fewer \n     CO2 emissions per unit of electricity produced but \n     still has carbon emissions and if one considers the upstream \n     footprint of exploration and production natural gas is an \n     answer, but not a perfect answer. For example, in my state, \n     natural gas processing plants emitted 6.9 million metric tons \n     of CO2 equivalent in 2005, representing nearly 25% \n     of our net carbon footprint. One of the two largest plants \n     operated by ExxonMobil has a large well field and plant that \n     produces natural gas, helium and CO2 for the \n     enhanced oil recovery industry. However much of the \n     CO2 is currently vented to the atmosphere. In \n     fact, for every million cubic feet of natural gas produced, \n     nearly two million cubic feet of CO2 is produced \n     and a majority of it is vented to the atmosphere. My friends \n     in California where much of the natural gas ends up don't \n     always take this into account when they do their carbon \n     footprint analysis.\n\n\n                           State Perspective\n\n       We believe the state has a role in managing greenhouse \n     gases and to that end we have begun to construct the legal \n     framework to do so. However, even the simple question of who \n     has the right to sequester CO2 under state law is \n     amazingly complicated. Does that right belong to the surface \n     owner or to the owner of the mineral estate? How do we take \n     into account the vast federal ownership of both the surface \n     and mineral estate?\n       From the point of view of a Governor, the absence of a well \n     thought out, cogent federal policy that maps the pathway \n     forward makes the task of setting workable rules, regulations \n     and operating practices that much more difficult. This is \n     equally true for the private sector. Until someone monetizes \n     CO2 through performance standards with offsets, \n     cap and trade or some variation of these schemes the \n     marketplace is wandering in the desert. The level and pace of \n     technology development will be set largely by the scheme you \n     adopt as the price of carbon, the timeline for implementation \n     and off ramps such as safety valves anchor the assumptions \n     behind any economic investment. With these variables in mind, \n     the structure needs to be set sufficient to promote large \n     scale demonstration projects sufficient to resolve the \n     outstanding questions in a rational but aggressive manner.\n       We meet with folks who are absolutely serious about \n     developing new plants to supply energy and they assume they \n     will live in a carbon constrained world. They fully \n     anticipate sequestration of C02 or the necessity \n     of some other mechanism to manage greenhouse gases. Most are \n     not shy about their dislike of taxes or escalating costs, but \n     uncertainty about future carbon rules absolutely overwhelms \n     every discussion. It appears to me that a number of these \n     investments will never come to fruition until the other shoe \n     drops and the boundary conditions are established for the \n     risk with respect to carbon management.\n       In a minute I will list some specific actions I think make \n     sense, but first I want to make an observation as a predicate \n     to those recommendations. It is the simple notion that when \n     it comes to carbon management, it is difficult but necessary \n     to admit what we don't know. Because in the absence of full \n     knowledge we tend toward absolutist positions like ``only \n     wind'', ``no nukes'', ``only biomass'' or ``no coal''. I am \n     not sure the federal government knows how we should construct \n     the greenhouse gas management regime and I am not sure \n     industry knows either.\n       If you will grant me this observation for a moment, it \n     seems a prudent course would be to pick those activities we \n     believe must be undertaken no matter what path ultimately \n     proves to be the correct one. For example, we know we need \n     studies and demonstrations putting C02 in the \n     ground in quantity to determine the physical facts i.e. \n     measuring, monitoring and verifying sequestration data in the \n     real world. We favor an array of these demonstrations as \n     proposed by the Department of Energy carbon sequestration \n     partnerships as a sensible approach given different \n     conditions across the country.\n       Additionally, we know there are differences between \n     enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and carbon sequestration which \n     may or may not overlap. Monetizing a C02 stream \n     for the purposes EOR may mitigate the cost impact on \n     consumers in the early years of a carbon policy. This needs \n     to be studied with some degree of granularity.\n       Staying with the theme of moving from the abstract to real \n     world data, I believe we need to accelerate those programs \n     that lead quickly to economically viable, commercial scale \n     electric generation plants. This would include both super \n     critical pulverized coal plants with significant carbon \n     capture and sequestration as well as integrated gasification \n     combined cycle (IGCC) plants with carbon capture and \n     sequestration. My observation is that substantial federal \n     underwriting to hasten this process is required to assist \n     those companies willing to pursue these types of plants. \n     Short of constructing and operating these plants and learning \n     the lessons required to engineer follow on plants, we will be \n     confined to the laboratory bench and speculation.\n       While I have heard and seen a number of presentations I am \n     not sure there is definitive information on available \n     technologies and the quantitative analysis surrounding \n     commercial deployment of carbon sequestration. Academics and \n     companies have their plausible estimates but I have yet to \n     see money changing hands in a commercial transaction. In fact \n     the discussion with the individuals charged with financing \n     these projects, quickly becomes an exercise working through a \n     list of the uncertainties. On that list are not only \n     questions about the technologies involved with carbon \n     management but the impact of the hyper-inflation in material, \n     manpower and construction costs. Simple questions such as \n     whether CO2 capture and sequestration costs \n     (capital and operating) will be recoverable as part of a \n     utility's rate base has yet to be answered.\n       With respect to the federal-state interface and their \n     respective roles in this enormous undertaking, we favor a \n     model of federal standards and state implementation. The \n     Clean Air Act is an example of how this might work. One \n     important difference however between that process and our \n     current situation is the state of development of the \n     technology enabling implementation. Hence another threshold \n     activity would seem to be the federal underwriting of the \n     research and development of capture and storage technology to \n     the point of commercialization. We need to not only \n     understand the capital costs but the operating and \n     maintenance costs through time. Additionally, the likely \n     internal energy requirements to implement both a robust \n     capture system and preparing CO2 for transport and \n     sequestration are most probably significant. This needs to be \n     understood not only by the plant design engineers but by \n     public policy makers as well.\n       Indemnification and risk assumption and at what juncture \n     are also critical unresolved issues. There is precedent that \n     the private sector absorbs the operational risk related to \n     capture, transportation and injection. But post-injection \n     risk, namely in situ liability of harm to human health, the \n     environment and property related to CO2 leakages \n     needs to transfer to the public sector at a reasonable point \n     in time when the operational risk of the initial process has \n     practically concluded. Funding for this long-term risk \n     management pool would likely need to derive from the \n     monetization of CO2 through a federal cap and \n     trade or taxation system.\n       Another point of separation between the historically \n     successful management of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide is \n     the amount of material involved. In rough terms there is \n     about 250 times the amount of material involved in dealing \n     with CO2 as with SO2 in electric power \n     generation. It would seem a detailed study of the required \n     infrastructure would make sense. What will it take to move \n     significant amounts of CO2 from generation source \n     to ultimate sequestration site? How much pipeline capacity \n     will be needed and where will it need to be installed? What \n     are the energy requirements to move large amounts of \n     CO2? What design standards will need to be in \n     place and in force to ensure safe handling?\n       Resolving these vital questions requires a long-term \n     commitment to fund demonstration projects at scale, to \n     monitor, measure and verify the CO2 activity and \n     begin to build a risk assessment profile. According to a \n     recent MIT study, to do so requires an 8-10 year commitment \n     and a federal commitment of at least $1 billion/annum. But \n     with a projected decline in GDP growth of $400-800 billion if \n     carbon capture and sequestration is\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\n     not deployed, our economy stands to suffer a far worse \n     outcome if CCS is not commercially available in the next few \n     decades.\n\n\n                            State Activities\n\n       As I mentioned before, Wyoming has undertaken a number of \n     activities to address the management of greenhouse gases. We \n     are a founding member of the Climate Registry.\n       We are in the process of conducting an inventory of \n     greenhouse gas sources to establish our emissions baseline \n     and begin to identify practical opportunities for reduction. \n     Many of our significant oil and gas companies are members of \n     EPA's Natural Gas STAR Program which implements best \n     practices to reduce methane emissions in natural gas \n     exploration and production. For a number of years, our \n     Department of Environmental Quality has employed a permitting \n     protocol requiring best available control technology (BACT) \n     for oil and gas minor sources which significantly reduce \n     greenhouse gases. We have for many years had a Carbon \n     Sequestration Committee investigating terrestrial \n     sequestration opportunities springing from our agriculture \n     lands and forests.\n       We have funded a study underway by the Wyoming State \n     Geological Survey to identify optimal CO2 \n     sequestration sites and to date they have found a site that \n     is calculated to store all emission from every source in \n     Wyoming for 350 years (20 billion tons). We have funded and \n     operated the Enhanced Oil Recovery Institute at the \n     University of Wyoming which assists primarily independent oil \n     producers in finding suitable fields and employ \n     CO2 floods to produce more oil. We participate in \n     two carbon sequestration partnerships and have proposals for \n     large scale demonstration projects at two promising sites. We \n     have established the Wyoming Infrastructure Authority, a \n     state instrumentality to address the electricity transmission \n     constraint that keeps our vast wind resource from the \n     marketplace. Recently, Rocky Mountain Power has announced \n     plans to build nearly 1200 miles of high voltage power lines \n     across four western states. We have competed in the FutureGen \n     competition making the case for a western mine mouth plant \n     located near both enhanced oil recovery well fields and deep \n     saline aquifers for long term carbon sequestration. We have \n     actively and seriously pursued section 413 of the Energy \n     Policy Act of 2005 which calls for an Integrated Gasification \n     Combined Cycle (IGCC) electric generation plant with carbon \n     sequestration at an altitude above 4,000 feet with low ranked \n     coals in a western state. We have signed a Memorandum of \n     Understanding (MOU) with the State of California and \n     particularly the California Energy Commission and California \n     Public Utility Commission to work toward the development of \n     this IGCC plant. We have funded a clean coal request for \n     proposal (RFP) process with intention of drawing the best \n     ideas from industry partnerships to advance the state of the \n     art in clean coal technology.\n       We have established the School of Energy Resources at the \n     University of Wyoming and will dedicate a portion of our time \n     on the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) \n     supercomputer to sequestration reservoir characterization. We \n     have passed statutory incentives for the development of wind \n     energy. We are exploring an exchange with a Chinese province \n     focused on CO2 sequestration.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       As you can see we are expending a good deal of money, time \n     and talent in the pursuit of greenhouse gas management and \n     will continue to do so. But please recognize this is just the \n     tip if the iceberg and we need federal involvement in a \n     serious way to really move forward in a meaningful way.\n       My recommendations for the Committee's consideration are \n     three. First, continue to focus the debate on the proper, \n     rational and achievable framework that leads to the \n     monetization of carbon. However, let me be clear here, I am \n     not urging continued inaction. The lack of a federal plan \n     essentially paralyzes the other players, both private and \n     public sector.\n       Secondly, focus short-term spending and federal \n     underwriting on the nearly universally agreed upon activities \n     of carbon capture and sequestration. With respect to capture, \n     a better understanding of the technologies particularly the \n     economics and power requirements is fundamental. Given the \n     amount of material involved, a comprehensive study of the \n     infrastructure requirements to move CO2 from \n     source to sink is necessary. With respect to storage, \n     continuation or acceleration of the multiple current \n     sequestration projects which will put CO2 in \n     quantity in the ground is essential.\n       Finally, the Congress should take up the issue of parsing \n     the long-term liability of carbon storage. Serious investment \n     in plants which will make use of carbon sequestration will \n     likely not be forthcoming until this issue is settled.\n       It is my understanding that there have been over 105 \n     hearings on this and the broader topic of energy independence \n     in just the last eight months. I ask to you consider what \n     specific information is still required to chart the course. \n     For while I'm only one Governor, we will commit our resources \n     towards obtaining the answers you need, so that we can \n     effectively move forward now. The problem at hand is \n     enormous, climate change does not wait for us and we cannot \n     afford to delay.\n       Mr. Chairman, thank you for your time and attention.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, to quote part of what Governor Freudenthal \nsaid:\n\n       I am not urging continued inaction. The lack of a federal \n     plan essentially paralyzes the other players, both private \n     and public sector. The problem at hand is enormous. Climate \n     change does not wait for us and we cannot afford to delay.\n\n  I have had many conversations with the good Governor, and let me tell \nyou why he is upset. The West has got problems. In my friend's own \nState, the average temperature rising in the Colorado River Basin, \nwhich stretches from Wyoming to Mexico, is more than double the average \nglobal increase. So his State is facing real problems, and essentially \nhe gets up here, and has every right, and reads off the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers' talking points. I thought the West was \nindependent. I am a little stunned.\n  We are hearing the same things now over and over: Raising gas prices. \nLet us look again. Under George W. Bush, we have had a 250-percent \nincrease in gas prices. Where was my friend when we tried to do a \nwindfall profits tax and give back the money to his poor working people \nhe is crying about today? He wasn't with us on this. He has never been \nwith us on this.\n  The fact is, we know if you look at this administration's own charts, \nnot the National Association of Manufacturers', we will lower gas \nprices, because clearly we are going to have other technologies--other \ntechnologies. And the fuel economy standards that we passed here--and I \ndon't know if my friend supported them; I hope he did--are going to \nmake it cheaper for folks to drive because their cars will do better. \nSo if there is a 2-cent-a-year increase--which is the outside limit, by \nthe way--as Senator Lieberman says, at the end of the day it won't be \nan increase for our families.\n  Now, my friend talked a lot about working people, so let's talk about \nworking people. Let's see the working people who support this bill. My \nfriend says he talks for working people, so I will tell you who is \nsupporting the Boxer-Lieberman-Warner bill. The International Union of \nOperating Engineers. They see jobs, jobs, jobs. The building and \nconstruction trades. They see jobs. The International Association of \nBridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers; the \nInternational Association of Heat and Frost Insulators; the \nInternational Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron, Shipbuilders, \nBlacksmiths.\n  I don't have enough time. I don't have enough time. The Laborers \nInternational Union of North America. It goes on and on. So when folks \non the other side get up and say they are crying for working people, \nwhy don't you listen to working people? Because they see what is \nhappening.\n  Let me tell you, my friend, what is happening in California, where we \nhave a cutting-edge global warming law, and whether this bill passes or \nnot, they are moving forward. So are the western States, I say to my \nfriend. The fact is, let me tell you what is happening. We have a \nterrible recession in my State because of the crash of the housing \nindustry. We are hoping we come out of this, but in the meantime, I am \ntold by my Governor, who is a Republican, Governor Schwarzenegger, who \nsupported this bill, that 450 new companies, solar companies, have set \nup shop and they are hiring those workers.\n  Then my friend says: What are you doing for the workers? Take a look \nin this bill. We have worker training. My friend actually wrote one of \nthe pieces of this part of the legislation. Universities have think \ntanks, and they have job training. We are very excited about the jobs \nthat will come. We are excited about the fact that finally we will get \nenergy independence.\n  Really, in a way, I smile. I am not happy about it, but I have to \nsmile when my colleagues on the other side complain about gas prices \nwhen they stood there and supported George Bush through his whole term \nwhen gas prices have gone up 250 percent. What was his answer? He went \nacross to the Middle East and held hands with a Saudi prince and \nbegged. It did not work. Let's forget about these phony arguments and \nsupport this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, we have heard the same thing over and\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\nover. This is only the second day. I guess we have maybe 10 days to go. \nThe junior Senator from California is so interested in the fact that it \nis only up by 2 cents a year. Looking at the Energy Information Agency \nstudy, what is interesting about that is the Energy Information Agency \nstudy presumes that we would have an additional 260 nuclear plants on \nline. When the appropriate time comes I will be asking her that \nquestion, if she supports that.\n  We have several speakers coming down. Senator Grassley from Iowa is \ncoming down, so I will visit a little bit until he gets here. Then we \nwant to go on schedule, and I am hoping we will be able to go back and \nforth and hear from a number of these Members.\n  First, I thank my colleague from Wyoming. I don't know what he \nexperienced this last winter. When the Senator from California talks \nabout temperatures and all this, it happens that we in the State of \nOklahoma have had the worst cold spell during this last winter than we \nhave in 30 years. I find this to be true all over the country. You just \ncan't have it both ways.\n  One of the good things about this discussion and this debate is we \nare not going to be discussing the science. I know the Senator from \nMassachusetts talked about the scientists in the IPCC. I have to remind \nmy friends across America, really it was the IPCC. That is the United \nNations, in case nobody knows who the IPCC is. They are the ones who \nstarted all this.\n  By the way, anytime there is a quote from the IPCC, it is a summary \nfor policymakers. Those are not--\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, I will not.\n  That has nothing to do with scientists. We talked about 2,000 \nscientists. We have a list of 30,000 scientists who said: Yes, there \ncan be a relationship between CO2 and a warming condition, \nbut it is not major.\n  Let me use an example. This is the best example because it comes from \nsomeone we all love dearly, former Vice President Al Gore. Former Vice \nPresident Al Gore wanted to explain to us how serious it was way back \nwhen he was Vice President. This is in the middle 1990s. He said he \nhired a scientist. The scientist's name was Tom Wiggly. Tom Wiggly was \na well-known scientist, one who was supposed to know what he was \ntalking about. He was the choice of Vice President Al Gore.\n  When he did this, the Vice President said: Do a study and tell us \nwhat would happen, how much cooling would take place if all of the \nnations who were developed nations--not developing nations, not China, \nnot India, not Mexico--just the developed nations were all to sign onto \nthe Kyoto Treaty and live by the emissions requirements. How much would \nthat reduce the temperature in 50 years?\n  Do you know what the answer was? Do you remember that? You remember \nthat. It was seven one-hundreths of 1 degree Celsius. That is not even \nmeasurable.\n  Of course, that is not Senator Jim Inhofe; that was Vice President Al \nGore. Al Gore has done his movie. Almost everything in his movie--in \nfact, everything has been refuted. Interestingly enough, the IPCC--on \nsea levels and other scare tactics used in that science fiction movie, \nit has been totally refuted, and refuted many times, by the IPCC.\n  On the conversation we have been having on gas prices, if you look at \ndifferent studies--you don't want to believe studies. Look at some of \nthe government studies. They have a responsibility to come out with \nsomething that is realistic. If you do not want to do that, just use \nlogic. If you are to pass a bill that has a cap on the supply of oil \nand gas in this country, and that cap goes into effect, by mere supply \nand demand the price is going to go up. It has to go up. So the EPA \nestimates that this bill, the Lieberman-Warner bill, will increase fuel \ncosts an additional 53 cents per gallon, and by $1.40 by 2050.\n  The Energy Information Agency weighed in on the same thing and \nestimated gas prices will increase anywhere from 41 cents a gallon to \n$1 a gallon by 2030. While the climate bill's proponents, as we heard \njust a few minutes ago from the distinguished junior Senator from \nCalifornia, argued that this shows the gas price numbers going up by \nonly 2 cents a year, that is assuming we have 2\\1/2\\ times the nuclear \nplants we have today. That is all written in this report. Right now we \nhave approximately 104. That would be 260 nuclear plants.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, I will not. Not now.\n  Then, getting into the nuclear, it is one of the things I think no \none is going to argue with. You are not going to resolve the energy \ncrisis unless it has a strong nuclear component. I think you are going \nto have some amendments coming up on this bill that certainly are \nsupported by Senator Warner, who is a cosponsor of the bill, that say \nwe need to dramatically increase our nuclear capacity in America. I \nhave been saying that for a long time.\n  If you look at European countries where there are not problems right \nnow, in the European countries, actually 80 percent of their energy \ncomes out of nuclear energy. In our country it is about 20 percent. I \nwould say any kind of correction of this problem is not going to take \nplace unless we have the nuclear plants.\n  The study that was referred to, the one that said only 2 cents a \nyear, that is assuming we have an increase of 260 nuclear plants--it is \nwildly optimistic, impossible, can't be done. Nonetheless, that is what \nis being discussed. Nuclear energy is a very important part of our mix. \nIt is going to have to be in the future.\n  I would say this: If I were on the other side of this bill, and I \nwere trying to get this bill passed, I would welcome the opportunity to \nhave that discussion on the nuclear amendment that will be offered by \nmore than one person, but certainly offered by even the author of the \nbill, Senator Warner.\n  I see the Senator from Iowa has arrived, and I think he is scheduled \nto speak for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I probably will not take all that time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator just yield for a question before he \nyields?\n  Mr. INHOFE. The problem with that is, as you well know, it is not \nvery reasonable because we are on a schedule to listen to other people, \nother than the distinguished junior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. With all due respect, Madam President, we are here to have \na debate. It is hard to have a debate when you are talking all by \nyourself. If the other side wants to engage in a good discussion, there \nare an awful lot of things said that are inaccurate, and I wonder if \nthe Senator wants to discuss them.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will be happy to do that after the remarks of the \nSenator from Iowa. Is that all right?\n  Mr. KERRY. Terrific.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, on April 24 of this year the Senate \nFinance Committee held a hearing on the tax aspects of what we call the \ncap-and-trade program, which is an essential part of this bill before \nthe Senate. At that hearing, the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, Peter Orszag, testified about the economic impact of a cap-and-\ntrade system.\n  Then we also had Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities testifying on the impact of a cap-and-trade system on low-\nincome families.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues some very relevant \ninformation, in the case of my colleagues not having an opportunity to \nreview the testimony that was before the Senate Finance Committee. Mr. \nGreenstein, who is often pointed to by Members of the other side of the \naisle on economic issues, expressed support for policies to address \nclimate change, but pointed out:\n\n       Significant increases in the price of energy and energy-\n     related products will necessarily occur as a result of the \n     enactment of effective policies to reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions.\n\n  I think sometimes this issue is presented as though there will be no \ncost or that big corporate polluters will pay all the costs. On the \ncontrary, we have then the CBO Director Orszag testify:\n\n       Under a cap-and-trade program, firms would not ultimately \n     bear most of the cost of the allowances but, instead, would \n     pass them along to their customers in the form of higher \n     prices.\n\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\n\n  So we are in this situation where everybody wants you to believe that \ncorporations pay taxes or corporations absorb costs. But corporations \nare tax collectors or, if they have costs, they are passed on to the \nconsumers and individuals end up paying. Mr. Orszag explained that \nprice increases stem from the restrictions on emissions itself, and \nprice increases are, in fact, an integral part of a cap-and-trade \nsystem. This is because price increases would be a key mechanism \nthrough which businesses and households would be encouraged to change \nbehavior, leading to reductions of CO2.\n  Regarding the impact of higher energy prices, I would like to refer \nto Mr. Greenstein again, whom I know many on the other side of the \naisle very closely listen to about issues that affect the poor. He \nobserved in his testimony:\n\n       Households with limited incomes will be affected the most \n     by these higher prices because they spend a larger fraction \n     of their budgets on energy and energy related products and \n     because they--\n\n  Meaning people who are in lower income levels--\n\n       are less able to afford investments that could reduce their \n     energy consumption, such as a new or more fuel efficient \n     heating system or car.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from Mr. Greenstein.\n  It is important to emphasize we are not just talking about heating \nbills. Mr. Greenstein further testified:\n\n       The impact of climate change policies on low-income \n     consumers goes well beyond the direct effect of higher energy \n     prices on their utility bills. More than half of the \n     increased costs that low-income households would face would \n     be for goods and services other than utilities.\n\n  Any item that requires energy to produce will become more expensive--\ncommon sense. Items he mentioned that would be more costly for low-\nincome families are quite obvious--gasoline, food, and rent.\n  We have heard a lot of rhetoric from the majority party expressing \nconcerns about the current high gas prices. Now they have brought \nbefore us a bill that would yet further raise gas prices. It seems like \nmaking points that are in conflict, very definitely in conflict. You \ncannot complain about high gas prices and then introduce legislation to \nraise gas prices yet higher.\n  The new substitute amendment does contain a token provision for tax \nrelief for consumers, but it only allocates the revenue from 3.5 \npercent of the allowances in the first year for this relief.\n  Robert Greenstein, whom I have quoted many times--many of the \nsupporters of this bill usually quote him, maybe on other issues--\ntestified that 14 percent of the allowance revenue would be needed to \nshield low-income households from further poverty and hardship instead \nof 3.5 percent. The current bill still falls short even in the year \n2030, when 12 percent of allowances will be available to fund tax \nrelief for consumers and emissions will be 45 percent below 2012 \nlevels.\n  Mr. Greenstein estimates that the average increase in energy-related \ncosts for the poorest fifth of our population would be somewhere \nbetween $750 and $950 per year for a modest 15-percent reduction in \nemissions. Can you imagine the outcry if Congress passed a bill to \nraise taxes on the poorest fifth of our population by $750 to $950 per \nyear? Some of the very proponents of this legislation would be those \ncrying foul the quickest. But that is exactly what this bill will do. I \nguess the Democratic leadership is hoping no one will notice.\n  Be forewarned, just look at a recent election in Britain. The Labor \nParty recently enacted a new tax policy that was perceived as a tax \nincrease on low-income people, and its approval ratings hit historic \nlows, leading to sweeping losses in local elections. If Congress is \ngoing to impose significant new costs on working families, we must take \nsufficient action to maintain their standard of living. However, that \nmeans more than providing benefits to offset direct costs imposed by \nthe bill before Congress. All Americans rely on healthy economic growth \nto provide jobs and opportunity.\n  CBO Director Orszag testified regarding a CO2 cap that \n``the higher prices caused by the cap would lower real wages and real \nreturns on capital, which would be equivalent to raising marginal tax \nrates on those sources of income.'' In other words, a cap-and-trade \nsystem has the same economic effect as the most antigrowth type of tax \nincreases one could think about. We are talking about a loss of jobs. \nWe are talking about a loss of economic opportunity for too many \nAmericans.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that this bill could \nreduce U.S. manufacturing output by almost 10 percent in 2030 and could \ncut gross domestic product by as much as 7 percent--by $2.8 trillion--\nin the year 2050. So we have people proposing this legislation from \nwhom I have sometimes heard outcries on the floor of the Senate because \nthere is outsourcing of manufacturing jobs, losing manufacturing in the \nUnited States. We have a bill before the Senate that is going to make \nthat situation worse, according to the EPA.\n  To help mitigate the adverse effect of a CO2 cap, Director \nOrszag suggested that one option would be to use revenue from \nauctioning allowances to reduce existing taxes that tend to dampen \neconomic activity. Instead, what does the bill do? The bill before us \ncreates a raft of new Government spending programs. In fact, this bill \nis 491 pages long, and I have had my staff count how many pages of new \nspending programs. They counted 212 pages. Much of the rest of the \nbill, then, is devoted to creating new bureaucracy to manage new \nprograms and to bring about new mandates. We are talking about $6.7 \ntrillion in spending over the life of the bill. That is an astounding \namount of money, even by Washington standards.\n  Of course, the authors of the bill will say these new spending \nprograms would invest in new technology. I heard that sort of \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate a week or two before we took our \nMemorial Day recess. I also heard speeches a couple weeks ago that it \nwould help the environment in some way. One problem with that argument \nis that almost all of this spending would occur after the caps have \ntaken effect because that is when the revenue from the allowance \nauctions will start coming in. So common sense tells me that is way too \nlate. It is too late to start investing in alternative energy \ntechnology after we already have a cap in place that effectively limits \nthe amount of energy that can be produced from fossil fuels. We need to \ndevelop those alternatives right now. If we wait, the pinch we feel \nfrom the cap will be much harder. We must have alternatives in place \nbefore caps.\n  I should add that even though this bill showers money on many \nindustries and special interests in an attempt to attract political \nsupport, it does little or nothing to promote further use of wind \nenergy. My interest in wind energy is that I happen to be the father of \nlegislation that passed in 1992, and Iowa is one of the leading \nproducers of wind energy of the 50 States. As a promoter of the wind \nenergy tax credit, I can tell you that this is zero-carbon, zero-\npollution technology, and it has tremendous potential to help meet any \nfuture carbon emissions goals.\n  Congress should take a very positive, concrete step toward reducing \ngreenhouse gases right now. You don't do that by leaving wind energy \nout of the legislation. That step we ought to be taking right now would \nbe to send to President Bush a package of extensions of expiring \nrenewable energy production tax incentives. In order to become law, \nthat package would need to be in a form obviously acceptable to the \nPresident. The Senate acted on this issue when the Cantwell-Ensign \namendment passed the Senate in the housing bill debate. The full \nCongress needs to follow through and get it to the President. With \nthose production incentives and investments in effect and way ahead of \ntime of what this bill would do, the projects will be built and more \ngreen energy will be supplied to American homes, motor vehicles, and \nbusinesses.\n  I look forward to seeing these vital incentives extended, but we need \nto do more--much more--if we are going to have in place the \nalternatives to meet any future emissions targets. Instead, what does \nthis bill do? This bill for the most part waits until the cap has \nalready taken effect and we will need to start switching to alternative \nsources of energy. Only then does it begin spending money to develop \nthe alternatives we will already desperately need by that point.\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\n  In addition, this legislation creates a whole new Federal \nbureaucracy, called the Climate Change Technology Board, to spend \nmoney. So we tax the American people. We are going to have an \nindependent agency spend the money, independent of any other Government \nagency. It will consist of five Directors appointed by the President. \nThis new unelected bureaucracy will have broad discretion to spend \nfunds that are allocated directly to it without going through Congress \nand with minimal congressional oversight. Congress will only be allowed \nto block funding after the fact and only if it passes legislation \nwithin 30 days. Anyone who is familiar with the legislative process \naround here, particularly in the Senate, knows this is essentially a \ncarte blanche to spend money.\n  I am sure we will hear justifications of how each of these new \nspending programs will do a lot of good. When we hear that, I urge my \ncolleagues to keep one thing in mind: According to the EPA, a typical \nAmerican household will lose $1,400 in purchase power, and $4,400 in \n2050, due to this legislation. What we need to ask is whether these new \nspending programs justify a tax of $1,400, increasing to $4,400, on a \ntypical American family.\n  The authors of this bill will say this is not a tax. I have already \nquoted the CBO Director saying that this bill will have the same \neconomic effect as tax increases. We know this bill will raise \ntrillions of dollars in Federal revenue, and CBO says it will consider \nauction proceeds to be Federal revenues. Spending in the bill, quite \nobviously, will be Federal outlays. In the process, American families \nare going to feel a tight pinch on their pocketbooks.\n  So you get back to something that is kind of Midwestern common sense \nabout this legislation and about whether it is a tax increase or not a \ntax increase, whether it is a Federal expenditure or not a Federal \nexpenditure, because where I come from, as the saying goes, if it walks \nlike a duck, talks like a duck, it is a duck. Well, this looks like a \ntax and it talks like a tax.\n  The question is, What to do with the revenues? We are faced with a \ntough decision. With this much new spending, there is something in \nthere for everyone. But does it justify a tax of $1,400--eventually \n$4,400--on hard-working American families? Rather than spend this money \non new Government programs, the right thing to do is to return it to \nthe American people to offset increased costs they will bear, prevent \nincreased poverty, and preserve economic opportunity for all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Inhofe may have some \ntime left--4 minutes--on his 30 minutes, then I would have 5 minutes to \nrebut, and then we would go to Senator Whitehouse.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I don't think that is entirely accurate because I think \nthe Senator who just spoke, Mr. Grassley, was on the list and was \ndesignated as the speaker with some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands that the Senator from \nOklahoma yielded time to the Senator from Iowa from the 30 minutes of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The UC that was passed allowed Senator Grassley to speak. \nHe was out of order only by one. Senator Whitehouse was supposed to be \nfirst, and then he was supposed to speak. What is it you want? Maybe I \ncan accommodate that.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I was going to suggest that you controlled 30 minutes. \nYou had 4 minutes remaining. If you wanted to use that, then I would \ntake the 5 minutes under the order we have for rebuttal, and then we \nwould go to Senator Whitehouse.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is fine.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Good.\n  Mr. INHOFE. According to the Chair, I have 4 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, let me repeat what I started out talking about in \nthe opening discussion on this bill. We said we are going to go ahead \nand we will not talk about the science because the science is not in \nthis bill. What we are going to talk about is the economics of this \nbill. That is what we have done. I have also said that if anyone wants \nto talk about science--I used the example of Vice President Gore's own \nscientist who said what a small, immeasurable impact it would be if we \nwere to sign on to the Kyoto treaty which is cap and trade, very \nsimilar to what we are talking about today.\n  Then, in 2005, we went through the same thing with the McCain-\nLieberman bill. That bill, I have to say to my good friend from \nConnecticut, was not nearly as bad as the Kyoto Treaty and far better \nthan this bill today because the price tag on that was less than the \nKyoto Treaty. The Kyoto Treaty would have been in the range of between \n$300 and $330 billion. That amount of money was a huge, very high \namount. But the bill that came along in 2005 was the bill by McCain and \nLieberman which is far less than that. Now, this is the one that is the \nbig one. The range here in terms of the cost is about 20 percent, 25 \npercent higher than Kyoto would have been at that time.\n  We started talking about gas prices and the fact that the nuclear \ncomponent is going to have to be necessary. But what we did not really \nget around to--and I think we need to do it over and over again in the \nnext few days, until such time as we get onto the amendments--is the \nfact that the amount of money this is going to cost over a period of \ntime, according to Senator Boxer in one of her early press releases, is \n$6.7 trillion. This would be in the form of higher gasoline or electric \nbills. A lot of people will make the statement that this really is not \nan accurate figure. Well, this is not my figure, this is her figure.\n  They have also said the bill provides that some of this money can \nbe--or the amended bill, which we have not seen all that long a time, \nprovides that some of this money can go back to poorer families. That \namount in the maximum, as I calculate it, is $2.5 trillion, which \nleaves $4.2 trillion.\n  Now, you might wonder, what is all this going to go to? I found it \nvery interesting, when the junior Senator from California was \ncomplimenting the senior Senator from New Hampshire, when Senator Gregg \nsaid: Well, we are in somewhat agreement, she said: The difference is, \nhe wants to return that money to the people, that $4.2 trillion, \ninstead of supporting this bureaucracy.\n  Well, as to the bureaucracy, we think it is going to be about 45 new \nbureaucracies, and it is going to take, over the 50-year life of this \nbill, I would suspect, right around $4.2 trillion to run that \nbureaucracy. I would conclude, though, by saying this country does not \nneed 45 more bureaucracies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, let me respond to some of the things \nthat have been said in the last half hour. But let me come back to why \nwe are here and why the Environment Committee reported this bill.\n  This bill has a purpose, and the purpose is to reduce the carbon \npollution that causes global warming. Why are we doing it? We are doing \nit because we want to turn this country and this planet over to our \nchildren and grandchildren and those who follow them in a better, safer \ncondition than it will be if we just let global warming go unchecked.\n  There have been a lot of things that have been blamed on this bill \ntoday: Gas prices, which got pretty high without this bill being \nadopted because it has not been adopted. The response has been given to \nthat. Tax increases. These are not tax increases. We rejected a carbon \ntax. This is the result of a market where businesses exercise choice. \nThey can either reduce their carbon emissions below the cap, in which \ncase they have some credits to sell or, if they cannot do it, they will \ngo back out in the market, of their own choice, and buy some at \nauction, and that creates the revenue which we then refunnel.\n  In the last block of time, what seemed to be suggested was that the \npassage of this bill would gravely hurt the American economy. In the \nfirst place, my friend from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, cited a study by \nthe National Association of Manufacturers and the American Council for \nCapital Formation. I believe the underpinnings of this study have been \nundercut by independent authorities.\n  At a May 20 hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, the Deputy Administrator of the Energy Information Agency--\npart of the Department of Energy, part\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\nof the Bush administration--Mr. Howard Gruenspecht said that this NAM, \nNational Association of Manufacturers, modeling mistakenly attributes \ncosts due to rising world oil prices as impacts of the Climate Security \nAct, which will reduce world oil prices because it will reduce demand \nfor oil, rather than considering those costs as part of the economic \nbaseline for the study. The fact is--and here again I cite two studies \ndone by agencies of this administration, the EPA and the EIA--both \npredict continued strong growth for the U.S. economy under this Climate \nSecurity Act. The modeling of the Environmental Protection Agency found \nthat under this bill, gross domestic product would grow by 80 percent \nbetween 2010 and 2030.\n  Here is the slight impact of the Climate Security Act.\n  Incidentally, these studies all do not account for the costs of doing \nnothing, which we believe would be many billions of dollars. Look at it \nthis way: If we do not pass this act--and this does not count for the \ncost of hurricanes and other extreme effects of global warming--the \ntotal output of the American economy is projected to reach $26 \ntrillion--that is a great number--in June of 2030. With the passage of \nthe bill, the economy will reach $26 trillion in April of 2030. So is \nit worth that few months' delay to get to the $26 trillion to avoid the \ncost of doing nothing and the harm global warming will do to our \ncountry and our planet, affecting our children and our grandchildren? \nMy answer is yes.\n  Let me suggest this too. There is a cost of the status quo for \nindustry. My friend from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso, comes from a great \ncoal-producing State. Coal is America's most abundant natural energy \nresource. America has the largest coal reserves in the world. This bill \naims to continue to allow American industry, power companies, to use \ncoal--in fact, to use it more.\n  But let me suggest this: Under the status quo, without this bill, \ncoal and those manufacturers who rely on it are in trouble. Fifty-four \npercent of the new coal-fired electric power capacity ordered in this \ncountry since 2000 has been canceled. Why? Because companies cannot get \naffordable financing to build the plants. And why not? Because \ninvestors have 100 percent certainty that a climate law is going to be \nenacted in this country within the next few years, certainly within the \nlifetime of a coal plant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The bottom line is, coal and the manufacturers who \ndepend on it need this bill to raise the money they need to build \nadditional coal plants to provide energy for American industry. That \nwould be great for our economy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor to my friend from Rhode Island, \nwho I might say played a very important and constructive and creative \nrole in the work the Environment Committee did in bringing S. 2191 to \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut for his kind words and, more importantly, for his \nleadership.\n  Madam President, for the first time the Senate is embarked on a full \ndebate on one of the most pressing issues facing America and the world \ntoday; that is, reducing the carbon pollution that causes global \nwarming.\n  This legislation, admirably and painstakingly pieced together by \nSenators Warner and Lieberman and by our chairman, Senator Boxer, takes \na historic step to confront the crisis before us.\n  As we speak, unchecked greenhouse gas emissions are causing the most \nsignificant and rapid climate and ecosystem shifts living memory has \never witnessed, affecting our oceans, our rivers, our lakes, our \nplants, our crops, and our wildlife. They affect our economy. They \naffect our very national security.\n  The evidence of global warming can be found in every State in the \ncountry. My home State of Rhode Island, the Ocean State, is perhaps the \nsmallest, but it is no exception. Over the past 20 years, the annual \nmean winter temperature in our beautiful Narragansett Bay has increased \nby about 4 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, the difference between, say, 63 and \n67 degrees may not feel like much to someone plunging into the clear \nwaters of Narragansett Bay, but for the populations of fish and \nshellfish that make Narragansett Bay their home, that feed Rhode Island \nfamilies, and fuel Rhode Island's proud fishing tradition, it is an \necosystem shift. It displaces cold water species, and it threatens the \nfragile and rich diversity of marine life in our precious Narragansett \nBay.\n\n  So far, the consequences of global warming have been relatively mild. \nBut there are worse things to come--in the world and in the waters \naround us. We are forewarned by overwhelming and undeniable scientific \nevidence.\n  Let me speak briefly about the science underpinning the evidence of \nglobal warming. We are fortunate to have an enormous body of scientific \ndata measuring the warming of the Earth, the rising of the seas, the \nshift in weather patterns, and the effects on all the Earth's \ncreatures. This data comes from all corners of the world and from the \nfull spectrum of scientific thinking, most recently, indeed, from a \nreport by the Bush administration's own Department of Agriculture. The \nscientists essentially all draw the same ultimate conclusion: Global \nwarming is happening, it is manmade, and it is getting worse.\n  Let me talk for a minute about some of the very foundations of the \nscience we will be discussing.\n  As shown on this chart, this is a very simple scientific device: the \nbell curve, the standard normal distribution. It basically is the \nstandard analytical device for almost all the observations in which \nscience works. In this dimension, one measures the danger of what could \nhappen. In this dimension, one measures the likelihood that will \nhappen.\n  What you find in the bell curve is that there is a strong agreement, \na strong, solid foundation of observed agreement around a level of \ndanger that has a very high likelihood of taking place. It is this \narea, as shown on this chart--this key area--where the likelihood is \nthe greatest that we face the dangers that have been described on this \nfloor so eloquently by Chairman Boxer and Senator Kerry and others of \nthe global warming that the Earth is undergoing.\n  Now, you will, during the course of this debate, hear about other \npoints of view. I am confident of that. Most of them lurk down here, as \nshown on this chart, in the area where the likelihood is the least, but \nthe danger is the least. That is the key. But this is really fringe \nscience. The body of science on global warming, like the body of \nscience on almost any other topic, follows a curve in which the vast \nmajority of the observations, the vast majority of the scientific \nconclusions follow an allocation, a curve like this.\n  What the people who are fond of pointing out these low-danger but \nlow-likelihood opinions usually forget to tell you is that there is \nthis side of the curve. This side of the curve may also be unlikely, \nbut it is very significant to us as a species because here the danger \nis even greater than what the vast bulk of the science we are relying \non here in this discussion today would indicate. These are very \nsignificantly dangerous scenarios for our species.\n  What we have found as time has gone on and as the scientific \nobservations have kept coming in is that we think it is here, as shown \non this chart, but when the observations come in, they tend to be here, \nas shown over here on this chart. We are always running ahead of the \nscience when the observations come in. Science is not telling us: Take \nit easy, don't worry. Science is telling us that the more information \nwe get, the more dangerous it appears to be.\n  It is a simple, traditional, normal distribution curve. The \ndiscussion that supports the changes we are making here is taking place \nwhere the weight of the science is. If people try to take you off that \nand show you this end of it, beware because there is just as great a \nlikelihood that this other end of the danger spectrum will occur.\n  Another aspect of the science here is the so-called trend line. Now, \nthis is just an example. It is not any statistics at all; it is just \ndots we put together to show a variety of data over time and how a \ntrend line flows through it. It is calculated through a very \nestablished scientific process.\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\n  There is a book that was written several years ago called ``How to \nLie with Statistics.'' A trend line provides a lot of opportunity to \nmislead people with statistics. In this debate, unfortunately, that \nhappens a fair amount.\n\n  I will give an example of that in a second. But basically, each of \nthese, as data points come in over time--and in this case the \ntemperature of various places on the Earth is measured--scientists are \nable to draw a trendline that essentially any reputable scientist, \nalmost any reputable mathematician, can draw through those points, and \nthen you base your conclusions on the trendline. That is standard, \ngrade A, basic 101 science.\n  Now, let's look at how that works in terms of global warming. Here \nare temperature changes plotted over years 1978 through 2003. Here is a \ntrendline that has been plotted through all of these orange data \npoints. It clearly indicates the warming of the Earth. This is the type \nof information on which reasonable and prudent people across this \ncountry--in businesses, in homes--base their decisions all the time. It \nis the type of decisionmaking our military relies on, our intelligence \ncommunities rely on, our scientists rely on, our corporate leaders rely \non. It is not anything special or magic. The trendline is very clear \nabout what is happening.\n  Now, in the green box I have highlighted a section of the data \nbecause what I have seen is a number of reports that have focused on \nonly this little piece of information. If you pull this little piece of \ninformation out--this was an El Nino year, so temperatures were \nunusually high. If you pull this little bit of data out, you can draw a \nvery different trendline through this. It would probably look something \nlike that. There have been people who have said: Well, that shows that \nin 1998 global warming stopped--because they took this tiny little \nsegment of the overall data and tried to focus only on that.\n  So it is very important in this debate, when you see some of the \ninformation that has been brought out, to understand that books such as \n``How To Lie With Statistics,'' their principles are still alive and \nwell, and unfortunately, data such as this has even seeped into \ndiscussion in the Senate.\n  For many years, global warming denial thrived on an industry of sham \nscience bought and paid for by special interests. Those days are \ndiminishing. Even the most vocal global warming deniers have \nincreasingly fallen silent because the science is speaking to us now \nwith an unequivocal voice. We can reduce the carbon pollution that is \ncausing global warming, and time is of the essence. The bill before us \ntakes a badly needed step toward the new green economy that beckons \nAmerica with the promise of new technologies, new products and, most \nimportantly, new jobs that will drive our American economy for decades \nto come.\n  This country has never before shied away from the next great \nchallenge or the next big idea. Classic American know-how has always \nled the world into new frontiers of scientific and technological \ndiscovery. The cold hand of the past always has reached out to impede \nprogress, and we see it clawing on this floor today. But America is \ncalled by the future, not by the past.\n  We have heard discussion today on whether there are costs if we act \nto address the carbon pollution that is causing global warming. What \nare the costs if we do not act? If we do not act, we will continue to \nsend our hard-earned dollars overseas to buy oil from nations that do \nnot care for us. The economic implications of our crippling dependence \non foreign oil are evident to every American every time they pull up to \nthe gas pump. The challenge to our national security grows increasingly \nclear with every day our troops spend mired in the war in Iraq. If \nPresident Bush had tackled this problem 7 years ago after he was \nelected, we would not have the gas prices we see today. We would not \nhave the weakened oil economy we live in today. We are paying at the \npump because President Bush was AWOL when the future called.\n  If we do not act, we will not only keep paying at the pump for our \ncontinued addiction to foreign oil, but we will fall behind the rest of \nthe world in developing and exploiting the green jobs and technologies \nof the future. If we do not act, we will witness increasing destruction \nof our natural landscape, disappearing coastlines back East, fire-swept \nprairies out West, a tornado-ravaged heartland, our hurricane-battered \ngulf coast. Hunters will see game species change their patterns and \nmigrate away. Trout fish will find rivers too warm. If we do not act, \nwe will allow the extinction of cherished creatures who share God's \nEarth with us, from the struggling polar bears of Greenland to Rhode \nIsland's own little piping plover.\n  If we do not act, we will become the first and only generation of \nAmericans--the first and only generation of Americans--to leave the \nworld to our children in worse condition than the one that was handed \nto us. We should not make ourselves that first and only generation. We \nshould not break the faith with our children and grandchildren.\n  I look forward as much as anybody in this room to a spirited debate \nthat will give all Members of this body the opportunity to share their \nideas and concerns. But when the debate is done, we must not shirk our \nduty. This has to be a legitimate debate. This can't be just about \nscoring political points. There is a true problem before us. We have it \nwithin our care, within our control, within our power to do something \nto get this right. I look forward very much to this debate. I hope my \ncolleagues are all joining in it in good faith. I hope we will rely on \nreal science and real arguments and not on talking points from \nindustries that haven't gotten it yet.\n  But when you see indications such as this, that people are willing to \ntake one little segment of the data out of context as much as that, I \nthink people who are watching this can see if that is what people are \ndoing, there is cause for concern about how serious they are about \nsolving this problem.\n  Madam President, I thank you very much and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first, before the Senator from Rhode \nIsland leaves, let me remind him he started the discussion by saying \nthis is the first time we have been debating this. We have been \ndebating this for years. I know the Senator from Rhode Island wasn't \nyet elected when we had the McCain-Lieberman bill on the floor and I \nremember that so well because I was down here for 6 solid days doing \nnothing but debating this.\n  One thing I wish to ask you to do is--we made the request when we \nfirst started--this is not a discussion on science. We are now talking \nabout a bill. We want to talk about the bill. I am convinced that \npeople coming down and talking about science are doing that because \nthey don't want to talk about the bill, they don't want to talk about \nthe tax ramifications of this bill.\n  Now, for the purpose of this discussion from now on, let's assume the \nscience is there, that we don't have to worry about science. Let's talk \nabout the bill.\n  I yield the rebuttal time to the fine Senator from Tennessee, Senator \nCorker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I say \nto my friend from Rhode Island--would the Presiding Officer let me know \nwhen I have a minute left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. CORKER. The Senator from Rhode Island has talked about science, \nas the Senator from Oklahoma has mentioned, and I say I agree with him, \nthat the large body of science says that man is contributing to global \nwarming. As a matter of fact, I will even give to the Senator from \nRhode Island the fact that cap and trade may be a legitimate way for us \nto deal with this. I think everybody in this body knows I am very open \nto looking at a legitimate cap-and-trade bill.\n  What I would ask the Senator from Rhode Island is--and I know he \nknows this subject well; he and I were in Greenland together and I know \nhis beautiful wife Sandra actually swims daily in the bay that he is \ntalking about, so she knows well about those temperatures. I know they \ndiscuss this at great length.\n  But if, in fact, we have this issue to deal with, why isn't the issue \nitself, by itself, good enough for us to focus on it? Why is it that we \ncreate a bill that--instead of focusing on cap and\n\n[[Page S4936]]\n\ntrade and lowering emissions in our country, why is it instead that we \ncreate a bill that brings trillions of dollars into the United States \nTreasury and then pre-spends that money from the year 2012 to 2050? Why \nwould we do that? Isn't the issue by itself strong enough? This is the \nmother and father of all earmarks. I have no understanding why anybody \nin this body would support legislation that prescribes trillions of \ndollars of spending.\n  Secondly, why would the Senator from Rhode Island support a bill \nwhere 27 percent of the allocations that are worth trillions of \ndollars--why would he support a bill that actually transfers those \nallocations which, in essence, is a tremendous transference of wealth \nto entities that have nothing whatsoever to do with lowering carbon \nemissions? Why would he support a bill such as that? Again, I have seen \na lot of people walking around here with nicely tailored suits and \nbriefcases, and I know that they realize if they sit at the table, they \nare going to benefit themselves by being tremendously enriched in the \nprocess. But why would the Senator not support a cap-and-trade bill \nthat returned the auction proceeds to the people of America who are \ngoing to be paying higher costs legitimately as a result of this bill?\n  The last piece--and this is one that is very difficult for me to \nunderstand. Why would the Senator from Rhode Island--my friend, whom I \nlove serving with--support a bill that pays and sends U.S. companies--\ninstead of spending money here in our country on technology that lowers \nemissions here, encourages them to spend billions and billions of \ndollars in China that benefit that economy when we have tremendous \ntrade deficits today?\n  So what I would say is again--I will say it over and over--I respect \nthe authors of this bill. I agree with the science. I think we are \nsquandering a tremendous opportunity in this body, because we are using \nold-time politics to win support for legislation that ought to be good \nenough on its own, and in the process the American people are paying \nthe tab. I think it is reprehensible that we are going about it in this \nfashion. I think today with gasoline prices at $4 a gallon, we have an \nopportunity--I think this is a perfect time to talk about this bill to \nmarry responsible climate security with responsible energy security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. CORKER. The American people elected us--the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, the Presiding Officer, all of us at the same time--to focus on \nthe big issues of this country. We have a tremendous opportunity in \nthis body to have a balanced climate security bill that doesn't take \nmoney out of the pockets of Americans forever and spend it through \nbureaucracy, but to tie that with energy security and do it in a way \nthat everyone wants, in a way that creates growth and economic \ndevelopment in this country. I think it is a shame--a shame--that we \nare squandering that opportunity by having legislation on this floor \nthat instead takes money from the American people, never returns it, \nbuilds a bureaucracy that doesn't exist, and damages our country for \nthe next 40 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I wish to take a few minutes to \nrespond to the questions that were asked of me. I think I have some \ntime remaining of the 15 minutes I was allocated.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining on his 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, that was a 5-minute rebuttal. The \nquestion I will ask the Chair, has the 5-minute rebuttal time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. So it would take a unanimous consent request for him to \nhave more time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that I may respond to the \nquestions that were asked of me by name.\n  Mr. INHOFE. OK. For 1 minute. After this I think we will try to stay \non schedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, since time is very short, to my good \nfriend Senator Corker from Tennessee I say this: First, the basic \nprinciple of this legislation is that polluters should pay, and I would \nhope that every person in this room would agree with that. Polluting \nindustries should not get away with causing global warming by releasing \ncarbon pollution for free and having all the rest of us pay the costs \nof that. If you agree with the proposition that polluting industries \nshould pay, then you have to, as you suggested, figure out the best way \nto get the funds back to the American people.\n  We try to do it in this bill in ways that step us into the green \neconomy we need for the future and in ways that step us up toward \nenergy independence. The Senator may disagree. That is what the bill is \nabout. If the minority would allow us to go to amendments, we could \ndiscuss that. That is not the way it is right now. We have to step \nforward. Senators Biden and Lugar are going to come forward with \nforeign policy recommendations to make sure the rest of the countries \nmove with us. I agree with the Senator from Tennessee that we have to \nmake sure the rest of the world moves with us. But we cannot wait for \nthe rest of the world to move.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have an important message for everyone \nlistening to me right now: This bill will cost you money. It will make \nyour gasoline more expensive. It will increase your electric bill--\ndramatically. It will take hard-earned money out of your pocket. \nCompanies don't pay the costs of higher energy. They pass it on to you, \nthe customer. You need to think about what you want to pay for your gas \nand electricity when this bill has its full effect on you.\n  How willing are you to pay the personal cost of global warming \nlegislation--even if it might not make a difference? What you and I \nneed is a bill that spurs innovation and recognizes what is possible \nwith technology. What you and I need is a bill that cleans the \nenvironment without destroying our economy. I am in favor of using \nalternative sources of energy and reducing emissions and giving \nincentives to invent cleaner air. I am in favor of increasing our \nsupplies of energy. I am in favor of actions that will bring down your \ncost of energy.\n  We are now debating an issue that Congress has been discussing for a \nlong time. I have been involved in this global warming debate for a \nlong time. I was a member of the original Senate delegation that \nattended the Kyoto conference, at which the Kyoto protocol was created. \nI saw right away that that conference was not an environmental \nconference, it was an economic conference with the United States as a \ntarget.\n  Well, before that, I was also the mayor of Gillette, WY, the center \nof the largest coal-producing area in the Nation. Like many of my \ncolleagues, I have spent a lot of time studying this issue.\n  Some say this bill is essential. I am not convinced that such is the \ncase because I am not convinced it takes the right approach to reducing \nemissions. We may need to address this issue but not through the \nlegislation we have before us today.\n  I am concerned that this is a piece of legislation that will make \nenergy much more expensive for Americans, at a time when the No. 1 \nissue I am hearing about is the need to decrease energy prices, \nespecially gasoline. I am concerned that we are debating a bill that \nwill send American jobs overseas. I am concerned we are debating a bill \nthat will irrevocably harm our ability to use our Nation's most \nabundant energy source--coal.\n  I am not a fearmonger. I am an environmentalist. I am in favor of \nusing alternative sources of energy. As my constituents will tell you, \nwe have a great potential for wind and solar energy in Wyoming. I am \nfor conservation. We need to find ways to consume less energy. I am for \ninventions that reduce\n\n[[Page S4937]]\n\ngasoline and diesel consumption, and I am for inventions that reduce or \neliminate all suspect chemicals and gases. But I am not a fearmonger.\n  We have held congressional hearings, but hearings around here aren't \ndesigned to get at the truth; hearings are to make a preconceived \npoint. The chairman selects all of the panel members but one. The \nranking Republican gets to pick that one. Then both sides show up to \nmake specific points and to discredit the other approach. We have a \nbill before us that is one approach to this issue. Now we need to \ndetermine if it is a sensible solution, and we must determine what you, \nthe public, are willing to pay. What are we willing to make you, our \nconstituents, pay to implement the plan we have before us today to \nmaybe address global warming? I suspect my folks in Wyoming are not \nwilling to pay the enormous costs associated with this bill.\n  This bill is a one-size-fits-all approach. It is expensive. It \ncreates a huge new bureaucracy. It assumes that technology is further \nalong than it truly is, and it ignores the fact that nations such as \nChina and India do not and will not have similar programs. We need a \nbill that spurs innovation and recognizes what is possible with \ntechnology. What we need is a bill that recognizes that if we want a \nclean environment, we cannot destroy our economy.\n  I figured out when I was mayor of Gillette and we were going to have \na coal boom that we could wait to be run over or we could work to \nrealize the benefits from development. We worked with the mines. We got \nthe necessary facilities and amenities their employees would like. We \nmade sure they did a reclamation job that makes us proud. You see, \nWyoming coal is a clean coal. We ship it to all 50 States. Other States \nmix their coal with ours to meet the clean coal standards.\n  In the early days of my hometown's coal boom, the critics of coal \nsaid, ``Don't let them tear that area up. It is not reclaimable.'' \nToday, visitors in Gillette say, ``Don't let them tear that lush land \nup.'' And I have to say, ``That is where the mine used to be, and that \narea is where the mine is headed.'' Most of those visitors then say, \n``Let the mines move ahead if they can improve it like that.'' Of \ncourse, the next generation is going to say, ``You moved all that dirt \nand you didn't make a bigger difference than that?'' The mining \ncompanies have to put the contours back exactly as they found it. That \ncomes from one-size-fits-all legislation. People in the East got upset \nabout mountaintop removal, and they should be upset when that occurs. \nBut we mine coal differently in Wyoming. Our coal is in 60- to 90-foot \nseams under a few feet of dirt.\n  When we talk about coal mining, the first question should be: What \nwould be hurt by mining? Second, we should ask: Can we improve what was \nthere before? Are there any local needs that could be met? Wildlife is \npart of Wyoming's heritage. It is part of our recreation and even our \nfood. What can we do to improve the habitat for wildlife? These \nquestions are all asked before we allow mining to move forward in \nWyoming in the first place. Unfortunately, sometimes policy in \nWashington dictates that we cannot do everything we want to do.\n  A few years ago, a prime emphasis from Washington was wetlands. \nWyoming was photo-surveyed during our wettest spring in years, and we \nhave been maintaining at that level. As the mayor of Gillette, I wanted \nto do better. I worked to get more wetlands on reclaimed mine property. \nBut I was turned down because they weren't wetlands before. I finally \ngot permission for a demonstration on one mine. It worked beautifully. \nIt looked lush and it attracted animals and birds that were supposed to \nbe attracted. It was a marvelous success. Do you think we have been \nable, in the next 20 years, to do one other project like that? No, we \nhave not. Why not? Because restrictive policies in Washington by \nCongress have held us back. Don't try to make things better; try to \nkeep them the same. That is not a good policy.\n  The Lieberman-Warner bill is an example of a similar policy. Instead \nof recognizing that, if given the proper tools, American innovation can \nsolve any climate crisis, instead of trusting that industries will make \nadvances and will improve technology, providing they can pass the cost \non, the bill assumes that technologies are far ahead of where they \ntruly are. And it does so at a tremendous cost to consumers. You may be \npaying for huge costs that may not make any difference.\n  There are so many studies on this subject that you cannot count them \nall. The bottom line is you can count on the fact that this bill will \nbe expensive. You can explain it any way you want, but it will increase \nthe energy cost of all you hard-working Americans. I have heard a lot \nof my colleagues talk about the struggling middle class. Well, if you \nimplement a policy that will significantly increase energy prices, the \nmiddle class will struggle even more.\n\n  There is also a lot of talk about the need for the United States to \nbe the leader on climate policy. People argue that if the United States \nacts, the world will follow. Europe is working to meet the greenhouse \ngas reduction standard they set up, but they are doing it by shipping \ntheir manufacturing to India and China because those countries don't \nhave to meet any sort of standards. I don't want the United States to \ndo the same thing. I want the jobs here. Presidential candidates are \ncomplaining about jobs going overseas. Whose jobs will be shipped out \nbecause of this bill? I cannot support a bill such as this, which does \nlittle to include the developing world in this effort. We have already \nreduced our logging, and those jobs shipped overseas have almost \neliminated the Siberian tiger. We have placed an emphasis on ethanol \nand have Brazilians chopping down the rain forests to plant corn.\n  We are going to spend some time talking about this bill. The American \npeople need to know that this bill costs money. It will make gasoline \nmore expensive. It will increase their electric bills. It will take \nhard-earned money out of their pockets. It is the right time to have \nthis debate so we can discuss the approach this bill is taking and \ndetermine if we are willing to saddle the people of our States with the \nenormous costs caused by it.\n  On June 1, George Will did an editorial in the Washington Post and \nexposed the cap-and-trade policy of this bill for what it is--a carbon \ntax, but clever and hidden. While I was at the global warming \nconference in The Hague, the United States was negotiating to get some \nrecognition for the increase in trees in the United States since they \nabsorb CO2 and put out oxygen. The United States has had a \nsignificant increase in trees over its history, and studies have shown \nthat the trees absorb more CO2 than the people of the United \nStates put out. The other countries wouldn't allow that since the \nconference every year is an economic conference, not an environmental \nconference.\n  Here is how the cap and trade will work. Actually, here is how cap \nand trade will shift wealth. Landowners who have trees on their land \ncan put their trees' CO2 absorption on the market. They can \ndo that right now. The same trees that have been absorbing and \ntransforming--that the world will not credit--will now be paid to do \nwhat they have always done. And you will pay for it at the gas pump and \nwhen you flip the electric switch, or when your furnace or water heater \ncome on. That is right, the companies will buy the cap-and-trade \ncredits for the trees and other absorbers, but you will pay it because \nit will be passed on.\n  I want everybody listening to visualize opening their utility bill \nthe month after this bill goes into effect. Can you see your shocked \nlook as the already high bill is now 50 percent higher? But that is \nnothing. Visualize how high your bill will go when you get into the \nspirit of selling credits. Speculation has driven up oil costs. Cap and \ntrade will result in speculation as well. You will wonder what happened \nto your utilities, and they will tell you that Washington foisted this \nexpense on you. The utilities will explain how Congress forced them to \nbuy CO2 credits to stop global warming. If there were a \ncarbon tax--and I am not suggesting any new tax--if it were a carbon \ntax, it would at least be in proportion to what you yourself used and \ncould be transparent. If this bill becomes law, you should visualize \nwhat will happen when you fill up your automobile. If you have a job in \nmanufacturing, imagine what will happen to\n\n[[Page S4938]]\n\nyour job when India and China, that have no constraints, get your job \nbecause their energy, with no environmental controls, is cheaper. \nWithout a way to increase energy supplies that we rely on every day, so \nthat prices will come down, this bill is out of step with the times and \nwill cost you dollars--and perhaps your job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if the Senator has completed, it is my \nunderstanding I will have a 5-minute rebuttal time; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to make a few comments and then turn to \nSenator Lieberman. Can you tell me when I have used 2\\1/2\\ minutes, \nplease.\n  Let me say, new speaker, same talking points. Unbelievable. Not one \nof my friends on the other side, not one, in my opinion, has offered \nanything to combat global warming, to get us off foreign oil--not one. \nIt is unbelievable.\n  I checked the record. Let's hold up these charts on oil. Here we go \nagain. It has been 7 years since George Bush took office, and gas \nprices have gone up 250 percent. I did not hear my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle saying: Oh, my people are hurting, let's go to \nthe oil companies; we know the executives are earning many millions. \nNothing.\n  Let's look at what happened in the past 9 months, since January 7: an \n82-cent increase. My colleagues, silent. Now they are worried, just \nwhen we can get off foreign oil, just when we have a plan to do it, we \ncan say goodbye to big oil, out of the stranglehold, oh, they are \nsuddenly concerned because gas prices could go up 2 cents a year, \nwhich, by the way, is the outside limit and we know, because of fuel \neconomy we passed, is not going to impact our people.\n  Let's look to June 2007. The Senate rejected an effort by Senator \nBaucus to provide tax credits to renewable energy by closing loopholes \nfor the oil industry that is taking all the money from my people and \nyour people and the hard workers of America: 47 Democrats said yes; 34 \nRepublicans said no.\n  In November 2005, an amendment by Senator Cantwell to establish a \nnational goal of reducing our dependence on foreign oil so the \nPresident does not have to go hold hands with a Saudi prince, let's see \nwhat happened then: 45 Democrats voted yes, but 52 Republicans said, \nno, they don't want to be energy independent. That is what this is \nabout. All these crocodile tears, and you will hear it time and time \nagain.\n  Where were they when we tried to do something about oil prices? How \nabout in November 2005, an amendment by Senator Cantwell to create a \nnew Federal ban on price gouging: 45 Democrats yes; 42 Republicans no.\n  Don't listen to this. This is a phony attack just when we are ready \nto get off foreign oil.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California. \nIn the midst of all the attacks being made against the Climate Security \nAct, something may be missed by those who are listening or watching. We \nhave a problem. It is called global warming. This bill, according to \nthe Environmental Protection Agency of the Bush administration, solves \nthat problem, protects us from the worst consequences of global \nwarming.\n  I presume, because my friends on the other side are opposed to the \nbill, they don't deal with either the reality of global warming or the \nfact that our bill solves it. They are blaming just about everything \nbut the common cold on our bill.\n  One of the biggest deceptions is this business that this bill will \nincrease gasoline prices. I presume that argument is being made because \nall of us and the American people are angry about the increase in \ngasoline prices. The truth is the Climate Security Act will not \nincrease gasoline prices, it will decrease gasoline prices because it \nwill decrease our reliance on oil. In reducing carbon emissions, we \nhave to stop using oil and use other ways to power our vehicles and \nthat reduces the demand for oil.\n  Look at this chart. This is a study done by the International \nResources Group, an economic consulting firm. This is the line for what \noil imports will be in 2015 if we do not pass this bill: about 15 \nmillion barrels a day. Here is the line for 2191 if the Climate \nSecurity Act passes: down 58 percent, 6.4 million barrels a day, the \nlowest amount of imported oil in this country since 1986. That is 8.4 \nmillion barrels per day less imported into the United States.\n  We know there is speculation in the oil market, but the laws of \nsupply and demand still have some effect. If we can reduce demand for \noil that much, we are going to reduce the cost of gasoline. That is \nwhat this bill is all about. It is going to take that money and invest \nit in the kind of new technologies America has been waiting for, and \nthey exist.\n  So let's go from the attack to something positive. Let's protect our \nchildren and grandchildren from global warming caused by carbon \npollution.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the Senator from Pennsylvania \nis to be next for a period up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I believe I have 6 minutes remaining on my \n20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator wish to retain his time?\n  Mr. ENZI. I certainly wish to retain a portion of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes remaining, and that \ntime apparently was not yielded back.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I understand Senator Whitehouse tried to reclaim his \ntime, and he was not allowed to do it. Was he at the end of the day? It \ntook a new consent agreement. Do we wish to now have a new consent \nagreement that people can do half their time and reclaim their time \nlater? Is that something, I say to Senator Alexander, he wants to do? I \ndon't mind it at all. I would like to have it in the agreement.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, as I understand it, that is what the \npractice has been recently in the debate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Why don't we formalize it?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That would mean a Senator who had 20 minutes could \nreserve an amount of time used for rebuttal.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As long as they use it immediately after the rebuttal, \nand does that mean you get another rebuttal? That is why this is a \nproblem. The whole notion was for rebuttal after the individual \nfinished speaking. If somebody withholds, it is very complicated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to make a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to keep it the way it is but make an \nexception now for Senator Enzi because I feel like he didn't know that \nrule. I would like to keep it the way it is and not be able to yield \nback time. You have your time, we have the rebuttal, we move on. I \nobject to changing it, except in this circumstance, allowing Senator \nEnzi to have that 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. Reserving the right to object, I think we already have a \nunanimous consent agreement that says exactly what is happening right \nnow. My thought was we would have a debate on the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Excuse me, if Senator Corker objects----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California will withhold.\n  Mr. ENZI. I was here for the previous discussion, and it was my \nunderstanding that the train had to continue on time, but it was set up \nthat it would flow, that we could withhold shortly and then have a \nslight rebuttal after the rebuttal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has a unanimous \nconsent request pending and that unanimous consent request is that \nSenator Enzi be able to retain his 7 minutes and thereafter Senators \nwith allotted time under the current order must use that time in one \nblock.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to amend that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the unanimous consent request of the \nSenator from California. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\n  Mr. CORKER. I object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then he cannot speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee objects.\n  Mr. CORKER. That is the order that is on the floor. You can't change \nthe rules.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is not the order.\n  Mr. CORKER. That is the order. The fact is the order is if people \nhave remaining time, they can speak after rebuttal. That is exactly \nright.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: Could the Chair \nstate the existing unanimous consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California and the Senator \nfrom Tennessee will hold on for a minute. The understanding of the \nChair at this point is that Senators use their allotted time and then \nthere is up to 5 minutes for rebuttal. If the Senator does not use the \nentire allotted time during the one block, then time is yielded back \nand nothing is reclaimed. That is the understanding of the Chair with \nrespect to the unanimous consent order in place. That unanimous consent \nagreement was enforced with respect to Senator Whitehouse, who asked \nconsent to be granted an additional minute, which time he had not \npreviously used.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, that was not the understanding Senator \nInhofe had left me with. However, I respect the Chair. If that is the \nruling, then I do not object. I thank the Senator from California for \nher courtesy in giving Senator Enzi his remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to amend my UC to say that there be \n2 minutes of rebuttal, after Senator Enzi completes his 7 minutes, to \nbe controlled by myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let us make it clear that the value of this debate, not \njust to ourselves but to the American public, is to have some exchange \nbetween us and to have a little followup and some questioning. I hope \nnothing that has been said thus far will restrict a Senator--for \nexample, my dear friend who is about to speak, I would like to ask him \na question and then that be charged against my time. Is that to be in \nany way obstructed by that procedure which we normally follow--I assume \nyou will accept the question or maybe equally divide the time so we \nhave some colloquy taking place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take consent to enter into that form \nof colloquy.\n  Mr. WARNER. I beg your pardon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take consent for the time to be \ncharged against the time allocated to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am thrilled to report the white smoke is \ncoming out, and we have reached agreement on how to proceed. We are \ngoing to keep the order--and I hope everyone will make sure I am saying \nthis right--keep the order the way it is. The only exception is, if a \nSenator wants to question another Senator, that Senator will do it off \nof the time they already have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is wonderful. Now I believe we go to Senator Casey \nfor 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, we are making history today in the Senate \nbecause this is the first global warming bill that has reached the \nfloor for a full debate and vote. Congress has, in the past, as we \nknow, considered symbolic global warming legislation, but this is the \nfirst time that we are working on the details--how to create a national \npolicy to slow, stop, and reverse the catastrophic global warming that \nwe see across the world. At the same time, this legislation and this \ndebate could not be more important to our economy and our national \nsecurity.\n  This bill is very simple. There is a lot of complexity to it, \nobviously, but at its core it is very simple. It is about creating \njobs, first of all; it is about protecting God's creation; and it is \nalso about enhancing our national security and, indeed, the world's \nsecurity. It is not a perfect bill, but it is a good bill on which to \nbuild a national program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  I do want to commend several Members of the Senate: Senators \nLieberman and Warner, Senator Boxer, and so many others who have worked \nso many years on this legislation, and especially worked in the last \nyear and the last 6 months to bring this to where we are today. These \nSenators, with help from other Members of the Senate, have crafted a \nbill that includes all of the major policy issues that we must address: \nthe cost to American families, job creation, worker protection, \nfocusing on developing nations that will soon be the largest emitters \nof carbon, and keeping America competitive internationally.\n  At its core, this bill also recognizes and celebrates the best of the \nAmerican spirit. We are confronting challenges in this bill, no doubt \nabout that, but we are confronting challenges with American innovation, \nAmerican ingenuity, the can-do spirit of the American people, and the \nskill of the American people in leading the world in confronting a \ndifficult challenge. So I think that is something we should recognize: \nthat this is a good opportunity for the American people not only to \nconfront the crisis of global warming, but also to create jobs, to \nbuild a stronger economy, to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and \nto do something very significant on the question of what happens to our \nplanet.\n  The authors of this bill have worked to include a number of things \nthat are important to me, especially a program in this bill that is \ncritical to the security of American workers--the Climate Change \nWorkers Assistance Program. In short, what this program will do is make \nsure that workers who are adversely affected will have wages, they will \nhave health care benefits, and they will have the intensive training \nthey need to make the transition that will happen to some of our \nworkers. This program will also provide a link between creating new \nmanufacturing jobs in the future and helping transition to those new \njobs of the future over time. This program is also a safety net \nintended to give American families peace of mind that they will not be \nleft behind as we build a new economy with these new jobs.\n  That is the key point. Americans have called on us--have called on \nus--to take action and to prevent global warming, and they are willing \nto do a lot of the hard work to implement a national program to secure \nour collective future. Together, we can do this. We know we can do \nthis. America has always been able to confront difficult challenges, \nwhether that challenge was the Depression or a World War or any \nchallenge presented to us. We have met those challenges just as we are \nmeeting the challenge that is global warming. We can stop global \nwarming at the same time that we create a robust new economy that will \nprovide good jobs for our families.\n  There is a lot of talk about the cost of this bill, and there is no \nquestion that there are costs. But I also worry about the cost to our \nfamilies. All of us worry about that. People are working so hard just \nto make ends meet. This bill contains programs to directly address \nthese concerns, including a paid-for tax policy to return money to \nconsumers to offset increased costs and special assistance for States \nsuch as Pennsylvania, my home State, that rely on manufacturing and \ncoal as a major part of their economy.\n  But to this discussion of cost I wanted to add something opponents of \nthis bill don't talk much about, and that is the cost of inaction, the \ncost of doing nothing, which many in this Chamber apparently believe we \nshould do--do nothing and hope it gets better; talk about it and talk \nabout it and do nothing and wait for another day. While\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\nthere is certainly a cost to implementing this legislation, there is \nalso a cost if we sit back and do nothing. Not only will it be more \nexpensive to address global warming the longer we wait, we can expect \neven greater costs in terms of major storms and weather events, \nincreased wildfires, loss of food crops, and so many things that we are \nseeing playing out right before our eyes today in the world.\n  Just last week, a report commissioned by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture acknowledged the impact global warming could have on crop \ndisasters. We already know what happens when grain crops fail due to \ndrought and flooding in different parts of the globe. It is happening \nright now. Lack of crops and increased costs of staples, such as wheat \nand rice, are causing food riots in some countries. By one estimate, \none-fifth of the world's nations are in a food insecurity situation \nright now, as we speak.\n  So this is not just a humanitarian crisis for those people and their \ncountries, this is also a national and international security threat--\nthat threat being food insecurity--caused by a number of events and \ncauses but especially the challenge that we have of global warming \nbecause that is contributing to that food insecurity. To sit back and \ndo nothing about global warming when we see this path ahead of us and \nhave heard the warnings from scientists all over the world would be not \njust the wrong policy--to do nothing on global warming--it would, in \nfact, in my judgment, be immoral.\n  So I support the Climate Security Act, and I will vote in favor of \nits passage.\n  Before I give up the floor, I have heard a lot of discussion in the \nlast day or so from people criticizing this legislation, about a number \nof parts of the bill they do not like. But one of the things they keep \npointing to is gas prices. Senator Boxer and others have used the chart \nthat talks about the price increase of gasoline since President Bush \nhas been in office, an exorbitant increase in the cost of gasoline. But \nI have to ask my friends on the other side of the aisle who keep \ntalking about this bill increasing gas prices--and, frankly, it would \nnot do that over time. We know from some of the data that has been \npresented that this bill will bring down the cost of gasoline. But \nlet's say they are really concerned about this part of the legislation. \nLet's just say they are trying to make their point about gas prices.\n  If they are so concerned about gas prices today, why don't they \nsupport, as we have tried to push on this side of the aisle, strategies \nto bring down that cost or to, at a minimum, provide some measure of \nrelief to our families?\n  How about a windfall profits tax? If people really are worried about \ngasoline prices, why don't critics of the bill support that? Why don't \nthe critics of the bill, if they are so worried about families and gas \nprices, not only support a windfall profits tax but support measures \nthat we have introduced already--and I hope we can have a vote on \nthis--to focus on excessive speculation that is in the market right \nnow?\n  So there is a lot we can do right now to bring down the cost of \ngasoline, or at least try, but it seems the other side of the aisle \njust wants to talk about bringing gas prices down but does not want to \ndo it.\n  I think this Climate Security Act is one way not only to deal with \nour energy challenges but to do our best to protect God's creation, to \nenhance our national security, and to create lots and lots of jobs for \nour families and for our future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee \nup to 5 minutes to rebut the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the senior Senator from Tennessee. I will only \ntake a moment.\n  I enjoy so much working with the Senator from Pennsylvania. We came \nin at the same time and I appreciate the points he made. I actually \nwish to more fully address the comments made by the bill manager, the \nSenator from California, and say that I don't see any crocodile tears \ncoming from this desk. The fact is, we will be offering meaningful \namendments that focus on this legislation, with no excuses. I know the \nsenior Senator from Tennessee has been in the forefront of this issue \nfor some time. I think all of us realize that while gasoline prices \nhave increased no doubt over the last 7 years, no doubt this bill will \ncause gasoline prices to continue to increase.\n  I think there is a big discussion about what we do with the revenues \ngenerated by this bill. That is a legitimate argument. We all realize \nthere is a tremendous transference of wealth that takes place in this \nbill. All we are trying to do is cause this bill to be more pure and at \nthe same time to try to link it toward energy security. I am looking \nforward to the amendment process.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for adding so much to the tone of \ndebate we are having here.\n  I yield back my time to the Senator from Tennessee for not only \nrebuttal but his comments about the bill itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I understand under the regular order \nthat leaves me with a couple of minutes plus 20 minutes, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes for rebuttal and \nthen 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. May I ask the Chair to let me know when 3 minutes \nremains in my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this is an important day in the Senate \nbecause we are debating an important issue. It is one the country cares \nabout and should care about. It is one which a great number of Senators \nhere on both sides of the aisle have discussed. I congratulate Senator \nWarner and Senator Lieberman for their leadership. The chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee is here. She has worked \ndiligently on this and made it a priority. We are doing what the Senate \nought to do.\n  What the American people do not like is when they see us engaged in \nwhat I like to call playpen politics--when we start trying to see who \ncan stick fingers in each other's eyes. What they do like to see is for \nus to have principled, vigorous debates about important issues that \nhave to do with the future of our country, and how we deal with climate \nchange is one of those issues.\n  That is how we are dealing with this. We voted by a large margin, \nDemocrats and Republicans both, to proceed with this debate and say \nthis is important enough to put on the floor. The majority leader \napparently is giving us a significant amount of time to debate this--as \nwe say in Tennessee, to air out the issues--and that is surely what we \nought to do.\n  We began this morning in a bipartisan breakfast. Senator Lieberman \nand I are the hosts, along with some others, of a bipartisan breakfast \non Tuesday mornings. The Presiding Officer often attends those meetings \nas well. The purpose of that is for Democrats and Republicans to sit \naround a table in a room, with no staff and no media, and discuss \nissues about which we do not agree in hopes we can find a way to deal \nwith them.\n  This is an important day in the Senate. We are doing exactly what we \nought to be doing on an issue of importance to the American people. The \nLieberman-Warner bill is the basis for this discussion. We are going to \nbe hearing this week a lot of criticisms of the Lieberman-Warner bill \nand I am going to make some of them myself. But that is not to \ncriticize the effort, because we have to start somewhere. These are two \nof our most distinguished Members. The bill has gone through the \ncommittee and it is now on the floor. We would be derelict if we didn't \nsay let's deal with climate change in the correct way.\n  What I wish to do in the time I have remaining is to talk about three \nthings: No. 1, what is wrong with this bill; No. 2, to suggest a better \nway to deal with the climate change issue; and No. 3, to suggest what I \nbelieve is the best way to deal with the entire range of issues that \nare presented to us which I believe are much larger than climate \nchange.\n  Let me jump to the end of my remarks at the beginning by simply \nsaying: I believe climate change is a real issue, that humans are a \ncontributor to\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\nclimate change, and we must deal with it. But I also believe that an \nunusual demand for energy in the United States and the world is a real \nissue. In our region where the Tennessee Valley Authority produces \nabout----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The rebuttal time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  In our region where the Tennessee Valley Authority produces about 3 \npercent of all electricity in the country, estimates are that we would \nneed 700 new megawatts of power in the next year. That is a coal plant \nand a half. That means 30 or 40 new coal plants around the country just \nto meet that, if the rest of the country is like TVA. That is a real \nissue as well.\n  Our Nation's overreliance on oil from other countries is a huge issue \nfor us. We don't like being in the pocket of people who are selling us \noil, including some who are trying to kill us by bankrolling terrorism. \nWe want to be more independent than that in the world. It affects \nalmost every aspect of our national security. It is costing $500 \nbillion a year. Overdependence on foreign oil is driving down the value \nof the dollar. That lack of independence in our supply is a major \nissue.\n\n  Clean air is an issue. Carbon is not the only pollutant in the air \nthat I am concerned about, coming from Tennessee, nor would it be for a \nSenator from California either. We have a real concern about sulfur, \nnitrogen, and mercury. I have, since I have been in the Senate, \nsupported legislation in a bipartisan way--first with Senator Carper--\nto stiffen requirements on mercury, nitrogen, and sulfur as well as \nbegin to cap powerplant emissions for carbon. That is a little \ndifferent perspective as well, rather than just saying carbon is the \nonly problem. There is a range of problems we need to deal with.\n  My preference, as I will say in my remarks, is that we should have a \nnew Manhattan Project for clean energy independence. That is the real \nway to deal with high gas prices, high electric prices, climate change, \nclean air, and the national security implications of too much \ndependence on foreign oil. But let me go back to the beginning and \nstart with some problems with this bill.\n  What is wrong with Lieberman-Warner? The first thing wrong is that \nthe Warner-Lieberman bill, according to an analysis by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, would increase the tax on gasoline by \n53 cents per gallon by the year 2030, and an additional 90 cents or so \nafter that. That's a 53-cent-per-gallon gas tax increase, according to \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. That is not some Republican policy \ngroup speaking--that is the EPA.\n  I intend, when the opportunity comes, to offer an amendment to strike \nfrom the bill the provisions that would put a 53-cent gas tax increase \non the American people. That is the first thing wrong with the bill.\n  The second thing wrong with the bill is that the Environmental \nProtection Agency says a 53-cent gas tax increase may hurt the \npocketbook of the American consumer, but it will not reduce the carbon. \nIt is not enough to cause people to drive much less and it is an \nineffective way to do what the sponsors of the bill want to do, so we \nwould have the worst of both worlds--we would be increasing the gas tax \nby 53 cents per gallon, and we would not be doing what we aim to do \nwhich is to reduce carbon with that effort.\n  The third thing wrong with the bill is it creates, over the next 10 \nyears--according to the Congressional Budget Office--what I would call \na trillion dollar slush fund. It would collect money--in effect a \ncarbon tax, through a cap-and-trade system on the entire economy of the \nUnited States--and bring it to Washington, DC, where Members of \nCongress would, over the next 40 years, create about 42 mandatory \nentitlement spending programs for that money. Nothing is more dangerous \nin Washington, DC than a $1 trillion slush fund with a group of \nCongressmen with ideas about how to spend it.\n  My cure for that, and I think there will be amendments to this \neffect, is that to the extent there is any money brought into \nWashington as a result of a cap-and-trade auction--whether it is only \non powerplants or the whole economy--that money ought to be returned \ndirectly to the taxpayers, especially the working people who will be \nhaving to pay for the higher electric rates or the higher gas prices \ncaused by this legislation.\n  Those are three problems I have with the bill. No. 1, the 53-cent-\nper-gallon gas tax increase--that is what the EPA says. I don't think \nanyone doubts that. No. 2, it doesn't work because the EPA also says--\nand so does other testimony before the committee of which Senator Boxer \nis chairman--that an economy-wide cap on fuel is not an effective way \nto reduce the amount of carbon produced, at least in the early years. \nAnd third is the trillion dollar slush fund for Members of Congress to \nuse for their own great ideas they come up with. I can't think of a \nworse way to spend the money.\n  It is well intentioned, but the bill as it has grown has become, in \neffect, with all respect, a well-intentioned contraption and it creates \nboards and czars and commissioners and money, and it is too complicated \nand too expensive. It has the potential for too many surprises. It \noverestimates what we in the United States have the wisdom to do in \nwriting legislation about an economy that produces about 30 percent of \nall the wealth in the world every year and uses 25 percent of the \nenergy. This is a very complex free market economy we have here and we \nhave to be very careful about how we affect it.\n  Having said that, would there be a better way to deal with climate \nchange? The answer is, I believe so. I wish to say briefly what I think \nthat is. I believe it would be to put a cap-and-trade system on \npowerplants alone--that is 40 percent of the carbon produced in the \nAmerican economy--and a low-carbon fuel standard on fuel. A low-carbon \nfuel standard, which is already in this legislation, is very simply the \nidea that beginning in the year 2023 we would control the amount of \ncarbon that fuel in cars and trucks could produce, and that is it. In \nother words, instead of putting cap and trade on the whole economy as \nthe Lieberman-Warner bill would do, we should only put cap and trade on \npowerplants--nothing else--and use a different approach for fuel.\n  Why would cap and trade work for powerplants? We have a lot of \nexperience with cap and trade for powerplants. Cap and trade is simply \na system of setting limits on the amount of carbon to come out of the \nsmokestacks at a powerplant--if it is a coal plant or whatever kind of \nplant it might be. We have experience with measuring that. We actually \nhave measurements for sulfur, nitrogen, and now mercury. We could do it \nfor carbon. We could select effective enforcement dates that had some \nrealistic relationship to the development of technology--for example, \nthe technology to recapture the carbon that comes out of coal plants. \nAnd, in doing so, I believe that could be an effective way to begin to \ncontrol the source of 40 percent of the carbon produced in the United \nStates--the powerplants.\n  Would it add to the cost of electricity? Yes, it would. What would we \ndo with the revenues from credits that were auctioned if there were a \ncap-and-trade system? We would give the money back. Not through a lot \nof federal spending programs, not to the State governments, not to pet \nprojects; we would give it straight back to the working people to help \npay their electric bills because they are the ones who would have those \nhigher rates.\n  That would leave manufacturers alone. It wouldn't drive them \noverseas. It would avoid setting up all these boards and commissions \nand czars and government bureaucracies.\n  Then what would we do about fuel? Already we have done the single \nmost important thing we could do as a Congress for climate change when \nwe passed higher fuel efficiency standards at the end of last year. We \ndid that in a bipartisan way, too. In 2007, we increased by 40 percent \nthe fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks in the United States \nfor the first time in over 30 years. Testimony from David Greene of the \nOak Ridge National Laboratory said that is the single most important \nthing the Congress can do to deal with climate change, overdependence \non foreign oil, or clean air. And we did it. That is the first thing.\n  But there is another step we could do and that is already in this \nbill. It is the low-carbon fuel standard that I talked\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\nabout a few moments ago. As it is now presented in the bill, it would \nrequire fuel suppliers to lower the carbon content of transportation \nfuels by 5 percent less per unit of energy in 2023, and 10 percent less \nin 2028. The advantage of a low-carbon fuel standard, unlike the cap-\nand-trade system which is ineffective in terms of reducing carbon in \nfuel, is that it would be 100 percent effective because it would \nrequire a certain amount of reduction. Second, it is the way we \nnormally deal with fuel and pollution. For example, the low-sulfur \ndiesel standards for big trucks that the Clinton EPA started and the \nBush EPA finished is making a big difference in the Smoky Mountains of \nTennessee by reducing the amount of sulfur in the air starting this \nyear. That is a form of fuel standard. This would be a low-carbon fuel \nstandard, just like the low-sulfur diesel standard is for big trucks. \nIt is simple. There would be a timeline that we could prepare for, and \nit might actually lower gasoline prices rather than adding 53 cents per \ngallon to the price of gasoline as the Lieberman-Warner bill would, \nbecause if you know that there needs to be a low-carbon fuel standard, \nthen you might, for example, choose electricity as a fuel and have a \nplug-in hybrid vehicle and that would reduce the amount of carbon for \nfuel.\n  Or you might advance research for biofuels made from crops we don't \neat, such as cellulosic ethanol, and use more of that kind of fuel. But \nwe wouldn't have Senators and Congressmen and people who are elected to \noffice making judgments about picking and choosing winners and losers.\n  If you are asking me how I would do it, I would imagine that if we \nlooked ahead a couple years and had to guess today what kind of climate \nchange legislation might actually pass the Senate, the House of \nRepresentatives, and be signed by the President, I think it will be a \nvery simple piece of legislation, probably cap and trade for \npowerplants, with effective dates regulated or adjusted to the \ndevelopment of technology that would permit powerplants to meet the \nstandards. Then, for fuel, it would be the higher fuel efficiency \nstandards we already passed into law last year, plus a low-carbon fuel \nstandard. That would cover two-thirds of the carbon we produce in the \nUnited States. The current bill only presumes to cover 85 percent. The \napproach I am suggesting would fairly distribute the burden because \nmost people buy electricity and most people buy gasoline. It should be \nlower cost, fewer surprises, and much less complicated than the bill we \nare debating in the Senate today.\n  I might add to that framework I suggested, we would take whatever \nmoney was auctioned off in the cap-and-trade system on powerplants \nand--rather than building what I call a slush fund--refund it to the \ntaxpayers. That money would come right in and go right back home, right \nback to the taxpayers. It wouldn't stop.\n  Finally, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1\\1/2\\ minutes. I stand \ncorrected. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Finally, the best way to deal with the climate change \nissue would be a different agenda--one that focuses on clean energy. I \nwould much prefer to see the Senate today talking about clean energy \nindependence rather than the President asking the Saudis to drill for \nmore oil or the Democratic majority saying: Don't explore for oil but \nraise taxes on gasoline by 53 cents per gallon. I would rather see a \nRepublican or a Democratic President work with the Congress and say: \nLet's say to the world we are going to launch a new Manhattan Project \nfor clean energy independence. So within 5 years we will be well on our \nway to saying to the Saudis: We want to be your friends, but we can \ntake or leave your oil.\n  The way to do that would be, first, to begin to do the things we know \nhow to do to increase supply. For the next 30 years, we are going to \nuse oil; it might as well be ours rather than importing it. Explore for \noil offshore, and use it from the 2,000 acres in Alaska that is next to \n13 million acres of wilderness. Then agree on six or seven grand \nchallenges, such as those I suggested at the Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory a couple of weeks ago, to give us a chance to make \nbreakthroughs that would give us that kind of clean energy \nindependence. Those would include making plug-in cars and trucks \ncommonplace, a crash program for carbon recapture, for making solar \ncosts equal or as low as fossil fuel costs, advanced research for \nbiofuels from crops that we don't eat, more new green buildings, even \nfusion for the longer term.\n  I believe from the day the American President and the Congress \nannounced to the world that we were engaged in a new Manhattan Project \nfor clean energy independence that included both supply, demand, and \nresearch, what would happen is that the rest of the world would change \nits way of thinking, that the speculators would get nervous, that the \noil-producing countries would get real, and that the price of gas would \nstabilize and eventually go down. Within 5 years, we would be well on \nour way to clean energy independence. That is the way to deal with high \ngas prices, high electric prices. That is also the way to deal with \nclean air, climate change, and the national security implications of \nour overdependence on foreign oil.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 5 minutes available for rebuttal. \nThe Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, Senator Lieberman and I had planned to \nshare this, but if Senator Warner wishes to jump in, we will try to \nyield him some time. Let me say this one more time: Every Republican \nspeaker who has come to the floor has talked about a gas tax. It in a \nway is so ironic, because when they had a chance to help us deal with \ngas prices, where were they? My friend, Senator Alexander, says gas \nprices are going up 52 cents. He didn't tell you it is over 20 years, \nfolks. He didn't tell you that, 2.5 cents a year, if he is right, and \nhe is not right. That is the outer limit. The automobile fuel economy \nstandard we passed will negate that, even if it is true. But where was \nhe? Where were they?\n  We had three initiatives, we Democrats. They said nothing. Now, when \nwe are on the brink of getting off foreign oil, getting off big oil, \nsuddenly we can do nothing. It is sad, but that is the case.\n  What we are forgetting--and not one Republican has talked about this \nissue except for Senator Warner, and I am happy to say Senator Snowe is \non her way to speak--the National Academy of Sciences concluded that \nclimate change is real, attributed to human activities, and that global \nwarming is unequivocal, and we need to do something about it.\n  The human health impacts, these come straight from the Bush \nadministration people: Increase in the frequency and duration of heat \nwaves and heat-related illness, increase in waterborne diseases, \nincreased respiratory diseases. All they can talk about is 2 cents a \nyear on gas prices, which isn't going to happen because we are going to \nget off foreign oil. Increased respiratory disease, lung disease, \nasthma, if we don't act. Children and the elderly are vulnerable. I \ndon't hear any talk about that. All we hear about is 2 cents a year on \ngas, which we are not going to see either. The polar bears, we know \nthey are in deep trouble. They are God's creatures, God's creatures. We \nhave a responsibility to protect the 40 percent of the species that \ncould be extinct.\n  Let me close my part by saying this. Evangelicals, the Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, the National Council of Churches, the Religious \nAction Center of Reform Judaism, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, \nthe Interfaith Power and Light Campaign--these dedicated religious \nleaders have joined hands with us. Why? Because they feel this is a \nmoral issue. We believe jobs will be created. Businesses will be \ncreated. Technologies will come to the fore and will solve the global \nwarming problem.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Lieberman, if he wishes \nto share it.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Is there time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield to Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before my distinguished colleague from \nTennessee leaves the floor, I listened to his proposal, just taking out \nthe power industry and use that. But the revenues you gain by your \nbill, wouldn't they be\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\nsubject to the same accusation? Is it a tax? I think it is a false \naccusation, but I think your plan is basically a part of our plan. If \nthey call our plan a tax, yours is a tax; am I correct?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I may answer the Senator briefly, the answer is, \ncorrect, to the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is all I need to know.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Except that the rest of my answer to the Senator from \nVirginia is, any increase in revenue that came into the Government as a \nresult of the cap-and-trade system on powerplants would then go \nstraight back to the working people who pay their electric bills \ninstead of coming into the unwieldy contraption this bill sets up which \ncreates what I call a slush fund.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I reply to my good friend, your plan is \njust as subject to the calls in here that it is a tax as is ours. But \nyou send it back to the taxpayers. What we do is to give it to research \nand technology to try and improve the efficiency of the spectrum of \norganizations. We will have a proper pie chart tomorrow, showing how we \ntake the money we collect and send it to research and development to \nimprove our ability to develop solar and wind and all types of things. \nThat is the difference. You are, in a sense, a tax collection agency. \nYou collect it and give it back to the people. We collect it the same \nway, but we then put it into where technology will benefit the people.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question on his time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The rebuttal time on this matter for this \nperiod has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was asking if the Senator could use some of his own \ntime.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield to the manager part of my time for the purpose of \na colloquy. The colloquy will add strength to this whole debate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is the colloquy that I believe is important because my \nfriend is so right. We approach the future with hope. We are not going \nto pull the covers over our heads. This is America. We need to lead, \nand we need to lead in technology. We know venture capitalists have \ntold us they are waiting for this bill. They are going to invest more \nin new technologies than they ever did in biotech and high tech. I wish \nto ask my friend this question: It is true that we do have a very large \ntax cut in this bill; is that not so?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the chairman is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it not so that we have a large, almost a trillion \ndollars of consumer relief that goes through the utilities to help our \nconsumers; is that not correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the chairman is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And lastly, is it not true that we have a deficit \nreduction trust fund of about a trillion dollars as well?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the chairman is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to make that point because I resent the Senator \nfrom Tennessee saying our bill is a slush fund.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I resent being resented and ask \nunanimous consent for a couple minutes to get into this colloquy, if I \nmay.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection, but where is the time coming from? I \nwould hope you could find it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. He is asking unanimous consent.\n  Mr. INHOFE. He is asking for additional time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is fine with me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am trying to get to a result here. \nEver since I have been a Senator, I have proposed a cap-and-trade \nsystem on powerplants to deal with climate change. All I am saying is \nit would be better to keep it simple, to take the money collected and \nsend it straight back home rather than bringing it up here and putting \nit in a slush fund. If ``slush fund'' is offensive to the Senator from \nCalifornia, I am sorry, but that is what large funds tend to be here. \nIt is mandatory spending that is earmarked for the next 42 years.\n  So removing that slush fund would be an improvement on their bill. \nTake that out. Send the money back to the people. Return it to the \nindividuals who paid it. That is all I am suggesting. No one ought to \nbe offended by that. If we need to invest dollars in solar research, \nfor example, I sponsored the amendment for the solar energy tax credit \nthat is in the law now. Let's do that separately and with a clear \nappropriation, rather than a 42-year mandatory spending program that is \ndrawn from $800 billion.\n  I thank the Chair and Senators for their courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may take 2 minutes off my time to say \nto my good friend, when you get up and say it is going there for the \nnext 42 years or whatever statement you made, you are incorrect. In our \nmanagers' amendment, the substitute, whatever comes up tomorrow--and \nthat will be the order of business--we explicitly give the President of \nthe United States the power at any time to come in and alter where \nthose funds go. Of course, it requires the concurrence of the Congress, \nso the Congress has a voice.\n\n  There is nothing in our bill that acts in perpetuity. If at any time \nthe President determines there is a crisis in the economy or that the \ntechnology, as required by the power sector to do the sequestration, is \nnot there, the President pulls back on the throttle.\n  So I would hope colleagues, when they get up to discuss this bill, \nrecognize that flexibility has been put in it to take care of all of \nthese situations. I hope we do not have anybody saying again: And for \n42 years this will stay in fixed cement, in place. It is not true. \nFlexibility is at every turn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, can I make a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Is the time that was used by the Senator from Virginia going to be \ntaken from his time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The reason I ask is because we have a lot of people who \nhave lined up afterwards who do not want to wait much longer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the parliamentary inquiry from the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, the time will be charged against the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself some time from the 20 \nminutes I have allotted on the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me \nexplain why. I know you are going to take it from your time, but the \nproblem is, we have two speakers on this side who are pressed for time, \nand you are actually scheduled for after these two speakers. So if you \ncould wait until your time, it would be----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, as Mr. Alexander, the Senator from \nTennessee, did, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes from my time to \nrespond to something the Senator from Tennessee said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, two points. One is on the discussion of \nan increase in the cost of gasoline. There was a lot of citing from \nSenator Alexander and others about the projection of a 53-cent increase \nper gallon of gasoline. Again, it is over 22 years, made by EPA, 2008 \nto 2030. That is about a 2-cent-plus, at the outside, per year increase \nin a gallon of gasoline.\n  I tell you, look at what it has done this year. Just this year, in 8 \nmonths: January 7, $3.11; May 26, $3.93--an 82-cent increase since the \nbeginning of this year--compared to about a 2-cent a year, outside, \nincrease projected to do something, which is to help us achieve the \npurpose of this bill, which is to reduce carbon pollution that causes \nglobal warming. That is the point.\n  The second point, and we are going to come back to this, Senator \nAlexander--and we agree--sees there is a problem. He wants to deal with \nit in a mandatory way and agrees on cap and trade. But he only wants to \ndo it for the powerplant sector. We think if you do that, and eliminate \nthe oil and fuel sector, eliminate the industrial sector,\n\n[[Page S4944]]\n\nyou are simply not going to get the reductions in carbon pollution we \nneed to reduce global warming, and you are going to diminish the \nmarketplace.\n  A lot of the companies that want to come in are going to be deprived \nof the kind of broad marketplace we believe will work best to stimulate \ninnovation and to reduce the carbon pollution that causes global \nwarming.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to claim the 30 \nminutes that was previously reserved for Senator Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise in support of the legislation that is pending and the \nsubstitute that will be offered by the chair of the committee, Senator \nBoxer, to the Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act, which is obviously \na historic measure that is a benchmark for America in confronting the \npressing and pervasive threat of global climate change.\n  This is not a Democratic issue; it is not a Republican issue. It is \nnot a conservative or liberal issue. This is a human issue. It is a \nplanetary issue. It is a moral issue. It is a matter and a question of \nstewardship, of responsibility not only to ourselves and the world in \nwhich we live but, most critically, to a future we will never inhabit \nbut will largely determine based on decisions we make now.\n  In that light, I express my profound gratitude to the chair of the \ncommittee, Senator Boxer, without whom, obviously, this simply would \nnot have been possible. I thank her for her longstanding advocacy and \nleadership, bridging the partisan divide which I think is what this \nlegislation that is pending before the Senate does--the substitute that \nwill be offered by her tomorrow--because I think it is critical we \nbegin this process in developing the United States' leadership with \nrespect to one of the most pressing and transformational issues not \nonly facing this country but the world community.\n  I also express my profound gratitude to Senator Lieberman and Senator \nWarner for their outstanding and longtime leadership as well, and for \ntheir advocacy in developing those solutions to stem global climate \nchange. It is certainly one of the most consequential issues of this \ncentury. I thank them for their vision and courage--and Senator Boxer--\nfor doing all they could to bring this legislation to this point in the \nSenate to have the first ever debate on a monumental issue that will \nreverberate for generations.\n  I have heard much here in the debate. Hopefully, I will be able to \noffer some of the counterpoints later on in the debate. I want to lay \nout my own views with respect to this issue because I think it is so \ncritical for the future of this country. I do not think we can afford \nthe option of inaction any longer. I think this is the time in which we \nhave to engage in global leadership and to lead the way on this \ncritical issue, and not to forfeit what is essential, for the United \nStates to position itself on one of the major environmental issues of \nall time.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia, for whom leadership has been the \nhallmark of his 29 years of service in the Senate. That ennobling \nquality is now on display yet again today on this vital and timely \nissue before this body.\n  We have arrived at this day, as this issue of global warming should \nno longer be open to serious skepticism. This past week, the U.S. \nGovernment released a report that concluded that climate change is \naffecting the Nation's ecosystems, causing significant changes, such as \nincreasing incidences of severe storms in some areas, and water \nscarcities from the lack of rain and snowpack in others, along with \ninsect outbreaks and forest fires.\n\n  Looking to the future, in the words of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture report, ``Even under the most optimistic carbon dioxide \nemission scenarios, important changes in sea level, regional and super-\nregional temperatures, and precipitation patterns will have profound \neffects.''\n  The bottom line is, this debate is no longer a question of science. \nIt is now a question of our political will to provide solutions to \nthese problems. I believe the substitute bill we will be debating later \non this week, with an approach that mirrors closely what Senator Kerry \nand I called for in the Global Warming Reduction Act that we introduced \nin the last two Congresses, offers a measure that anyone who has \nanalyzed the science and is honestly committed to addressing global \nwarming can support.\n  It establishes a Federal program to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas \nemissions as much as 66 percent by 2050, through a mandatory cap-and-\ntrade program that provides companies with both the flexibility and \ncertainty necessary for their continued viability and growth, while \nallowing the United States to lead the world in reducing damaging \nCO2 emissions for the generations to follow. It presents us \nwith a watershed opportunity that our obligation to the future dictates \nwe must seize now.\n  I have not come lightly or lately to this debate, having cosponsored \nthe Lieberman and McCain Climate Stewardship Act in the 108th and 109th \nCongresses, as well as the Global Warming Prevention Act as far back as \n1988, when I was a Member of the House of Representatives. So I am left \nto wonder exactly how far down the road we would be now if we had acted \nthen. That was 20 years ago, when one of the first pieces of climate \nchange legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives and \nSenate, and here we are, in 2008, and yet we have not engaged this \nissue in a proactive way as a nation.\n  Indeed, it has been my concern regarding global climate change that \nled me to accept an invitation in 2004 to be the cochair of the \nInternational Climate Change Taskforce, established by three respected \n``think tanks''--the Institute for Public Policy Research in the United \nKingdom, the Center for American Progress in the United States, and the \nAustralian Institute.\n  In working with my cochair, the Right Honorable Stephen Byers of the \nUnited Kingdom, our goal was to develop recommendations to blaze a \ntrail for engaging all countries to forge an international consensus \nfor action on climate change, including the United States, China, and \nIndia, which are not bound by the Kyoto Protocol, as we all know.\n  Subsequently, our task force published a series of recommendations in \nJanuary 2005, ``Meeting the Climate Challenge.'' Right at the top of \nour list, based on scientific consensus, was the necessity of \npreventing global temperatures from rising more than 3.6 degrees \nFahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius, over the course of this century. \nBeyond that 2-degree Celsius increase, the planet would arrive at a \ntipping point--a potential abrupt climate change that would have \ncatastrophic effects on our ecosystems and our society. Already, we \nhave witnessed the early warning signals, with the loss of Arctic Sea \nice, for instance, that appears to be accelerating faster than \nscientific models only recently predicted.\n  So what will it require to ensure we remain below the 2-degree \nCelsius tipping point? Well, currently, there exists a concentration of \n380 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the world's atmosphere. An \nincrease of 2 degrees Celsius correlates with a carbon dioxide \nconcentration at 450 parts per million. Therefore, ensuring we do not \nexceed this concentration level is absolutely essential.\n  An additional recommendation in our report calls for the G8 and other \nmajor economies, including from the developing world, to form a G8+ \nClimate Group, to involve major CO2-emitting countries in \nthe climate change debate to ultimately develop a blueprint for moving \nforward in the carbon dioxide reduction program.\n  As a result, the G8+5 Ministerial Level Group was established with \nthe five major developing countries of China, India, Mexico, Brazil, \nand South Africa. President Bush has expanded upon this idea as the \nbasis for his current Major Economies Meeting. The current G8 \npresident, the Japanese Prime Minister, is employing the same guidance \nat this summer's G8 Summit.\n  The point is, we have established we cannot risk an increase of more \nthan a 2-degree Celsius increase in global temperatures. We further \nknow that CO2\n\n[[Page S4945]]\n\nemissions contribute to global warming. There is no doubt this is an \ninternational problem requiring an international solution that must \ninclude action on behalf of the world's highest CO2 emitters \nif the effort is to be effective.\n  Indeed, our task force specifically recommended that all developed \ncountries introduce national mandatory cap-and-trade systems for carbon \nemissions, and construct these systems so they may be integrated into a \nsingle global market. And that, of course, is the linchpin of the bill \nbefore us: a mandatory domestic carbon cap-and-trade system for the \nUnited States that would achieve an actual 71 percent emissions \nreduction by 2050 for the 87 percent of the Nation's emitters that are \ncapped under the bill, with a 66 percent reduction of total U.S. \nemissions by 2050.\n  Now, I fully understand this bill represents a major new initiative \nfor the United States. Therefore, I want to underscore that this is \nnot, as some have asserted, a proposed solution to a problem that does \nnot actually exist. We are not being compelled by guesswork or by \nunsubstantiated theory or by popular perception. We are being led by \nthe facts.\n  This past year, the scientists on the United Nations \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--who shared in the 2008 Nobel \nPeace Prize--recently completed the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report, \nwhich was 6 years in the making, and drew on the work of more than \n2,500 scientists, 800 contributing authors, and 450 lead authors. As \nthe ranking member of the Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, \nFisheries, and Coast Guard, which oversees the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, I wish to congratulate the 120 NOAA \nscientists--NOAA scientists, I add--who were part of Working Group I, \nthe Physical Science Basis of the International Panel on Climate \nChange, who shared in the Nobel Peace Prize. You can see all the names \nlisted on this poster I have right here: 120 of our own scientists who \nreached the same conclusions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the names of these exceptional Federal \nscientists be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       NOAA 2007 Peace Prize List\n\n       Dan Albritton, J.K.

The IPCC's key findings were agreed to unanimously by more \nthan 130 governments, including those of the United States, China, \nIndia, and the European Union, and now are forming the basis for \ninternational policy. For the first time since its first assessment in \n1990--and I repeat, 1990--the IPCC concluded that there is at least a \n90-percent chance that manmade activities, through the burning of \nfossil fuels, are the major cause of global warming.\n  Now, if we were told in any sphere that we had at least a 90-percent \nchance of diverting a disaster through changes we ourselves could make, \nwould we not take action? Is the IPCC finding not a compelling reason \nto assume reasonable steps when climate change is occurring, even \nbeyond the projections that were outlined just decades ago?\n  So here on these charts we have some illustrations of just what the \nscience is referring to: Arctic sea ice from NASA's images taken in \n1979, 2005, and again in 2007 displaying the increase in the melting of \nthe polar ice in September when the sea ice is usually at a minimum \neach year. So you can see the differences. In 1979, when we can see the \nsea ice, we can see the masses of the sea ice, and then, of course, you \nlook progressively and see what has happened in 2005 and 2007 and you \nsee the demonstrative difference and discrepancies of what is happening \nwith the melting process just since 1979.\n  When you look at the amount of sea ice noted in September, it looked \nlike this massive amount in 1979; and here we are progressively to \n2007: Obviously, we have a serious problem that the global community \nneeds to recognize and we need to address. That is why we cannot \nforfeit our leadership in this process. It is quite obvious that more \nof the sea ice has melted than ever before. When you look at the 2007 \npicture, it obviously indicates how alarmingly the sea ice has \ndiminished, even opening the Northwest Passage. This is some of what \nthe U.S. Department of the Interior looked at when listing the polar \nbear as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, as its habitat is \nliterally melting away.\n  The May 29 U.S. Climate Change Science Program called ``The \nScientific Assessment of the Effects of Global Change in the United \nStates'' stated that the 2007 Arctic sea ices were 23 percent below the \nprevious all-time minimum observed in 2005. I will repeat that because \nthat is significant. By our own report that was issued just last week \nsaying that Arctic sea ices were 23 percent below the previous all-time \nminimum observed in 2005, in just 2 years we see a decline of more than \n23 percent. Some models suggest that the Arctic Ocean is likely to be \nfree of summer ice as soon as 2040.\n  Closer to home, the report stated that the energy sector will be \nsubject to the effects of climate change through direct impacts from \nincreased intensity of extreme weather events. Increasingly, global \ntemperatures, rising sea levels, and changing weather patterns will \npose significant challenges to the Nation's roads, airports, railways, \ntransit systems, and ports. What we are talking about is our energy and \ntransportation network that is vital not only to the entire U.S. \neconomy but to our quality of life.\n  The new facts just keep on coming. Just last month a study was \npublished in the Journal of Science called ``Expanding Oxygen Minimum \nZones in the Tropical Ocean,'' warning that marine zones where fish and \nother sea life can suffocate from lack of oxygen are spreading across \nthe world's tropical oceans. Scientists warn that if global \ntemperatures keep rising, there could be dramatic consequences for \nmarine life and for humans and communities that depend on the sea for a \nliving.\n  So let's move beyond the question of should we act, as many of our \nown States have chosen to do. Maine, California, Hawaii, Minnesota, New \nJersey, Oregon, and Washington have all had mandatory climate laws on \nthe books that mandate limits on greenhouse gas emissions. At least 23 \nStates have joined one of the three regional partnerships that will \nrequire greenhouse gas and just carbon dioxide emission reductions.\n  Set to take effect in 2009, the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas \nInitiative, known as RGGI, is a partnership of 10 Northeast and Mid-\nAtlantic States, including my own State of Maine, that creates a cap-\nand-trade system to limit carbon dioxide emissions from powerplants. \nYet while the States have moved out on the vanguard as their citizens \nhave demanded, Congress has delayed, hiding behind the red herring of \narguments of scientific uncertainty rather than considering\n\n[[Page S4946]]\n\nthe truth that peer-reviewed science has revealed.\n  The legislation before us has been crafted to respect the courageous \ninitiative of these States while recognizing that a patchwork of State-\nto-State regulation is a serious impediment for U.S. businesses and \nindustry. It does not preempt existing State policy or State authority \nto limit or to avoid greenhouse gas emissions but, rather, authorizes \ntransition funds to assist the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas \nInitiative partners, for instance, in meshing with the new Federal \nprogram if they so choose.\n  We have worked to make additional improvements to the bill that was \npassed out of the Senate Environment Committee to garner the breadth of \nsupport necessary to get this bill passed. But I think it is \nillustrative of the States' leadership that 23 States have already been \nwilling to take action, to be progressive, to understand the dimensions \nof this problem, and that they are willing to accept the challenges and \nalso the costs of being able to move forward independently and \nseparately because the Federal Government has failed to take action; \nthat the Congress has failed to take action for so long that 23 States \nacross this country have been prepared to do it.\n  So this legislation recognizes that. That is why it is important to \ngive the certainty of a Federal standard so that businesses can operate \nknowing what regulations will be in play. In fact, businesses have \njoined together with environmental organizations to reach an agreement, \nunderstanding that it is in the national interest to work in concert \nand to understand as they prepare to make the investments for 40 and 50 \nyears beyond. That is the point of having a national standard. That the \nStates have been prepared to assume that leadership irrespective of the \nfailure of the Congress to address it certainly illustrates their \nwillingness and their courage to move forward on this critical issue.\n  For those who have expressed concerns about the impact to the Federal \nbudget, this new substitute is now deficit neutral, according to a June \n2 CBO report. I ask unanimous consent to have this CBO report printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n                             (June 2, 2008)\n\n     Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2008.--A substitute \n         amendment for S. 3036 transmitted to CBO on June 2, 2008\n       Background: S. 3036 would set an annual limit or cap on the \n     volume of certain greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted from \n     electricity-generating facilities and from other activities \n     involving industrial production and transportation. Under \n     this legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     would establish three separate regulatory initiatives known \n     as cap-and-trade programs--one covering most types of GHGs, \n     one covering hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and a third program \n     to cover the carbon emissions embodied in imported goods.\n       EPA would establish a quantity of allowances for each of \n     calendar years 2012 through 2050 and would auction some of \n     those allowances. The proceeds would be used to finance \n     various initiatives, such as developing renewable \n     technologies, assisting in the education and training of \n     workers, and providing energy assistance for low-income \n     households. EPA would distribute the remaining allowances at \n     no charge, to states and other recipients, which could then \n     sell, retire, or use them, or give them away. Over the 40 \n     years that the proposed cap-and-trade programs would be in \n     effect, the number of allowances and emissions of the \n     relevant gases would be reduced each year.\n       Funds from the auction of allowances are considered to be \n     federal revenues and the spending of the auction proceeds to \n     be federal outlays. In addition, because the government would \n     be essential to the existence of the allowances and \n     responsible for the readily realizable monetary value of them \n     through its enforcement of the cap on emissions, and because \n     the market for non-HFC allowances would be relatively liquid, \n     CBO considers the distribution of those allowances at no \n     charge to be functionally equivalent to distributing cash.\n       Finally, because the receipts from selling or giving \n     allowances away would effectively be an indirect business \n     charge that reduces the federal tax base for income and \n     payroll taxes, in most cases, CBO adjusted a portion of the \n     gross gain to the federal government from auctioning and \n     giving away allowances to account for reductions in other \n     federal revenues; we assume that tax offset totals 25 \n     percent--an approximate marginal tax rate on overall economic \n     activity.\n       CBO's cost estimate for S. 2191 (the Lieberman-Warner \n     Climate Security Act of 2007), as ordered reported by the \n     Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works on December \n     5, 2007, includes a detailed discussion of how the budgetary \n     treatment of the cap-and-trade program, including a \n     discussion of how tax offsets are applied to the revenues \n     generated by allowances auctioned and given away. It also \n     describes the methodology that CBO uses for analyzing this \n     type of legislation. That estimate was provided to the \n     Congress on April 10, 2008.\n       Estimated cost of the amendment: CBO estimates that \n     enacting the amendment would increase revenues by about $902 \n     billion over the 2009-2018 period, net of income and payroll \n     tax offsets. That estimate excludes revenues from the sale of \n     international reserve allowances for imported goods because \n     CBO has not had sufficient time to analyze the impact of such \n     allowances and to assess either the number or value of those \n     allowances that would be auctioned. Over the next 10 years, \n     we estimate that direct spending would total about $836 \n     billion. That figure also excludes any spending of proceeds \n     from the auction of international reserve allowances for \n     imported goods because the spending of any such receipts \n     would be subject to future appropriation acts. The additional \n     revenues from enacting this legislation would exceed the new \n     direct spending by an estimated $66 billion, thus decreasing \n     future deficits (or increasing surpluses) by that amount over \n     the next 10 years (see table below).\n       CBO has not completed its estimate of spending that would \n     be subject to future appropriation action. Therefore, this \n     estimate does not address such spending. In years after 2018, \n     net revenues attributable to the legislation would exceed \n     annual direct spending through 2050.\n       Intergovernmental and Private-sector Mandates: The \n     amendment would impose private-sector mandates, as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA), with costs that \n     substantially exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA \n     for private-sector mandates ($136 million in 2008, adjusted \n     annually for inflation). The most costly mandates would \n     require certain private-sector entities to participate in the \n     cap-and-trade programs for greenhouse gas emissions created \n     by the bill.\n       CBO estimates that the cost of complying with those \n     mandates would total tens of billions of dollars annually.\n\n                ESTIMATED IMPACT ON REVENUES AND DIRECT SPENDING OF A SUBSTITUTE AMENDMENT TO S. 3036, TRANSMITTED TO CBO ON JUNE 2, 2008\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                             By fiscal year, in billions of dollars--\n                                         ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                            2009     2010     2011     2012     2013     2014     2015     2016     2017     2018   2009-2013  2009-2018\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  CHANGES IN REVENUES a\n \nProceeds from Auctioning Allowances:\n    Allocated for Government Activities.      0.7      0.7      0.8     17.8     18.2     19.3     20.3     21.3     22.3     26.0      38.1      147.3\n    Allocated for Spending Subject to         0.5      0.5      0.6     11.0     11.7     12.3     13.9     15.1     16.1     18.1      24.3       99.9\n     Appropriation......................\n    Free Allocation of Allowances.......        0        0     19.6     83.1     84.4     83.6     88.4     93.9     98.8    102.3     187.1      654.1\n    Other Revenues......................        0        *        *        *        *        *        *      0.1      0.1      0.1       0.1        0.3\n        Total Estimated Revenues........      1.2      1.3     21.0    111.8    114.3    115.2    122.6    130.4    137.3    146.5     249.6      901.6\n \n                                                               CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nSpending from Auction Proceeds:\n    Estimated Budget Authority..........      0.9      1.0      1.0     23.7     24.3     25.8     27.0     28.4     29.7     34.6      50.8      196.4\n    Estimated Outlays...................        0      0.2      0.5      5.6     11.3     16.4     21.3     24.8     26.7     28.5      17.5      135.2\nSpending from Freely Allocated Emission\n Allowances:\n    Estimated Budget Authority..........        0        0     19.6     88.5     90.2     89.7     94.8    100.9    106.2    110.1     198.3      700.0\n    Estimated Outlays...................        0        0     19.6     88.5     90.2     89.7     94.8    100.9    106.2    110.1     198.3      700.0\nTVA and Other Spending:\n    Estimated Budget Authority..........        0        *        *        *        *        *      0.1      0.1      0.3      0.5         *        1.0\n    Estimated Outlays...................        0        *        *        *        *        *      0.1      0.1      0.3      0.5         *        1.0\nTotal Changes:\n    Estimated Budget Authority..........      0.9      1.0     20.7    112.2    114.4    115.5    122.0    129.3    136.1    145.2     249.1      897.3\n    Estimated Outlays...................      0.1      0.2     20.1     94.1    101.4    106.1    116.2    125.7    133.1    139.1     215.8      836.1\n \n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\n \n                                NET CHANGE IN THE BUDGET DEFICIT OR SURPLUS FROM CHANGES IN REVENUES AND DIRECT SPENDING\n \nImpact on Deficit/Surplus b.............      1.2      1.1      0.9     17.8     12.9      9.2      6.3      4.7      4.2      7.4      33.8       65.5\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNotes: * = less than $50 million; TVA = Tennessee Valley Authority.\nComponents may not sum to totals because of rounding.\nThe bill would affect spending subject to appropriation, but CBO has not yet completed its estimate of such spending.\na Revenue estimate does not include proceeds from the sale of international reserve allowances for imported goods.\nb Positive numbers indicate decreases in deficits (or increases in surpluses); negative numbers indicate increases in deficits (or decreases in\n  surpluses).\n\n       The amendment also contains several intergovernmental \n     mandates as defined in UMRA. CBO estimates that, during the \n     first five years following enactment, states would realize a \n     net benefit as a result of this bill's enactment (resulting \n     from the allowances they would receive). Therefore, the \n     annual threshold for intergovernmental mandate costs \n     established in UMRA ($68 million in 2008, adjusted annually \n     for inflation) would not be exceeded.\n       Previous CBO estimates: On April 10, 2008, CBO transmitted \n     a cost estimate for a substitute amendment to S. 2191, the \n     Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act of 2007, as ordered \n     reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works on December 5, 2007. That substitute amendment to S. \n     2191 was introduced as S. 3036, the Lieberman-Warner Climate \n     Security Act of 2008, on May 20, 2008. CBO has estimated the \n     budgetary impact of those versions of this legislation as \n     follows:\n       S. 2191, as ordered reported by the Senate Environment and \n     Public Works Committee on December 5, 2007, would increase \n     deficits (or decrease surpluses) by $15 billion over the \n     2008-2017 period; and\n       An amendment to S. 2191 that was introduced as S. 3036 on \n     May 20, 2008, would reduce deficits (or increase surpluses) \n     by $78 billion over the 2008-2017 period.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Susanne S. Mehlman. \n     Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Neil Hood. \n     Impact on the Private Sector: Amy Petz.\n       Estimate approved by: Theresa Gullo, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. At the same time, the bill also allows us to respond to \nthe complex issues of curbing greenhouse gas emissions while squarely \nconfronting the argument that reducing carbon dioxide emissions will \ndamage our economy. To the contrary, funds generated for the Federal \nGovernment from this auction of carbon emission allowances that are \nestablished under this legislation can be held, purchased, or sold in \nthe program's first 18 years so that it can generate $1 trillion for \nclean technology, in worker training and retraining programs.\n  Moreover, the bill provides funding to help industry meet the new \nemissions targets not just in the short term but all the way through \n2050. So it has a long-term view and also accepts the long-term \nresponsibilities and obligations that accompany this legislation. It \nalso encourages low and zero carbon technologies that would change as \nthe technologies are developed and come on line by placing a cost on \ngreenhouse gas emissions. But it also offers the private sector the \ncertainty they require with respect to the laws they must comply with \nwell into the future before they invest in low and zero carbon \ntechnologies. That is important so that businesses not only understand \nthe standards that will be established for the next 40 to 50 years; it \nalso is logical for them in terms of making their decisions, their \nfinancial investments, and understanding what the long term will \nprescribe.\n  In addition, this bill provides a range of funding incentives from \nmanufacturers of high efficiency consumer products, manufacturers with \nzero and low carbon generation technology, advanced coal technology, \nfuel from cellulosic biofuels, electric vehicles, hybrid or plug-in \nelectric cars, fuel-cell-powered cars, and advanced diesel--all areas \nof potential future economic growth that should put America well on its \nway toward developing the alternative technologies that are so \nessential to making us independent of fossil fuels.\n  The substitute legislation to the Climate Security Act also adds $800 \nbillion through 2050 for a tax relief package to help consumers with \nenergy costs that will be developed by the Senate Finance Committee. It \nalso will provide $250 billion in funding through 2050 from auction \nrevenues for States to assist them in protecting against possible \nfuture effects of climate change such as storm surges and rising sea \nlevels in coastal States. In addition, $566 billion will be provided \nthrough 2050 for States that take action to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions and that the funding can be used for specific State purposes \nsuch as the LIHEAP program and energy efficiency programs as well.\n  I am also pleased that the Climate Security Act has included language \nfrom a bill that Senator Klobuchar and I introduced establishing a \nrobust tracking system to inventory greenhouse gas emissions from \nsignificant sources across this country. This was a critical first step \nthat the European Union did not have in place when instituting their \nemissions training system, and as a result of this lack of accurate \ndata, they gave away too many allowances to industry that could be \ntraded, and the carbon market bottomed out.\n  The substitute further includes strong market oversight provisions \nfrom legislation that Senator Feinstein and I introduced to ensure \nprice transparency and prevent market manipulation and other abusive \npractices when carbon emission allowances are sold in the carbon market \ncreated by this legislation.\n  This bill is not perfect, but in fact it does go hand in hand with \nrobust economic growth. The science of the matter tells us that \nbusiness as usual certainly is not an option. Adhering to the status \nquo will continue current U.S. job losses to other countries that must \nbe brought under the same umbrella for greenhouse gas reductions as we \nare attempting to do with this legislation through international \nmechanisms and partnerships. There should be no reason for good U.S. \njobs to move overseas and be lost to those countries with no checks on \ntheir lax environmental laws.\n  The only other alternative which some of my colleagues and economists \nhave called for is a carbon tax. Yet those in favor of a carbon tax and \nnot a free market cap-and-trade system cannot guarantee that a tax will \nachieve the necessary environmental protection. If a tax is set too \nlow, companies will simply pay the tax without reducing emissions. If a \ntax is set too high, unnecessary costs will be imposed upon businesses \nand consumers, especially on low-income Americans. A flexible but \nmandatory cap and trade allows market forces to find the lowest cost \nsolutions for the desired level of environmental protection.\n  Additionally, according to the Government's own Energy Information \nAgency, under this legislation the U.S. gross domestic product will \ncontinue to grow. In 2003, the EIA finds that the GDP would be just 3 \npercent lower than under a ``business as usual'' scenario.\n  At the same time, the largest proportion of revenues--hundreds of \nbillions of dollars that this legislation will generate through the \ntransaction of carbon credits--will be designated to develop and deploy \ntechnologies to transform existing energy sectors and to create \nentirely new green industries such as solar, wind, renewable \nindustries, cellulosic biofuels, hybrid, plug-in cars, as I mentioned \npreviously, as well as high-paying jobs and to wean us off carbon \ndioxide-polluting fossil fuels.\n  As we look to the future, we must also be reminded that reducing our \ncarbon emissions means reducing our use of oil. When we spend more than \n$500 billion purchasing imported oil, helping to finance the radical \nambitions of radical leaders, do we really want to say we are unable to \nsummon the innovative can-do spirit on which this country was built to \nbreak our dependence on fossil fuel and foreign oil? This\n\n[[Page S4948]]\n\nlegislation is a monumental step forward in severing that bond and \nadvancing our energy security and our national security, and we must \nnot wait a moment longer.\n  Mr. President, I would prefer that the Substitute bill contain \nmeasures to update the means by which the U.S. prioritizes its \nscientific research . . . reports this research to stakeholders and \nCongress to assist in decisionmaking . . . and transmits this \ninformation to planners who must establish mitigation and adaptation \nplans at local, state, and regional levels. The Global Change Research \nImprovement Act I have introduced with Senator Kerry that has already \npassed out of the Commerce Committee addresses this issue and should be \nconsidered in the context of this bill.\n  Moreover, Senator Kerry and I have an amendment requiring the \nNational Academy of Sciences to advise Congress to act if future \nscientific research demonstrates that changes must be considered to \nmeet percentage emissions reductions goals.\n  Ultimately, however, there should be no misunderstanding--\nthissubstitute bill represents the defining opportunity of this 110th \nCongress for reversing the unmitigated damage that climate change \ncontinues to cause, and to assist every State in its ability to adapt. \nAnd if the UnitedStates is to meet its commitments made under the Bali \nRoadmap to reach an international agreement among all countries for \ngreenhouse gas emissions reductions for common but differentiated \nobligations by December of 2009, we should also say ``yes'' to the \namendment Senator Biden will offer to set us on the right course for \nthis process. This week and next, over 2,000 U.N. delegates from around \nthe world are meeting in Bonn, Germany, to take the next steps forward \nfor the Bali Roadmap--and what we do right here and right now is \nenormously critical in their planning for moving forward.\n  Let us not allow this opportunity to slip out of our grasp--the world \nis watching and waiting to see what the world's richest country--and \nits biggest emitter--has the fortitude to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am going to just take a second on the \nrebuttal time, and then I am going to go ahead and yield to the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. But my distinguished colleague, the junior Senator \nfrom California, several times talked about tax relief. I think it is \ntime that we take this out, look at it, and put this issue to sleep.\n  At a press conference on June 2, the distinguished Senator said:\n\n       Today is the day to say yes to clean energy, yes to green \n     jobs, yes to science, yes to energy independence, yes to tax \n     relief.\n\n  Later on in the same news conference:\n\n       We also have in this bill a very large piece, almost $1 \n     trillion of tax relief so that when we do see some energy \n     increases in energy costs in the early years, electricity, \n     for example, we can offset that.\n\n  In other words, send that back to those people as tax relief.\n  This bill has one of the largest tax cuts we have seen around this \nplace in a long time. What does the bill say about this? It says the \ntax relief in the bill is a nonbinding sense of the Senate that says \nsome funds ``should be'' used to protect consumers from the coming \n``increases in energy and other costs.'' Here is the quote:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that funds deposited in the \n     Climate Change Consumer Assistance Fund under section 583 \n     should be used to fund a tax initiative to protect consumers, \n     especially consumers in greatest need, from increases in \n     energy and other costs.\n\n  Now, I only say here that this does not direct any money to be paid. \nIt doesn't authorize any money to be paid. Besides, if it did, it would \nhave to go to the Finance Committee. So there is no tax relief in the \nbill.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Is the Senator from New Hampshire \ntaking the time of the Senator from Tennessee?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his \ncourtesy in finding a spot for me to speak.\n  This is obviously a bill of immense proportions and implications for \nus as a nation, for our economy, for consumers, for our place in the \nworld, and for how we deal with the passing on of the quality of life \nthat we have to our children so they can live in an environment that \nwill sustain them and be sure that we do not overly pollute our world \nor atmosphere.\n  I think the Senator from California needs to be congratulated for \nmoving the initiative forward. It is my opinion that this is a debate \nthat needs to be pursued aggressively. I respect all the different \nparties' views on this. There has been an excellent discussion of how \nto proceed in this area.\n  In the past, I have strongly supported initiatives that are similar \nto this effort, in the sense that they tried to reduce the amount of \npollutants we put into our atmosphere through a variety of different \nmeans. The Lieberman-McCain bill and the Carper-Alexander bill, both of \nwhich I have supported, had attempted to do this also.\n  This bill, however, is much more comprehensive, much more extensive, \nand the implications are far greater to our economy and to our quality \nof life in the United States.\n  It is safe to say that were this bill to become law in its present \nform, it would impact our future as much as anything that we could do--\nafter addressing the issue of defeating global terrorism as they \nattempt to try to destroy our culture--and making sure we are fiscally \nsolvent as a result of the cost of programs we already have on the \nbooks, such as entitlements. So it is a tremendous issue and deserves \nserious and thoughtful consideration, which it is getting so far in \nthis debate.\n  I respect both sides of the argument. I find myself, on this issue, \nin a variety of different camps because I am attracted to parts of the \nbill, and I find parts of the bill to be very difficult. I am not going \nto get into all the different elements. I am concerned about the effect \non our competitiveness internationally. I am concerned that if we put \nlimitations on our economy in place, economies such as India and China, \nwhich will not be subject to these limitations, will simply pursue \ncourses that will end up polluting at a rate that overwhelms whatever \nwe save and that, as a practical matter, we may significantly undermine \nour competitiveness.\n  I am concerned about how this cap-and-trade issue is going to work. I \nam concerned that NOX and carbon are not addressed. I am \nconcerned that we are looking at an issue of how the science is not up \nto speed with the requirements being put on the industries that must \nreduce their pollution, or NOX itself. There is a legitimate \nquestion of whether we are putting the cart before the horse relative \nto the science of the capacity to deliver these savings. For example, \nin the area of savings and the reduction of pollutants, I believe \nstrongly that we need to pursue a much more aggressive policy in the \narea of nuclear. But the question of whether we can bring on line the \nnuclear generating capacity necessary to meet the requirements of this \nbill is very much an issue and very much in doubt, simply because of \nour permitting procedure in this country, coupled with the fact that \nthe industrial complex in this country doesn't have the capacity to \nproduce the nuclear plants in the timeframe necessary in order to \ncomply with what would be the reduction necessary in this bill. Those \nare some of my concerns.\n  Again, I come back to the fact that I think the concept of cap and \ntrade, as proposed in the bill, is a path we need to seriously consider \ngoing down. However, on a parallel path, I have a very severe concern, \nserious concern, and that is that this bill, under its present \nstructure, is going to generate value of approximately $6.7 trillion \nover its life. Over the next 10 years, it is estimated that the sale of \nthese allowances will approximately be a billion dollars. Most of this \nwill come into the Federal Treasury--not all of it--and then under this \nbill it gets spent, for the most part. There is $800 million set aside, \ntheoretically, but it is done by a sense of the Senate, as was noted. \nThe vast majority of the money gets spent by creating new programmatic \nactivity and expanding the size of the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\n  Now, this $6.7 trillion is costs that will be passed on to the \nAmerican consumer in the form of increased electrical bills. I think \nthe American consumer is willing to pay a higher price for electricity \nif they feel they are significantly and positively impacting the \nreduction of the emission of greenhouse gases that are affecting our \nclimate. I am willing to vote for putting that type of cost into place. \nBut what I am not willing to vote for is taking that money and using it \nto radically expand the size of the Federal Government.\n  If you look at the proposals in the bill, it essentially becomes the \nmost massive exercise at earmarking we have ever seen. It dwarfs the \nfarm bill, which is hard to do, when it comes to earmarks. As a very \npractical matter, that is not fair to working Americans. Working \nAmericans, under this bill, are going to be hit with a new consumption \ntax. That is what this bill does. It creates a massive new consumption \ntax, called allowances, which get sold, but the price of paying for \nthose allowances will go back into the rate base and will raise the \ncost of electricity and will be a consumption tax.\n  Americans, working at their jobs and trying to make ends meet, trying \nto take care of their families, are going to see their energy bills go \nup because they will get hit with this new consumption tax. I believe \nvery fervently that if we are going to go down this road of creating \nthis massive new consumption tax, the purpose of which is to promote \nthe reduction of greenhouse gases, which will reduce our negative \nimpact on the global climate, we need, at the same time, to reduce for \nworking Americans the burden of their taxation in other places. This \nshould be a one-for-one trade, very simply. If we are going to say to \nworking Americans that we are going to increase your consumption tax by \n$6.7 trillion, or if you take out the money that is under here and \nrepresented as a sense-of-the-Senate tax reduction, it will be around \n$4-plus trillion--if you are going to have that type of major tax \nimpact and essentially shift the economy to a national consumption \ntax--and many States have those consumption taxes, but there is no \nnational one. If you are to shift to a national consumption tax, then \nyou need to take those dollars and reduce the burden on working \nAmericans, one for one, so you mitigate the impact on their quality of \nlife, on their ability to be productive citizens, and on their ability \nto pursue a lifestyle they can afford.\n  There are a variety of ways to do this. You can reduce income taxes. \nYou can take the consumption tax, which is going to flow into the \nTreasury, and move it to the reduction of income tax rates or you can \ntake the consumption tax, which is going to fall under the Federal \nTreasury through these allowances, and you can use it to reduce the \nFICA tax, the Social Security tax, which is an across-the-board tax \nthat all Americans pay or you can take the consumption tax, which is \ngoing to be generated by this bill, and you can use it under some sort \nof rebate proposal such as that which has been proposed by the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, where people making less than $150,000 would get a \nrebate reflecting the amount of money coming into the Treasury under \nthe allowances.\n\n  Have I used 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for another 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will yield my good friend a minute or \ntwo off my time. Several Senators, including myself, are waiting to \ntalk. I yield him 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 more minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, what we should not do with this major new consumption \ntax is use it to expand the size of the Federal Government, to put in \nplace a series of initiatives that are essentially being used for the \npurpose of building constituencies that will support this bill. That is \nthe way legislation passes here, but it is wrong--wrong when we did it \nin agriculture and especially wrong when we do it in the energy \nproduction area.\n  American consumers should not be hit with this tax and have no tax \ncut or rebate coming to them on the other side of the ledger to try to \nmitigate the impact of this consumption tax.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know there is rebuttal time now. I \nintend only to speak for a short period of time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was going to answer the Senator's \nquestions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield 3 minutes of the rebuttal time to Senator \nWarner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I was interested in the comments the \nSenator made. What the Senator has described--tomorrow, I will have a \nbetter pie chart for colleagues to look at. The money that comes in \nthrough the bill is to be distributed primarily to companies, entities \ndeveloping new technology as to how to solve the very question the \nSenator raises; namely, will technology be available for the \nsequestration? So it is not as if it is going to be distributed similar \nto leaflets and dropped all over. This money is going for the purpose \nof trying to improve America's sources of energy.\n  Mr. GREGG. According to the earmark list I have, $191 billion goes to \nworker training, $171 billion goes to mass transit projects, $237 \nbillion goes to natural resource and wildlife adaptation, $288 billion \ngoes to Federal programs of natural resources, $342 billion goes to \ninternational climate change, $300 billion goes to agriculture and \nforestry, and $368 billion goes to reforestation. Under these numbers, \nonly $136 billion out of the trillions of dollars goes to energy \nefficiency block grants, and that is for local governments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, give me until tomorrow. He reads \noff correctly some of the allocations, but each of them has some \nbenefit to the problem of the CO2 and global climate change; \neach one is carefully thought through. So tomorrow I will be able to \ngive this to you in greater detail, once we get before us the actual \namendment or the bill that we are going to hopefully continue to debate \nwith the amendment process.\n  The second question the Senator asked about was the nuclear program. \nThere is nothing in any of the bills that have been put into the record \nthus far, but I have the amendment here to initiate a very significant \nprogram to address what the distinguished Senator said is the need for \nnuclear power to begin to expand, using the current base, which, as he \nwell knows, and I know, has been reduced in the last 12 to 14 years to \nwhere it is hardly in existence, either manufacturing or \neducational. But I have that handled.\n\n  Lastly, I hope the Senator will spend a little time on a provision I \nhave in this bill by which the President of the United States is given \nauthority to at any time correct inequities or problems he thinks are \nincorrect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Have I not 17 minutes also?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has reserved 2 \nminutes of her rebuttal time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I can finish my 17 minutes and yield it back for the \nbenefit of other colleagues because I have had my fair share talking \nabout this bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, I thank \nhim for a meeting in his office where he gave me this great idea. As a \nresult of that meeting, I say to Senator Gregg, we took another look at \nthe bill. Half of the bill is going back to consumers. Actually, a \nthird of that--there are three pies: $800 billion goes into a tax cut. \nSenator Inhofe said it is not specific. We did it as far as we could. \nWe know it is a fund for tax cuts. There is $900 billion for a deficit \nreduction trust fund, and $900 billion goes into a fund so that \nutilities can help our consumers. I thank him for that contribution.\n  When my friend came before the committee, I was so hopeful he would \njoin with us because Senator Gregg made a beautiful statement. He said:\n\n       States alone can't solve the problem. I believe Congress \n     must take action to limit the\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\n     emissions of greenhouse gases from a variety of sources.\n\n  He talked about mandatory limits on greenhouse gases. I honestly \nthought this bill we worked on would be something my friend could \nsupport.\n  I will say, to talk about a consumption tax, you can make up anything \nand call it what you will. There is no consumption tax in this bill. \nThis bill is modeled on the acid rain bill. The acid rain bill works \nthe same way--cap and trade. No one ever called that a consumption tax.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may return to my allocation of 17 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I also say to my friend from New Hampshire, I call to his \nattention section 434, in which Congress has oversight on the use of \nthese funds. Congress can change them.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is what I worry about.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I recognize he has a point there.\n  This situation, where I devised a provision to give the President the \nauthority, in my view--in earlier days, I was in aviation. \nUnfortunately, I never fully succeeded to become an aviator. We used to \nhave a stick in the old days, before all this other stuff, when we had \ntandem seats--believe it or not, I flew in those old planes--you pull \nthe stick forward, pull it back, roll it. The President has the stick, \nand he can change this if this bill is wrong. But we have to get this \ntrain out of the station and start it rolling down the rails.\n  Fifty States are trying to devise their own framework of laws now. \nThat has to be a nightmare to industry and particularly the power \ncompanies that have to serve a multiple of States.\n  We simply have to show the world this country can lead, and no one is \na stronger leader than the Senator from New Hampshire in this body. He \nunderstands that.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a brief \nintercession.\n  Mr. WARNER. Go ahead.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree. In fact, the Senator from California clearly \nstates my position, which is I support initiatives in this area. I \nsupport mandatory initiatives in this area. What I am concerned about \nis that these allowances--which really are a consumption tax, in my \nopinion--will essentially be used to greatly expand the Government. If \nwe were to take that section out of the bill and just basically take \nthose dollars and give them back to the taxpayers without having this \nhuge section which essentially creates huge new initiatives in all \nsorts of different areas, I think you would have a very workable bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, where do we get the money to \nperfect sequestration? That troubles me the most. I do not think \nscience has proven that we can actually capture the CO2, \ncost effectively transfer it, and put it safely into some type of \nrepository, an old gas well.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield further, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. If we are going to limit dollars spent to technology \nadvancement, I guess I could be receptive to that, some percentage. But \nthe vast majority of the dollars--that is not going to take that many \ndollars compared to the money we are dealing with here, $6.7 trillion. \nIf you want to take some percentage of that and use it for expansion of \ntechnology purely on the technology side, that may make sense. This \nbill goes way beyond that. It has all sorts of initiatives in here \nwhich are only at the margin of the issue of technology, in my opinion. \nWhere the dollars really should go is to reduce the tax burden for the \npeople who are going to have the higher energy prices.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply say to my good friend, we have a \ndifference of opinion.\n  I will conclude my remarks. I congratulate the managers of this bill, \nthe distinguished Senator from California and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. I have been here a few years. I know about managing \nbills. I have had that privilege many times. But it has been done \nfairly, equitably, and in a civil way on a highly controversial \nsubject. May it remain for the balance of the time that this \ninstitution, I hope, votes for this bill and comes up with some \nsolution to the problem. We simply cannot do nothing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my 5-minute \nrebuttal time I would normally use be added to my statement after the \nconclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Idaho since he has time \nallocated now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill, the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee for the debate \nthat has gone on.\n  The chairman was opining a few moments ago that the debate today had \nbeen focused on gas and high gas prices and that somehow her bill was \ngoing to push gas prices even higher. That may happen. I don't know \nthat. What I do know today is that the American consumer is fed up with \n$4 gas, and anything we do that would even risk pushing gas prices \nhigher ought to make the American consumer mighty unhappy.\n  So I say to the chairman tonight, I am not going to talk gas prices, \nI am going to talk something different because I was convinced, based \non my time on the Environment and Public Works Committee and having \ncrafted a bill that got hearings, got a markup, and was ready to come \nto the floor when the chairman's staff took it, turned it inside out, \nand brought it back to the floor in an unheard document, I was \nconvinced then gas prices were going to go up, and I think my \ncolleagues this afternoon who have spoken openly in opposition to this \nbill have strongly made the case that the American consumer is going to \npay mightily for this bill that is before us if, in fact, it becomes \nlaw.\n\n  So I am a bit puzzled when I hear the title of ``Climate Security \nAct.'' I am confident that this might protect the environment, but what \ndoes it do for people? What does it do for the consumer who is going to \nbe put through a financial wringer, not only with their home heating \nbill but continually at the gas pump, if the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senator Boxer, has her way?\n  Why don't we call this bill the China-India Economic Stimulus Act of \n2008, because clearly those countries that are rapidly becoming the \nlargest emitters of greenhouse gas are going to be allowed to run free \nin the world economy while we put the clamps on our economy. That is a \nreality we all know and to which the American consumer has already \nreacted. Fewer jobs in our country, more jobs in China--does that make \neconomic sense at a time when our economy is struggling? We are just \ngoing to stick another hole in our economy and send those jobs to India \nor China? Or maybe we could call this the U.S. Recessions Act of 2008.\n  I have said it, I believe it, I have been in this Congress 28 years, \nand I have never seen a piece of legislation to equal this one. It is \nthe largest single redistribution of wealth in our country ever tried \nby the human mind through the public policy process. To me, that is \nfrightening--frightening for my grandchildren and their future, \nfrightening for the Idaho economy, frightening for the U.S. economy. \nAnd what are we going to do about it? We are going to stand here and \nsay: But it saves the world. I am not going to argue that the world \nisn't worth saving because I want to spend a few more years in it, but \nI want to make darn sure the world in which I live and my children live \nis a world that is at least as good as the one we have today from the \nstandpoint of the environment and from the standpoint of the economy \nand the economic opportunities that come from that economy for my \nchildren and my grandchildren.\n  Is this micromanagement as I describe it? We just heard the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire begin to worry about $100 billion here, $100 billion \nthere, and $100 billion over here, and the Senator from Virginia says: \nWell, we have to have some money. Yes, we do, but we are talking \ntrillions of dollars. That is $6.7 trillion. And last I calculated it, \nthat is a lot of money and it is going to be taken from the pockets of \nthe American consumer,\n\n[[Page S4951]]\n\npassed through Government, and handed out in a variety of ways yet to \nbe determined by the bureaucracy.\n  OK, that is all I am going to say about the economy of this bill.\n  When we were marking up another bill that never made it to the floor, \nI wanted to talk about substantive efforts, such as sequestration and \nrevitalizing the American landscape in a way where we truly could take \ncarbon out of the atmosphere and put it into plants and put it in roots \nand put it in tree stumps and tree stems in a way that was true, vital, \npositive environmental sequestration of carbon. I was told: No, you \ncouldn't do that. Oh, no, no. The chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee said: No, you can't do that; we won't allow that \nkind of amendment. We are not going to have forestry in this bill. You \nbring your amendments to the floor, Senator Craig. And that was the way \nthe bill was crafted.\n  All of a sudden, we get to the floor, and guess what is in the bill: \na 10-percent carbon credit for companies that invest in foreign \nforests--not U.S. forests, not the Payette National Forest in Idaho or \nthe San Bernardino National Forest in California where 60 percent of it \nis dead and dying. No, we can't do that. It has to go to the Brazilian \nrain forest.\n  I am not going to debate rain forest politics tonight, but I will \ntell you that if we are going to tax the American people to improve the \nforested landscape of America, then by darn we ought to invest it in \nour landscape and not in Brazil's landscape or China's landscape. But \nthat is what this bill does.\n  With that in mind, let me talk about forestry and forestry \nsequestration and what happens when you have a young, vital, growing \nforest across America and its ability to pull carbon down out of the \natmosphere and store it in tree trunks, not just for a year or two or \nthree but hundreds of years. It is the single greatest form of \nsequestering carbon from the environment that man ever thought about \nbecause Mother Nature was well ahead of the game before we came along \nand began to mess up the environment. Yet this bill does nothing about \nit.\n  The reason I get a little excited about this idea is because of, in \nthe year 2000, in Belgium, a climate change conference. It was the last \nyear of the Clinton administration, and they were trying to give away \nour forest credits to the world to try to convince them we believed in \nKyoto. I stayed up 24 hours straight to stop them from giving away our \nability to use our forest to sequester carbon out of the atmosphere \ninto foliage and trees. I won and they lost. Now the world has changed \nand we can measure the reality of forest sequestration and we are not \nallowed to do it in a comprehensive way? That is where we are in this \ndebate.\n  Fast forward with me, if you will, to where we are in the health of \nAmerica's forests today. We have over 180 million acres of dead and \ndying forest in our country. They are no longer pulling carbon out of \nthe atmosphere and bringing it down, they are doing what a tree does \nwhen it dies--they are releasing it back into the atmosphere.\n\n  We have unprecedented rates of forest burn in America today that we \nhaven't seen in 60 to 70 years. That is what is happening in American \nforests--last year, 9.2 million acres, 2 million of it right in my home \nState of Idaho. The beautiful, clear, blue skies of Idaho were full of \nsmoke all summer. Why? Because of a forest management and policy that \nis now simply allowing that to happen and because of a forest whose \nhealth is in such a state of dying, decaying, bug-killed trees, our \ngreat forests are now beginning to release carbon into the atmosphere \nat a higher rate.\n  This year alone, you would say: Well, Senator, we are not in the \nforest fire season in the West. No, we are not. But since January 1 \nthrough May 30, we have already burned 1.49 million acres of forested \nlands across our Nation. We have seen them burning in Florida and other \nplaces. What are they doing? They are releasing carbon into the \natmosphere.\n  The reason I bring this chart along tonight is because it tells the \nstory of the tragedy of the American forest. See this line? This is a \nresult of a history of our forests as they evolve and they grow and \nthey live and they die. We went through a period in the late 1920s and \nearly 1930s of climate change, where we weren't hustling around trying \nto change the world but Mother Nature was changing, and we had a dust \nbowl era and we began to learn about El Nino and La Nina and Pacific \ndecibel oscillation and all the changes going on in our environment \nthat created a tragedy in our forests as they grew dry. And we began to \nsee phenomenal fire burns in the late 1800s through the early 1900s, up \nuntil about 1920, when our Forest Service decided to change policy and \ngo after fires. Now, remember, fires are burning, releasing carbon into \nthe atmosphere at a tonnage rate unprecedented, at least in man's \nhistory.\n  Why did it plummet and why did forests become a sequesterer of carbon \nagain instead of a releaser of carbon? Because we established a policy \ncalled 10 a.m. That is right, 10 a.m. in the morning. The U.S. Forest \nService said that a fire that started the day before, we are going to \nhave it out by 10 a.m. the next morning. And so we put phenomenal \nresources into putting out fires.\n  After World War II, when all the young men came home who had been \njumping out of airplanes in Europe, they became smoke jumpers and \ndropped down on small fires and put them out. And the era of the smoke \njumper in the U.S. Forest Service was born.\n  And what happened? It is right here on the chart. Forest fires \nplummeted, down to a period in 1945 on--1950s, 1960s--in which we \nsimply weren't burning. We were putting out fires. And our forests \nbecame a net sequesterer of carbon.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I ask my friend to allow me to take \nthe floor for a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would be happy to yield to the leader.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize because you were really getting wound up.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will not lose my momentum. I will keep it right here, \nMr. Leader.\n  Mr. REID. We have been trying to get this done, and I have just \nspoken to the Republican leader. I have spoken to Chairman Judd Gregg \nand Chairman Kent Conrad, so we are ready to do a unanimous consent \nrequest regarding the budget.\n\n\n               Unanimous Consent Request--S. Con. Res. 70\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous \norder with respect to the conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. \n70 be modified to provide that the Senate may utilize the available \ndebate time, notwithstanding the absence of the official papers on the \nconference report filed in the House on May 20, 2008, and printed in \nthe Congressional Record beginning on page H4217, and the Senate being \nin possession of the Senate official copy of the conference report; and \nthat the Senate proceed to utilize the debate time on Wednesday, June \n4--that is tomorrow--at 11:30 a.m., following a period of morning \nbusiness, and upon the use of the time specified in the previous order, \nthe Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the conference report at \n11:45 a.m.; provided further that if the Senate fails to receive a \nmessage that the House has adopted the conference report by Tuesday, \nJune 17, the Senate adoption of the conference report be vitiated; \nfurther, that if the vote is vitiated, then the previous order modified \nby this request remain in effect.\n  Further, Mr. President, I will say that we will firmly adhere to the \n11:30 a.m. tomorrow morning, and 11:45 a.m., no matter what happens in \nmorning business or extensions of time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be approved. As I have said, I have \njust spoken to the majority leader and Mr. Schiappa, and this has all \nbeen cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I said the majority leader, but I meant the Republican \nleader, although I do talk to myself on occasion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, while the Senate majority leader is still \non the floor, I want to talk about a fire that happened in his State \njust a few years ago because I was directly involved with that Senator \nin recognizing the dead and dying conditions of the Tahoe\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\nBasin in both Nevada and California. He came to the committee--the \ncommittee that I chaired at the time--and said: We have to fix this \nproblem; a lot of people live in that area. And we did. We sent money \nout to the U.S. Forest Service to get in and change the character of \nthat dead and dying forest. But the courts and the environmental groups \nwould not allow it to happen. Lawsuit after lawsuit stopped it. And a \nyear ago, the Tahoe Basin burned--3,100 acres, 250 homes, and what is \nmore important, or as important, 140,000 tons of carbon released into \nthe atmosphere.\n  Do you know the second largest releaser of carbon into the \natmosphere, after coal-fired utilities? Forest fires. The second \nlargest releaser of carbon into the atmosphere. Yet this bill does \nnothing about it except give money to Brazil to save the rain forest \nbecause it is a popular environmental issue. That is what this bill is \nabout, the politics of the environment, not the reality of the \ncircumstance in which we all live, in which the Senator from California \nnearly saw the entire San Bernardino forest wiped out and a Governor of \nher State who had to declare a state of emergency and go in and try to \nstop it from burning.\n  So if you are going to create a new world, a greener world, a cleaner \nworld, one that has less carbon in it, you have to have a forest \npolicy--a forest policy--that begins to revitalize our forests, to thin \nthem, to clean them, to change the kind of ecosystem in them that \ndoesn't tolerate 180 million acres of dead and dying trees that will \nrelease hundreds of millions of tons of carbon into the environment.\n\n  So what do we do? Six tons of CO2 is released every time \nan acre burns. Six tons. Up to 100 tons of CO2 can be \nreleased per acre, depending on the number of trees within that \nacreage--300, 400, 500. So that is a reality. Last year, in the 9.2 to \n9.4 million acres that burned, we released the carbon equivalent \nemissions of 12 million passenger automobiles running for 1 year, or \nthe entire passenger automobile fleet of the State of California, or \nsomewhere close to that. Yet this bill doesn't address forestry? It \ndoesn't address forest health? It doesn't address the kinds of things \nthat we ought to be doing in an active management system to revitalize \nour forests? No, it doesn't. It is not environmentally popular to do. \nEnvironmentalists have spent the last 20 years shutting down our \nforests.\n  So tomorrow I will bring a comprehensive amendment to the floor to \nattempt to add to this bill, to get us back into the business of forest \nmanagement, healthy forests, revitalizing our forests, and, hopefully, \nover time changing the ecosystem of our forests in a way that we don't \nburn 10 million acres a year and release hundreds of thousands of tons \nof carbon into the atmosphere. And this can be done at very little \ncost. You don't have to have a cap-and-trade scheme that pours \ntrillions of dollars into it.\n  That is what we will talk about tomorrow. Gas is today. Let's talk \nabout trees tomorrow, one of the greatest storers of carbon, one of the \ngreatest sequesterers of carbon in the world today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will just take a couple of minutes of \nrebuttal time. Of course, one of the purposes of our bill, in fighting \nglobal warming, is to save our environment. That is the whole point of \nthe bill, and part of our precious environment certainly includes our \nforests. We actually do have a forest title in the bill. So I am \nlooking forward to seeing my friend's amendment. I hope it works well \nwith our bill.\n  We know, as the climate warms, our trees are now open to all kinds of \npests that didn't really thrive in a cooler climate. If you look, for \nexample, in Alaska--and, of course, we have this in California too--the \nbark beetle is thriving now because of warmer temperatures. So I \ncertainly look forward to working with my friend on forests.\n  I am looking at the Presiding Officer sitting there now, and he and I \nare working on saving the rain forest. And I say to Senator Craig, he \nis absolutely right about the forests being a carbon sink, and that is \nwhy Senator Pryor and others are working very hard to save the rain \nforest. This is all part of what we do in this bill. So it is a little \nshocking for me to hear a colleague stand and say this bill doesn't do \nanything about forests, when the main purpose of this bill is to \npreserve and protect God's planet, and that includes our beautiful \nforests.\n  The Senator is right. I have been to those fires as they were raging \nand I have talked to those people and we have to do everything we can \nto be smart about protecting our lands.\n  I also want to address Senator Craig's point about India and China. \nHe jokingly, I guess, said you should call it--I think he said the \nChina-India----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Economic Stimulus Act.\n  Mrs. BOXER.--Economic stimulus blah blah. Ridiculous. Because the \nbottom line is, when anyone stands up and says India and China, it is \nbecause they do not want to do anything about global warming. They are \ncode words. These are turned into code words, and what I want to say \nis, how far have we fallen as a nation when we sit back and wait for \nIndia and China to lead us on an issue as important as this? This is \nour turn.\n  I mean, we are going to hear in a minute from Senator Sanders, who is \ngoing to come at this and say this bill doesn't do nearly enough. \nUnfortunately, Senator Sanders, we have people here who think this bill \ndoes way too much, and they are fighting us every step of the way, \nwhich is very difficult for those of us who believe this is our \nchallenge, this is our time, these are our grandchildren we have to \nprotect, and this is our planet we have to protect.\n  So I want you to listen for a few key words in this debate. We will \nhear them more--India, China. When somebody says that, say: Senator, \nare you suggesting that America not lead and we turn over our \nleadership to those countries? That is wrong. America doesn't cower in \nthe corner waiting for other nations to take on the great issues of the \nday. It is ridiculous. That is why our States, our Governors, our \nmayors, our conference of mayors support this bill. They are moving \nwhile the National Government is stuck in neutral.\n  Finally, we are moving. We are moving forward. We don't know how far \nwe will get, but we are going to take this bill as far as we can. So \nkeep your ear out for the words ``India'' and ``China,'' and ``gas \nprice increases,'' which really is ironic since my friends on the other \nside of the aisle have done nothing but vote against us when we tried \nto push back against those super high prices--a 250-percent increase \nsince George Bush came into office, and all he could do was go beg for \noil from the Saudi prince. It is a pretty sad state of affairs.\n  So now I am done with my rebuttal, and I know Senator Sanders has \nbeen waiting and I look forward to his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in the rebuttal scheme, is there an effort \nto make comments back? No?\n  All right. I thank the chairman. And let's add one more word--\n``forestry sequestration.'' That is another new buzzword added tonight.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, since my colleague said that, we have $1 billion in \nthe bill for forestry every year, so we will show it to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on this global \nwarming legislation, I did want to say one word about gas prices, which \nare impacting my State of Vermont very heavily because workers in \nVermont have to travel long distances to work, and the weather gets \nvery cold and we spend a lot of money on home heating oil.\n  What I say to my Republican friends is I am glad to hear they are \nconcerned about these soaring oil and gas prices. In the coming days we \nare going to give them an opportunity to stand up to the big oil \ncompanies who are enjoying record-breaking profits as they rip off the \nAmerican people. We are going to give our Republican colleagues the \nopportunity to stand up to the speculators who many experts believe are \ndriving up the price of oil by 25 to 50 percent. And we are going to \ngive them the opportunity to join with us to stand up to those people \nwho are causing oil prices to be so high and are causing so many \nproblems all over this\n\n[[Page S4953]]\n\ncountry as a result. We look forward to working with them on that \nissue.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, I want to say a few words in \ncongratulating Senator Boxer, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Warner, \nand all of those who worked so hard to bring this historic legislation \nto the floor. This is a very important start in addressing one of the \ngreat crises facing our planet. But in my view, and I think in the view \nof many people in the scientific community, if we are going to respond \nin a serious way to what the best evidence out there is telling us, \nthis bill must be strengthened in a number of ways.\n  In the short time I have now, I wish to focus on four simple points. \nNo. 1, what are the most knowledgable scientists in the world telling \nus about global warming and what will happen if we do not act boldly? \nNo. 2, how can we reverse global warming through an aggressive path of \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy? No. 3, how can transforming our \nenergy system create millions of good-paying jobs here in the United \nStates? And, No. 4, I want to mention some of the amendments I will be \noffering to strengthen the bill.\n  Let me begin by mentioning that the International Panel on Climate \nChange, the IPCC, is made up of more than 2,500 scientific expert \nreviewers, some 800 contributing authors, and in excess of 450 lead \nauthors representing 130 countries. Collectively, this group, the \nentire team, was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last December. \nLet me very briefly summarize the findings of the IPCC, and let me \nstate very clearly that this, their work, constitutes the overwhelming \nposition of the scientific community. That is why they received the \nNobel Peace Prize. This is what they said.\n  Warming of the climate system is unequivocal. With 90 percent \ncertainty, most of the warming in the past 50 years is due to human \nactivity. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are higher than they \nhave been in over the last 650,000 years. Eleven of the twelve years \nbetween 1995 and 2006 rank among the 12 warmest years since we have \nbeen keeping records--meaning since 1850. Without a major change, by \n2100, temperatures will likely increase between 3 and 7 degrees \nFahrenheit. Further, with 90 percent certainty scientists expect that \nhot extremes, heat waves, and heavy precipitation events will continue \nto become more frequent, and the higher the temperatures become, the \nworse the effects of global warming will become. That is what the \nscientific community is telling us. There is not a lot of debate within \nthe scientific community on these issues.\n  But what does unchecked global warming actually mean for ordinary \npeople, who are not Nobel Prize-winning scientists? It means there will \nbe a significant increase in human misery and death for our children, \nour grandchildren, and future generations as we see a significant \nincrease in drought, in flooding, in severe weather disturbances, in \nwars and political unrest as nations fight for limited resources. There \nwill be an increase in all kinds of disease. There will be an increase \nin malnutrition and starvation because of the loss of arable cropland \nand water. Those are some of the realities that will be seen in coming \ngenerations.\n  Let me be even more specific about what the future will bring if we \ndo not reduce global warming in a significant way. Many of our friends \nsay: Oh, there are problems here, look at all the problems. Yes, there \nare problems, but think about the problems that will take place if we \ndo not act. In this sense we have to not be selfish because we are \ntalking about our kids, our grandchildren, and the future of this \nplanet. This is what we will be seeing in the not too distant future.\n  In the western United States, there will be a major crisis in terms \nof finding drinking water. There are great discussions taking place \nright now in California. While we have already seen major problems in \nterms of forest fires in recent years--and my colleague from Idaho was \non the floor talking about forest fires--he ``ain't seen nothing yet,'' \nif this planet continues to warm.\n  Furthermore, we will see heat waves, which will become more frequent, \nwhich will cause terrible health impacts, especially for the elderly.\n  In Africa, by 2020, fresh water sources for between 75 and 250 \nmillion people will be stressed. In Asia, fresh water availability will \nbe decreased, potentially adversely affecting more than 1 billion \npeople by the year 2050.\n  In Latin America, by mid-century, tropical forests will be replaced \nby savanna, causing a significant loss of biodiversity and water \navailability.\n  Finally, in the polar regions, the loss of ice in glaciers and ice \nsheets and changes in snow conditions will negatively affect wildlife \nand arctic communities. From this, sea level could rise up to 23 feet, \nwith the complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which would take \nmany centuries but would ultimately occur due to manmade emissions.\n  When people say: My goodness, resolving global warming is a problem--\nyes. But compared to what?\n  Let us also be very clear that the horrific problems we are talking \nabout for the future have already begun today. This is not saying, gee, \nit is all going to happen tomorrow. It is happening today, right now. \nYesterday, one example of a million, the New York Times reported that \nlarge parts of Spain are turning into deserts and conflicts over water \nare increasing, in part because of global warming. A long-term drought \nin Australia, which many believe is related to global warming, has \nsignificantly reduced their food production, which some experts believe \nis one of the reasons international food prices are rising. That is \ntoday, not 10 years from now.\n  The evidence is overwhelming. We are looking at one of the great \ncrises facing our planet, as great as we have ever faced. If we do not \nact effectively, the results will be catastrophic. When people say it \nwill be difficult to address the issues of global warming, they are \nright. It is not going to be easy. But it will be 100 times more \ndifficult to address the disasters that will come if we do not act now. \nAll over the world people of all political persuasions, of all \nreligious persuasions, understand that simple reality. If you do not \nact now, it is not going away, it is only going to get worse.\n  What the leading scientists are telling us is that not only is the \nsituation dire, it is worse than they had predicted only a few years \nago. I am a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. \nThat is what these people do. They come and say: Yes, we told you the \nsituation was bad. We were wrong. It is worse than we had told you only \na few years ago.\n  What the scientific community is now telling us, and why this \nparticular bill is lacking, is that the United States must reduce its \nglobal warming emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050, and some say \nwe should do more than that. Further, through its leadership--we are \nthe most powerful Nation on Earth--through its political strength, its \nadvanced technology, we must do everything we can to work with the \ninternational community so that as a planet we go forward together in \nsubstantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The world is crying \nout for America's leadership. We must give it.\n\n  If we do all of these things, there is still a chance that we may not \nbe successful in keeping the worst from happening. Those are the \nproblems our planet is facing. What should we do to address them? What \ndo we do? Frankly, I happen to believe that not only is the global \nwarming crisis solvable, I happen to believe it is not quite as \ncomplicated as many others believe. The truth is that as a result of a \nlot of excellent scientific and technological work done here in the \nUnited States and all over the world, we know what has to be done. We \nknow what has to be done. It is not a mystery.\n  Frankly, if you compare for a moment the challenge that we face with \nglobal warming today compared to the challenge the Congress of 1941 \nfaced when we were attacked at Pearl Harbor, our job is much less \ndifficult than their job was. They had to create armies to fight all \nover the world. They had to rebuild the civilian economy into a war \neconomy. And they did all of that in a few years--and won, both in \nEurope and in Asia. That was a problem.\n  This, frankly, in my view, is less of a problem. What do we have to \ndo? In English? No. 1, we must move aggressively toward energy \nefficiency in every area of our lives, and the technology is here for \nus to do it. My own\n\n[[Page S4954]]\n\nState of Vermont has been aggressive with regard to energy efficiency \nand the results are very promising. As a result of strong energy \nefficiency efforts, my State is using 5.3 percent less energy than it \nwould have without those programs. These efforts have made Vermont the \nfirst State in the country to experience negative load growth while the \npopulation is increasing. Said another way, the State has actually \nreduced the amount of electricity it uses while still adding more users \nand experiencing economic growth. And Vermont has barely scratched the \nsurface in terms of energy efficiency. I have no doubt, for example, \nthat Vermont and the rest of the country can do much better in years to \ncome, especially as new technology such as LED light bulbs are \nintroduced into the economy. These bulbs will consume one-tenth of the \nelectricity of an incandescent bulb. So the potential in terms of \nenergy efficiency is extraordinary.\n  But the issue is not only with electricity. The issue is also with \ntransportation. Given the dismal situation in terms of efficiency in \ntransportation today, we can't help but make enormous improvements in \nyears to come. Automobiles, including hybrids and hybrid plug-ins, will \nget at least 50 miles per gallon and it should be commonplace within a \nfew years. Forget about the cars that are getting 15 miles per gallon, \nwe will get 50, 75 miles per gallon and even more. Electric cars will \nbe on the market that will have a range of 200 to 300 miles. You go to \nwork, you go on your trip, you come back, plug it in, and you are off \nand running the next day.\n  Today, rural America is sorely lacking in public transportation. In \nVermont and all over America, workers have no choice but to drive to \nwork because we don't have the kind of bus system we have to have. \nBuild that bus system. You are going to save an enormous amount of \nenergy.\n  In terms of our antiquated rail system, think of the potential we \nhave there. Today we are far behind, both in passenger travel and in \ncargo travel. We are way behind Europe and Japan, other parts of the \nworld. We can and must build a modern transportation system, a rail \nsystem. When we do that, we save unbelievable quantities of energy. In \nother words, what the scientific community has told us over and over \nagain is that the cheapest energy is the energy we don't use. As a \nNation we are going to make some progress in this area, but we have a \nlong way to go.\n  As we contemplate a strategy to reverse global warming, breaking our \ndependance on foreign oil and stimulating the economy, there is some \nvery good news out there if we are smart enough to hear it, if we are \nprepared to take on powerful special interests, and if we are prepared \nto develop the political will to go forward.\n  Despite the fact that the Federal Government has been very slow in \nmoving in terms of sustainable energy, major breakthroughs are already \ntaking place in our country and around the world in terms of such \nrenewable energies as wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. If we are \nsmart and prepared to invest in a reasonably short period of time, we \ncan move our country not only away from foreign oil but away from \nfossil fuel in general, the burning of which is the major cause of \nglobal warming. We now have the potential to produce an enormous amount \nof energy in a cost-effective way through sustainable approaches which \nnot only do not emit greenhouse gases but produce virtually no \npollution at all, clean up our environment, as well as cut back on \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Let me give you a few examples of what I am talking about.\n  Wind is the fastest growing source of energy in the world and the \nUnited States, but we have barely begun to tap its potential. Today, we \nare producing less than 1 percent of our electricity from wind, but \neven the Bush administration acknowledges that we can get as much as 20 \npercent of our electricity from this valuable renewable resource. We \nshould be supporting wind energy not only through the creation of large \nwind farms in the appropriate areas but through the production of \nsmall, inexpensive wind turbines which can be used in homes and farms \nthroughout rural America.\n  In terms of solar power, the potential is almost unlimited. Right \nnow, as we speak, concentrating solar powerplants are being built and \nplanned in the United States and throughout the world. These plants can \nproduce as much electricity as a small nuclear powerplant. Let me \nrepeat that. Plants are being constructed today which emit virtually no \ngreenhouse gas emissions, which are cost effective, and which can \nproduce almost as much electricity as a nuclear powerplant.\n  It is estimated that this one solar technology which is beginning to \nexplode in the southwest part of our country--in Nevada, southern \nCalifornia, New Mexico--this one technology can provide as much as 25 \npercent of our Nation's electricity and maybe even more. It is there. \nIt is happening now. The Federal Government, of course, has been very \nslow to respond or to help. It is happening even without our help.\n  To offer another example, building just 80 gigawatts of concentrating \nsolar power capacity--a target that is achievable by 2030--would \nproduce enough electricity to power approximately 25 million homes, \nwhile helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is there now. \nThis is what we can be doing.\n  Furthermore, the cost of concentrating solar powerplants has already \nbegun to decline as production increases. In fact, concentrating solar \npower costs are projected to drop to 8 to 10 cents per kilowatt hour \nwhen capacity exceeds 3,000 megawatts, according to a 2008 Sandia \nNational Laboratory presentation.\n  There it is. It is happening. People are talking about all kinds of \nthings, solar concentrating powerplants are taking place right now, \nincreasingly cost effective, and no greenhouse gas emissions.\n  One of the country's largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric, is \nworking with Solel Solar Systems to build and operate a 553-megawatt \nconcentrated solar powerplant in the Mojave Desert which would provide \nelectricity for 400,000 homes. We can build dozens of those plants in \nthe United States of America.\n  Furthermore, in terms of solar technology, we are not only talking \nabout solar powerplants, we are also talking about photovoltaic. And \nmore and more Americans, in their homes, in their buildings, in public \nbuildings, in businesses, are installing solar photovoltaics, the price \nof which should also come down significantly as production increases. \nPhotovoltaics on the roofs of only 10 percent of the existing buildings \nin the United States could meet 70 percent of peak electric demand. \nWorldwide installations of solar PVs have increased by nearly 50 \npercent last year. This is an exploding technology in the United States \nand all over the world. We have to do everything we can to increase and \nhelp out and make sure that technology continues to grow.\n  The bottom line here is, as we move forward in all of these areas, we \nare going to create millions of good-paying jobs, transforming our \nenergy system away from foreign oil and fossil fuels into energy \nefficiency and sustainable energy. The potential is extraordinary. This \nis a great country. We have faced challenges in the past. We can and \nmust accept this challenge now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The senior Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me comment that these \nthings do not come without a cost. I am putting up some things that \nwill happen in the State of Vermont. But I would also say this: It is \nso tempting to debate when he talks about the science here because the \nscience is not settled.\n  But I stated--and I do not think the Senator from Vermont was on the \nfloor when I opened the discussion yesterday, I guess it was--that for \nthe purpose of this bill, so that there will not be Members coming down \nwho do not want to talk about the bill and instead want to talk about \nthe science, I said as far as the bill is concerned, let's assume the \nscience is there so we do not have to put that on the table and use up \nthe time. So that is what we have been doing. I hope we will be able to \ncontinue to do that. However, tomorrow, after the locked-in vote on the \nbudget, I believe we are going to be going, hopefully, to some of these\n\n[[Page S4955]]\n\namendments which I think are very significant.\n  Now, I had by unanimous consent asked to have, I think, locked in 30 \nminutes. I do not need that much time. I would like to repeat a couple \nof things.\n  I understand Senator Enzi is coming back to the floor. One of the \nthings I think he stated earlier when he was speaking was something \nthat somehow people have forgotten; that is, there can be no debate \nover whether jobs are going to be lost. Jobs have to be lost because we \nare talking about putting a cap on oil and gas, putting a cap on our \nenergy supply. We are talking about doing what we can to reduce coal. \nThere is no nuclear provision in this bill. So we are going to have a \ncutback in the ability to run this great machine we call America.\n  So what happens to manufacturing jobs in the State of Ohio and other \nStates? They go south. Most of them will go probably to China, some \ndown to Mexico. But already we have seen a huge migration of jobs, \nmanufacturing jobs, and the estimate on this bill is that would be \nincreased by 9.5 percent. We have the studies that show we would lose \nmanufacturing jobs by another 9.5 percent over and above all of the \nmanufacturing jobs that are gone.\n  Now, if you do not agree with these studies, use a little logic. If \nthere is no energy to run these manufacturing jobs, they have to go \nwhere the energy is. It has been 30 years since we have had a new coal-\nfired generating plant in the United States. China is cranking one out \nevery 3 days--every 3 days. And I know it is a mess over there. It is a \npolluted mess. We spent a lot of time talking about CO2. But \nI would state to the chairman of the committee that in China, it is \nSO2, CO2, it is mercury, it is everything else, \nbecause they do not really have the restrictions.\n  So the point Senator Enzi was making was that when these jobs go over \nthere--let's say this bill passes, which it will not, but if it did \npass, that it would have the effect of increasing CO2 in \nthat respect. And it is very simple because it would go, as Senator \nEnzi said, to these countries where they have no controls. So that is \nvery significant.\n  The third point I wish to make, because it has been made several \ntimes by my very close friend, the junior Senator from California, the \nchairman of the committee, that somehow the increase in gas has \nsomething to do with the Bush administration, when I would only remind \nyou that during the period of time we have had the acceleration of the \nprice of gas at the pump, it has been through the Congress, \ncongressional acts. In fact, if anyone doubts that, they can go to our \nWeb site. The chairman and I, as chairman and ranking member, have a \nWeb site called EPW, Environment and Public Works, epw.senate.gov. When \nyou go in, you will see I have documented the votes of every time we \ntry to increase our capacity of energy, and it goes down on straight \nparty-line votes. I am talking about increasing the exploration in \nANWR, offshore, in all of the other areas, addressing the tar sands, \ntrying to do something in expanding into the shale in western Colorado, \nthe Western United States, trying to do something about tax incentives \nfor marginal well production. You know I know about that because we are \nthe largest State for marginal production in the country. That is wells \nof 15 barrels or fewer a day. So if we had all of the marginal wells \nproducing today that we plugged in the last 10 years, it would amount \nto more than we are currently importing from Saudi Arabia.\n\n  So I have to get on record here to make sure everyone understands. \nAnd the documentation is there. Every time we have tried to either get \nnuclear or tried to do something about clean coal technology or \nsomething about oil and gas, to expand our supply of energy in America, \nit goes down right along party lines. That is the problem we have.\n  Now, I do have another area I wanted to talk about and maybe try to \nput it in a different context than it has been in the past, because the \nbill with all of these ramifications, with the 45 new bureaucracies, \nwith all of the money, with the $6.7 trillion of additional money that \nis going to come into the system--that has to come from taxpayers, from \nconsumers of energy. That is where it is going to come from.\n  When this all comes up, it is a shell game. It reminds me of the \nmagician who takes a small object and he puts it under a shell, all \nunder the watchful eyes of the public. Then he starts mixing them up in \nthe shells. The problem is that the magician does such a good job of \nshuffling the shells around, no one can agree where the prize is, and \nsometimes the magician simply removes the prize in a slight-of-hand and \nall of the shells are empty. Well, this bill, the Lieberman-Warner \nbill, is much like a shell game. They promise everything to everyone.\n  There is one group--I do not think I will mention their name now--one \nof the big ag groups in this country has came out, and they were \nconvinced they were going to get all of the credits and they would be \nable to control these credits and they were going to make all of this \nmoney. Now they realize that is not true, so they have taken their \nsupport away from this.\n  But the bill that promises everything to everyone showed the public a \npile of money under one shell, and then they lead people to believe \neveryone is going to get that. The trouble is, there are more losers \nwith the Lieberman-Warner bill than winners. What makes it worse is we \nare the ones choosing the losers and winners. We try very hard to make \neveryone think they will be better off under this redistribution of \nwealth, but, like most schemes, it does not work.\n  The first major shell game trick is the claim by the sponsors that \nthe bill would generate $6.7 trillion of new revenue. The problem, of \ncourse, is that revenue comes from consumers and people in higher \nenergy costs. It is a tax on everyone in this country who uses energy. \nIt is a tax on energy, of course, either consumer products such as \nfood, manufactured goods, or higher prices on anything made of \nconcrete, steel, or chemicals. Now, you can bet that whenever the \nGovernment tells you they are going to redistribute money, the money \nthey are distributing is coming from the U.S. taxpayers one way or \nanother.\n  The next shell game trick is the promise of tax relief. We have heard \nthis. We talk about tax relief. I hope everyone was listening when I \nread very carefully from the bill that there is no tax relief. They are \nmerely talking about this, what they should do with all of this money \nafter it has been redistributed back to people. But it doesn't say they \nwill do it. It does not authorize it. It does not direct it. In fact, \nif it did happen, it still has to go to the Finance Committee, and they \nwould have to make those decisions. But they are saying--the sponsors \nof the bill are promising Americans $800 billion in tax relief over the \nnext 40 years. Now, the trouble is they are taking in $6.7 trillion. If \nthey do redistribute the $800 billion, that is not a very good deal; \nthat is $1 back for every $8 put in. Only in Washington, DC, does that \nsound like a good return on investment.\n  Now, how much tax relief will $800 billion provide? Let's break it \ndown. Over 40 years, that is $20 billion a year. While that seems like \na lot of money--and it is--this year's tax rebate cost the Government \n$150 billion. This means that for the U.S. taxpayer to play the \nLieberman-Warner shell game, they have to fork over $8 for the chance \nof getting back $1.\n  The bill's sponsors also play the same shell game with different \nindustries. They promise them that a small amount of money is hidden \nunder one shell and hope they don't notice how much they will have to \npay overall. They promise the auto industry less than $2 billion a year \nfor research and development, when the industry already spends $75 \nbillion a year. They promise $34 billion to help transition oil \nrefineries over the life of the bill, when in the first year alone, \n2012, they will have to purchase over $65 billion worth of credits \nbased upon conservative estimates. This is actually written into the \nbill where you have the credits allocated by industry for the \nindustrial base. Then they say: This is the amount that you get credit, \nbut this is what you are going to have to eventually come up with. That \nis the difference, that is what they are going to have to pay. In the \ncase of the auto industry, it will be $65 billion worth of credits. \nThey offer fossil fuel-fired powerplants an average of $7 billion a \nyear in assistance, ignoring the fact that in the first year alone they \nwill have to\n\n[[Page S4956]]\n\npurchase over $20 billion in allocation credits.\n  Even worse, the sponsors play the same shell game with workers' jobs. \nThey promise a whole host of new so-called green jobs in exchange for \ngood paying manufacturing jobs. The problem is, the good jobs created \nunder Lieberman-Warner are in developing countries such as China, \nIndia, and Mexico. The American worker is left with an empty shell.\n  Dr. Kenneth Green, with the American Enterprise Institute, stated in \ntestimony before our committee, when I asked him if global warming \ninitiatives create new green jobs:\n\n       The short answer, I would say, is that they might do so, \n     but only at the expense of other jobs that would otherwise \n     have been produced by the free market. Further, I would \n     suggest that the end result would be significantly less jobs \n     on net, less overall economic growth on the net, and most \n     likely, the loss of existing capital as a by-product.\n\n  That was in our committee. That was a testimonial from someone who is \nvery knowledgeable. Even the so-called green jobs will be going \noverseas. Just last month the California-based SunPower Corporation, \nthe second largest solar cell manufacturer in the world, announced it \nis building its new manufacturing plants in Malaysia. I am sure one of \nmy colleagues might say the financial incentives in the bill for solar \npower will keep more of these jobs here in the future, but we already \nsubsidize them by $24 dollars per megawatt hour compared to 44 cents \nfor coal and 25 cents for natural gas. How many more subsidies do they \nthink they need to keep the green jobs here?\n  Another victim of the shell game is the American farmer. They are \npromised funds for carbon offsets. Yet they aren't told of the \nincreased prices they will be paying for everything from electricity to \npropane to natural gas to diesel fuel, fertilizer, chemicals, tires, \nbatteries, belts, bearings, farm machinery, spare parts, and everything \nelse they use. That is the reason you have all the farmers groups \nopposing this, saying: We can't be dealt one more bad hand.\n  I know my farmers in Oklahoma are having a problem, in addition to a \nlot of the overregulation they are suffering through. We have something \nthat is probably not very prevalent in the State of California. It is \ncalled the burying beetle. It is about that big. That stops farmers \nfrom being able to cultivate their fields, and it is a serious problem. \nNow they look at this and say: Wait a minute. It is going to be even \nworse in the future.\n  Farmers have serious problems. In addition, this empty shell promise \nwill come with increased regulations and inspections by the EPA as they \nset up, monitor, and then annually verify farmers' activities. My \nfarmers always use the phrase, they don't want more bureaucrats \ncrawling all over their farms. It is almost as if the sponsors are \nplaying a shell game in hopes of distracting farmers with new \nregulatory programs and higher costs.\n  This is kind of funny. I happened to be chairman at the time, back \nwhen the Republicans were the majority, of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, when there was an effort to make propane a hazardous \nmaterial. I remember seeing a bunch of people wearing red coats walking \nin the back. They were young people. I didn't know who they were. I \nsaid: We can document that this will cost the average farmer in my \nState $700 a year more than they are paying now in excessive regulatory \ncosts. We defeated that. When we defeated it, all these young kids \nstood and applauded. I didn't know it, but it was the ag youth \ncommittee of the State of Oklahoma. There must have been 40 of them \nthere, bright young kids. Of course, every shell game someone comes out \nahead. In this case, the magician is the Federal bureaucracy.\n  The bill creates a host of new Federal programs, boards and funds, \nall of which will require new regulations, staff and resources. To give \nyou an idea, when people talk about the amount of money, this net \namount of money is out there. We talk about the $6.7 trillion. We talk \nabout a period of time that will extend 38 or 40 years out right now \nand some 45 bureaucracies. I want you to look and see. This is what we \nwould be creating. People who vote for this bill are voting for all \nthese bureaucracies: A Federal greenhouse gas registry, efficient \nbuildings program, a super efficient equipment and appliances \ndevelopment program, a clean medium and heavy duty hybrid fleets \nprogram, research on the effect of climate change on drinking water \nutilities program, the Rocky Mountain center of the study of coal \nutilization, the Sun grant center for research on compliance with the \nClean Air Act, the outreach initiative on revenue enhancement for \nagricultural producers, the agriculture and forestry emissions \ndistribution program, the carbon market oversight and regulation \nworking group. These are all going to be staffed with people. It is all \ngoing to be paid for by the results of this bill, if it should pass, \nwhich I am quite sure it will not. The carbon market efficiency board, \nthe climate change technology board, the climate change worker training \nand assistance fund, the efficiency and renewable energy worker \ntraining program, the climate change worker assistance program, the \nmultiagency steering committee, the national climate change advisory \ncommittee, the office of climate change adjustment assistance. I have \nto read these out so people know this monster we are talking about. The \nworkforce training and safety program, the climate change consumer \nassistance fund, the transportation sector emission reduction fund, \nenergy efficiency and conservation block grant program, tribal climate \nchange assistance fund, State wildlife adoption fund.\n  People say: What are you going to do? Let's assume that all this \nstuff is supposed to go back to taxpayers which we have calculated to \nbe something less than--at the very most it would be $2.5 trillion, \nthat that would leave $4.2 trillion. This is where it is going, for all \nthese bureaucracies: The early action program, the efficient \nmanufacturing program, the low and zero carbon electricity technology \nfund, the carbon capture and sequestration technology fund, the \nliabilities for closed geological storage sites task force, the climate \nchange transportation technology fund, the cellulosic biofuel program. \nThis is kind of interesting because right now my State is a leader in \nthe cellulosic biofuel programs. It is Oklahoma State University and \nthe Noble Foundation. I would like to see this happen.\n  I stood on the floor of the Senate--I think this is one of the rare \nthings we agreed with, I say to my good friend, the Senator from \nCalifornia. All these ethanol mandates that we went through, initially \nall the environmentalists were for these mandates. Now people realize \nthat with the mandates and with the increase in the mandates in the \nenergy bill of 2007 that we passed in December, now it has doubled or \ntripled the mandates that were already there. What is happening? They \nproduce a dirtier fuel that is less efficient. It is not good for the \nengine. It takes the life of the engine down. But worst for me in my \nState of Oklahoma, it is competing with feedstocks. Our feedstocks in \nOklahoma have tripled since all this stuff started because they are \nusing this. The cellulosic biofuel program was a result of that because \nthat is something that is not going to be used to compete with.\n  On with the list: The Bureau of Land Management emergency \nfirefighting program, the Forest Service emergency firefighting \nprogram, the Federal wildlife adaptation program, the national wildlife \nadaptation program, the science advisory board, the climate change and \nnatural resources science center, the international climate change \ncommission, the international reserve allowance program. These are all \nbureaucracies, you guys. I hope somebody is watching. The capacity \nbuilding program, the clean development technology deployment fund, the \ninternational clean development technology board, the international \nclimate change adaptation and national security program, the \ninteragency climate change task force, and finally, the Climate \nSecurity Act administrative fund.\n\n  Here we are with all 45 new bureaucracies, programs that are created. \nI guess we know who the winner is in the Lieberman-Warner shell game: \nThe Federal Government, at the expense of families, workers, and \ntaxpayers who are going to pay for all this fund we will be having.\n  I don't recall, in the years I have been here, seeing more interest \nfrom\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\nmore different areas in a piece of legislation. I would like to share \nsome of the things that I thought were of interest. A lot of these are \nfrom, I think it was the senior Senator from Ohio, who was talking \nabout one of the medias I will be quoting. I will get to it. I am not \nsure which one it is.\n  The Associated Press:\n\n       With gasoline at $4 a gallon and home heating and cooling \n     costs soaring, it is getting harder to sell a bill that would \n     transform the country's energy industries and, as critics \n     will argue, cause energy prices to rise even more.\n\n  That was from ``Economic Cost Drives Senate Climate Debate.''\n  The Wall Street Journal:\n\n       This is easily the largest income redistribution scheme \n     since the income tax.\n\n  The New York Post:\n\n       The only thing it will cool is the U.S. economy. In effect, \n     the bill would impose an average of more than $80 billion in \n     new energy taxes every year.\n\n  Robert Samuelson in the Washington Post:\n\n       Let's call it by its proper name: cap-and-tax.\n\n  George Will, a little more intellectual on this one:\n\n       Speaking of endless troubles, cap-and-trade comes cloaked \n     in reassuring rhetoric about the government merely creating a \n     market, but government actually would create a scarcity so \n     that government could sell what it had made scarce.\n\n  Charles Krauthammer, this is one that was a few days ago. There is \nanother one in this morning. I would invite anyone out there who wants \na lot of details on how bad this legislation is, I had an op-ed piece \nin this morning's Wall Street Journal. I covered all these things in \nmuch more detail with documentation, and you can only do it in print. \nSo I did it.\n  Charles Krauthammer:\n\n       There's no greater social power than the power to ration. \n     Other than rationing food, there is no greater instrument of \n     social control than rationing energy, the currency of just \n     about everything one does and uses in an advanced society.\n\n  Human Events:\n\n       It will significantly increase the price Americans pay for \n     gasoline and electricity. Cap and trade is an economy-killer.\n\n  The Hill:\n\n       A bill that the senate will debate after Memorial Day could \n     add about 50 cents more to the price of a gallon of gasoline, \n     according to a study.\n\n  There are several studies in this area. It is far greater than that. \nI think the EPA actually had the study that said that it would be 53 \ncents a gallon increase.\n  The Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Boxer climate tax bill would impose the most extensive \n     government reorganization of the American economy since the \n     1930s.\n\n  Investor's Business Daily:\n\n       The bill essentially limits how much gasoline and other \n     fossil fuels Americans can use, as Klaus puts it . . .\n\n  Talking about one of my real heroes, he is the President of the Czech \nRepublic. He said:\n\n       . . . in the name of the planet. A study by Charles Rivers \n     Associates puts the cost (in terms of reduced household \n     spending per year) of Senate bill 2191--\n\nwhich is the present source on this--\n\n       to $1,300 per household by 2015, rising to $1,500 to $2,500 \n     by 2050.\n       Electricity prices could jump by 36 percent to 65 percent \n     by 2015 and 80 percent to 125 percent by 2050.\n\n  By the way, we have another chart which I do not have with me which I \nwill be showing tomorrow that has the breakdown by CRA, showing what \neach State has. It happens that the highest States in terms of the \nproblems are the States of Oklahoma and Texas. The average cost for the \naverage household in my State of Oklahoma and the State of Texas is \n$3,300 a year. So it is far greater than average, so naturally I am a \nlittle more concerned than some of the others are.\n  The Las Vegas Review Journal:\n\n       Consumers are already struggling with gasoline approaching \n     $5 a gallon and other utility costs that have been moving \n     steadily higher for the past few years. New mandates placed \n     on producers in the name of ``global warming'' will only make \n     matters worse.\n\n  The Plain Dealer--this is the one that is in Cleveland, OH, so I am \nsure the Chair knows a little bit about this newspaper. This is the one \nthat was characterized by the senior Senator from Ohio as normally \nbeing moderate to liberal as opposed to being conservative. It says:\n\n       The bill, as conceived, will just bore new holes into an \n     already battered economy.\n\n  That was an editorial by the Plain Dealer of Cleveland, OH, called: \n``Carbon Cap-And-Trade Bill Is Going Nowhere, For Good Reason.''\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding I have 30 minutes. How much \ntime do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understood the Senator to have 25 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, but I also had the 5 minutes in addition to rebut \nafter the speech, which I acknowledged and asked for when I first \nstarted talking. Twenty-five plus 5 equals 30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Pittsburgh Tribune-Review:\n\n       If there indeed is a second Great Depression to come, this \n     will be the government measure that guarantees it arrives \n     with a devastating gut punch.\n\n  San Francisco Chronicle. We have to have this one because generally \nthey are on the other side of these issues.\n\n       The Senate debate on the climate bill probably will focus \n     on its impact on energy prices and the economy, which in the \n     short run could be considered significant.\n\n  Anyway, we have many, many more. So I guess to finalize what I have \nsaid, you have to repeat some of these things. First, we do have the \nproblem of gas prices. You could argue it is not going to increase the \nprice of gas. Every study we have, except one that presumes we are \ngoing to triple the number of nuclear plants, agrees with that.\n  In fact, the Energy Information Agency estimates that gas prices \nwould increase from 41 cents somewhere to a dollar. When they talk \nabout only 2 cents a year, that is on a study the EIA did that assumes \nthat currently we have 104 nuclear plants and that would be increased \nby 260. Nuclear, we are going to have some amendments. There will be \nseveral amendments on that.\n  Let's remember now the other two major things that are worth \nrepeating. You lose your jobs. The jobs are not going to be here. You \nare not going to have the energy. This bill puts caps on all the energy \nwe produce today. They talk about the future. Yes, as the Senator from \nVermont said, I want to have the renewables. I want to have solar \nenergy that will work. I want to have wind energy. All of these we want \nto have. We need them all.\n  But what are we going to do today? That technology is not here. Today \nthe technology on oil and gas is here. The technology is here on clean \ncoal. We actually have, right now, 32 applications pending on new \nnuclear plants, a nuclear renaissance. That is what we need in this \ncountry.\n  Lastly, the tax and spend: $6.7 trillion, all going to be paid for by \nall these people out there. Maybe they may get back $1 out of every $8 \nthey pay, but I doubt it. Because, as I said earlier, if you look and \nsee clearly what it is that is in the bill, it says we should return \nsome of this money to them, but it does not demand it. It does not \nauthorize it. The Finance Committee would end up having to do it.\n  Now, with that, I will yield the floor for the response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in my rebuttal, I say to my good friend \nfrom Oklahoma that I truly believe one of the reasons his party is in \ntrouble right now and his party is losing all these elections right now \nis because they do not have any answers to the problems that are facing \nus.\n  Whether it is high gas prices--and my friend can say Congress was \nresponsible. Come on. I remember when George Bush ran with Dick Cheney, \nand they said: We are two oil men, and we are going to make sure--we \nare going to use the power of the Presidency and the Vice Presidency to \nbring down gas prices. What happened? We will show you the chart again: \na 250-percent increase since George Bush came into power. You could try \nto blame that on the Congress.\n  That just does not wash because we Democrats have offered many ways \nto go after big oil. We have offered resolutions saying we should be \nfree of foreign oil. Republicans, for the most part, do not vote for \nit. Democrats do. So that is a red herring.\n  To blame it on the Congress is kind of laughable, when George Bush \nwas\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\ncomplaining about the price of oil when he got into office--I remember \nthat; it is not that much ancient history--and has been really unable \nto do anything about it. And just as we are on the brink of passing a \nvery important bill to get us off foreign oil, get us off big oil, and \nall those programs my friend read from--and I will talk about them more \ntomorrow. Those are not bureaucracies. Those are actually investments \nwe are going to make so we make sure we get off of oil so we make sure \nin the future our prices go down. That is what the Boxer-Lieberman-\nWarner bill will do.\n  So to sum up, what you are hearing--and I have listened all day to \nevery speech. I am very pleased Senator Dole is here to speak in favor \nof the Boxer-Lieberman-Warner bill. I welcome her to this debate. We \nhave had some great bipartisanship on our side today. We have heard \nfrom Senator Snowe. We have heard from Senator Warner. We are going to \nhear from Senator Dole. And, of course, we heard from Senator \nLieberman, an Independent. So we have tripartisan support for our bill.\n  But on the other side, it is the same old, same old, same old--\nattack, attack, attack. They say we have a tax increase when we have a \nhuge tax cut. They ignore the fact that half of the bill's revenues go \nto the people--deficit reduction trust fund, tax cut, and consumer \nrelief. They ignore the fact that what we do with the rest of the funds \nis invest them in our country, in our people. That is why many unions \nare supporting us, because they understand the jobs are going to be \ncreated, just as they are being created in California.\n  Right now we have a horrible problem in California with our housing \nindustry, our construction industry. Those jobs are going, thank \ngoodness, to the 450 new solar energy companies that are located there.\n  I know my friend who is sitting in the chair is grappling with all \nthese issues. He is concerned about manufacturing. That is why some of \nthe programs my friend from Oklahoma talked about are going straight \ninto the economies of the coal States, to make sure we can find the \nanswer.\n  Now, there is another Dayton Daily News editorial:\n\n       Cap-and-trade has two factors going for it--\n\n  I think this is good. Since you heard a negative editorial, here is a \npositive editorial.\n\n       Cap-and-trade has two factors going for it that one needn't \n     be an expert to understand. One, it is a new, inventive \n     approach, as opposed to government incentives. . . .\n       Second, the bipartisan appeal of cap-and-trade is itself a \n     case for adopting the idea. A way to actually get something \n     done. . . .\n\n  So I think in Ohio we have a mixed review. I wanted to put that into \nthe Record. I also want to say to my friend, he is reading editorial \nafter editorial. I will go with him toe to toe. I am going to read some \neditorials.\n  San Jose Mercury News:\n\n       The challenge of climate change is to avert disaster for \n     future generations.

Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues an \nimportant development in Asia with implications for regional security.\n  Malaysia, a moderate country of 27 million people with an Islamic \nmajority, has long been a major high-tech manufacturing center, \nproducing components of goods that are in personal computers and \nhousehold items throughout our country, as well as throughout the \nworld. It is encouraging to see economic reforms now complemented by \npolitical ones.\n  In response to a call for change voiced by the people in the March 8 \nMalaysian elections, in which opposition candidates made gains in \nParliament, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi has proposed a \nseries of significant reforms to promote a more independent and \neffective judiciary and to increase anticorruption efforts across \nMalaysia.\n  In the area of judicial reform, Prime Minister Badawi has proposed a \nnew Judicial Appointments Commission to identify, recommend and \nevaluate candidates for the judiciary based on clearly defined \ncriteria. He has also offered a proposal to improve the quality of \njudges by reviewing the compensation and terms of service for judges to \nattract and retain the most qualified judges.\n  Recognizing the major public concern about corruption in Malaysia, \nMr. Badawi has taken steps to make Malaysia's Anti-Corruption Agency, \nACA,\n\n[[Page S4960]]\n\nbecome a fully supported and independent commission with an independent \ncorruption prevention advisory board. He has also undertaken action \nintended to triple the number of anticorruption officers, and to \nestablish a parliamentary committee on corruption prevention that would \nreview annual reports by the ACA.\n  Mr. Badawi's reform proposals also include greater support and \nprotections for freedom of the press, including issuing one-time--\nrather than annual--licenses for media organizations and approving a \npermit for the party of main opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's People's \nJustice Party to publish its own newspaper.\n  Malaysia's pursuit of democracy and its struggle against Islamic \nextremism are critical for establishing lasting peace, prosperity, and \nsecurity both for the Malaysian people and for the entire Southeast \nAsian region. The future direction of countries such as Malaysia is of \nsignificant importance to the United States as we work with others to \nfight extremists.\n  The relationship between these types of reforms and security in \nMalaysia and the surrounding region is the subject of a recent op-ed in \nthe Providence Journal by Stuart Eizenstat, who served as \nUndersecretary of State and Deputy Treasury Secretary in the Clinton \nadministration. This editorial, which I am submitting for the Record, \nalso notes Mr. Badawi's initiative to have Muslim states which are \nmembers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, \ncommit themselves to a joint plan to eradicate poverty, illiteracy and \nunemployment in the Islamic world. Attention to that kind of investment \nin basic social needs in the Islamic world is an essential element of \ncombating extremism. Human security requires protection not only of law \nand freedom, but of economic security, and I commend Mr. Eizenstat's \narticle for its recognition of how these issues intersect in the \ncurrent reform efforts being undertaken in Malaysia.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Providence Journal, May 29, 2008]\n\n               Malaysian Democracy's Role in Terror Fight\n\n                        (By Stuart E. Eizenstat)\n\n       There is a titanic conflict within the Muslim world pitting \n     modernity against reactionary radicalism.\n       Muslim leaders who promote modernization and integration \n     with the world economy will only succeed if their policies \n     will lead to a better way of life for their people.\n       The next U.S. president must determine how best to support \n     the reformers, which will require new approaches, a \n     combination of both hard and soft U.S. power, and most \n     importantly, strong, reliable allies.\n       That's why it is so important for the U.S. to pay attention \n     to the transformation now occurring in Malaysia, a Muslim \n     nation of some 27 million people whose prime minister, \n     Abdullah Badawi, has responded to electoral calls for change \n     by introducing sweeping reforms designed to maintain a \n     democratic open society for the long term.\n       On March 8, Malaysian voters sent a strong message to the \n     government by giving opposition parties solid gains in \n     parliament--even as Badawi's party continued to hold more \n     than 60 percent of the seats.\n       Instead of heeding the calls of his adversaries to resign, \n     Prime Minister Badawi embraced the call of voters who \n     demanded reform. The results: Badawi's avalanche of proposals \n     has begun positioning him as the 68-year-old ``comeback kid'' \n     of Malaysia politics.\n       The reforms have addressed three central foundations for \n     freedom too often not seen in developing nations--and \n     especially those in the Islamic world.\n       First, Badawi has moved to strengthen the independence of \n     Malaysia's judiciary, by creating a process to create merit-\n     based lists of judicial candidates, similar to the kinds of \n     vetting systems used in the U.S. to rate potential new \n     federal judges.\n       Second, Badawi is building on strategies adopted in Hong \n     Kong and Singapore to create independent bodies to combat \n     corruption.\n       Finally, Badawi is opening up historically strict licensing \n     processes to promote freedom of the press, making it possible \n     for the newly empowered political opposition to publish its \n     own newspaper.\n       These new reforms would fundamentally change the way \n     business--and politics--are carried out in a nation whose \n     political leadership had historically emphasized economic \n     development rather than political freedom. By making the \n     country's institutions more transparent and independent, the \n     Badawi government is promoting a system that is also more \n     likely to be resilient in turbulent economic times.\n       The stability of this majority Muslim nation through \n     political and economic change has significant implications \n     for the U.S., for whom Malaysia is the 10th largest trading \n     partner.\n       Malaysia is an important producer for the U.S. of \n     components for high-tech business and consumer goods, like \n     computers and cell phones. It also has provided a steady \n     example of a Muslim government that has been serious about \n     combating terrorism at home. And it has burnished Badawi's \n     reputation as a leader of Islamic moderates against the life-\n     support systems that sustain the dark forces of Al Qaeda, \n     Hamas, Hezbollah and the terror network that stretches from \n     Northern Africa across the Middle East into Southeast Asia.\n       Other Muslim leaders, including those of some of the \n     opposition parties in Malaysia, have a different vision, one \n     that would reverse Badawi's goal of converting Malaysia into \n     a multi-cultural Islamic-oriented state that is helping to \n     modernize Islam in ways that are compatible with the \n     globalizing challenges of the 21st Century.\n       For example, Malaysia's Parti Islam se Malaysia (PAS) has \n     called for the imposition of a criminal code of Islamic law, \n     or Shariah, including such cruel punishments as amputation \n     and death by stoning, reversing hard-won women's rights and \n     an end to race-oriented affirmative-action programs aimed at \n     helping improve the lives of Malaysia's minorities.\n       Malaysia and Badawi have sought to lead by example in the \n     region. During his recently concluded chairmanship of the \n     Organization of the Islamic Conference--an international \n     organization of 57 Muslim states from the Middle East to \n     Indonesia--he led efforts to address the twin challenges of \n     poverty and illiteracy that fuel the spread of Islamic \n     extremism in the Muslim world.\n       Badawi has challenged his fellow Muslim states, including \n     those which are members of the Organization of Petroleum \n     Exporting Countries (OPEC), to commit themselves to a joint \n     plan to eradicate poverty, illiteracy and unemployment in the \n     Islamic world.\n       His persistence in helping to establish a new economic \n     agenda for the Muslim world represents a critical initiative \n     in the long-term struggle to transform impoverished Muslim \n     states into nations that find their place in a progressive, \n     globalizing world.\n       In the end, whether Badawi's dexterity will keep him in \n     power to serve a full term is yet to be determined, but what \n     he has set in motion deserves the support of the United \n     States, since his reforms will place Malaysia firmly on the \n     path to modernizing its Islamic society.\n       Stuart E.

Mr. President, I believe our Nation's farmers and \nranchers--free of government interference and redtape--are the best \nstewards of the land.\n  Unfortunately in Washington, there are people who don't understand \nWyoming. We do not need the Federal Government to regulate mud puddles \nand wetlands. We know how to manage our lands. We do not take kindly to \nthe ``Washington knows best'' philosophy. We are westerners. We have \nbeen living out here for a long time without the helpful hand of the \nFederal Government.\n  A recent editorial printed in the Wyoming Livestock Roundup on April \n5 really hit home. I recommend to my colleagues the editorial by Jim \nMagagna as reflecting the feelings of Wyoming farmers and ranchers. I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         The Society We Live In\n\n       I am admittedly old-fashioned. I still relish the 60's when \n     resource conflicts were most often resolved by just getting \n     out and kicking a little dirt. I had my share of ``cussin' \n     and discussin''' with BLM, USFS and WG personnel. I \n     respected their professional expertise and they respected my \n     practical experience. Most often this combination produced a \n     result that was a little uncomfortable for both of us, but \n     right for the resource. Neither of us was particularly \n     concerned that our decisions would be challenged by anyone \n     else.\n       Fast-forward to the 21st century: Resource managers are no \n     longer respected for their professional judgment, which they \n     can exercise only at peril of the agency being sued. The \n     demands placed upon them to create paper trails leave little \n     time for kicking the dirt. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \n     (FWS), has been added to the list of federal agencies known \n     to strike fear into the hearts of ranchers. Resource \n     decisions are driven primarily by often uninformed public \n     opinion and agency efforts to avoid litigation. Many of the \n     threats which once plagued only\n\n[[Page S4961]]\n\n     public land ranchers have migrated to private lands, \n     infringing on our property rights. Many of today's decisions \n     are simply not ``right for the resource''.\n       These 21st century resource management challenges have also \n     forced ranchers and the organizations that represent them \n     into the litigation arena to an unprecedented extent. Certain \n     environmental organizations have perfected the litigation \n     process as a tool to make government dysfunctional. Their \n     formula is simple: Challenge every unfavorable decision on \n     simple procedural grounds, utilizing the National \n     Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) or the Endangered Species Act \n     (ESA), as a tool. Make massive, costly and time-consuming \n     demands on the agencies for documents under the Freedom of \n     Information Act (FOIA), thereby preventing agency personnel \n     from performing normal duties. Identify ``friendly'' courts \n     that will assure a favorable decision on the weakest of \n     evidence. Assure that the environmental organization's legal \n     fees are paid by the taxpayer and that the FOIA fees are \n     waived ``in the public interest''. This is the shameful but \n     successful strategy of Western Watersheds Project, Center for \n     Biological Diversity, Forest Guardians and a host of \n     similarly aligned conspirators.\n       Meanwhile, back at the ranch, individual families are \n     forced to scrape together thousands of dollars of their own \n     funds to defend property rights and federal grazing permits. \n     Financial and human resources that would otherwise be \n     directed toward resource management and improvements are \n     diverted to legal fees and endless meeting participation, \n     thereby strengthening the claims of the environmental \n     plaintiffs that the resource is not being properly managed. \n     The rancher is placed in a vicious circle from which there is \n     no ready escape.\n       Agricultural organizations at the state, national and local \n     levels have stepped up to the plate in recent years in order \n     to address these threats in a collective manner and relieve \n     some of the burden placed on individual ranchers. In Wyoming, \n     state government has been a partner in this effort, in \n     particular regarding endangered species.\n       In 1999 the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA), for \n     the first time in its then over 125 year history, deemed it \n     necessary to establish a permanent Litigation Fund to support \n     challenges by the radical environmental community. Since that \n     time the generosity of our members and supporters has allowed \n     us to participate in or financially support over ten (10) \n     defenses of the property rights and interests of the ranching \n     community. In addition to these direct expenditures, an \n     increasing portion of staff time is dedicated to reviewing \n     litigation and determining the appropriate level of \n     involvement for the organization.\n       Currently, WSGA is involved as an intervenor in litigation \n     seeking the listing of the sage grouse and in challenges to \n     the state's elk feedgrounds. We have filed a motion to \n     intervene in recent litigation seeking to force listing of \n     the mountain plover. WSGA, joined by WWGA, has recently moved \n     to file an amicus brief in litigation challenging the \n     delisting of the grizzly bear. We were in the process of \n     filing in the black-tailed prairie dog litigation when a \n     settlement was reached. In addition, WSGA is a leader in an \n     effort by the National Public Lands Council challenging the \n     overturning of the revised BLM grazing regulations. The \n     announcement last week by WildEarth Guardians of a lawsuit \n     challenging the Secretary of Interior for failure to act on \n     listing petitions for 681 species will undoubtedly present \n     new ``opportunities'' for our involvement.\n       The ESA and NEPA are laws whose original intent remains \n     valid. However, they have been co-opted by environmental \n     litigants as procedural hurdles to serve their ultimate goal \n     of land use control. Congress has demonstrated its inability \n     to act in restoring integrity to these laws. There will \n     continue to be a handful of federal judges who are willing to \n     aid and abet in their abuse.\n       WSGA and others will continue to defend the property rights \n     and grazing permits of ranchers in environmental litigation. \n     This alone will not be enough. The time has arrived when we \n     must develop a multi-faceted strategy to end this abuse of \n     our rights and our legal system. We have begun the proactive \n     step of building public support for our stewardship and \n     forming alliances with other groups who support our role in \n     resource management. Future steps should include an expose of \n     the motives and tactics of select radical environmental \n     groups and direct legal challenges to certain of their \n     practices. This strategy will demand even greater short-term \n     sacrifices by ranchers and a strong coordinated commitment by \n     those who represent them. Success will assure a sustainable \n     resource and a more secure future for our industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4961-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4961-S4963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before the last recess, the Senate \nconfirmed Judge G. Steven Agee of Virginia to the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. His confirmation lowered the \nremaining vacancies on that circuit to less than there were at the end \nof the Clinton administration, when a Republican-controlled Senate had \nrefused to consider any nominees to the Fourth Circuit during the last \n2 years of the Clinton Presidency. The Republican Senate majority used \nthe Clinton years to more than double circuit court vacancies around \nthe country. By contrast, we have already reduced circuit court \nvacancies by almost two-thirds, in the process reducing them to zero or \nonly a single vacancy in nearly every circuit. We have already reduced \nvacancies among the 13 Federal circuit courts throughout the country \nfrom 32--which is what it was when I became chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee in the summer of 2001--to 11, the lowest number of vacancies \nin more than a decade.\n  When Republican Senators are ready to allow us to consider and \nconfirm the President's nominations to fill the last two remaining \nvacancies on the Sixth Circuit, yet another circuit will be without any \nvacancies. We will reduce the total number of circuit court vacancies \nto single digits for the first time in decades. Lost in all the \nagitating from the other side of the aisle is the fact that we have \nsucceeded in reducing circuit court vacancies to historically low \nlevels.\n  In addition, this work period we have the opportunity to complete \nSenate consideration of five additional nominees for lifetime \nappointment to Federal courts, which are pending on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar. The Judiciary Committee has favorably reported the \nnominations of Mark Davis of Virginia to fill a vacancy in the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia, David Kays of Missouri to fill a vacancy in the \nWestern District of Missouri, Stephen Limbaugh of Missouri to fill a \nvacancy in the Eastern District of Missouri, William Lawrence of \nIndiana to fill a vacancy in the Southern District of Indiana and \nMurray Snow of Arizona to fill a vacancy there. In addition, when the \nJudiciary Committee considers the nominations of Judge Helene White and \nRay Kethledge to the Sixth Circuit, we will also consider the \nnomination of Stephen Murphy to the Eastern District of Michigan. Thus, \nwith cooperation from across the aisle, the Senate should be in \nposition to have confirmed four circuit court judges and 11 district \ncourt judges before the Fourth of July recess, for a total of 15 \nadditional Federal judges.\n  By comparison, during the 1996 session when a Republican Senate \nmajority was considering the judicial nominees of a Democratic \nPresident in a Presidential election year, not a single judge was \nconfirmed before the Fourth of July recess--not even one. That was the \nsame session in which they failed to confirm a single circuit court \nnominee.\n  Another stark comparison is that on June 1, 2000, when a Republican \nSenate majority was considering the judicial nominees of a Democratic \nPresident in a Presidential election year, there were 66 judicial \nvacancies. Twenty were circuit court vacancies, and 46 were district \ncourt vacancies. Those vacancies were the result of years of Republican \npocket filibusters of judicial nominations. This year, by comparison \nthere are just 47 total vacancies with only 11 circuit vacancies and 36 \ndistrict court vacancies. If we can continue to make progress this \nmonth, the current vacancies could be reduced to fewer than 40, with \nonly 9 circuit court vacancies and 30 district court vacancies.\n  The history is clear. When Republicans were busy pocket filibustering \nClinton nominees, Federal judicial vacancies grew to more than 100, and \ncircuit vacancies to more than 30.\n  When I became chairman for the first time in the summer of 2001, we \nquickly--and dramatically--lowered vacancies. The 100 nominations we \nconfirmed in only 17 months, while working with a most uncooperative \nWhite House, reduced vacancies by 45 percent.\n  After the 4 intervening years of a Republican Senate majority, \nvacancies remained about level.\n  It is the Democratic Senate majority that has again worked hard to \nlower them in this Congress. We have gone from more than 110 vacancies \nto less than 50. With respect to Federal circuit court vacancies, we \nhave reversed course from the days during which the Republican Senate \nmajority more than doubled circuit vacancies. Circuit vacancies have \nbeen reduced by almost two-thirds and have not been this low since \n1996, when the Republican tactics of slowing judicial confirmations \nbegan in earnest.\n  Consider for a moment the numbers: After another productive month, \njust 9\n\n[[Page S4962]]\n\nof the 178 authorized circuit court judgeships will remain vacant--just \n9--a vacancy rate down from 18 percent to just 5 percent. With 168 \nactive appellate judges and 104 senior status judges serving on the \nFederal Courts of Appeals, there are 272 circuit court judges. I expect \nthat is the most in our history.\n  I regret to report that when I tried to expedite consideration of \nPresident Bush's two Sixth Circuit nominations last month, I \nencountered only criticism from the Republican side of the aisle, as \ndid one of the nominees. Senator Brownback publicly apologized for his \nactions at the hearing, and I commended him for doing so.\n  We have now received the updated ABA rating for President Bush's \nnomination of Judge Helene White to the Sixth Circuit. She received a \nwell qualified rating. That did not come as any surprise. She has \nserved ably on the Michigan state appellate courts and acquired \nadditional experience in the decade since when she was nominated by \nPresident Clinton and the Republican Senate majority refused to \nconsider her nomination. The White and Kethledge nominations to the \nSixth Circuit break a logjam after 7 long years.\n  In light of Republican criticism of my efforts to expedite \nconsideration of President Bush's Sixth Circuit nominations, I have \nsaid that the nominations would be scheduled for committee \nconsideration after we received updated ratings from the ABA. Now we \nhave and I plan to include them on the agenda for the committee's \nbusiness meeting on June 12. I trust that all Senators will be prepared \nto consider and vote on the nominations at that time. That should \nprovide the Senate with the opportunity to consider them before the \nJuly 4 recess.\n  The President has not nominated anyone to 16 current judicial \nvacancies. He has refused since 2004 to work with the California \nSenators on a successor to Judge Trott on the Ninth Circuit. The \ndistrict court vacancies without nominees span from those that arose in \nMississippi and Michigan in 2006, to several from 2007 in Pennsylvania, \nMichigan, Indiana and the District of Columbia, to others that arose \nearlier this year in Kansas, Virginia, Washington, and several in \nColorado and Pennsylvania.\n  Disputes over a handful of controversial judicial nominations have \nwasted valuable time that could be spent on the real priorities of \nevery American. I have sought, instead, to make progress where we can. \nThe result is the significant reduction in judicial vacancies.\n  The alternative is to risk becoming embroiled in contentious debates \nfor months. The most recent controversial Bush judicial nomination took \n5\\1/2\\ months of debate after a hearing before Senate action was \npossible. I am sure there are some who prefer partisan fights designed \nto energize a political base during an election year, but I do not. I \nwill continue in this Congress, and with a new President in the next \nCongress, to work with Senators from both sides of the aisle to ensure \nthat the Federal judiciary remains independent, and able to provide \njustice to all Americans, without fear or favor.\n  In fact, our work has led to a reduction in vacancies in nearly every \ncircuit, reducing vacancies on almost every circuit to only one or \nnone. Both the Second and Fifth Circuits had circuit-wide emergencies \ndue to the multiple simultaneous vacancies during the Clinton years \nwith Republicans in control of the Senate. Both the Second Circuit and \nthe Fifth Circuit now are without a single vacancy. We have already \nsucceeded in lowering vacancies in the Second Circuit, the Fourth \nCircuit, the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, the \nNinth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, the DC Circuit, \nand the Federal Circuit. Circuits with no current vacancies include the \nSeventh Circuit, the Eighth Circuit, the Tenth Circuit, the Eleventh \nCircuit and the Federal Circuit. When we are allowed to proceed with \nPresident Bush's nominations of Judge White and Ray Kethledge to the \nSixth Circuit, it will join that list of Federal circuits without a \nsingle vacancy.\n  My approach has been consistent throughout my chairmanships during \nthe Bush Presidency. The results have been positive. Last year, the \nJudiciary Committee favorably reported 40 judicial nominations to the \nSenate and all 40 were confirmed. That was more than had been confirmed \nin any of the three preceding years when a Republican chairman and \nRepublican Senate majority managed the process.\n  Still, some partisans seem determined to provoke an election year \nfight over nominations. The press accounts are filled with threats of \nRepublican reprisals. The May 14 issue of Roll Call boasted the \nfollowing headline: ``GOP Itching for Fight Over Judges; Reid's Pledge \nto Move Three Before Recess Fails to Appease Minority.'' Then in a \nrecent article in The Washington Times, we read that the Republican \nfixation on judges is part of an effort to bolster Senator McCain's \nstanding among conservatives. There seem to be no steps we could take \nto satisfy Senate Republicans on nominations because they are using it \nas a partisan issue to rev up their partisan political base.\n\n  Among the reasons that Republican complaints about the Fourth Circuit \nring hollow is that the emergency vacancy on the Fourth Circuit from \nNorth Carolina exists only because the Republican Senate majority \nrefused to consider any of President Clinton's nominees to fill that \nvacancy. All four nominees from North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit \nwere blocked from consideration by the Republican Senate majority. That \nalso prevented President Clinton from integrating the Fourth Circuit \nthrough appointment of Judge Beaty or Judge Wynn.\n  Of course, during the Clinton administration, Republican Senators \nargued that the Fourth Circuit vacancies did not need to be filled \nbecause the Fourth Circuit had the fastest docket time to disposition \nin the country. That was the period when Fourth Circuit vacancies rose \nto five. One of those vacancies--to a seat in North Carolina--still \nexists because the President insisted on nominating and renominating \nTerrence Boyle over the course of 6 years to fill that vacancy. That \nhighly controversial nomination persisted for years despite the strong \nopposition of law enforcement officers from across the country, civil \nrights groups, and those knowledgeable and respectful of judicial \nethics opposed the nomination.\n  The Fourth Circuit now has fewer vacancies than it did when \nRepublicans claimed no more judges were needed, and fewer vacancies \nthan at the end of the Clinton administration. I have already said that \nonce the paperwork on President Bush's nomination of Judge Glen Conrad \nto the Fourth Circuit is completed, if there is sufficient time, I hope \nto move to that nomination.\n  This is not the first time we have heard false complaints about our \nprogress on nominations. One of the Republicans' favorite talking \npoints is to use a mythical ``statistical average'' of selected years \nto argue that the Senate must confirm 15 circuit judges in this \nCongress. They only achieve this inflated so-called ``historical \naverage'' by taking advantage of the high confirmation numbers of \nDemocratic-led Senates confirming the nominees of President Reagan and \nthe first President Bush. They ignore their own record of doubling \nvacancies during the Clinton administration, including during the 1996 \nsession when the Republican-led Senate refused to confirm a single \ncircuit court nominee.\n  They do not like to recall that during the 1996 session, when a \nRepublican majority controlled the Senate during a Presidential \nelection year, they refused to confirm any circuit court judges at \nall--not one. Their practice of pocket filibustering President \nClinton's judicial nominees led Chief Justice Rehnquist to criticize \nthem publicly. Chief Justice Rehnquist was hardly a Democratic \npartisan. Quite the contrary. Even he was appalled by the actions of \nthe Republican Senate majority. In his 1996 Year-End Report on the \nFederal Judiciary, he wrote:\n\n       Because the number of judges confirmed in 1996 was low in \n     comparison to the number confirmed in preceding years, the \n     vacancy rate is beginning to climb. When the 104th Congress \n     adjourned in 1996, 17 new judges had been appointed and 28 \n     nominations had not been acted upon. Fortunately, a \n     dependable corps of senior judges contributes significantly \n     to easing the impact of unfilled judgeships. It is hoped that \n     the Administration and Congress will continue to recognize \n     that filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and \n     effective administration of justice.\n\n  When that shot across the bow did not lead the Republican Senate \nmajority to reverse course, Chief Justice\n\n[[Page S4963]]\n\nRehnquist spoke up, again, in his 1997 Year-End Report on the Federal \nJudiciary. It was a salvo from a Republican Chief Justice critical of \nthe Republican Senate leadership:\n\n       Currently, 82 of the 846 Article III judicial offices in \n     the federal Judiciary--almost one out of every ten--are \n     vacant. Twenty-six of the vacancies have been in existence \n     for 18 months or longer and on that basis constitute what are \n     called ``judicial emergencies.'' In the Court of Appeals for \n     the Ninth Circuit, the percentage of vacancies is \n     particularly troubling, with over one-third of its seats \n     empty.\n       Judicial vacancies can contribute to a backlog of cases, \n     undue delays in civil cases, and stopgap measures to shift \n     judicial personnel where they are most needed. Vacancies \n     cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without \n     eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been \n     associated with the federal Judiciary. Fortunately for the \n     Judiciary, a dependable corps of senior judges has \n     contributed significantly to easing the impact of unfilled \n     judgeships.\n\n  It was only after the scorching criticism by a Republican Chief \nJustice that the Republican Senate majority modified its approach in \norder to allow some of the nominations that had been held back for \nyears to finally proceed. Having built up scores of vacancies, some \nwere allowed to be filled while the Republican Senate majority \ncarefully kept vacant circuit court positions to be filled by President \nClinton's successor. It is in that context that Republican claims of \nmagnanimity must be seen for what it was. It is in that context that \nthe 8 circuit confirmations in 2000 must be evaluated while the \nRepublican Senate majority returned 17 circuit nominations to President \nClinton at the end of that session without action.\n  By contrast, the Democratic Senate majority has worked steadily and \nsteadfastly to lower vacancies and make progress, and we have. When \nSenate Republicans allow the Senate to confirm President Bush's Sixth \ncircuit nominees, we will have achieved the average number of circuit \nconfirmations the Republican Senate majority achieved in presidential \nelection years and lowered circuit vacancies to an historically low \nlevel.\n  Further, the Republican effort to create an issue over judicial \nconfirmations is sorely misplaced. Americans are now facing an economic \nrecession, massive job losses of 232,000 in the first 3 months of this \nyear, increasing burdens from the soaring price of gas, and a home \nmortgage foreclosure and credit crisis.\n  Last month, the Commerce Department reported the worst plunge in new \nhomes sales in two decades. The press reported that new home sales fell \n8.5 percent to the slowest sales pace since October 1991, and the \nmedian price of a home sold in March dropped 13.3 percent compared to \nthe previous year. That was the biggest year-over-year price decline in \nfour decades. You would have to go back to July 1970 to find a larger \ndecline. Sales of existing homes also fell in March, as did employment \nand orders for big ticket manufactured goods, both of which fell for \nthe third month in a row.\n  Unfortunately, this bad economic news for hard-working Americans is \nnothing new under the Bush administration. During the Bush \nadministration, unemployment is up more than 20 percent; the price of \ngas has more than doubled and is now at a record high national average \nof over $3.94; trillions of dollars in budget surplus have been turned \ninto trillions of dollars of debt, with an annual budget deficit of \nhundreds of millions of dollars. According to a recent poll, 81 percent \nof Americans today believe that our country is headed in the wrong \ndirection. It costs more than $1 billion a day--$1 billion a day--just \nto pay down the interest on the national debt and the massive costs \ngenerated by the disastrous war in Iraq. That's $365 billion this year \nthat would be better spent on priorities like health care for all \nAmericans, better schools, fighting crime, and treating diseases at \nhome and abroad.\n  In contrast, one of the few numbers actually going down as the \nPresident winds down his tenure is that of judicial vacancies. Senate \nDemocrats have worked hard to make progress on judicial nominations, \nlowering circuit court vacancies by almost two-thirds from the level to \nwhich the Republican Senate majority had build them. Any effort to turn \nattention from the real issues facing Americans to win political points \nwith judicial nominations is neither prudent, nor productive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4963-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING L.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of a very special man, Sydney Pollack of Los \nAngeles County, who died May 26, 2008. He was 73 years old.\n  Sydney Pollack was a master filmmaker and will be fondly remembered \nfor his over four decades of work in Hollywood as a director, producer, \nand actor.\n  Sydney Irwin Pollack was born to Rebecca and David Pollack on July 1, \n1934, in Lafayette, IN. He was raised in South Bend and moved to New \nYork City in 1952 to study at the Neighborhood Playhouse. While there, \nSydney so impressed head acting teacher Sanford Meisner, that Mr. \nMeisner quickly made Sydney his assistant. Sydney went on to teach at \nthe Neighborhood Playhouse from 1954-1959, guiding the talents of \nactors such as Robert Duvall, Rip Torn, Brenda Vaccaro, and Claire \nGriswold, whom he married in 1958.\n  At the urging of Director John Frankenheimer, Sydney left New York \nCity in 1961 for Hollywood where he began work as a director of \ntelevision shows. In 1965, Sydney made his movie-directing debut in the \nsuicide help-line drama, ``The Slender Thread'' with Sidney Poitier and \nAnne Bancroft. In 1969, Sydney received his first Best Director \nnomination for an Academy Award for the film ``They Shoot Horses Don't \nThey?''\n  As an actor, Sydney's key roles include Woody Allen's ``Husbands and \nWives,'' 1992, Robert Altman's ``The Player,'' 1992, and Stanley \nKubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' 1999. Sydney's most notable acting and \ndirecting role was in his 1982 comedy film ``Tootsie'' in which he \nplayed George Fields, agent to the main character played by Dustin \nHoffman. His production company, Mirage, produced this film as well as \nmany others, most recently ``Michael Clayton'' in which Sydney gave yet \nanother memorable performance.\n  Perhaps Sydney Pollack's biggest directing triumph came in 1985 with \n``Out of Africa.'' This landmark film received seven Academy Awards--\nBest Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Cinematography, Original \nScore, Art Direction, Sound--and three Golden Globe Awards--Best \nPicture, Supporting Actor, Original Score. ``Out of Africa'' was also \nan example of one of the great collaborations of all time between actor \nand director. Sydney Pollack and Robert Redford made seven classic \nfilms together that include ``This Property Is Condemned,'' ``Jeremiah \nJohnson,'' ``The Electric Horseman,'' ``3 Days of the Condor,'' ``The \nWay We Were,'' and ``Havana.''\n  Those who knew Sydney Pollack recognize him as a courageous, \ninnovative and brilliant man. He took pride in tackling social issues \nthrough films which raise interesting and challenging\n\n[[Page S4964]]\n\nquestions. His work as an ambassador of cinema will be remembered \ngratefully by all those whose lives he touched. He touched mine, and he \nwill be deeply missed.\n  Sydney is survived by his wife Claire Griswold, and their two \ndaughters, Rachel Pollack Sorman and Rebecca Pollack Parker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4964-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST. AMBROSE HOUSING AID CENTER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I congratulate the St. \nAmbrose Housing Aid Center on its 40th anniversary. Since 1968, it has \ngrown from its original mission to confront the ``blockbusting'' \npractices harming Baltimore's neighborhoods to providing a myriad of \nservices to more than 100,000 Baltimoreans as our oldest nonprofit \nhousing provider.\n  St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center was founded in 1968 by the dynamic and \ntenacious Father Vincent Patrick Quayle, known to all as Vinny. The \ncenter is dedicated to creating and preserving affordable housing in \nBaltimore. Its many successes are due to the charismatic and effective \nleadership of Vinny Quayle and the tireless efforts of a dedicated \nstaff.\n  In the 1970s, St. Ambrose initiated a rental program and converted \nseveral vacant Catholic school buildings into affordable apartments. \nThis effort led to neighborhood revitalization in many Baltimore \ncommunities. Today, St. Ambrose owns and manages 350 single and \nmultifamily affordable housing units serving very low-income \nhouseholds, households with special needs, and the elderly.\n  When Baltimore experienced a gentrification movement in the 1980s, \nmany low income families, especially those renting their homes, feared \nthey would be displaced. St. Ambrose led the way in helping tenants \nconvert to homeownership and was instrumental in convincing Baltimore \nCity to establish a ``Tenant's Right of First Refusal'' bill.\n  Two other programs were established that have become core services at \nSt. Ambrose. The Homesharing Program, the only one in Maryland, matches \nhouseholders with room to share with homeseekers who need affordable \nhousing and are willing to provide help with household tasks or \nfinancial support. The Legal Services Program helps homeowners and \ntenants combat home improvement fraud and predatory lending practices.\n  St. Ambrose partnered with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, HUD, and bought, renovated and sold Federal Housing \nAdministration, FHA, properties to first-time homebuyers. Through its \nHomeownership Counseling Program, St. Ambrose serves more than 700 \nprospective homebuyers every year, with 100 of them purchasing a home \nwithin 6 months of completing housing counseling.\n  As the numbers of subprime mortgages and foreclosures have increased, \nSt. Ambrose has stepped forward to help homeowners save their homes. \nExpert housing counselors provide assistance to homeowners in a number \nof ways and staff attorneys are available to provide legal review and \naction.\n  I am most proud to extend my warmest congratulations and best wishes \nto St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center on its 40th anniversary and ask my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4964-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING LIEUTENANT GENERAL WILLIAM ODOM\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I would like to commemorate \nthe life of a great soldier, strategic thinker and American, LTG \nWilliam Odom. I was deeply saddened to learn of his recent sudden \ndeath.\n  General Odom served our country with honor and distinction throughout \nhis life. During his time serving as a military adviser in the White \nHouse, Director of the National Security Agency, and West Point and \nYale professor, General Odom demonstrated an uncanny talent for \nassessing and advancing U.S. interests in a complex and challenging \nworld.\n  Over the years, the U.S. Congress has benefited greatly from General \nOdom's clear vision of U.S. interests in the Middle East. General Odom \nwas a strong critic of the Iraq war even before it began. It is \nunfortunate that more Members of this body did not heed his insightful \nand prescient warnings of the perils of invading Iraq. His steadfast \ncommitment to ending the war and restoring a balanced and focused \nnational security strategy has been an inspiration. So, too, was his \nstrong opposition to the President's illegal warrantless wiretapping \nprogram.\n  Our thoughts are with his wife, son, and family during this difficult \ntime. I hope that they can take some comfort knowing that he will be \ndeeply missed by a grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4964-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4964-S4965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING BILL CLARK\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I honor the life of a great \nArkansan, William E. ``Bill'' Clark, who passed on May 15, 2007. Bill \nwas respected as a great philanthropist, sportsman, business leader and \ncitizen of Arkansas. He was seen as an unparalleled advocate for the \nneeds and welfare of his State and its citizens. He dedicated his life \nto serving his community and supporting individual lives in the public \nand private sector.\n  Bill graduated from Little Rock Central High School in 1961 and the \nUniversity of Arkansas at Fayetteville in 1965 with a bachelor's degree \nin electrical engineering. Thereafter, he joined his brothers at C \nElectric Construction Company in Little Rock, working there until 1981 \nwhen he acquired Bragg's Electric Construction Company. In 1987, Bill \npartnered with Dillard's Incorporated and founded CDI Contractors, \nwhich grew to be one of the largest construction firms in the South. \nHigh-profile projects completed by CDI under Bill's leadership include \nthe Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, the headquarters for \nHeifer International in Little Rock and Immanuel Baptist Church in West \nLittle Rock, of which Bill was a devout attendee for over 27 years. \nBill's impact on the business community of Arkansas is evident by the \nnumerous business and professional awards he received, including \nArkansas Business Executive of the Year, Rotary Club of Little Rock's \nBusiness and Professional Leader of the Year Award, Paul Harris Fellow \nas given by Fifty for the Future, election to the Arkansas Construction \nHall of Fame, and admission to the University of Arkansas Engineering \nHall of Fame and the Arkansas Academy of Electrical Engineering.\n  Respected and admired throughout Arkansas for over three decades, \nBill took on countless worthwhile projects with optimism and \nenthusiasm; he was an inspiration to many. The positions he held \nrelating to public service are evidence of his commitment to his \ncommunity. His awards reflect his professional successes as well as his \navid public service. These awards included the Arkansas Arts Center's \nWinthrop Rockefeller Memorial Award, the Boys and Girls Club of America \nNational Service to the Youth Award, the Edwin N. Hanlon Memorial Award \nfor Contribution to the Arts, and the Arkansas Children's Award from \nthe Arkansas Sheriff's Youth Ranches.\n  Bill was a past president of the board for the University of Arkansas \nboard of trustees, the Arkansas Arts Center, the Little Rock Regional \nChamber of Commerce and the Country Club of Little Rock. Bill served as \na board member of the Little Rock Boys and Girls Club, the Arkansas \nArts Center Foundation, Baptist Health, the UAMS Foundation, Ouachita \nBaptist University Business Advisory Council, and the Episcopal \nCollegiate School Foundation.\n  During his lifetime, Bill was an enthusiastic outdoorsman. He loved \nhunting, fishing, and golf, while remaining committed to conservation \nendeavors. A final gesture honoring Bill and benefiting his community \nis the establishment of the William E. ``Bill'' Clark Presidential Park \nWetlands, a 13-acre tract located on the banks of the Arkansas River \nrunning adjacent to the Clinton Presidential Library. This natural \nwetland area provides an educational exhibit that can be enjoyed by \nState, national, and international visitors for generations to come. As \ncontractor for the Clinton Presidential Library, Bill believed in the \nlibrary's mission to strive for educational advances within Arkansas, \nincluding the history of the United States, the institutional roles of \nthe Presidency and the American political system as applied to \nPresident William J. Clinton.\n\n[[Page S4965]]\n\n  It is hard for people to experience Arkansas without noticing the \nremarkable accomplishments of Bill Clark. It is not hard to imagine \njust what makes Bill Clark so special to his family, his friends, and \nto Arkansas. He was a person of great faith, a loving husband and \nfather, a doting grandfather, and a humorous, compassionate friend to \nall he met. Bill never approached a situation with a negative attitude; \nrather, he saw everything as an opportunity to benefit his community. \nBill will be well remembered for his generosity and commitment to \nimproving his community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4965-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO KATHRYN TUCKER WINDHAM\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I ask that my colleagues \njoin me in celebrating the 90th birthday of one of America's and \nAlabama's most talented and acclaimed residents, Ms. Kathryn Tucker \nWindham. Ms. Windham is a beloved storyteller, author, playwright, \nphotographer, television and radio personality and, most importantly, a \nwoman of faith, integrity, grace and high ideals.\n  This smalltown girl has written larger than life tales including \n``Thirteen Alabama Ghosts and Jeffery'', along with many other \nhistorically based ghost-stories that involve smalltown urban legends \nin Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and Mississippi. She has also written \nworks like ``Twice Blessed'', ``GRITS'' and ``Alabama, One Big Front \nPorch'', which reveal the rich joys of Alabama living.\n  She grew up in Thomasville, AL, not too far from my rural home and \nnot too far from another notable Alabama writer--Harper Lee. Her \ncapacity for storytelling and writing started early, as a news \nreporter. But she did not stop there allowing her natural talent and \ninclinations to lead her to a higher plane of national renown. It is \nalways inspirational to see a real person, an individual American, \nfollow their own calling and achieve success.\n  Ms. Windham represents the highest values of our State and region. \nThis is so because she was raised right, studied hard, thought deeply, \nand was committed to a life that enriches others. A graduate of my alma \nmater, Huntingdon College, she followed its admonition, ``Enter to grow \nin wisdom; go forth to apply wisdom in service.''\n  I have known her and her son Ben for many years. I am so in awe of \nher. Not just for her noteworthy achievements, but because of the \ncontent of her character. She is an entertaining storyteller for sure, \nbut she is a truth teller also. Her works reflect with truth the nature \nof the human condition. In them, she displays a love for all persons \nthat reflects well on her rich heritage of religious faith.\n  She, from a lifetime of experience and insight, has been a leader in \nracial reconciliation in her home area. Persons of her integrity and \nstature can make a positive difference and she has. She supports good \ncauses, knows in remarkable detail the history of the smallest \ncommunities in our State, and knows the importance of simply \nremembering. She loves children, capturing them with tall tales while \nstressing education and personal character.\n  Her wonderful southern accent is well remembered on NPR's ``All \nThings Considered'' and her commentaries are still heard on Alabama \nPublic Radio.\n  I applaud her on her many achievements, and I am thankful to have \nsuch a beacon of literary excellence shining from Alabama. She is \nhighly recognized for her achievements by the whole State and around \nthe world and was one of the 13 artists chosen to represent the State \nby the Alabama State Council for the Arts at Alabama in France and \nMonaco in 2000. She was also honored in 2003 with the establishment of \nthe Kathryn Tucker Windham Museum at Alabama Southern College.\n  Fellow Alabama author Harper Lee, author of ``To Kill a \nMockingbird'', which is set in Monroeville not far from Thomasville, \nnominated Ms. Windham to the Alabama Academy of Honor in 2003. Some of \nher other accolades include: Alabama Humanities Award in 2000, the \nGovernor's Award for the Arts, the National Storytelling Association's \nCircle of Excellence Award and Lifetime Achievement Award, the \nUniversity of Alabama's Society of Fine Arts' Alabama Award, the Selma \nRotary Club's Citizen of the Year, and she was inducted into the \nUniversity of Alabama College of Communications Hall of Fame.\n  In true poetic form, I think, Ms. Windham sums up her insights in her \nbook ``Alabama, One Big Front Porch'':\n\n       Alabama, they say, is like one big front porch where folks \n     gather on summer nights to tell tales and to talk family. The \n     stories they tell are all alike in their Southern blend of \n     exaggeration, humor, pathos, folklore and romanticism. Family \n     history is woven into the stories. And pride. And humor. \n     Always humor.\n\n  I know I speak for all Alabamians and all Americans when I express my \ngratitude for your eloquence, your literary achievements, and your \nhumanity, and say, ``Happy Birthday Kathryn Tucker Windham!''\n  In closing, I would like to leave the Senate with a few of her words \nthat truly embody the spirit of her work and life:\n\n       I think we need to be put back in touch with our childhood \n     . . . to be reminded of what's important, like memories about \n     people we loved, or things that happened to us that affected \n     our lives, things we can laugh about and shed a few tears \n     about . . . I think storytelling is a way of saying ``I love \n     you. I love you enough to tell you something that means a \n     great deal to me.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4965-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NEW HAMPSHIRE EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION AWARD WINNERS\n\n Mr. SUNUNU.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the \nprofessional dedication, vision, and military service of GEN B.B. Bell, \nwho is retiring from the U.S. Army after 39 years of dedicated service. \nIt is a privilege for me to recognize the many outstanding achievements \nGeneral Bell has provided the\n\n[[Page S4966]]\n\nArmy and our great Nation. General Bell was commissioned as a \ndistinguished military graduate and second lieutenant in 1969 upon \ngraduation from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. Following \ncommissioning, General Bell specialized in armor and served with \ndistinction as he rose through the ranks. His orders took him to posts \nthroughout the United States, Germany, and the Middle East.\n  General Bell assumed command of the United Nations Command, Republic \nof Korea/United States Combined Forces command, and United States \nForces Korea on February 3, 2006.\n  During his time in command, North Korea made provocative missile \nlaunches and numerous demilitarized zone and airspace incursions. \nDespite these threats, General Bell maintained military readiness even \nas he reduced the U.S. footprint in Korea by moving soldiers, \ncivilians, and family members south, thus transforming the commands in \nKorea.\n  In addition, General Bell has been a principal participant in the \nfast-paced bilateral military and political discussions, where he has \nearned the reputation as a well-respected ambassador for the United \nStates. He also developed and maintained close ties with the military \nand civilian leadership of the Republic of Korea in partnership with \nthe U.S. Ambassador to Korea. He has helped fuse a lasting bond between \nthe two countries.\n  General Bell is a soldier's soldier. Throughout his career, he has \nmade the wellbeing of soldiers, families, and civilians a priority. He \nexpects those serving below him to do the same.\n  During service in Desert Shield and Desert Storm as the United States \nCentral Command executive officer, he worked to ensure that each \nsoldier was properly prepared, trained, and equipped for the mission \nand that every family was cared for by a Family Readiness Group.\n  Throughout his illustrious career in the Army, General Bell has been \nnothing less than exceptional. He is a great credit to the Army and \nthis country.

A bill to strengthen transparency and accountability in \nFederal spending; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I am proud today to introduce the Strengthening \nTransparency and Accountability in Federal Spending Act of 2008. This \nimportant legislation will improve Government transparency and give the \nAmerican people greater tools to track and monitor nearly $2 trillion \nof Government spending on contracts, grants, and other forms of \nassistance.\n  Throughout my time in public service, I have consistently fought to \nincrease the openness and accessibility of Government and to encourage \ngreater participation by people of all interests and backgrounds in \npublic debates. One of the most important public debates is how \nWashington spends the people's money. Unfortunately, it has been far \ntoo difficult for ordinary citizens to see where, how, and why money is \nspent.\n  Congress took a big step toward improving transparency two years ago \nwhen it passed the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act \nthat I introduced with Senator Coburn. That bill, which created the \npublic website USASpending.gov, makes information about nearly all \nFederal grants, contracts, loans and other financial assistance \navailable to the public in a regularly updated, user-friendly, and \nsearchable format. The website includes the names of entities receiving \nFederal awards, the amounts of the awards, information on the awards \nincluding transaction types, funding agencies, location, and other \ninformation. Soon the website will also include information about \nsubcontracts and subgrants.\n  Our work is not done however. The early success of USASpending.gov \nhas demonstrated that additional public information should be made \navailable. Whether you believe Government ought to spend more or spend \nless or just spend differently, we all should be able to agree that \nGovernment spending should be transparent and that public information \nought to be accessible to the public. We should also be able to agree \nthat the quality of Government financial data must be improved and made \nmore reliable.\n  Today I am pleased to be joined by Senators Coburn, Carper, and \nMcCain on a bill to build upon USASpending.gov and further advance \nGovernment transparency. In addition to a few technical corrections, \nthe bill we are introducing today will require the website to include \nadditional public information, including a copy of each Federal \ncontract in both PDF and searchable text format. The improved website \nwill also include details about competitive bidding, the range of \ntechnically acceptable bids or proposals, the profit incentives offered \nfor each contract, and the complete amount of money awarded, including \nany options to expand or extend under a contract.\n  With this legislation, the website will also show if a Federal grant \nor contract is the result of an earmark as well as provide an \nassessment of the quality of work performed. Ordinary citizens will be \nable to use the website to find information about Federal audit \ndisputes and resolutions, terminations of Federal awards, contractor \nand grantee tax compliance, suspensions and debarments, and \nadministrative agreements involving Federal award recipients. The \nwebsite can also be used to find information about any civil, criminal, \nor administrative actions taken against Federal award recipients, \nincluding for violations related to the workplace, environmental \nprotection, fraud, securities, and consumer protections.\n  Under the enhanced website, information about government lease \nagreements and assignments will be available in the same manner that \ninformation is reported for contracts and grants. Information about \nparent company ownership will also be available.\n  In addition to improving the transparency and accessibility of public \ndata, our bill will also improve the quality and usability of data that \nis made available. For one thing the data on USASpending.gov will be \naccessible through an application programming interface. The bill also \nrequires the use of unique award identifiers that prevent the release \nof personally identifiable information. Finally, the bill creates a \nsimple method for the public to report errors and track the performance \nof agencies in confirming or correcting errors while also requiring \nregular audits of data quality.\n  People from every State in this great Nation sent us to Congress to \ndefend their rights and stand up for their interests. To do that we \nhave to tear down the barriers that separate citizens from the \ndemocratic process and to shine a brighter light on the inner workings \nof Washington.\n  This bill helps to shine that light. It is simple common sense and \ngood governance that has been endorsed by a diverse range of grassroots \norganizations and Government watchdog groups, including the American \nAssociation of Law Libraries, Americans for Democratic Action, \nAmericans for Tax Reform, the Center for American Progress, the Center \nfor Democracy & Technology, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in \nWashington, the Environmental Working Group, the Federation of American \nScientists, the Government Accountability Project, the National \nTaxpayer Union, OMB Watch, OpenTheGovernment.org, POGO, Public Citizen, \nSciencecorps, the Sunlight Foundation, Taxpayers for Common Sense \nAction, U.S. Action, and U.S. PIRG among others.\n  This bill continues the bipartisan progress we have made opening up \nWashington to greater scrutiny and oversight. I am grateful for \ncontinued grassroots leadership on these issues and I appreciate the \nhard work of my Senate colleagues. Together I know we can change the \nway business is done in this town and make our Government more \naccountable to the people who sent us here to work for them. I urge \nsupport for this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 3078. A bill to establish a National Innovation Council, to \nimprove the coordination of innovation activities among industries in \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nInnovation and Job Creation Act, a bill which aims to spur the adoption \nof new technologies and practices that can accelerate economic growth \nand build a secure foundation for good, high-paying jobs. I am pleased \nthat Senator Clinton joins me in offering this legislation.\n  We are all familiar with the fiscal challenges our Nation will face \nin the coming years. Over the next 2 decades, more than 75 million \nmembers of the Baby Boom generation will leave the workforce and enter \nretirement. The loss of their participation in the workforce, coupled \nwith our Social Security obligations and rising healthcare costs, will \nput enormous strains on our economy. So too will competition from other \ncountries, brought about by increased international trade and \nglobalization. If we do not act to strengthen our competitiveness, our \nnation's ability to create good, high-paying jobs will be severely \ntested.\n  Indeed, there are already troubling signs that our economy's \ncompetitive edge has been dulled, and we are losing ground to other \nnations. In just the last 4 months, we've seen 340,000 jobs lost across \nthe country. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 1.6 \nmillion more workers unemployed today than in 2001, and 800,000 more \nworkers unemployed than just\n\n[[Page S4972]]\n\none year ago. Our trade deficit is now 6.5 percent of GDP--the highest \nin history--while manufacturing continues its decades-long decline, \naccounting for only 12.1 percent of GDP in 2006. We now import more \nhigh-technology products than we sell to other nations, and even in \nagriculture, where America has long been the world leader, our trade \nsurplus is dropping toward zero.\n  Even the service sector is not immune from the effects of \ninternational competition. With the increased telecommunications \ncapacity provided by trans-oceanic fiber-optic networks, geographic \nproximity to the market is no longer necessary for services such as \nback-office operations, call-centers, and software development.\n\n  As the Brookings Institute pointed out in a series of recent white \npapers on the topic of Innovation, ``the growth of international trade \nand the globalization of production make it increasingly important for \nthe United States to innovate to maintain its standard of living.'' \nThey explain that low-wage countries will always find it easier to \ncompete with America for labor-intensive work that is difficult-to-\nautomate, but that does not mean that we must surrender whole \nindustries to China and India, nor does it mean that we must fear the \ninevitable loss of high value-added jobs that depend upon research and \ndevelopment, and advanced technology.\n  Rather, it means that we must build upon what has always given \nAmerica its competitive edge--innovation. This means taking what has \nalready been invented, and putting it to use. It is only by doing this \nthat we can raise our productivity rate, and ultimately, continue to \ncreate the high-paying jobs that Americans need and deserve.\n  Last year, with the passage of the America COMPETES Act, we took an \nimportant step toward bolstering research and education that can serve \nas the foundation for future innovation. But we must go beyond this, to \nhelp enterprises understand innovative technologies and services that \ncan make them more competitive, and to help them overcome the barriers \nthey face in adopting these innovations.\n  That is what the bill Senator Clinton and I are introducing today \naims to do. The bill creates a National Innovation Council in the \nExecutive Office of the President, to take the lead in coordinating \nexisting Federal efforts on innovation, and to help support those \nefforts at the State and local level. Six Federal programs that share \ninnovation-based missions would be relocated to the NIC. These are: The \nManufacturing Extension Partnership Program (the ``MEP''), the \nTechnology Innovation Program, Partnerships for Innovation, the \nIndustry-University Cooperative Research Center Program, the \nEngineering Research Center Program, and the Workforce Innovations in \nRegional Economic Development program, known as the ``WIRED'' program.\n  The operation and funding of these existing programs would be \nunaltered by my legislation, but the NIC would lead these programs to \ncoordinate their activities where feasible.\n  The NIC would operate several grant programs to support efforts to \nspread innovation and create good jobs. Chief among these would be a \ngrant program to support innovation-based economic development \npartnerships in every State. The NIC would also provide grants for the \ndiffusion of technology in every state, operating through the existing \nMEP program.\n\n  The NIC would also oversee a new ``Cluster Development'' program \nwhich would operate alongside the six existing programs I have already \nmentioned. I want to focus for a moment on this aspect of my proposal \nsince cluster development is so essential to our ability to keep and \ncreate good, high-paying jobs in the face of international competition.\n  ``Clusters'' are geographic areas where interrelated economic \nactivity is taking place. Businesses that locate in a cluster build the \nfoundation they all rely on to succeed, even as they compete with one \nanother. Because of this, clusters are often at the heart of strong \nregional economies. Silicon Valley in California, Route 128 around \nBoston, and the Research Triangle Park in Raleigh-Durham, North \nCarolina, are famous examples of clusters in the high-tech sector. But \ncluster development is not just a phenomenon of the high-tech \nindustry--successful clusters can and do arise in any sector of the \neconomy. Think insurance in Connecticut, theme parks in Florida, movies \nin Hollywood, and boatbuilding in Maine. Each of these ``clusters'' is \nbuilt around a skilled labor force that can command good wages, and is \nready to compete with the best the world has to offer.\n  In Maine, cluster development has been championed by Karen Mills, the \nprimary author of the Brookings Institute's white paper ``Clusters and \nCompetitiveness.'' From her work in helping Maine secure $15 million in \nWIRED funding to further develop the composite and boatbuilding \nclusters in a project that hopes to create 2,500 high-quality jobs over \nthe next 5 to 7 years, to her current position as chair of Maine's \nCouncil on Competitiveness and the Economy, Karen's hard work and \ndedication on cluster development is unsurpassed.\n  The WIRED grant has enabled Maine to make great progress on cluster \ndevelopment, but more must be done nationally. As Karen explained in \nthe Brookings white paper, our Nation's network of cluster initiatives \nis ``thin and uneven,'' and consequently ``many U.S. industry clusters \nare not as competitive as they could be, to the detriment of the \nnation's capacity to sustain well-paying jobs.'' Because of this, ``too \nmany workers are losing decent jobs, and too many regions are \nstruggling economically.''\n  The Cluster Development program we are proposing in this bill is \nmodeled after the Department of Labor's WIRED program. It would \nidentify geographic regions where cluster activity is taking place or \ncan develop, and provide assistance to local and regional efforts to \nbuild on those clusters.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this and other \nproposals to bolster innovation, strengthen our Nation's \ncompetitiveness, and most of all, help preserve the foundation for \nhigh-quality jobs in the face of the coming economic challenges.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I introduce the National \nInnovation Act of 2008, a bill that will strengthen America's \nleadership in technology and manufacturing innovation, while helping to \nkeep and create more jobs here at home. I would like to recognize my \ncolleague, Senator Collins, for her leadership on this bill, and I \nthank her and her staff for all their hard work.\n  Our Nation is at a crossroads. Every day we hear of more jobs being \nsent oveaseas and new technology centers growing halfway across the \nworld. In this increasingly global economy, we need to have the tools \nand the knowledge to compete and succeed. There is no doubt that \ntechnology and innovation will be the foundation of the new economy. \nAnd America must be at the forefront of this new, innovation economy.\n  The National Innovation Act is a comprehensive plan to spur the \ngrowth of innovative technologies to increase America's productivity \ngains and economic growth. It builds on the longstanding bipartisan \ncommitment to improve our Nation's competitiveness by strengthening our \ninnovation infrastructure.\n  This new legislation creates a ``National Innovation Council'' to \ncoordinate Federal innovation policy, and to help support efforts at \nthe State and local level to accelerate the adoption of innovation \ntechnologies throughout the economy. It will include six existing \nFederal programs which share this important innovation-based mission.\n  The National Innovation Act also establishes a CLUSTER Information \nCenter and a Cluster Grant Program. The CLIC will collect, develop, and \ndisseminate analysis on industry clusters throughout all 50 States, \nprovide technical assistance guides for regional cluster development, \nand develop initiatives and programs.\n  Since I took office, I have devoted time and energy into trying to \nhelp the economically distressed communities throughout New York State, \nparticularly those in upstate New York that were once economically \nvibrant but now are facing a declining economy. This legislation will \nhelp revitalize communities in upstate New York and across the country \nwho have been hit hard by manufacturing and job loss by establishing \nregional economic clusters. It will bring innovation to every corner of \nAmerica. Communities can\n\n[[Page S4973]]\n\nuse cluster grants to build on the strengths of their particular \nregions by utilizing the skills and knowledge base of local businesses, \neconomic developers, colleges and universities, scientists, nonprofits, \nand the public sector.\n  In order to secure the future of America's economy we must create \nnew, good-paying jobs here at home. Investing in new technologies and \nindustries will expand our workforce, ensuring America remains \ncompetitive in the global economy and putting us on a course toward \ngrowth and prosperity for future generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cardin, Mr. \n        Sanders, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Brown):\n  S.J. Res. 37. A joint resolution expressing the sense of Congress \nthat the United States should sign the Declaration of the Oslo \nConference on Cluster Munitions and future instruments banning cluster \nmunitions that cause unaccapetable harm to civilians; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein, in sponsoring this joint resolution \ncalling on the administration to sign the Convention on Cluster \nMunitions when it is open for signature in December.\n  This treaty is the product of a year of negotiations among many of \nour closest allies and other nations that came together to prohibit the \nuse of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.\n  I regret that the United States did not participate in the \nnegotiations. The Pentagon continues to insist that cluster munitions \nare necessary, but the country with the world's most powerful military \nshould not be on the sidelines while others are trying to protect the \nlives and limbs of civilians in war.\n  Any weapon, whether cluster munitions, landmines or even poison gas, \nhas some military utility. But anyone who has seen the indiscriminate \ndevastation cluster munitions cause over a wide area understands the \nunacceptable threat they pose for civilians. These are not the laser \nguided weapons that were shown destroying their targets during the \ninvasion of Baghdad.\n  And there is the insidious problem of cluster munitions that do not \nexplode as designed, and remain as active duds, like landmines, until \nthey are triggered by whoever comes into contact with them. Often it is \nan unsuspecting child, or a farmer.\n  This resolution follows an amendment I sponsored which prohibits U.S. \nsales and exports of cluster munitions that do not meet strict \ncriteria, which became law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations \nAct, 2008. These criteria are no different from what the Pentagon set \nfor itself 7 years ago for new procurements of cluster munitions, \napplied also to those in existing U.S. stockpiles. Senator Feinstein \nand I have also introduced legislation that would apply these same \ncriteria to the use of cluster munitions. That legislation now has 20 \ncosponsors.\n  I want to express my appreciation to the Government of Norway for its \nleadership in initiating the process that led to the agreement on the \ntreaty in Dublin, and to the Cluster Munitions Coalition, a group of \nsome 200 nongovernmental organizations that worked diligently in \nsupport of the treaty.\n  I traveled to Dublin last week to meet with delegates to the \nnegotiations, including the president of the Conference Daithi \nO'Ceallaigh. He did a masterful job of guiding the discussions to a \nsuccessful conclusion.\n  There are some who have dismissed this effort as a ``feel good'' \nexercise, since it does not have the support of the United States and \nother major powers such as Russia, China, Pakistan, India and Israel. \nThese are the same critics of the Ottawa treaty banning antipersonnel \nlandmines, which the U.S. and the other countries I named have also \nrefused to sign. But that treaty has dramatically reduced the number of \nlandmines produced, used, sold and stockpiled, and the number of mine \nvictims has fallen sharply. Any government that contemplates using \nlandmines today does so knowing that it will be condemned by the \ninternational community. I suspect it is only a matter of time before \nthe same is true for cluster munitions.\n  The administration insists that the Convention on Certain \nConventional Weapons, known as the CCW, is the right place to negotiate \nlimits on cluster munitions because all countries are represented. I \ndon't doubt their intentions, but it is what they said about landmines, \nand nothing happened because Russia and China were opposed. The same is \nlikely for cluster munitions. It is a way to make it appear as if you \nare doing something, when you are not.\n  It is important to note that the U.S. today has the technological \nability to produce cluster munitions that would not be prohibited by \nthe treaty. What is lacking is the political will to expend the \nnecessary resources. There is no other excuse for continuing to use \ncluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians.\n  Finally, I want to thank Senator Feinstein who has shown a real \npassion for this issue and has sought every opportunity to protect \ncivilians from these weapons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4973-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 581--DESIGNATING JUNE 6, 2008, AS ``NATIONAL \n                  HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE AWARENESS DAY''\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 86\n\n       Whereas 78 countries have adopted the International \n     Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, signed at \n     Washington December 2, 1946 (TIAS 1849) (in this preamble \n     referred to as the ``Convention''), which established the \n     International Whaling Commission (in this preamble referred \n     to as the ``Commission'') to provide for the conservation of \n     whale stocks;\n       Whereas the Commission has adopted a moratorium on \n     commercial whaling in order to conserve and promote the \n     recovery of whale stocks, many of which had been hunted to \n     near extinction by the whaling industry;\n       Whereas the United States was instrumental in the adoption \n     of the moratorium and has led international efforts to \n     address the threat posed by commercial whaling for more than \n     3 decades;\n\n[[Page S4974]]\n\n       Whereas, despite the moratorium, 3 countries that are \n     parties to the Convention continue to kill whales for \n     financial gain, disregarding the protests of other parties;\n       Whereas those 3 countries have killed more than 25,000 \n     whales since the moratorium entered into force, including \n     more than 11,000 whales killed under the guise of scientific \n     research;\n       Whereas whaling conducted for scientific purposes has been \n     found to be unnecessary by the majority of the world's \n     cetacean scientists because nonlethal research alternatives \n     exist;\n       Whereas the parties to the Convention have adopted numerous \n     resolutions opposing and calling for an end to so-called \n     scientific whaling, most recently in 2007 at the annual \n     Commission meeting in Anchorage, Alaska;\n       Whereas commercial whaling in any form, including special \n     permit whaling and any coastal or community-based whaling, \n     undermines the conservation mandate of the Convention and \n     impairs the Commission's ability to function effectively;\n       Whereas all coastal whaling is commercial, unless conducted \n     under the aboriginal exemption to the moratorium on \n     commercial whaling; and\n       Whereas the majority of the people of the United States \n     oppose the killing of whales for commercial purposes and \n     expect the United States to use all available means to end \n     such killing: Now, therefore, be it\n         Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the United \n     States, through the International Whaling Commission, \n     should--\n         (1) use all appropriate measures to end commercial \n     whaling in any form, including so-called scientific whaling;\n         (2) oppose any initiative that would result in any new, \n     Commission-sanctioned coastal or community-based whale \n     hunting, even if the whale hunting is portrayed as \n     noncommercial and including any commercial whaling by coastal \n     communities that does not qualify as aboriginal subsistence \n     whaling; and\n         (3) seek to strengthen conservation and management \n     measures to facilitate the conservation of whale species.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4974-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4822.

FINDINGS ON SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND MENTAL \n                   HEALTH.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 1,500,000 members of the Armed Forces have \n     been deployed in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \n     Enduring Freedom. The 2005 Department of Defense Survey of \n     Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Personnel reports \n     that 23 percent of members of the Armed Forces on active duty \n     acknowledge a significant problem with alcohol use, with \n     similar rates of acknowledged problems with alcohol use among \n     members of the National Guard.\n       (2) The effects of substance abuse are wide ranging, \n     including significantly increased risk of suicide, \n     exacerbation of mental and physical health disorders, \n     breakdown of family support, and increased risk of \n     unemployment and homelessness.\n       (3) While veterans suffering from mental health conditions, \n     chronic physical illness, and polytrauma may be at increased \n     risk for development of a substance use disorder, treatment \n     for these veterans is complicated by the need to address \n     adequately the physical and mental symptoms associated with \n     these conditions through appropriate medical intervention.\n       (4) While the Veterans Health Administration has \n     dramatically increased health services for veterans from 1996 \n     through 2006, the number of veterans receiving specialized \n     substance abuse treatment services decreased 18 percent \n     during that time. No comparable decrease in the national rate \n     of substance abuse has been observed during that time.\n       (5) While some facilities of the Veterans Health \n     Administration provide exemplary substance use disorder \n     treatment services, the availability of such treatment \n     services throughout the health care system of the Veterans \n     Health Administration is inconsistent.\n       (6) According to the Government Accountability Office, the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs significantly reduced its \n     substance use disorder treatment and rehabilitation services \n     between 1996 and 2006, and has made little progress since in \n     restoring these services to their pre-1996 levels.\n\n     SEC. 302.

The 2005 Department of Defense Survey of \n     Health Related Behaviors Among Active Duty Personnel reports \n     that 23 percent of members of the Armed Forces on active duty \n     acknowledge a significant problem with alcohol use, with \n     similar rates of acknowledged problems with alcohol use among \n     members of the National Guard.\n       (2) The effects of substance abuse are wide ranging, \n     including significantly increased risk of suicide, \n     exacerbation of mental and physical health disorders, \n     breakdown of family support, and increased risk of \n     unemployment and homelessness.\n       (3) While veterans suffering from mental health conditions, \n     chronic physical illness, and polytrauma may be at increased \n     risk for development of a substance use disorder, treatment \n     for these veterans is complicated by the need to address \n     adequately the physical and mental symptoms associated with \n     these conditions through appropriate medical intervention.\n       (4) While the Veterans Health Administration has \n     dramatically increased health services for veterans from 1996 \n     through 2006, the number of veterans receiving specialized \n     substance abuse treatment services decreased 18 percent \n     during that time. No comparable decrease in the national rate \n     of substance abuse has been observed during that time.\n       (5) While some facilities of the Veterans Health \n     Administration provide exemplary substance use disorder \n     treatment services, the availability of such treatment \n     services throughout the health care system of the Veterans \n     Health Administration is inconsistent.\n       (6) According to the Government Accountability Office, the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs significantly reduced its \n     substance use disorder treatment and rehabilitation services \n     between 1996 and 2006, and has made little progress since in \n     restoring these services to their pre-1996 levels.\n\n     SEC. 102. EXPANSION OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT \n                   SERVICES PROVIDED BY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     ensure the provision of such services and treatment to each \n     veteran enrolled in the health care system of the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs who is in need of services and treatments \n     for a substance use disorder as follows:\n       (1) Short term motivational counseling services.\n       (2) Intensive outpatient or residential care services.\n       (3) Relapse prevention services.\n       (4) Ongoing aftercare and outpatient counseling services.\n       (5) Opiate substitution therapy services.\n       (6) Pharmacological treatments aimed at reducing craving \n     for drugs and alcohol.\n       (7) Detoxification and stabilization services.\n       (8) Such other services as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate.\n       (b) Provision of Services.--The services and treatments \n     described in subsection (a) may be provided to a veteran \n     described in such subsection--\n       (1) at Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers or \n     clinics;\n       (2) by referral to other facilities of the Department that \n     are accessible to such veteran; or\n       (3) by contract or fee-form service payments with \n     community-based organizations for the provision of such \n     services and treatments.\n       (c) Alternatives in Case of Services Denied Due to Clinical \n     Necessity.--If the Secretary denies the provision to a \n     veteran of services or treatment for a substance use disorder \n     due to clinical necessity, the Secretary shall provide the \n     veteran such other services or treatments as are medically \n     appropriate.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives a report setting forth, for each medical \n     facility of the Department, the availability of the \n     following:\n       (1) Medically supervised withdrawal management.\n       (2) Programs for treatment of alcohol and other substance \n     use disorders that are--\n       (A) integrated with primary health care services; or\n       (B) available as specialty substance use disorder services.\n       (3) Specialty programs for the treatment of post-traumatic \n     stress disorder.\n       (4) Programs to treat veterans who are diagnosed with both \n     a substance use disorder and a mental health disorder.\n\n     SEC. 103.

Mr. President, I am pleased to express my strong support \nfor S. 2162, the Veterans' Mental Health and Other Care Improvements \nAct of 2008, as amended. This bill includes provisions on mental health \ncare, suicide prevention, care for substance use disorders, prevention \nof homelessness, pain and epilepsy care, and other health care matters. \nThis comprehensive legislation addresses many critical issues facing \nour Nation's veterans.\n  Returning home from battle does not necessarily bring an end to \nconflict. Servicemembers return home, but the war often follows them in \ntheir hearts and minds. Their invisible wounds are\n\n[[Page S4986]]\n\ncomplicated and wide-ranging, and we must provide all possible \nassistance. I am working with VA Secretary James Peake to ensure that \nVA is forthright about the numbers of suicides and attempted suicides \namong veterans. Solid and reliable information is critical to our \nunderstanding of the issues. Prevention of suicide is a vitally \nimportant mission.\n  A growing number of veterans are in need of mental health care. VA's \nSpecial Committee on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder advised in its 2006 \nformal report that virtually all returning servicemembers face \nreadjustment issues. An assessment of mental health problems among \nreturning soldiers, recently published in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association in November, 2007, found that 42.4 percent of \nNational Guard and reservists screened by the Department of Defense \nrequired mental health treatment.\n  Additionally, a March 2007 study published in the Archives of \nInternal Medicine reported that more than one-third of war veterans who \nhave served in either Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from various mental \nailments, including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, \ndepression, substance use disorder and other problems. A RAND study \nreleased in April 2008, emphasized the high risks of PTSD and \ndepression, especially among servicemembers sent on multiple \ndeployments, and among National Guard and reservists.\n  Further, the RAND study found that the stigma associated with mental \nhealth care continues to prevent servicemembers and veterans from \naccessing care. VA and the Department of Defense must redouble their \nefforts to ensure that receiving mental health care does not harm one's \ncareer. No individual is immune to the risk of mental health problems, \nand all must have the opportunity to receive care.\n  On April 25, 2007, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing \non veterans' mental health concerns, and on VA's response. We heard \nheart-wrenching testimony from the witnesses.\n  The provisions of this bill are a direct outgrowth of that hearing \nand the testimony given by those who have suffered with mental health \nissues, and by their family members. Earlier versions of the provisions \nincluded in this bill were also discussed at a legislative hearing on \nOctober 24, 2007.\n  This bill represents a bi-partisan approach, and is cosponsored by \nSenators Burr, Rockefeller, Mikulski, Bingaman, Ensign, Smith, Collins, \nClinton, Dole, and Sessions. It is a tribute to Justin Bailey, a \nveteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, who died in a VA domiciliary \nfacility while receiving care for PTSD and a substance use disorder. \nThis was a tragedy that will live on with Justin's parents, who have so \ncourageously advocated for improvements to VA mental health care.\n  Provisions included in this legislative package stem from bills which \nhave all been reported favorably by the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, including: S. 1233 as reported on August 29, 2007; and S. \n2004, S. 2142, S. 2160, and S. 2162, as ordered reported on November \n14, 2007.\n  I will briefly outline other provisions in S. 2162, as amended.\n  As I mentioned, the legislation would make sweeping changes to VA \nmental health treatment and research. Most notably, it would ensure a \nminimum level of substance use disorder care for veterans in need. It \nwould also require VA to improve treatment of veterans with multiple \ndisorders, such as PTSD and substance use disorder. To ascertain if \nVA's residential mental health facilities are appropriately staffed, \nthis bill would mandate a review of such facilities. It would also \ncreate a vital research program on PTSD and Substance Use Disorders, in \ncooperation with, and building on the work of, the National Center for \nPTSD.\n  Veterans with physical and mental wounds often turn to drugs and \nalcohol to ease their pain. Experts believe that stress is the primary \ncause of drug abuse, and of relapse to drug abuse. Research by Sinha, \nFuse, Aubin and O'Malley in Psychopharmacology, 2000, and by Brewer et \nal. in Addiction, 1998, has found that patients with psychological \ntrauma, including PTSD, are often susceptible to alcohol and drug \nabuse. Similarly, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, \npatients subjected to chronic stress, as experienced by those with \nPTSD, are prone to drug use. VA has long dealt with substance abuse \nissues, but there is much more than can be done. This legislation would \nprovide a number of solutions to enhance substance use disorder \ntreatment.\n  The inclusion of families in mental health treatment is vital. To \nthis end, the bill would fully authorize VA to provide mental health \nservices to families of veterans and would set up a program to help \nveterans and families transition to civilian life.\n  Beneficiary travel reimbursements are essential to improving access \nto VA health care for veterans in rural areas. This legislation would \nincrease the beneficiary travel mileage reimbursement rate from 11 \ncents per mile to 28.5 cents per mile, and permanently set the \ndeductible to the 2007 amount of $3 each way.\n  It is important that veterans who rely on VA for their health care \nhave access to emergency care. This bill would make corrections to the \nprocedure used by VA to reimburse community hospitals for emergency \ncare provided to eligible veterans so as to ensure that both veterans \nand community hospitals are not inappropriately burdened by emergency \ncare costs.\n  Too often, veterans suffer from lack of care merely because they are \nunaware of the services available to them. This legislation would \nenhance outreach and accessibility by creating a pilot program on the \nuse of peers to help reach out to veterans. It would also encourage \nimproved accessibility for mental health care in rural areas.\n  The legislation also addresses homelessness, which is far too \nprevalent in the veteran population. The bill would create targeted \nprograms to provide assistance for low-income veteran families. It \nwould also allow homeless service providers to receive VA funds without \noffsetting other sources of income and require that facilities which \nfurnish services to homeless veterans are able to meet the needs of \nwomen veterans.\n  The committee heard testimony that epilepsy is often associated with \ntraumatic brain injury, the injury that many are calling the signature \nwound of the current conflicts. This suggests a strong need to improve \nVA's effectiveness in dealing with epilepsy. The pending legislation \nwould establish six VA epilepsy centers of excellence, which will focus \non research, education, and clinical care activities in the diagnosis \nand treatment of epilepsy. These centers would restore VA to the \nposition of leadership it once held in epilepsy research and treatment.\n  The medical community has made impressive advances in pain care and \nmanagement, but VA has lagged behind in implementing a standardized \npolicy for dealing with pain. The bill includes a provision that would \nestablish a pain care program at all inpatient facilities, to prevent \nlong-term chronic pain disability. It also provides for education for \nVA's health care workers on pain assessment and treatment, and would \nrequire VA to expand research on pain care.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 2162, as amended. It has \nthe potential to bring relief and support to tens of thousands of \nveterans and their families across the country.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \nsubstitute amendment be withdrawn, the Akaka-Burr substitute amendment \nwhich is at the desk be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements related \nto the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, nearly a year ago, I began working on the \nClimate Security Act with two Senators, both of whom I also serve with \non the Armed Services Committee. As members of that committee, we have \nworked together to write and pass defense authorization bills to \nstrengthen our national security and support our military. Senators Joe \nLieberman and John Warner have moved the issue of climate security \nforward in the American dialogue, and I join them in that effort.\n  I understand this bill is viewed by most as an environmental bill--\nwhich it is--but it is also essential to our national security. Just a \nfew weeks ago, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates talked about the \nthreats our Nation faces. He said, ``Rather than one, single entity--\nthe Soviet Union--and one, single animating ideology--communism--we are \ninstead facing challenges from multiple sources: a new, more malignant \nform of terrorism inspired by jihadist extremism, ethnic strife, \ndisease, poverty, climate change, failed and failing states, resurgent \npowers, and so on.'' Of the threats Secretary Gates articulated, we \nknow the predicted negative ramifications of climate change could \ninitiate a chain-reaction of events such as severe drought or floods \nthat diminish food supply and displace millions of people.\n  Additionally, last year 11 retired three-star and four-star admirals \nand generals issued a report, National Security and the Threat of \nClimate Change. They had four primary findings: (1) Projected climate \nchange poses a serious threat to America's national security; (2) \nClimate change acts as a threat multiplier for instability in some of \nthe most volatile regions of the world; (3) Projected climate change \nwill add to tensions even in stable regions of the world; and (4) \nClimate\n\n[[Page S4990]]\n\nchange, national security and energy dependence are a related set of \nglobal challenges. At the release of this report, retired General and \nformer Army Chief of Staff Gordon Sullivan said, ``People are saying \nthey want to be perfectly convinced about climate science projections, \nbut speaking as a soldier, we never have 100 percent certainty. If you \nwait until you have 100 percent certainty, something bad is going to \nhappen on the battlefield.''\n  Adding to this concern, a joint report issued by the Center for \nStrategic and International Studies and Center for a New American \nSecurity, has made clear that we are now in the age of consequences \nregarding the foreign policy and national security implications of \nglobal climate change. The consequences range from expected to \ncatastrophic, and a key finding is that the United States must come to \nterms with climate change. According to the report, we can expect \nstrengthened geopolitical influence by fuel exporting countries, and a \ncorrelating weakened strategic and economic influence by importers of \nall fuels. We can expect many more consequences, but in short, the \nintersection of climate change and the security of nations will become \na defining reality in the years ahead. We cannot ignore the costs of \ninaction and we cannot leave these massive security concerns to the \nnext generation.\n  This is not a perfect bill, and a perfect bill likely does not exist. \nHowever, the fundamental approach of this bill--providing a market \ndriven system--is the right way to address climate change.\n  I am disappointed that this bill fails to consider the need for more \nnuclear energy in the United States. Patrick Moore, co-founder of \nGreenpeace made the need for nuclear energy clear when he wrote, ``. . \n. my views have changed, and the rest of the environmental movement \nneeds to update its views, too, because nuclear energy may just be the \nenergy source that can save our planet from another possible disaster: \ncatastrophic climate change.'' In order to meet all of the projected \nmodels for reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, we need a nuclear \nrenaissance in this country, and this bill must be the vehicle by which \nwe advance that renaissance. Nuclear energy, after decades of dormancy, \nmust be given an opportunity to be an affordable and reliable energy \nchoice for consumers. Wind and solar will play a role in our low-carbon \nenergy needs, but as of now they are not reliable, and cannot provide \nthe base load electricity generation that is needed, and that which \nnuclear energy, can provide. Nuclear is safe, reliable, low-cost energy \nand those who oppose it will find themselves in the precarious position \nof being unable to seriously confront climate change.\n  We have a solution to low-cost electricity generation in nuclear \nenergy, and we also have a solution to high fuel costs--the answer is \nmore domestic exploration here at home. Americans are clearly aware \nthat our dependence on foreign oil is far too dangerous and much too \ncostly. A significant amount of our oil comes from the Middle East, \nRussia and Venezuela--three parts of the world that do not have U.S. \ninterests in mind in their oil production. As former Director of \nCentral Intelligence James Woolsey noted, ``we're paying for both sides \nin the war on terror.'' At approximately $130 per barrel of oil, we are \nenriching, by billions of dollars, the likes of Iran's Ahmadinejad, \nRussia's Putin, and Venezuela's Chavez. They are flush with oil cash \nand are leveraging their influence against ours with Beijing and New \nDelhi in a geopolitical chess match.\n  We must shift away from our dependence on foreign oil, and this bill, \nprobably more than any other the Congress has ever considered, provides \nthe resources and framework to do just that. Under this bill, the \nNatural Resources Defense Council estimates oil imports to drop to 35 \npercent of total U.S. oil supply by 2030, compared to the approximately \n60 percent of foreign oil imports we rely on today. In fact, by 2025 \noil imports are expected to drop to around 6 million barrels per day, \nthe lowest point since 1986. That is a savings of more than 8 million \nbarrels a day--more oil than the United States currently imports from \nOPEC. We achieve these reductions through an overall reduction in \ndemand, and increased domestic oil production due to increased use of \nEnhanced Oil Recovery--a process by which we sequester carbon from \npower plants to derive more oil from the ground. What all this means \nfor families is that under this bill, the average household will pay 13 \nto 17 percent less for transportation fuels in 2020 than they did in \n2007. This is a savings of up to $530 a year at the pump for Americans.\n  The long-term outlook is positive for weaning ourselves off of \nforeign oil, but there is a major flaw in this bill in that it does not \naddress our near-term energy needs for more domestic oil and natural \ngas exploration and production. Increased oil and natural gas access \nhere at home is essential to lowering the high fuel costs consumers are \nfeeling today and for keeping them low in the early years of this bill. \nLower fuel costs will get our economy back on track and increase our \nenergy security. Unfortunately, efforts to allow that access to our \nAmerican resources have been blocked for years by our friends across \nthe aisle. The high cost of fuel is unsustainable, and we must take \naction to increase our domestic energy supply--this means we must \nexplore and produce here at home. At a time when Americans are \nexperiencing record high oil prices, we must begin exploration in areas \nsuch as the Gulf of Mexico and in remote areas of Alaska where the \nlocal population supports it. There is no silver bullet, but there are \ncommonsense solutions that we must move forward, in the wake of $4 per \ngallon gasoline.\n  It is time to put more dollars back in the hands of Americans instead \nof foreign dictators. Our energy independence will drive our economic \nsuccess. In keeping our economy the envy of the world, it is important \nto note that not addressing climate change is a costly course of \naction. The Stern Review, the leading analysis of the economic aspects \nof climate change conducted by Sir Nicholas Stern, former chief \neconomist at the World Bank, estimates that the monetary cost of \ninaction is equivalent to losing at least 5 percent, or $2.4 trillion, \nof global gross domestic product each year.\n  Indeed, delaying action comes at a cost! Paul Volcker, former Federal \nReserve Chairman under President Ronald Reagan stated, ``If we don't \ntake action on climate change, you can be sure that our economies will \ngo down the drain in the next 30 years.''\n  The National Academy of Sciences stated this year that global warming \nthreatens roads, rail lines, ports, and airports. America's global \ncompetitiveness is also at stake on this issue.\n  We used to be the leader in wind, solar, nuclear, and other low-\ncarbon energy. Acting on climate change first puts the United States in \na position to develop and own new technologies and all the jobs that \ncome with them. We have never ceded ground on American competitiveness \nto China, India, and other developing countries, nor should we on this \nissue. We do not address climate change without the entire world \nplaying a role, but we also do not address it by waiting for others to \nact. And we can take action in a way that continues to grow our \neconomy.\n  With the right policy that spurs investment and innovation, we can \ndeploy new technologies that will cut our emissions and not change our \nlifestyles. We have an opportunity to seize these new technologies, or \nwe can wait and cede ground to others.\n  The status quo just will not work, not this time and not on this \nissue. The current path is untenable. It leaves the future of our \neconomy in the hands of volatile and unfriendly nations from which we \nimport oil. It allows the quiet growth of the predicted negative \nramifications of climate change that national security experts have \ncautioned us about. And it leaves us less competitive in new and green \ntechnologies.\n  Cap and trade, first adopted for acid rain under the 1990 Clean Air \nAct amendments, is an American environmental and economic success \nstory. There is no doubt that this is a much greater challenge and one \nthat affects every sector of the economy. We have the ability to repeat \nthat success. Our constituents do not send us to Washington to sit back \nand do the easy things. Rather, they send us here to have the courage \nto tackle the challenges.\n  This may be one of the hardest things we do, but as American leaders, \nwe have a responsibility to lead. We have a responsibility to find \ncommonsense solutions to the hard problems\n\n[[Page S4991]]\n\nand not be afraid of carrying out those solutions.\n  A clean environment and economic and national security should not be \nRepublican or Democratic issues. These are American issues. We have the \nopportunity to lead and to change the entire landscape of this dialog.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I get to change the dialog completely. I ask \nunanimous consent to share joy as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/03/senate-section/article/S4991-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE BIRTH OF MEGAN RILEY McGRADY\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I get to announce to my Senate family that I \nam a grampa again. Incidentally, that is spelled with an ``m'' and no \n``d,'' grampa, the greatest title anyone can have. It is an \nindescribable thrill. It is incredible love. You cannot comprehend all \nof what I am saying unless you have a grandchild.\n  I have two other grandchildren, but this time Diana's and my youngest \nchild, the baby of the family, had a baby. Emily and her husband Mike, \nMike McGrady, met at the University of Wyoming. Mike broke family \nFlorida University Gator tradition to come to Wyoming, but it was part \nof God's plan. Emily and Mike fell in love and got married. Emily \nworked for the university while Mike went to law school. When he \ngraduated, he got a job clerking for Federal Circuit Court Judge Terry \nO'Brien.\n  Last year they bought a house. This year, they called to ask what we \nwere planning to do for Memorial Day and suggested we might want to be \nnear them for the birth of our grandchild. We were near. Our daughter \nEmily and her daughter Megan had extremely fortunate timing for Diana \nand me. Diana and I were in Wyoming for the workweek. Some call it a \nrecess. I prefer to call it, more accurately, a workweek.\n  The baby started coming almost on schedule. We went to the hospital \nwhen Emily went into labor. The family took turns walking the halls \nwith Emily while she could. After 13 hours of labor, mother and baby \nwere getting so tired the doctor suggested--strongly suggested--a \nCesarean section to take the baby. When nothing is progressing, there \nis no other decision. Surgery is always a scary decision.\n  But at 8:33 on May 29, we had a granddaughter, Megan Riley McGrady. \nShe weighed 6 pounds, 14 ounces, and was 20 inches long with delicate \nhands and long, thin fingers. I cannot begin to share the emotion and \nfeeling that overwhelms me today. It is such an incredible feeling to \nhold another generation in your hands, to see such a miniature person \nand such a huge miracle.\n  I had the pleasure of holding that baby and watching her breathe and \nmove with 100 different facial expressions--with the tongue in, the \ntongue out, yawns, eyes closed and eyes wide, and listened to all the \nlittle sounds she made. I watched her hands close to tight fists and \nthen open as if to stretch. Of course, I had to let my wife Diana hold \nher a little, too, and Megan's mom and dad, Emily and Mike, wanted a \nturn, too, and Mike's parents, Tom and Mary McGrady, came all the way \nfrom Florida and, of course, they wanted turns, too.\n  It was a grand time for our family. I have some instant replay \nmemories of that little face and those moving hands and the blanket and \ncap to hold in the body heat or the little pink bow on a pink band \ncircling her tiny head. They are all locked in my mind, and I am \nconstantly doing little instant replay memories for myself and thanking \nGod for the opportunities that he has given me from finding Diana to \nlearning about prayer with our first child, the daughter who was born \npremature, who showed us how worthwhile fighting for life is, to the \nbirth of our son, to the birth of our youngest daughter, this one who \nhad the baby, to helping me through open heart surgery so I might have \nthis chance to hold another generation in my hands.\n  I think of the Prayer of Jabez in Chronicles where he says: Lord, \nplease continue to bless me, indeed. And I add my thanks for this and \nall the blessings noticed and, unfortunately, often unnoticed.\n  So now I am a grampa. That is not grandfather. That is too stilted. \nYears ago, my daughter gave me a hand-stitched wall hanging that says: \n``Any man can be a father, but it takes someone special to be a dad.''\n  That is a challenge for grampas to live up to, too. Please note the \nname is not ``grandpa.'' That is a great title, but it is a little too \nelevated. As I said before, my name, grampa, is spelled with an ``m'' \nand no ``d.'' That is what I called my Grampa Bradley who took me on \nsome wonderful adventures and taught me a lot of important lessons.\n  Now it is my turn to live up to that valued name. He liked to be \ncalled grampa, and I am now delighted to have the opportunity to earn \nthat name. I wish I could adequately share the joy with you that is in \nmy heart.\n  After Megan was born, I went to the Republican Convention. When I \nspoke, I mentioned my mom's admonition that I need to pass on to my \ngrandchildren; that is, to do what is right, to do your best, to treat \nothers as they want to be treated. I use that guideline every day and \nexpect everyone on my staff to measure legislation and casework by it \ntoo.\n  Now I have an additional measure for myself. I don't ever want my \ngrandkids to say: My grampa could have fixed that, but he didn't. I do \nknow that most of what I do fix they will never know about. That is how \nAmerica is supposed to work. America is a lot of people doing their \njob, doing it because it needs to be done, not because someone will \ngive them acclaim.\n  Some would say that you, my granddaughter, Megan Riley McGrady, have \nbeen born at a scary time, a time of fear, fear of almost everybody, \nfear of war, fear of people from other countries, fear for our \nneighborhoods, worry about energy supplies and energy prices and the \neffect on food prices.\n  As an Enzi, we have faith that doing the right thing, doing our best, \nand treating others as they want to be treated will solve most problems \nwhich will overcome fear.\n  In my job, I get to hear lots of disparaging comments about our \ncountry and our Government, but you, granddaughter, were very lucky to \nbe born in this country. I have been to a lot of places in the world \nnow, and I can tell you that there are none that I would trade for the \nUnited States. In my job, I often have to remind people that I never \nhear about anybody trying to get out of our country, but I do hear of \nmillions who would love to live here.\n  As you get older, precious baby, if things don't change, you will \nhear people who think Government owes them a living and all kinds of \nguarantees, and you will hear people portray business as greedy, and \nyou will see attempts to keep faith and God out of your vocabulary. And \nall those things could come to pass, except for you, you and your \nfamily, you and others who will know how to do the right thing and will \nvalue the way our country was founded and has grown.\n  Megan, granddaughter, welcome to this world of promise and hope and \nfaith and love. Your whole family is excited to have you in our lives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
