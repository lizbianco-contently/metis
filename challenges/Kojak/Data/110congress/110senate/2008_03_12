Democrats have campaigned hard on the promise of tax \nrelief for the ``middle class.'' They say any tax hikes they propose \nwould only affect ``the rich.''\n  This, of course, raises a question. Who exactly are Democrats calling \nrich? Let's take a look.\n  According to Democrats, the ``rich'' include single workers who earn \n$34,000 a year. First year schoolteachers in Jefferson County, KY, earn \n$35,982 a year. I don't think they are rich.\n  According to Democrats, couples are rich if they earn $63,000 a year. \nI doubt that couples with children who make $63,000 a year think that \nthey are rich.\n  The fact is, under the Democratic plan, a lot of people will wake up \nhappy to hear they are rich, only to realize the only change in their \nlives is a hefty tax sock to their wallets. So much for the good news. \nIt is what Patrick Moynihan might have called ``defining wealthy \ndown''.\n  But there is a purpose behind the rhetoric. Democrats couldn't \nsupport their $1.2 trillion in spending--and the largest tax hike in \nhistory--unless they cast their tax hike nets far and wide.\n  So they have proposed to raise taxes on tens of millions of \nindividuals and families that they call ``rich.''\n  Under the Democratic plan for taxing the ``rich,'' a single mother \nwho earns $45,000 a year would see her taxes go up.\n  Under the Democratic plan for taxing the ``rich,'' 7.8 million low-\nwage earners will be added, back to the tax rolls, workers who are now \nconsidered too low-income to pay any income tax at all.\n  Under the Democratic plan for taxing the ``rich'', 43 million \nfamilies would be hit with an average tax increase of $2,300 next year.\n  These are the people that Democrats in Washington are calling \n``rich''--folks who would laugh if you told them that after a monthly \nbudgeting session around the kitchen table.\n  One would think that as the economy slows and fears spread about the \ncost of fuel, health care and food rising even higher, our friends on \nthe other side could resist reverting to type.\n  The last thing middle-class families can afford is a higher tax bill \nthis year.\n  So as the debate over the budget continues, let's be clear about who \nwill be picking up the tab for the largest tax hike in U.S. history. It \nis not just the rich.\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the only thing we haven't heard about the \nRepublicans' plan to take care of the world is tort reform. That is \nusually part of the mantra. We have a situation where everything that \nshould be going up is going down. We have an economy that is spiraling \ndown. We have a housing market that is in crisis. We have gas prices \nthat are predicted, by early summer, to be an average of over $4 a \ngallon. We have a war that is now starting its sixth year, and it is \ncosting us $420 million a day. We have an economy that has gone from \ngood to terrible. And we have a budget that has been put together with \na tremendous soft touch. What does that mean? It means we are \nrecognizing the problems we have in our economy, and we want to return \nto those days where we were paying down the national debt.\n  This isn't pie in the sky. We have actually done it. This is a \nblueprint for how we need to proceed with our economy. I commend and \napplaud Senator Conrad for putting this budget together. There is \nnothing in this budget that talks about increasing taxes. In fact, what \nthis budget does is decrease taxes for the middle class. In fact, that \nis what the Baucus amendment which is now pending is all about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1916-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there has been progress made on a farm bill. \nWe can't leave here without doing a farm bill. I think it is something \nwe need to do. We worked hard. We have agreed on how much money it is \ngoing to take. I had a meeting yesterday with Senator Harkin and \nSenator Baucus on our side. They have had good working relationships \nwith their counterparts, Senators Grassley and Chambliss. They are \nworking well with their House counterparts. We have had a little \nsetback because Chairman Rangel has been hospitalized. We were hopeful \nthat he would be out today. In fact, we had a meeting scheduled today. \nBut he is not going to be back to work today. That has slowed us up a \nlittle bit. But we all look toward doing a farm bill. It is something \nwe need to do, and we are going to work very hard on a bipartisan \nbasis, which is the only way we can have a farm bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add to the remarks of the \nmajority leader that I, too, believe it is important to have a farm \nbill. It has been a challenging process, to say the least, for our \nnegotiators, but they continue to make progress. I, too, am optimistic \nthat we can get there. I think it is important to the country that we \ndo get\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\nthere. This extension we just passed was regretfully necessary, but it \ndoesn't lessen in any way the need to get a farm bill, a 5- or 6-year \nextension, depending upon what is negotiated. We are continuing to work \nalong those lines and hope to get there.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1917-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1917-S1992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                            2009--Continued\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the leaders for the action they \nhave taken for a short-term extension of the farm bill so that we can \nconclude action on it. It has been a negotiation that has gone on well \nover a year. That is not unusual for a farm bill which is extremely \ncontentious.\n  I wanted to comment briefly on the Republican leader's statements \nthis morning about our budget. As I was driving in this morning, I \nheard another Republican on the air saying that we have a trillion-\ndollar tax increase in this budget. I don't know what budget they are \ntalking about because it certainly is not the budget we have presented \nhere. There is no trillion-dollar tax increase here. There is no tax \nincrease assumed here. Honestly, if I would go down to the Senate \ndining room and come to this floor and introduce the dining room menu \nas the budget for the United States, our Republican colleagues would \nsay it was a trillion-dollar tax increase.\n  This is what they said last year, and we hear the same mantra again \nthis year: It is a trillion-dollar tax increase. When they said it last \nyear, we didn't have a record of a Democratic Congress to refute their \nclaim. Now we do. We can look back and see precisely what happened with \nDemocrats in control. How much did taxes increase after the Republicans \nasserted repeatedly we were going to increase taxes a trillion dollars? \nWhat happened? What happened on the record, not a projection, not a \nforecast, not rhetorical, what is the fact? It is very interesting. \nDemocrats controlling the House, controlling the Senate, cut taxes $194 \nbillion--not a tax increase, a tax cut that overwhelmingly has gone to \nthe middle class. That is the Democratic record.\n  Let me say about this budget, we don't have the vast spending \nincreases they are talking about. For this year, if you look at total \nspending, we have 1 percent more than the President's budget. Where is \nthat money going? We put it into energy, to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. We put it into education, and we put it into \ninfrastructure because we don't want any more bridges, like the one in \nMinnesota last year, collapsing into the river with people driving home \nfrom work. That is a fact.\n  In terms of revenue, the truth is that over the 5 years, we have 2.6 \npercent more revenue than in the President's budget. We believe that \ncan be obtained not with a tax increase--don't need a tax increase to \nget it--you can go after the tax gap, the difference between what \ncompanies and people owe versus what they are actually paying. You can \ngo after these offshore tax havens which the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations has told us are costing this country $100 billion a \nyear. You can go after these abusive tax shelters where we have the \nspectacle of companies in the United States, banks buying foreign sewer \nsystems and depreciating them on their books in the United States to \nreduce their tax bill here, and then they lease the sewer systems back \nto the European cities that built them. My goodness. We are better than \nthat as a nation, better than letting people abuse the vast majority of \nus who are honest. That is not right. That is not fair.\n  I have shown on this floor many times a picture of a five-story \noffice building in the Cayman Islands called Ugland House. That 5-story \nbuilding is home to 12,800 companies. I would say that is the most \nefficient building in the world.\n  Mr. President, 12,800 companies claim they are doing business out of \nthis little five-story building in the Cayman Islands. They are not \ndoing business there. The only business they are doing is monkey \nbusiness. What they are doing is evading their taxes.\n  Now we have seen, according to the Boston Globe, another building \ndown in the Cayman Islands--this time a four- or five-story building \ntoo--and we know KBR, who is the biggest contractor for security forces \nin Iraq and additional workers in Iraq for the U.S. military effort \nthere, is running an operation out of that building to evade the Social \nSecurity taxes and the Medicare taxes of thousands and thousands of \nworkers they have employed for Iraq--another tax scam.\n  It is exactly the kind of thing we on this side think should be \nclosed down. Over and over, when we have tried, this President said: \nNo, you can't do that. That would be a tax increase. Really? Is that a \ntax increase? I do not think so. Making people pay their fair share, \nlike the vast majority of Americans already do--I do not think that is \na tax increase. I think that is making those folks pay like all the \nrest of us do. That is fair.\n  Mr. President, we have Senators on the floor ready to offer an \namendment. I want to go to that at this moment.\n  I ask Senator Bingaman, how much time----\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will withhold. Senator Gregg is seeking \nrecognition.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                     Senator Conrad's 60th Birthday\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise this morning to say this is a big, \nbig, big day for the chairman of the committee, and I know he would not \nwant this day to go unacknowledged after having made such an eloquent \nstatement. But it is the chairman's 60th birthday today. So I \ncongratulate him and say, on his 60th birthday, we appreciate all he \nhas done for the last 60 years, and we hope he will be here for another \n60 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member for his \ncontinuing courtesy and graciousness. This is my 60th. As I left the \nhouse this morning, I told my wife and our son, who is there visiting, \nI have to question: What have I done wrong in my life to have my 60th \nbirthday spent here managing the budget? But I will get over it.\n  I appreciate the many courtesies of the ranking member. This is a \nspecial day for me, and I am looking forward to a good debate.\n  With that, we want to go to the next amendment, unless the Senator--\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after Senator \nBingaman has spoken on his amendment, and to the extent Senator \nAlexander wishes to speak, that we then, after that, go to our side for \nthe next amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Fair enough.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, if you can give us a \nheads up at some point what your next amendment will be, that would be \nhelpful as well.\n  Now we will turn to Senator Bingaman and Senator Alexander, who I \nthink have a very constructive amendment. We welcome their description \nof it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time come off the resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill and all \ncolleagues. Let me mention, I believe Senator Kennedy wishes to speak \nin favor of the amendment after Senator Alexander speaks. So I believe \nhe will be coming to the floor. I hope there is an opportunity for him \nto do that before we proceed too far this morning.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4173\n\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4173 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Alexander, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Domenici, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n     Ensign, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Schumer, Mr. Biden, and\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\n     Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 4173.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide additional funding resources in FY2009 for \n    investments in innovation and education in order to improve the \n                 competitiveness of the United States)\n\n       On page 11, line 13, increase the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 14, increase the amount by $306,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 18, increase the amount by $210,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 22, increase the amount by $60,000,000.\n       On page 12, line 1, increase the amount by $12,000,000.\n       On page 12, line 5, increase the amount by $12,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $600,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $306,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, decrease the amount by $210,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 25, decrease the amount by $60,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 4, decrease the amount by $12,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 8, decrease the amount by $12,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment I am offering on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Alexander, Senator Kennedy, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Ensign, and others to offer an amendment to \nthe budget resolution to do two things: to fund the Office of Science \nwithin the Department of Energy and also to fund the National Science \nFoundation at the fiscal year 2009 funding levels that have been \nproposed in the President's budget.\n  Last year, on a bipartisan basis, Congress passed the COMPETES Act. I \ncompliment my colleague, who is here on the floor with me today, \nSenator Alexander, for his leadership in that legislation. This was \nbipartisan legislation. It was strongly endorsed by Members of the \nSenate. It authorized a number of programs based upon the \nrecommendations that came from the National Academies report entitled \n``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.''\n  Specifically, the COMPETES Act authorized a doubling of the budgets \nfor the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy's \nOffice of Science over a period of 7 years. The Office of Science and \nthe National Science Foundation are the two principal agencies charged \nwith maintaining the nondefense basic science enterprise of our Nation, \nwhich serves as the wellspring for future innovation and for our global \ncompetitiveness.\n  For the Office of Science, the America COMPETES Act authorized a 12-\npercent increase relative to fiscal year 2007. The President's Advanced \nCompetitiveness Initiative would have increased the Office of Science \nby 7.2 percent. For the National Science Foundation, the COMPETES Act \nauthorized a 12-percent increase as compared to the President's \nAdvanced Competitiveness Initiative proposed increase of 9.3 percent.\n  The COMPETES Act was passed into law last August. At that time, the \nappropriations bills in both Chambers kept the funding levels for both \noffices I am speaking about here at or above the President's request. \nBut by the time the Congress made the deep cuts that were required by \nthe administration in order to get an omnibus spending bill passed in \nDecember, all of the gains that had earlier been in appropriations \nbills for the Office of Science and for the National Science Foundation \nwere lost, and both of those offices were flat funded when you account \nfor inflation.\n  Let me talk a few minutes about why these two programs are so \nimportant to our ability to compete globally. As noticed in the \nPresident's budget, the National Science Foundation is the principal \nsource of Federal support for strengthening science and math education. \nEducation and human resource programs at the National Science \nFoundation support technological innovation to enhance economic \ncompetitiveness and new job growth. They address the workforce needs of \nthe country. They help to ensure a pool of talented experts. Many of \nthese programs are critical to developing and advancing the knowledge \nof our country's K through 12 math and science teachers as well.\n  When we passed the America COMPETES Act, we recognized that this \ncountry is facing a critical shortage in well-prepared math and science \nteachers. Accordingly, we significantly expanded the Robert Noyce \nScholarship program, which prepares science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics undergraduate students and professionals to become math \nand science teachers. Among a number of changes, we required increased \ncollaboration between science and education faculty to establish STEM \nteacher education programs--STEM, of course, refers to science, \ntechnology, engineering, and math teachers--and increased scholarships \nand stipends to at least $10,000 per year, for up to 3 years of \nscholarship support, beginning with the junior year.\n  We also increased funding significantly in order to meet these \nobjectives. Congress anticipated that the Noyce program would grow to \nbecome a major source of effective training for our science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics teachers. Research shows that \nstudents' performance on annual math and science assessments improved \nin almost every age group when their schools were involved in a program \nthat linked K through 12 teachers with their colleagues in higher \neducation.\n  The Math and Science Partnership I am referring to helps forge these \nconnections between K through 12 and higher education to strengthen \nmath and science teaching skills, improve curriculum, and provide \ncollege preparatory programs for students.\n  The Office of Science at the Department of Energy also makes \nsignificant contributions to math and science education. Among the \nthings the America COMPETES Act authorizes for the Department of \nScience are: to help establish statewide specialty schools in math and \nscience; to get middle and high school students around the State \ninvolved in national laboratories through internship programs; and to \nrequire the national laboratories to partner with local school \ndistricts and to adopt at least one high-need high school and transform \nthese schools into centers of excellence in mathematics and science.\n  This is only a small part of what the Office of Science does. Simply \nput, it provides the support for much of the basic scientific research \nthat will drive the industries of the future. It funds facilities that \nhelp us understand the basics of materials, funds research into such \ncritical areas as biogenetic sequencing, and provides support for much \nof the physical sciences enterprise in this country.\n  Once again, for fiscal year 2009, the President has come forward \nproposing increases for both the National Science Foundation and the \nOffice of Science. Relative to fiscal year 2008, the President's \nproposed budget increase for these two agencies amounts to $1.4 \nbillion. This amount would not bring the levels for these two agencies \nto the full level we authorized in the America COMPETES Act for fiscal \nyear 2009, but they are a substantial step in the right direction, and \nI strongly support these increases.\n  So the amendment my cosponsors and I are offering today adds another \n$600 million to the budget resolution, as reported by the Committee on \nthe Budget, to at least meet the level the President has indicated he \nis willing to support. I believe this addition to the budget resolution \ncan and should command broad bipartisan support in the Senate, just as \nthe America COMPETES Act was broadly supported on a bipartisan basis \nhere in the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I know my colleague \nfrom Tennessee is here to speak in favor of it as well. I again \ncompliment him for his leadership on the issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nBingaman, has been tireless in helping to create the America COMPETES \nAct, which passed unanimously here. But even more important than that, \nhe did not walk away from it once it became law. He has attended to the \ndetails of trying to make sure we implement it. One of those details is \nwhat we are doing today.\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\n  I wish to, in support of what he has said so eloquently--and I also \ncommend Senator Domenici from New Mexico, who has had such a key role \nin this effort--I wish to tell a story that helps put in perspective \nwhat we are talking about.\n  Two years ago, a group of Senators traveled to China, led by Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye. We were received very well because Senator \nStevens had flown with the Flying Tigers. He flew the first plane to \nland in Beijing after World War II, and the top Chinese leaders had not \nforgotten. And, of course, Senator Inouye is a Congressional Medal of \nHonor winner for his heroic service to our country in World War II.\n  So we saw President Hu, and the No. 2 man in China, Mr. Wu. What \nstruck me about those two meetings--which were about an hour long, and \nduring which we could have talked about Taiwan or Iraq or Iran or \nChina's military buildup or America's intelligence system--the subject \nabout which they wanted to talk the most and which animated them the \nmost in their conversation was the subject Senator Bingaman just \ndiscussed: how China can use its brainpower to create a higher standard \nof living for the people of China.\n  We are in an economic slowdown in America today, and we are debating \nand talking here about how we restore our level of progress \neconomically. We are talking not only about the Federal budget, we are \ntalking about the family budget. We are talking about family incomes. \nWe are talking about jobs. That was the same subject the No. 1 and No. \n2 men in China wanted to talk about as well. What were they focusing \non? The fact of trying to give to China the same kind of brainpower \nadvantage in creating a high standard of living we have had in America, \nsince World War II especially. This year, despite the economic \nslowdown, the United States of America will create about 30 percent of \nall the world's wealth for 5 percent of the world's people, who are \nthose of us who live in the United States. That is an astonishing fact. \nThere are many reasons for it, including our free market system, our \ngeography, our character, the immigration that has brought talented \npeople from all over the world who are entrepreneurial in their \nspirit. But most people agree that the major fact in the high standard \nof living for this country since World War II has been our brainpower \nadvantage. We have not only some of the best universities in the world, \nwe have almost all of them. We have a set of national laboratories that \nis unequaled in the world. Until recently, at least, our system of \nkindergarten through the 12th grade education has been the envy of the \nworld. As a result of all that brainpower, we have created a lot of \njobs and a high standard of living. Increasingly, that is where the new \njobs come from. That is why we like to have foreign students come here, \nbecause they become educated in our universities and we are, in effect, \ninsourcing brainpower, so they create Google in the United States of \nAmerica rather than in India or in China, and the jobs are here in the \nUnited States of America.\n\n  So the America COMPETES Act, to which Senator Bingaman referred, had \nbroad support here. It is the only legislation we have had in the last \n4 years that I remember was supported by Senator Frist and Senator \nReid. Then, when the Senate changed hands and the Democrats were in the \nmajority, it was sponsored by Senator Reid and Senator McConnell. At \none point, it had 70 Members of the Senate backing it, 35 Senators who \nare Democrats and 35 Republicans. It all came from a request that \nSenator Bingaman and I and others--including House Member Bart Gordon \nof Tennessee, the chairman of the Science Committee now--made of the \nNational Academy of Sciences: Please tell us, in priority order, what \nare the 10 things we in Congress ought to do to help keep our \nbrainpower advantage so our jobs will not go overseas. Norm Augustine, \nthe former chairman of Lockheed Martin, a member of the National \nAcademy of Engineering, assembled a group of Nobel laureates, \nuniversity presidents, and others, and they came back with 20 specific \nrecommendations in the Augustine report. There was also other important \nwork being done by the Council on Competitiveness. We put all that \ntogether over 2 years. The President weighed in, in a big way, in two \nstraight State of the Union Addresses and budgets. The Speaker of the \nHouse also weighed in, in an important way. So in this endeavor, on \nthis important issue, we are all on the same team. But what we are \ndoing today with this amendment is making sure we get where we have \nagreed we want to go.\n  Now, for President Hu in China, all he had to do was walk over to \ntheir National Academy of Sciences in China, he convened them all in \nthe Great Hall--and said: This is what we will do over the next 10 \nyears. We are going to increase support for our universities and \nresearch through a percent of our domestic product. We are going to \nrecruit from American universities talented Chinese professors who have \ndistinguished themselves in the United States and they are going to \ncome back and help improve Chinese universities. So, in China, the top \nman gave the order and they are on their way. Here, a lot more of us \nhave to be involved, but we are all involved. The President has said we \nneed an 18-percent increase for Fiscal Year 2009 to stay on a track to \ndouble funding for the physical sciences over the next 10 years; 18 \npercent for the Office of Science, which is our principal funder of our \nnational laboratories and science programs, and 13 percent in the \nNational Science Foundation. That is bigger than it normally would be \nbecause of the way the appropriations process worked last year. We \ndidn't do what we all agreed we wanted to be able to do.\n  So the Budget Committee did a pretty good job in reporting to the \nfloor a budget resolution with sufficient provisions to fund this \nyear's version of the America COMPETES Act. There are a wide range of \nthose programs. There are opportunities for low-income children to take \nadvanced placement courses which they now can't afford and to train the \nteachers who need to be trained to teach those courses. There are \nopportunities for summer academies at our laboratories and at \nuniversities to interest our students in math and sciences. The \nAugustine Commission reviewed programs all over America and recommended \nonly a handful that ought to be emulated, and they included programs \nsuch as the UTeach program in Texas at the University of Texas which \nattracts outstanding students in chemistry and physics, for example, \nand gives them scholarships if they will agree to become teachers of \nchemistry and physics.\n  Former Gov. Jim Hunt of North Carolina told me the University of \nNorth Carolina only graduated one physics teacher in one recent year. \nWe are not going to learn much physics in America, to keep up with the \nChinese and Indians and Irish and all the others who are trying to \nincrease their brainpower to increase their jobs if we don't graduate \nphysics teachers. So the Budget Committee did a good and important job.\n  What we are trying to do is to get back on track to double funding \nfor the physical sciences over 10 years, which is what we all agreed we \nshould try to do. That was our goal. A huge majority in the House, the \nSenate, and the President himself, we are asking that the Senate make \nroom in the budget for the President's number for the America COMPETES \nAct. That is what this amendment does.\n  So I feel confident we will have substantial support, because so many \nof us worked so hard for so long on this idea.\n  We Republicans are talking these days in unflattering ways about the \nDemocratic budget. Senator Reid, the majority leader, said he hadn't \nheard about tort reform yet. Well, he will, before we are through. One \nway to help the family budget is to make it easier for pregnant women \nin rural areas to get medical care without driving 60 miles, and one \nway to do that is to put some limits on medical malpractice suits. That \nis tort reform. That will help the family budget. Lower taxes help the \nfamily budget. Lower energy costs help the family budget. But on this \nside of the aisle, we also believe that better schools and investments \nin science and technology, so we can keep our brainpower advantage and \nkeep our jobs from going overseas, is an important part of a pro-growth \nplan.\n\n  When I was Governor of Tennessee, Tennessee's taxes were the lowest \nin the country. I say this with great respect to the Senator from New \nHampshire, who is also here. I double\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\nchecked this fact when I came in. But we were the third poorest State. \nSo we kept our taxes low, but we also had to enact some other pro-\ngrowth policies, which included getting rid of a usury limit, \npreserving the right to work law, reducing the number of employees in \ngovernment, but it also included building highways. Eventually, I came \nto the conclusion that the single most important thing we could do to \nimprove family incomes in our State was to focus on improving the \nquality of schools, colleges, universities, and research, so we began \nto pay teachers more for teaching well. We created chairs of excellence \nat the universities and centers of excellence at the universities. I \nbelieve that partly because of all those things together, our State \nbegan to increase its family incomes at a rate that was faster than any \nother part of our--any other State in the country during the 1980s. It \nwas no coincidence we were also increasing funding for our education \nduring that time at a rate faster than any other State.\n  So an important part of a pro-growth plan--a Republican pro-growth \nplan, but obviously many Democrats agree with this as well--is fully \nfunding the America COMPETES Act, making sure we keep our brainpower \nadvantage so we can keep our jobs.\n  I congratulate the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, for his \nleadership on this, and the senior Senator from New Mexico, Mr. \nDomenici, for his leadership on this. I thank the majority leader and \nthe Republican leader for their co-sponsorship of this act.\n  I say to Senators Conrad and Gregg, I am glad you made room in the \nbudget for much of the America COMPETES Act. I hope we can complete the \njob with the Bingaman amendment so we can keep those jobs from going \noverseas. That is one good way to help advance a pro-growth plan that \nwill help balance the family budget.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the fact that at the real start \nof this debate on the Budget Act, we have an amendment that reflects \nthe best judgment of Republicans and Democrats alike in the Senate, \nwhich is so key to the future of our country, and to listen to our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle at a time when, on so many \nissues, there is divisiveness, but on this issue, there is a real \ncoming together in the Senate on this item for the support of the \nAmerica COMPETES Act.\n  I wish to commend those who have been a part of this process over \nrecent years. It has been truly a bipartisan effort. We have listened \nto Senator Bingaman, Senator Alexander, and others who have been a part \nof this whole process, and it was an enormous achievement this last \nyear when the bill passed the Senate. Now, we are impressed by the fact \nthat those who were involved in making sure this was going to be \nachieved are committed to making sure we are going to have muscle and \nbones on this project in the form of providing the resources which are \nnecessary to make it effective. This is, I think, one of the most \nimportant undertakings we will have in this debate and discussion on \nthe budget, and I am very hopeful we will get a strong vote in support \nof this amendment.\n  Very briefly, I think all of us understand the average family in this \ncountry is exceedingly hard-pressed at this time. They are wondering \nwhether they are going to be able to pay their mortgages, and we are \nfinding out that many are unable to pay their mortgages and they are \nlosing their homes, or they have the threat of losing their homes. It \nis difficult to imagine, I think, for many of us, when parents go to \nbed at night and wonder whether they are going to be able to afford \ntheir mortgages and maintain their home for themselves, their families, \nand for their children, but it is happening in too many parts of this \ncountry. At the same time, those same parents are wondering if they are \ngoing to be able to heat their homes, at least in my part of the \ncountry. With the fact of the extraordinary explosion of the cost of \nhome heating oil, we find so many families are hard-pressed to be able \nto provide heating for their homes.\n  These are families who have worked hard, who have played by the rules \nall their lives, and they are wondering now about what the future will \nhold for themselves and for their parents and for their children. Are \nthey going to be able to make sure their parents are going to be able \nto live their golden years in peace and dignity? They are hard-pressed \nto provide the extra help and assistance to them so they can afford \ntheir prescription drugs. They have seen the cost of tuition go up and \ncontinue to go up, and they wonder if they will be able to educate \ntheir children; while fuel and gas go up, whether they will be able to \nfill the gas tank to get to their jobs where they are working. There is \nenormous anxiety. There is also the concern about rising health care \ncosts. There is enormous rising anxiety out in the country. People are \nwondering: Why should my job be at risk? I have worked hard. I have \nplayed by the rules. I have done everything I possibly can, and still I \nwonder whether in a few years, the opportunities for my children are \ngoing to be as great as opportunities were for me. I know my parents \nsacrificed so I would be able to make progress, and now I wonder \nwhether my children are going to be better off than I was. That is \ngoing on in home after home across this country.\n  It is as a result of the failure of economic policy. It is a failure \nof fiscal and monetary policy over the period of recent years. It is \nnot the fault of these particular families; it is the fault of economic \npolicy and giving the kinds of investments in our country and \ninvestments in individuals that are necessary in order to have a strong \neconomy. We know how to do it. We have seen it done. I am not going to \ntake the time of the Senate to go back over the history where it has \nbeen done and it should be done.\n  So we are faced with where we are today, and this calls for immediate \nassistance for these families. We have seen the efforts that have been \nmade in terms of housing and in terms of the unemployment, the help and \nassistance of fuel assistance and food stamps and others to try to \naddress the immediate kinds of problems families are facing.\n  We also have to look at where we are going to be as a country in \nterms of the future, where we are going to be in 3 to 5 years as we are \nseeing this whole global economy challenge the United States. One \noverarching fact is that the future is going to be the knowledge \neconomy, the economy that puts the premise on knowledge and information \nand education. That is where the future is going to lie. That will be \nthe great competition between the countries of Asia and the United \nStates. We are thinking about how we are going to address that, and the \nCOMPETES Act is one of the important solutions to this challenge.\n  Mr. President, if we look at this chart here, it is interesting in \nterms of U.S. students. To be globally competitive, we need to tackle \nthe achievement gaps. U.S. students from high-income families \noutperform students in other countries in math, while U.S. students \nfrom low-income families lag behind. When you are talking about \ninternational competitiveness, we find that U.S. students who come from \nhigher income families are able to go to schools that are able to \nafford the good teachers, are able to out-compete the students in other \nparts of the world. It is no mystery about how that should be done. But \nstudents who come from lower income families are not able to keep pace. \nThis legislation is designed to, among other things, reduce this gap \nthat exists now in our country.\n  Look at this chart. We have more math classes in high-poverty schools \nthat are taught by teachers without a major in that subject. You have \nlow-poverty secondary schools where the percentage of secondary school \nmath classes taught by teachers without that major is 26 percent. In \nthe high-poverty schools, it is 56 percent. Much of it comes down to \nteachers and the importance of investing in them, to make sure they are \ngoing to have the skills to serve in communities and in school \ndistricts all over the country, and so they are going to have the \ncompetency. If you are not going to have the high-quality teachers in \nunderserved areas, then you are going to have those kinds of results we \nsaw with the other chart where American children are going to fall \nfurther and further behind. It is in this very area that the COMPETES \nAct is directed.\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\n  That is one of the important reasons why this legislation is so \nimportant and why the resources and the investment are so much in the \ninterest of this country and its future in terms of the ability to be \nable to compete.\n  Mr. President, this is a sound amendment that makes a great deal of \nsense for the reasons I have mentioned here and other reasons as well. \nI am hopeful that the Senate will accept it with an overwhelming vote.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4189\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the present \namendment be set aside, and on behalf of Senator Specter, I send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Senator Specter will talk about this \namendment. Essentially, this amendment would repeal the AMT \npermanently, as it relates to middle-income Americans. It is currently \nwrong that we have this tax. It was never intended to be a tax that \nwould cover 20 million Americans. It was supposed to hit high-income \nindividuals who were avoiding taxes, using legal tax vehicles but \nbasically avoiding paying any income tax. It has turned into a monster \nwhere literally 20 million Americans would be subject to the tax unless \nit is adjusted.\n  This budget presumes that it will be abated for this year. There is \nno reason to keep these revenues in the baseline because we know we \nwill do this again next year and the year after that. It is time to \ncorrect this permanently and stop having these illusory revenues, which \nwe turn around and spend, and it creates inappropriate expectations and \nleads to less fiscal discipline here.\n  This is an attempt to address the issue by essentially repealing the \nAMT and addressing the fact that if we don't do this, 20 million \nAmericans will be hit with this tax, and that was never the intention \nof the Federal Government, to get revenues from them. It is wrong to \nhave it on the books.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania will come over to speak to this around \n11:30 or so. The Democratic side may have another amendment relative to \nthis issue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think the amendment the ranking member \nhas set up for Senator Specter doesn't actually have full repeal. \nInstead, what it does is change the individual alternative minimum tax \nfrom its current two-rate structure of 26 percent and 28 percent to the \nsingle 24-percent rate that was in effect prior to 1993. I believe that \nis what the Specter amendment does.\n  The first priority, of course, for dealing with the AMT is to protect \nfamilies who have not been subject to it previously. So our resolution \nacknowledges this priority and provides a 1-year patch to prevent the \nalternative minimum tax from affecting another 20 million American \nhouseholds. That is at a cost of $62 billion.\n  I would prefer that cost be offset, but last year that was not the \nwill of the body. It was not the will of the body in the very clear and \ncompelling vote. So we don't have it offset in our resolution this \nyear.\n  Our resolution acknowledges the political reality that the will of \nthis body is to extend alternative minimum tax relief without paying \nfor it. Restructuring the AMT, as Senator Specter proposes, is even \nmore expensive. The Specter amendment would lose $185 billion in \nrevenue, and it is not paid for in any way--by spending reductions or \nother revenue--and therefore it simply gets added to the deficit and \ndebt. If it were adopted as is, the resolution would be in deficit in \nevery year of the budget window.\n  Mr. President, I don't think that is fiscally responsible, so I am \noffering an amendment that accomplishes the same policy purpose but \nrequires that it be offset, paid for, so that it is not\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\nadded to the deficit and is not added to the debt.\n  I inquire of the Senator, did he send up the Specter amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. I did.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4190\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send the Conrad amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to setting aside \nthe pending amendment so the Senator from North Dakota may submit his \namendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4190.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To add a deficit-neutral reserve fund for repealing the 1993 \n     rate increase for the alternative minimum tax for individuals)\n\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR REFORMING THE \n                   ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX FOR INDIVIDUALS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other levels in this resolution for one or \n     more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, motions, or \n     conference reports that would reinstate the pre-1993 rates \n     for the alternative minimum tax for individuals, by the \n     amounts provided in such legislation for such purpose, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2013 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2018.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think it might be useful here that we \nenter into a unanimous consent agreement that when we go to a fuller \ndebate, the debate on the Specter and Conrad amendments be limited to 1 \nhour. Is that acceptable?\n  Mr. GREGG. I don't see why we cannot put the Kyl amendment in there \nalso.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be a \nhalf hour each on the Specter and Conrad amendments, a total of 1 hour.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Then we will go to the Kyl amendment, and there would \nalso be a side-by-side for that amendment. That would be, at this \npoint, an amendment in my name or by my designee.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that there be a half hour on each for \nthose amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, just to clarify this, other Members may \ncome in and talk during this time. The concept is that this hour is \nfluid. If other Senators show up and talk, it will not be off of these \namendments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Our understanding is the same. Look, we are going to have \nto be flexible. We have other committees that are meeting, and other \nMembers who are involved in these amendments are at other meetings. \nThey won't be here until later. It is our intention to have that amount \nof time on these specific amendments, but it may not occur all at once.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the understanding is that these are the \namendments that are actually in line: Specter and Conrad, and Kyl and \nConrad. Those are the amendments actually in the queue.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Correct. Our amendments are side-by-sides. Our amendments \nwould normally be second-degree amendments. They are not being offered \nas second-degree amendments here because we don't do that on the budget \nresolution. But those amendments that are the side-by-sides would be in \nthe regular order. That means they would be voted on first.\n  We also have the Bunning amendment. Do we want to put that into the \nqueue?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the regular order would not be that they \nwould be--we understood that you could offer them as second degrees if \nyou put them in that position.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Maybe we should have a discussion and make sure we are on \nthe same page with respect to that. Do we want to have the Bunning \namendment next?\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe so. We don't know when he will be available. I \nwould like the Bunning amendment to be after these. So the next \namendment would be the Bunning amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right. That is an amendment that involves Social \nSecurity, correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. Correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. There would be a side-by-side on our side. Would we want \nto limit debate on those to a half hour each?\n  Mr. GREGG. I have not spoken to Senator Bunning yet, so we will \nreserve on that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right. That will be the order. The colleagues who \nwant to offer amendments and want to have floor time, it is a very good \ntime to contact us to get time allocated because time is going to go \nvery quickly. Please don't come tomorrow and say: Gee, where is our \nfloor time? This is the time, this is the moment. If you want floor \ntime, we urge you to come now.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4191\n\n  Mr. KYL. I have an amendment I would like to send to the desk and ask \nthat it be read.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to setting aside \nthe pending amendment so that the Senator may offer his amendment?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4191.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this amendment is a reprise of what we did \nlast year in offering to reform the estate tax, sometimes referred to \nas the death tax.\n  Now, in the budget itself, and in an amendment that has been offered \nby the other side, there is a provision to allow the death tax to be \nchanged from the current law to a top rate of 45 percent and an \nexempted amount of $3.5 million, and there are some other features. My \namendment, as with the proposal that had significant support last year, \nwould reduce that top rate to no higher than 35 percent so that if you \nhad more than one rate, at least the top rate could not exceed 35 \npercent, and both of the two spouses would have a $5 million exempted \namount before the estate tax would kick in.\n  In addition, this provides for a step-up in the basis of the \nproperty. It would enable the estate tax to be paid over the current \nperiod of time, and the amounts of money in the exempted amount, or \nunified credit of the estate gift tax, would be indexed for inflation.\n  Now, the reason for my amendment is, I think most agree even in this \nbody, either allowing the estate tax to continue under current law--\ngetting up to a high rate of 55 percent and an exempted amount of \neither $2 million or $1 million, probably $1 million--or the proposal \nof the Democratic chairman of the committee would result in a continued \nunfair burden on primarily America's small businesses and farms, but, \nin any event, anyone subject to the potential liability of estate tax \nfor which there is a tremendous amount of money spent in attempting to \nget around the obligations of the tax or to plan against its eventual \nrequired payments.\n  As a result, we look for ways to further reform the estate tax so \nthat burden would be limited to only a few estates--the very highest \nestates--and that most people without a huge estate would not have the \nburden of trying to plan around it--to buy expensive insurance and hire \nlawyers and accountants and estate planners and the like.\n  The object, in other words, is not simply to limit the estate tax \nliability but provide some certainty in the Tax Code so that most \npeople realize, as their homes have gotten more valuable simply because \nof the increased value with inflation, and as their businesses have \naccumulated some capital wealth even though it may not be disposable in \nthe sense of liquid income, they are not going to have to worry that \ntheir estate is going to be subject to a tax and so they are not going \nto have to worry about spending this money to deal with the tax.\n  That is why we need to increase the total for a couple that would be \nexempted from the tax to $10 million and provide that the upper rate, \nif that rate kicks in, could be no higher than 35 percent. Above that, \nyou are going to find people feeling that they have to try to prepare \nfor or to get around the payment of the tax. And the irony is, Mr. \nPresident, those we are most concerned about really don't have the \nassets to try to spend a lot of money, whereas those who have enormous \nwealth can hire all the accountants, estate planners, and lawyers they \nwant and buy insurance so that the ultimate impact of the tax does not \nhit them.\n  Last year, when we proposed this same proposal of the 35-percent \nhighest rate or an amount of $5 million exempted for both spouses in a \nmotion to instruct conferees, 56 Senators, obviously both Democrats and \nRepublicans, voted for that motion to instruct. Now, it was never \ncarried out, but I think it demonstrates the will of this body that we \nwant to have some reform that is more realistic and that exempts more \nestates from the payment of the tax and the consideration of the tax.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee, in the tax year 2011, 131,000 \nestates alone will be subject to the estate tax--131,000. Mr. \nPresident, that is too much of a burden on too many people in this \ncountry who are not extremely wealthy. By 2015, that number goes up to \n177,000 estates. The advantage of my amendment is that it would protect \napproximately 119,200 family businesses and family farms from the \nestate tax each year. It would dramatically reduce the number of \nestates that have to worry about paying the tax.\n  If we fail to act, in other words, about 131,000 families and family \nbusinesses and farms will be subjected to the tax in the year 2011 and \nthereafter. Under our proposal, we would, according to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, reduce the impact of the tax so that only 11,800 \nestates would be required to file estate tax returns each year, if the \nexemption is set at $5 million each. So, that is a huge change. It is \nnecessary to protect the folks I think everybody in this body would \nlike to protect from having to worry about the estate tax.\n  Now, it is interesting that when public opinion surveys ask people \nwhat they think about the tax, almost uniformly the results come back \nthat the majority of Americans believe the estate tax is unfair and it \nought to be eliminated. I remember a Gallup poll, now 3 or 4 years old, \nthat said 60 percent of Americans believed it should be repealed. \nThat is my preference, to repeal it. We haven't been able to get enough \nvotes in this body to repeal it, but that is where the American people \nthink it should be.\n\n  Interestingly, there was a survey conducted after the last \nPresidential election, and people who supported both Senator Kerry and \nPresident Bush were asked what they thought about the estate tax. The \ninteresting thing is that while 70-some percent of the people who voted \nsaid they thought the tax should be repealed, roughly 80-some percent \nof the people who voted for President Bush thought it should be \nrepealed and 60-some percent of the people who voted for Senator Kerry \nthought it should be repealed.\n  So this is not a partisan matter among the American people. They \nbelieve, whether they supported Senator Kerry or President Bush in the \nlast Presidential election, that the estate tax should be repealed. I \ndaresay surveys even now, to this time, demonstrate the American public \nopinion remains the same. The interesting thing is even those who \nunderstand they will never be subject to the tax because their incomes \nare simply not such that they will accumulate the wealth necessary to \nhave to worry about the tax believe the tax to be unfair and believe it \nshould be repealed.\n  But even if you leave aside the issue of the morality of the tax and \npeople's understanding that it is not a fair tax, it hits people at the \nabsolute worst time--when a loved one in their family has passed away \nand they are having to consider whether pieces of the business or farm \nmay have to be sold off to pay the tax--they recognize that, at a \nminimum, it should be reformed and that is all we are trying to do.\n  For years, we have been trying to get a reform that basically \naccomplishes two objectives: It would increase the amount of the estate \nthat is exempt from the tax so you don't have to worry about filing \nforms or having to try to plan around it; and for those who would still \nbe subject to the tax above that amount, it would at least put a lid on \nit at a maximum of 35 percent.\n  Now, again, the numbers in the current law, if we don't do anything, \ngo up to 55 percent. And under the proposal of the chairman of the \ncommittee on the other side of the aisle, that would be reduced to 45 \npercent. That is still way too high, and the exempted amount would be \n$1 million, which is way too low. Because of inflation today, there are \na lot of homes that have a value of over $1 million, especially in \nplaces such as California, New York, and some other places. So, \nclearly, an amendment along the lines that I will be introducing to \nmake room in the budget for this kind of reform is necessary.\n  I would like to make just about three other quick points.\n  Last year, even though the budget could accommodate estate tax \nreform, the majority did not bring a bill to the Senate. And despite my \nbest efforts, it wasn't possible to get anybody to allow consideration \nof a bill to reform the estate tax. As a result, in the Finance \nCommittee at the end of last year, I asked that the chairman hold \nhearings and seek to have a markup this spring so we could actually \npass a bill and not simply deal with it in the budget that we pass each \nyear.\n  The American people need to understand what is really going on. Each \nyear we pass a budget that, theoretically, allows for a reform of the \nestate\n\n[[Page S1924]]\n\ntax, but then we don't do anything about it. And the budget itself \nisn't law. The budget is merely a goal, a blueprint of where we want to \ngo for the year. If you don't follow it up with a bill, you haven't \ndone anything. But Members here pat themselves on the back and go back \nhome and tell their constituents that they voted to cut the estate tax. \nOh, that is wonderful, people say. But it is never followed up with an \nactual bill.\n  So the chairman of the Finance Committee said: Well, he would have \nthe goal of marking up a bill this spring. He has since advised me he \nhas no plans whatsoever for a real bill on estate tax, and said: It \nwon't happen.\n  It is going to be in the budget. His amendment will provide for an \nestate tax reform in the budget, but he has advised that he has no \nplans to allow that to happen, to make it, in reality, a bill that \nwould pass and become law. So all of this is an exercise in show, with \napparently no real intent to follow through and provide relief for \nAmerica's families and small businesses and farms and the like.\n  What I would like to do, Mr. President, with my amendment, is not \nonly demonstrate in the budget that this is the level that we want to \nset it, at a $5 million exempted amount per spouse and no higher than a \n35-percent rate, but also ensure that the rules of the budget enable us \nto consider the bill during the year and not have it subject to some \npoint of order that would enable people on the other side to say: Gee, \nwe wish we could do it, but we just can't do it under the budget rules.\n  My amendment will make it possible to consider such an amendment, and \nI serve notice on my colleagues that I intend to try to bring it up. We \nare not going to sweep this under the rug year after year. If we are \nhonest with the American people about putting it in the budget, we \nought to be honest about bringing it to the floor for a vote so that we \ncan actually pass a bill, send it to the President, and get this job \ndone.\n  It is interesting that compared to other countries the United States \nis one of the worst in terms of the amount of money it takes from \nestates. The rate in the Democratic version would be 45 percent. The \naverage around the world is 13 percent. There are a lot of countries \nthat don't have an estate tax, and they understand why.\n  The irony is, I had to leave a hearing of the Finance Committee just \nnow, Mr. President, where an individual was testifying about countries \nsuch as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and places such as that, where \npeople have decided it is not a good idea to have an estate tax, and it \nhas been repealed in many of these countries. The United States should \ntake a leaf out the book of some of these countries that have found it \nis inimical to their development and their ability to compete with \nother countries.\n  We know it is not good in terms of savings. The irony is that a lot \nof my colleagues are concerned about reducing the fact that our savings \nrate in this country is too low and are concerned about the fact that \nas a result we have to end up borrowing from countries such as China, \nfor example. Yet having a big estate tax is exactly what is allowing \nthat to happen because it discourages savings. If you save the money, \nyou are just going to get taxed on it when you die, so why not just \nspend it?\n  Incidentally, the Treasury Department estimates the estate tax \nreduces the amount of money that we contribute to charity. Treasury \nestimates that the estate tax reduces bequests by about 14 percent. \nIndividuals are either choosing to save less or rely heavily on estate \nplanning which, of course, is a deadweight loss to the economy unless \nyou are in the insurance business, in which case you think it is a real \nnifty idea because people have to buy insurance against the estate tax \nobligation that they otherwise would have.\n  Finally, it is an irony that the amount of money the Treasury \ncollects--something over 1 percent of our revenue comes from the estate \ntax--is actually an equivalent amount of money to what is spent by \npeople to try to avoid paying the estate tax. So, in effect, the money \nis paid twice. People buy insurance, they hire accountants and lawyers, \nand they try to find ways to get around the payment of the estate tax, \nand the amount of money that costs each year is almost exactly the same \nas what we pay in the estate tax to the Federal Government. This was \naccording to a study by Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell who are \neconomists who have made this point over and over.\n  The other interesting aspect of the cost of the estate tax is the \namount of money it costs to try to plan around it. If you are a closely \nheld business, the estate planning is estimated to range anywhere from \n$5,000 to $1 million. Again, if you are a lawyer or estate planner or \nyou are selling insurance, that is probably a great thing. But it is \nnot great for the people who have to pay the money, and it is not the \nbest use of the money for the economy. The IRS estimates it takes 38 \nhours to complete the form, which is form 706. You may have an \nobligation, you may not, but you still have to fill out the form. The \ntax preparation fees can range from $5,000 to $50,000, and 52 percent \nof the estates that filed a return were required to incur a sizable \nlegal and accounting expense and other expenses even though they owed \nno tax. Bear in mind, over half of the people who have to file the \nforms end up with no obligation.\n  What we should do is have a tax that is predictable and clear with a \nlarge enough amount exempted so you know whether you are going to have \nto file the form. Hopefully, you would realize you don't have to file \nit because we have adopted the reforms I am talking about. We would go \nfrom something over 130,000 filers down to something over 11,000 \nfilers. You would be catching the people with the big estates, those \npeople who can really afford to pay the estate tax, but you would not \nbe requiring everybody else to have to engage in this expensive \nplanning and have the potential of having to pay part of the tax.\n  Again, the summary numbers to remember are, under the amendment that \nwill be filed--or has been filed, I gather--it would freeze the rates \nwhere they will be at the end of 2011, at 45 percent. That is only 10 \npercent less than the top rate of 55 percent under the previous law. \nAnd it will provide an exempted amount of $3.5 million. Far more \nestates will be caught in the estate tax trap with the amount at that \nlevel than they will be if both spouses subject to the tax have $5 \nmillion exempted as part of the unified gift and estate tax credit.\n  I hope as with last year when 56 of our colleagues, both Democrats \nand Republicans, supported instructing conferees to include in the \nbudget the precise proposal on estate tax reform that I have \nidentified, we will get that kind of support out of this budget as \nwell.\n  The last thing I want to say is, I think it would be better for the \ndebate and discussion if we had followed past practices and actually \noffered amendments and had debate on those amendments and then voted on \nthose amendments. Instead, what is happening this year is the majority \nis not allowing any votes on any amendments until tomorrow, when we get \ninto what we affectionately refer to around here as the vote-athon, \nwhen every 10 or 12 minutes we have a vote after 1 minute of discussion \nof the amendment, 1 or 2 minutes. I think it is 30 seconds per side, 1 \nminute equally divided. Great debate. Great debate.\n  We have time to talk about these things now, but what you can't do is \noffer an amendment, have a vote on it, and know whether you have won or \nlost so you can determine what you want to do next. If you win, then \nyou don't have to do two or three other amendments. If you lose, you \nmay have to do those amendments. But we are not going to do that \nbecause the majority decided it would like to put pressure on the \nMembers of this body to offer fewer amendments because they will have \nto all be voted on on Thursday and, of course, everybody knows the \nEaster recess begins as soon as we finish our business. So there is \ngreat pressure to offer fewer amendments, to hurry up and get out of \ntown, rather than, in my view, spending the time necessary to do the \npeople's business.\n  One of the first things we ought to be willing to do is do what is \nnecessary to both debate and vote on an estate tax reform that would be \nmeaningful for literally hundreds of thousands of American citizens.\n\n[[Page S1925]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. KYL. I will. I will conclude saying, I hope my colleagues will in \na bipartisan way, as they did last year, support the proposal I have \njust laid down. And while we will be doing it on Thursday, I gather, \nthey will be able to listen to a little of the debate if they are \nlistening now.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I can address one of the concerns of the Senator, when \nwe vote--this is a very awkward question, I say to my colleague. Let me \nbe very direct about what it is. We are missing two of our votes. We \nhave a third Member who is ill. So what we have said is we would defer \nvotes on these major matters until at least some of our Members are \nback. The body is very closely divided. We are completely ready to have \nvotes on other matters throughout this day. The problem is, with the \nmajor votes on these consequential issues where we are missing two of \nour Presidential candidates until tomorrow--they will be here Thursday \nand Friday--and we are missing Senator Byrd who, as you know, is ill, \nthat is the reason we have asked to defer votes on these major \namendments until tomorrow. It is a difficult situation. It has been \nthroughout.\n  I do thank the Republican caucus for the extraordinary courtesy they \nextended to the Budget Committee by allowing Senator Byrd to vote--to \nallow proxy voting in our committee. Our committee does not allow proxy \nvoting, and for a very good reason. We are the only committee that can \nreport a fast-track vehicle to the Senate floor directly. But I do \nthank the Republican side for doing that. It was very gracious. I think \nit was in the best tradition of the Senate.\n  Here on the Senate floor, of course, there is no ability to allow \nthat accommodation to a colleague who is ill. That is the circumstance. \nI regret it. I just say to my colleague, we are happy to have as many \nvotes as you want to have. The reason we have deferred these major \nvotes until tomorrow is for the reason I have given.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate that. In suggesting another \nreason for this, I do not think I am wrong in that, but I do \nacknowledge that certainly what the chairman of the Budget Committee \nhas said is true. I appreciate his acknowledgment of our courtesy with \nrespect to Senator Byrd. I know the Democratic side would do the same \nthing. That was done on a previous occasion last year as well. It is \none of the better traditions of the Senate.\n  It is also true probably this is not the first time this year \nbecause, for the first time in the history of the United States, I am \ninformed, two Senators will be running against each other for the \nPresidency so that there may be other occasions where, when there are \nvery close votes, our schedule may to some extent need to accommodate \ntheir schedules. Of course, as Members of this body they need to be \nhere to do business as well, but we understand that is not always \npossible. If we could adhere to a slightly more set schedule that might \nbe possible, but since we don't and it is almost impossible to have \nthat kind of schedule, that issue is one that has to be accommodated, \nand I appreciate what the chairman said.\n  I do hope the trend we have seen from 2 years ago to last year to \nthis year of not having votes early on during the week that we consider \nthe budget, but bunching them all at the end, a process which I don't \nthink anybody in this body really likes, would not continue; that \ncertainly the reason the chairman indicated will not pertain next year \nand that we can revert to the practice next year that we have \ntraditionally followed, which is to try to have debate on amendments, \nvotes, and then debate and then votes, and so on, hopefully, thereby \nminimizing the number of votes that we consider in this so-called vote-\nathon that, as I said, nobody in this body likes very much.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would just say to my colleague, last \nyear we did much better.\n  Mr. KYL. Than this year.\n  Mr. CONRAD. You remember last year we did more votes earlier. Just in \nline with what the Senator is thinking because that is the best way. I \nthink all of us would agree that is the best way to do our business, to \ndo the votes earlier. You will recall on the vote-arama on that Friday \nwe actually finished at 2 o'clock in the afternoon because we did have \nmore votes earlier. I am entirely, 100 percent in agreement with the \nSenator. I would far prefer to do it that way. I think it is easier to \nfollow the debate and to have the votes then coincident with the \ndebate.\n  (Mr. DURBIN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I might, just on the underlying \namendment offered by the Senator, this amendment as we understand it--\nwe have just seen it--would virtually eliminate the estate tax. Let me \nsay why. Let me first say there is no death tax in the country. Of \ncourse, if you poll people and you ask them: Do you want to eliminate \nthe death tax? they will say sure. I had a baggage handler stop a \ncolleague of mine, and he said: My No. 1 priority is to eliminate that \ndeath tax. My colleague, who is the current occupant of the chair, told \nhim there is no death tax here. You are not going to pay any tax when \nyou die unless you have $2 million.\n  The guy was very surprised about that because he heard all this talk \nabout a death tax. There is no death tax in America. There is a tax on \nestates. At today's level you would have to have $2 million to be \ntaxed. That affects only one-half of 1 percent of estates. When the \nexemption increases, as it does under current law, and reaches $3.5 \nmillion per individual, $7 million a couple in 2009, which is next \nyear, only two-tenths of estates will be taxed.\n  If you are out there and you are hearing about this death tax, don't \nworry. It does not apply, next year, to 99.8 percent of people who pass \naway. It only applies to two-tenths of 1 percent of estates.\n  We already have a tax structure that has overwhelmingly benefited the \nwealthiest among us. The amendment by the Senator would cost an \nadditional $478 billion over 10 years, and none of it is paid for. That \nmeans it goes on the debt. That means we have to borrow that amount of \nmoney, and where are we going to borrow it? We are now borrowing over \nhalf the money at our bond auctions from abroad--most of it from the \nChinese and the Japanese. So we would have, if the amendment of the \nSenator is agreed to as is, the unusual situation of borrowing this \nmoney primarily from China and Japan to give a tax advantage to two-\ntenths of 1 percent of the people, but the borrowing would be in the \nname of all of the American people. So 99.8 percent of the American \npeople would be borrowing this money, primarily from China and Japan, \nto give it to the Warren Buffets, the Paris Hiltons, and others of \nenormous wealth in this country.\n  I do not think that is a good policy. In the underlying budget, we \nhave improved the estate tax situation, reformed it in what is, I \nthink, a reasonable way. This is the bizarre circumstance that is in \ncurrent law. The exemption now, in 2008, is $4 million--$2 million a \nperson. OK? So if you are a husband or wife and you pass away at the \nsame time, you have $4 million of exemption that applies today. You \ndon't pay anything if you have estates of less than $4 million.\n  In 2009 that will go up to $7 million. Then in 2010, under current \nlaw, there is no estate tax, it is repealed. Then, in 2011--it is \nutterly bizarre--it goes down to $2 million per couple, $1 million a \nperson.\n  In the underlying budget we are saying, no, that makes no sense at \nall to go back down to $2 million a couple, $1 million a person. It \nshould be at $7 million a couple, as it is in 2009. If, in fact, we \nadopt those levels, virtually no one will pay the estate tax. That is a \nfact.\n  Here is what has happened under current law: The number of estates \nthat are taxed is falling very dramatically. In 2000, there were 50,000 \ntaxable estates. In 2006, that has been reduced to 13,000. In 2009, we \nare now expecting there will only be 7,000 estates that will pay \nanything. As I indicated, that is two-tenths of 1 percent; 99.8 percent \nof estates are completely exempt. That is a fact.\n  Now I am going to lay down an amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is it my understanding you are telling us how many people \nare\n\n[[Page S1926]]\n\ngoing to die in 2009 in this part of the Democratic budget; that you \nare projecting deaths in 2009 to be 7,000?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, this is this Tax Policy Center, I say to my \ncolleague, and they estimate the number of estates in any year, and \nthen they do a further analysis of how many would actually pay an \nestate tax, and what they have concluded is two-tenths of 1 percent.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator would yield further, I wanted to clarify \nwhere the number came from. I did not know if the Senator, as chairman \nof the Budget Committee, was calling on this number of people to die \nduring 2009 for the chart?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I know the Senator is pulling my chain. Even as slow \nwitted as I am, I can recognize when a Senator is pulling my chain, and \nhere on my birthday, my friend and my colleague is doing that.\n  What we have tried to do is come up with an alternative. I will send \nthis amendment to the desk to provide an alternative approach to that \nwhich the Senator from Arizona is offering, to go over and above what \nis in the Baucus amendment.\n  I say to my colleague, it provides another $45 billion, so that in \naddition to extending the estate tax exemptions of 2009, $7 million a \ncouple, $3.5 million an individual, instead of dropping down to $2 \nmillion a couple or $1 million, we stay at the $7 million; index it for \ninflation.\n  But in this amendment I am sending to the desk, I say to my \ncolleague, it also provides another $45 billion in a reserve fund, \nwhich means it would have to be offset either by a spending reduction \nor other revenue to further close the gap between what Senator Baucus \nprovided in his amendment the other day, and the amendment Senator Kyl \nhas laid down here.\n  That would be $45 billion in additional room in order to further \nreform the estate tax. I want to make clear that would be in a reserve \nfund, so it would have to be offset, it would have to be paid for.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask the chairman to yield for a question. The additional \n$45 billion, would you have an estimate as to--well, first, what policy \nin the estate tax would be attached to that? And if it is to add to the \nexempted amount, what would that take the exempted amount up to?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do not know. This is not my amendment. This is an \namendment Senator Baucus and others have crafted. So I apologize to the \nSenator, I do not know how much more of an exemption that would permit. \nBut others who have crafted this amendment hopefully will have an \nanswer that can be provided when they are available.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I might further, I had understood an \namendment such as this might be offered. My understanding was it would \naccommodate both an increase in the exempted amount to $5 million per \nspouse, and I also believe to reduce the rate further from 45 down to \n35, which would make it identical to my amendment. I might be wrong on \nthat. If you can ask the author of the amendment here if that is true, \nit would conform it to the levels set in the amendment I have laid down \nas well.\n  I wonder, as long as I have interrupted the chairman, if I might make \none or two other points.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Maybe I can conclude this part and go back to the Senator \nfrom Illinois who is also inquiring and answer his question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would yield. I wish to ask the Senator a \nquestion. I do not know if you want to offer your amendment first.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4196\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk. I have \nstyled it Conrad No. 2. In fact, it is not my amendment. It is the \namendment of the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, who is at \nthis very moment chairing a hearing on this subject, so he could not be \nhere. That is why I am sending it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Is there objection to setting \naside the pending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for Mr. Baucus, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4196.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4196) is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To reform the estate tax to avoid subjecting thousands of \nfamilies, family businesses, and family farms and ranches to the estate \n                                  tax)\n\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ESTATE TAX REFORM INITIATIVE.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the aggregates, allocations and other appropriate \n     levels in this resolution for a bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report that provides up to \n     $45,000,000,000 in tax relief over the period of the total of \n     the fiscal years 2008 through 2013 for additional estate tax \n     reforms that address the current flaws in the estate tax law, \n     by the amounts provided in such legislation for such purpose, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2013 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2018.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask that Senator Baucus be permitted, when he is able, \nto further discuss his amendment. I know we have got time reserved for \nthat purpose.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from North Dakota would further yield, I \nwas listening carefully to his debate as I presided. It is my \nunderstanding that he says under current law, two-tenths of 1 percent \nof the people who die in the United States each year might be subject \nto liability to pay the estate tax or, as the Republicans called it, \nthe so-called death tax.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, that is true, under the exemption rates for next \nyear. Under the exemption rates for next year, it will be two-tenths of \n1 percent. I believe this year it is five-tenths of 1 percent; there \nare 99.5 percent this year that are exempt. Next year it will be 99.8 \npercent exempt, as the rate goes up.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I tried to do a quick calculation on the .2 percent. I \nthink I have come to the conclusion that each year in America, 3.5 \nmillion Americans die. Of that number, you are projecting that 7,000 \nout of 3.5 million might have some estate tax liability next year?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the correct math.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding the proposal by the Senator from \nArizona is to further enlarge the exemption of those who pay this tax, \nso that even fewer than 7,000 will actually pay. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. My understanding is--and the Senator might correct me--\nthat under the Kyl proposal the cost would be approaching $200 billion \nover--$458 billion over 10 years.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So the Senator from North Dakota, as chairman of the \nBudget Committee, has come to the floor repeatedly with a chart which \nhe can get his hands on in a moment that talks about the accumulation \nof debt in America under the Bush administration compared to the \naccumulation of debt in America under all previous Presidents. Does the \nSenator recall the numbers that were involved in that chart?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, first, in terms of the gross debt of the United \nStates, under this President's watch, the gross debt has nearly \ndoubled. The foreign holding of U.S. debt has more than doubled.\n  This is it. It took 42 Presidents 224 years to run up $1 trillion of \nexternal debt. Perhaps this is the chart the Senator is referring to. \nIt took 42 Presidents, all of these Presidents pictured, 224 years to \nrun up $1 trillion of debt, U.S. debt held abroad. This President, as \nyou can see, has far more than doubled that amount in 7 years.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me, through the Chair, ask the Senator from North \nDakota a question. The pending amendment by the Senator from Arizona is \nnot paid for, which means he has not suggested increasing some other \ntax to set it off or cutting spending to offset it; it is simply added \nto the debt of America. And if that debt the Senator from Arizona wants \nto add to our national debt over the next 10 years is funded from \nforeign sources, how much more is going to be added to this figure by \nthe amendment of the Senator from Arizona?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, if his amendment costs another $458 billion, it is \nnot offset. And in a typical bond auction now conducted by the United \nStates, over\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\nhalf of the money, well over half now, is money from abroad. So you can \ntake well over half of the $458 billion, and it would be added to this \nexternal debt.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to ask the Senator, who is going to pay this debt?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, that is the unfortunate part of, as I see it, the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona. What he is doing is saying--he \nis asking all of us, all Americans, to put our name on the bill. But \nthe money is only going to two-tenths of 1 percent of us. I think that \nis unfortunate.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield when I am done.\n  Mr. KYL. I think it would be fair to let me answer.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator from North Dakota has the floor. I am \nsure he will yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  So that I understand this--I want to make it clear--in order to \nspare, at a maximum, 7,000 of the wealthiest people in America who may \ndie in the outgoing years, in order to spare them estate tax liability, \neven though America has been very kind to them and they have lived very \ncomfortable lives because of this great Nation, to spare them the \npossibility of paying back to this country for having lived and enjoyed \nthis great Nation, we are going to add some $400 billion plus in debt \nto Americans. And over half of that will end up being debt we owe to \nforeign countries, as I understand the Senator from North Dakota. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think that is clearly correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So for those who are so-called fiscal conservatives, we \nare going to cut taxes for the wealthiest people in America, and add \ndebt for everyone else in America, an added debt we are going to borrow \nfrom overseas and ask our children to pay for it. It sounds like a \ngreat idea if you happen to be in the lucky 7,000 club. This lucky \n7,000 club that will be benefitted by Senator Kyl's amendment will have \na great outcome. It appears that everyone loses--I take that back. \nEveryone but China and Japan and other countries will be losers in this \nproposal by the Senator from Arizona. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, I think that is undeniably the case. The problem \nthis country confronts now is we have massive deficits and, under this \nPresident, a dramatic increase in the debt. So all of these provisions \nare based on borrowed money. So why would we go borrow this amount of \nmoney, which is increasingly from foreign countries, in order to give a \nbenefit to two-tenths of 1 percent of the American people, when 99.8 \npercent of the estates in this country are already exempted from the \ntaxation? That is lost on me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I can ask one more question--I know the Senator from \nArizona wishes to speak--aside from the lucky 7,000 club the Senator \nfrom Arizona is taking care of, the wealthiest people in America--\nnothing but good luck, they have lived comfortable lives in a great \ndemocratic, free nation with the protection of our laws, and now, as \nthey leave and go to perhaps a better place, they want to make sure \nthey do not pay back to this Nation, aside from the lucky 7,000 club.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from North Dakota, I have heard this \nconcept, talking about pay as you go, that the Democrats, when they \ncame to control the Congress, would pay for any tax cuts or any \nspending increases so it would not add to the national debt. So I wish \nto ask the Senator from North Dakota, I know he believes in it very \npassionately: Is this a pay-as-you-go proposal from the Republican side \nso that there is no net loss to future generations? Is this being taken \ncare of by the Senator from Arizona offsetting it, for example, with an \nincrease in taxes on maybe working people of this country or some other \ngroup or cutting spending in some other area?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, this is all put on the tab. This is all borrowed \nmoney.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I still have the floor. The Senator from Arizona was \nseeking to ask me a question.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would be happy to have the ranking member \nof the committee make a comment. But I wish to correct some of the \nfacts. I can do that either on the Senator's time or on our time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to the Senator from New Hampshire if \nthe Senator wishes to engage in this debate or any other debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wish to note the Senator from Illinois described these \npeople as the lucky 7,000. They are dead. I guess only if you are from \nChicago do you consider it lucky to be dead. They can still vote.\n  I understand the Senator from Arizona feels these numbers are \ninaccurate. I know they are inaccurate. I wish to comment further on \nthe Senator's amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee and the majority whip have done some extrapolation \nfrom the number of people who die and two-tenths of a percent of this \nand that and, therefore, they have come up with a number. Why don't I \nquote the actual numbers according to the Joint Tax Committee. These \nare the officials numbers we deal with every year when calculating the \neffect of our legislation. According to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, if my amendment were to be adopted, 11,800 estates each year \nwould be required to file at the exempted levels that are set forth in \nmy amendment. If we fail to act, 131,000 families, not 7,000--family \nbusinesses, farms and so on--will be subjected to the death tax each \nyear, starting in the year 2011.\n  The point is, these are not individuals. These are families or \nbusinesses with a lot more people affected by the tax than the number \nof filers. The filer represents all the members of the family or the \nemployer of a company. That may be 50 or 60 or 200 people who may be \nout of a job. But that is how many will be subjected to filing this, \n131,000.\n  You might make fun of this and say it is a small percentage of the \nnumber of people in the United States. If you are unfortunate enough to \ndie and your heirs have to deal with this problem, it is a very real \nproblem to every single one of them. Over a 10-year period, obviously, \nyou are talking about way more than a million people. You may say that \nis not a significant enough number to worry about, but it is enough. We \nworry about a few people who suffer from all kinds of things that we \ntry to deal with. If you have a million Americans over a 10-year period \nsubjected to an unfair tax, it is a problem we ought to address and not \njust make fun of the fact that it is only a million instead of 50 or \n60,000. So let's get the numbers right. You can argue, if it is only \n131,000 people, should we be worried about it. I say yes, somebody on \nthe other side might say no, but at least let's get the numbers right.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand your proposal, which, if I recall \ncorrectly, got 56 votes in this body last year\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct, on the motion to instruct conferees, 56 \nDemocrats and Republicans voted for this identical proposal.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wish to ask the Senator further, through the Chair: As I \nunderstand the proposal, estates over $10 million would continue to be \nsubject to full estate tax obligation; is that correct?\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct. The rate would be reduced from 55 percent, \nif we don't do anything, to 35. I believe the majority proposal is 45. \nThis would make the top rate no higher than 35 percent.\n  Mr. GREGG. So we aren't talking about the wealthiest Americans. We \nare talking about people with significant wealth, up to $10 million. \nBut a family farm can easily be valued at $10 million. A small \nbusiness, a restaurant could easily be valued at $10 million. A small \nsoftware company could easily be valued at $10 million. So we are \ntalking about continuing, without major tax consequences, small \nbusinesses and farms that otherwise would be subjected to a very \nonerous tax which might put them out of business; is that not correct?\n  Mr. KYL. The answer is yes. If I could expand on that with a true \nstory, some friends of my wife and mine in Phoenix had a printing \nbusiness. The head of the household came out from New York in the late \n1940s and from\n\n[[Page S1928]]\n\nscratch built this business which, at the time he died, employed about \n200 people. They didn't take a great deal of money home because in this \nbusiness, you have to plow all your profits back into buying the very \nlatest laser printers and all the other equipment to keep it \ncompetitive. But they did all right as a family, well enough to be a \nmajor giver in the community. That is how we became friends with them \nbecause they were contributing to charities significant amounts, \nprobably more than they could afford, boys and girls clubs and a \nvariety of other charities. They were great contributors to the \ncommunity, both in terms of their business, the people they employed, \nwhat they did, and how they supported the community. He died. When he \ndied, his family found that despite the fact that they had spent \nmillions on insurance and other ways to try to plan for his eventual \ndeath and the estate planning, in order to pay the tax, they had to \nsell the business. They did, and they got enough money to pay the tax. \nThe company that bought it, to my knowledge, never contributed a dime \nto any charity in Arizona. It eventually closed the operation. So all \nthe people who worked there no longer had a job, no contribution to the \ncommunity. The family literally had to sell the business to pay the \ntax. While they were well off in terms of the average American, they \nwere exactly the kind of people you want in your community to provide \nemployment. That is the real story.\n  We can make fun by saying: Well, it is only 131,000 each year in that \ncategory. But these are real families who are contributors to the \neconomy and to our communities, and we ought to give them a break. Most \npeople, even though they know they are not subjected to the tax, still, \nwhen you ask them the questions in public opinion surveys, say they \nknow it is not fair. They like families such as the one I mentioned and \nwould like to see this tax either reformed or repealed.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I may ask a further question, I think the Senator's \nanecdotal story is one everybody has seen innumerable times in their \nhome States: Small businesses put out of business or put under distress \nas a result of the death of a principal in the small business due to \nthe estate tax, the death tax. After finishing law school, I went back \nfor 3 years and got a master's degree in taxation, which was one of the \nmost foolish things I ever did. It only proved to me the tax law is \ntotally inane. But I don't believe in the tax law there is any other \nplace where there is such a penalty of tax assessment for an act which \nhas occurred without any economic event. In other words, the only thing \nthat generates this tax is not that you sold a business or built a \nbusiness or that you were involved in some transaction. It is that you \ngot hit by a truck crossing the street, which is not an economic act. \nIsn't that why this tax makes no sense on the face of it, especially \nfor smaller estates that involve small businesses? It is a noneconomic \nevent. It is a ``comes out of the blue'' type of an event. You die, \nunfortunately. If you get hit by a truck, you get sick, any number of \nevents can cause that event to occur, but it is not something you have \ncontrol over and, therefore, you can't create economic activity around \nit which is going to give you the wherewithal to pay the tax. Is that \nnot true?\n\n  Mr. KYL. If I may respond, as an expert in the Tax Code, the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire knows the technical name of the doctrine which \napplies in this case, except we have made an exception in the case of \ndeath. If you are robbed or if your house burns down and you collect \ninsurance to pay for that unanticipated loss--not an economic activity; \nyou didn't decide to invest and get a return on the investment when \nyour house burned down--that is something you did not anticipate. It is \nnoneconomic. The Tax Code treats that in a very good way for people, as \none would expect. You get the insurance on it. You are not taxed on all \nthat as income.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is called casualty loss.\n  Mr. KYL. This is the third. Of the three areas that apply here of \nnoneconomic activity with a tax consequence, this is the only place \nwhere we don't give people a break for these unanticipated activities, \nthese noneconomic activities such as death. No, you do get taxed. And, \nyes, the Senator from North Dakota is absolutely correct. The dead \nperson is not the person----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Arizona on this \namendment has expired.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I may conclude, I am answering a question \nof the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is being charged on the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator be allowed to \ncontinue and the time come off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. My train of thought with regard to the answer to the \nquestion was interrupted.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator was pointing out that there are three elements \nof casualty loss. Two of them you are not taxed on and this one you \nare. And it is the ultimate casualty, dying.\n  Mr. KYL. As a matter of tax policy, I will answer my colleague, we \ncan differ about the kind of taxes that should apply to economic \nactivity, but we do agree that is the kind of activity that should be \ntaxed, if it is on a sale, if it is on income, if it is on a return \nsuch as capital gains or dividends. But where the American people draw \nthe line is with regard to death. I recall now the final point I wished \nto make. It is true the dead person doesn't pay the tax, but the people \nwho are left to deal with his affairs at the worst time in their life \ndo have to deal with this. What we are suggesting is, we ought to make \nit a little bit easier on these folks and not impose the kind of \npenalties that the current Tax Code, if it reverts to this because we \ndon't act, goes to the 55 percent tax rate. I am talking about 131,000. \nAccording to the Joint Tax Committee, the number by the year 2015 will \nbe 177,000. So this keeps increasing with respect to the number of \nestates each year that will have to be concerned about the tax.\n  Mr. GREGG. As a final question--I think it needs to be emphasized--is \nit not true that this doesn't exempt all estates? This exempts estates \nup to $10 million, which are probably going to be small businesses or \nsmall farms?\n  Mr. KYL. It is actually not quite that. It is $5 million. The way \nthis is written, if one spouse, let's say, the person who is not \nrunning the business, dies first, you can plan so you can get most of \nthe effect of $10 million in the unified credit between the estate and \nthe gift tax, but it is actually a $5 million exempted amount. So, for \nexample, if a single person owns a business, it is only $5 million. It \nis not the amount that would relate to a couple of $10 million.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Of course.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to try to harmonize the numbers because I \ndon't want to leave people with the misimpression that we have some \ndifference on the numbers because I don't think we do. The Senator is \ntalking about 131,000 estates possibly being affected. But that would \nbe at the million-dollar-a-person exemption level; is that not the \ncase?\n  Mr. KYL. I believe that is exactly the case. By the year 2015, it \nwould be 177,000 estates.\n  Mr. CONRAD. But that is assuming we have a million-dollar-per-person \nexemption. Under what is in the budget, we would have $3.5 million per \nperson--$7 million a couple--which, according to our figures, would \ngive only 7,000 estates out of 3.5 million any tax. I think the \ndifference between your 11,000 and my 7,000 was, you are talking about \nestates that have a filing responsibility. I am talking about estates \nthat would actually have a tax liability. As the Senator well knows, \nthere are some additional people who have a filing obligation even \nthough they don't have a liability.\n  The numbers the Senator and I are using are actually quite close. We \nare using somewhat different assumptions. He is talking about if we \nwent down, which current law does, to a million dollar exemption in \n2011, 131,000 estates would be affected. What we are seeking to do is \nto make certain that does not occur, that the exemption amount be $3.5 \nmillion a person, $7 million a couple, which would exempt 99.8 percent \nof estates.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to the chairman he is correct. I \ncannot verify the number 7,000 the chairman is\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\ntalking about, but I can verify the number I am talking about. The \nJoint Committee on Taxation projects that 11,800 estates would be \nrequired to file estate tax returns each year. So that is a correct \nstatement.\n  Of course, the additional point I made earlier was that not everybody \nknows exactly what their liability is and, therefore, you have about 10 \ntimes as many people who have to end up filling out the forms, going to \nthe expense of anywhere between $5,000 and $1 million to complete the \nforms, the 38 hours it takes to do it, only to find some of them do \nhave a tax liability at the end of the day. Some of them do not. The \nfact that you may not be subject to the tax does not diminish the fact \nthat you will be obligated to spend the money to file a return and do \nall the work to try to figure out that, in fact, you don't owe the tax.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is absolutely fair. I didn't want to leave some \nimpression that you and I had some great difference on the numbers. I \nthink our numbers are actually very close.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I might respond with one final point, when \nyou got to calculating how many--the lucky 7,000, and all that--I think \nthere was some extrapolation going on, and I think the chairman is \nright, we should stick to the numbers from Joint Tax. That way at least \nwe know exactly what we are talking about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, may I be recognized \nfor a moment? I have a housekeeping item we need to address.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 4196, which \nI sent to the desk, be restyled as being offered on behalf of Senator \nSalazar. I sent it to the desk in the name of Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That should be in the name of Senator Salazar. He is the \nmover of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, Mr. President, Senator Conrad, I think, was going to \nstraighten this out. But I think the plan now is to go to Senator \nDeMint. He needs approximately 20 minutes. Then there would be whatever \ntime the Senator from North Dakota plans to respond. Then we will go to \nSenator Bunning.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, why don't we do this out of courtesy to \nSenator Bunning, who is already here: If we could go to Senator \nDeMint--how much time would Senator DeMint require?\n  Mr. DeMINT. About 20 minutes or so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could we reach an agreement on up to 25 minutes?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Exactly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Because Senator Bunning was put on notice earlier he \ncould come at roughly this time. I would be happy to withhold on \nSenator DeMint's amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I see Senator Specter who also has an amendment. Maybe he \nwants to speak.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Maybe we could get him in the train as well so he would \nknow when he was up.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Fine.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator from Kentucky require?\n  Mr. BUNNING. No more than 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, shall we enter into an agreement: up to 25 minutes \nfor Senator DeMint, followed by Senator Bunning for up to 15 minutes. \nAnd then, I say to Senator Specter, how much time would you like?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Up to 15 minutes there. That would take us another hour \ndown the road. We will do it off the resolution. Is that fair?\n  Mr. GREGG. Senator Bunning is going to be offering an amendment, so \nwe can do his off his amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President. I wish to make sure my time is \ncounted against the resolution and not the amendment that was just \nbrought up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be counted against the resolution.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise this morning to speak on an amendment I will offer to the 2009 \nbudget resolution on behalf of myself and a bipartisan group of \nreformers in the Senate.\n  This amendment creates a 1-year moratorium on all earmarks. It does \nso by establishing a 67-vote point of order against bills, joint \nresolutions, conference reports, and messages between Houses that \ncontain congressional earmarks for the fiscal year 2009.\n  This is very important to the budget debate. As we look at this \nbudget, with planned spending over the next 10 years, we have clearly--\nboth parties--helped to wreck the budget at the Federal level, while \nevery month we expect families across this country to balance their \nbudget.\n  I would like to start with a little background. Before I came to \nCongress, one of my jobs was training quality development people in \norganizations. We worked on quality improvement--quality process \nimprovement--for a number of years. One of the great consultants in \nthat field, Tom Peters, wrote a book ``In Search of Excellence.''\n  One of the examples he gave in the book, related to improving \nquality, was a person who got on an airplane and pulled down their tray \nand saw a coffee stain there. People could say a coffee stain on a tray \nin an airplane is not a big deal. But many times we get our cues about \nquality, or about whom we can trust and why, from things that are \ndifferent than the real substance.\n  But his point was, if you see a coffee stain, you not only are \nconcerned about how the cleaning service does in that airplane, you \nwonder: If they are not able to clean up a coffee stain, are they \nmaintaining the engines? Is this a safe plane to fly in?\n\n  For us in Congress, our coffee stain is earmarks. Earmarks tell \nAmericans we cannot be trusted to spend their money in a way that is \nefficient and for the good of our country. Americans know if we \ncontinue to throw their tax dollars at bridges to nowhere or hippie \nmuseums--or a number of things I will talk about today--that if we \ncannot be trusted to do those things, certainly how can we be trusted \nto do the big things in this country.\n  We have lost our moral authority. We have undermined the trust of the \nAmerican people. A lot of that goes right back to our coffee stain, \nwhich is earmarks.\n  In 2006, many in this body, particularly my friends on the other \nside, promised to clean up earmarks in Washington. But after 1 year, \nthings have gone back to business as usual. The number of earmarks had \nfallen to 2,600 in 2007 because we were able to stop this huge omnibus \nspending bill that was going through. But now earmarks are back up to \nall-time highs. This year, there are 11,612 earmarks, costing $17.2 \nbillion, according to Citizens Against Government Waste. It is the \nhighest level of earmarks in history.\n  It came through in this Omnibus appropriations bill, which we were \ngiven less than 48 hours to review. No one read it. It was full of \nearmarks, full of wasteful earmarks and wasteful Government spending.\n  We still expect the American family to balance their budget while we \ncontinue to wreck the budget at the Federal level.\n  Last year, we worked together to pass earmark reforms, but, \nunfortunately, many of these reforms have been gutted or ignored. As \nmany of my colleagues know, the earmark rule we passed 98 to 0 was \nwatered down behind closed doors and then passed despite our \nobjections. Those in this body who oppose change insisted on continuing \nbusiness as usual.\n  I would like to review a little bit the history of the debate so \neveryone knows how we got to this place. For Americans who may be \nlooking in and still wondering what earmarks are--and I, frankly, \nconfess when I came to Congress I did not know what an earmark was--it \nis when every Member of Congress and the Senate feel like it is their \nresponsibility to take a piece of taxpayer money and designate it to a \nparticular favorite project or cause or organization back in their \ncongressional district or State. Instead of doing what is good for the \ncountry, we do what is good for our next election,\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\nand we use taxpayer dollars to enhance our image back home.\n  Mr. President, 2007 started off with a pretty hopeful note. I \nactually offered Speaker Pelosi's earmark transparency measure as an \namendment to the Senate ethics bill. But, unfortunately, the leadership \non the other side tried to kill the Pelosi transparency language which \nwould have required disclosure of all earmarks instead of 5 percent, as \nwe had on the Senate side. But the effort to kill my amendment failed, \nand we won the day.\n  Republicans voted with me and a few brave Democrats--Claire McCaskill \nand some others--joined us in saying: Enough is enough; America needs \nto know what we are spending. We were able to pass that transparency \nbill. But the original Pelosi-DeMint transparency rule that was part of \nSenate bill No. 1 last year, and agreed to unanimously, said \nauthorization earmarks could not be added or airdropped into conference \nreports with the House. But that provision has been gutted and ignored.\n  The original Pelosi-DeMint transparency rule gave Senators the right \nto force a vote on individual earmarks that were added into conference \nreports in the dark of night. But that provision was secretly gutted.\n  The original Pelosi-DeMint transparency rule said bills containing \nearmarks could not be brought to the floor until we had at least 48 \nhours to read the bill online in an easily searchable format. That was \nnot easily searchable with this bill you are looking at on the table. \nBut that provision, too, has been gutted and ignored.\n  In fact, in less than 24 hours we brought this bill to the Senate \nfloor--the largest appropriations bill in our history--that contained \nover 11,000 earmarks, and it passed in less than 48 hours. No one read \nthat bill.\n  We are wrecking the Federal budget, and we still expect Americans to \nbalance their family budget.\n  The original Pelosi-DeMint transparency rule said neither the Senator \nnor his or her family could financially benefit from an earmark, but \nthat provision has been changed to the point where it is almost \nmeaningless.\n  The original Pelosi-DeMint transparency rule said the \nParliamentarian, who is nonpartisan and whose job is to make impartial \nrulings, would be responsible for determining if bills brought to the \nfloor complied with earmark transparency rules. That was a good rule, \nbut that has been gutted. The provision has been changed so that now \nthe majority leader and the chairman of Appropriations verify if it has \nmet the rules.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  The Senate also passed legislation last year to ban the practice of \nwhat we call phone-marking or letter-marking, which occurs when \nSenators secretly request earmarks by pressuring agencies with phone \ncalls or letters without complying with the earmark disclosure rules. \nThat provision has been gutted.\n  Last year, the majority promised to cut the number of earmarks in \nhalf. But they did not. Instead, we passed the second highest level of \nearmarks in history. You can see from this chart, Republicans did a \nlousy job containing the number of earmarks, but we were able--by \nstopping an Omnibus appropriations bill before we left the majority--to \nreduce the number to 2,600. But last year it went back up to the second \nhighest level in history--a lot of broken promises.\n  I also wish to review some things about the earmark system and why it \nis broken. In the last 20 years, porkbarrel earmarks have exploded. In \n1987, Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill that had only 121 earmarks. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       I haven't seen this much lard since I handed out blue \n     ribbons at the Iowa State Fair.\n\n  Mr. President, 121 earmarks. We are dealing with tens of thousands of \nearmarks now every year. By 2005, earmarks had skyrocketed to about \n14,000 wasteful earmarks into our spending bills. In fact, since 2000, \nCongress has spent more than $188 billion of Americans' taxpayer \ndollars on over 77,000 porkbarrel projects.\n  Americans are outraged about a system that hands out their tax \ndollars based on political influence and congressional seniority \ninstead of on the merit of the projects. Here are a few examples of the \nresults of the earmark favor factory over the last several years. Keep \nin mind as I read these earmarks, this is hard-working American tax \ndollars coming to us. We are expecting the family to use their money \nresponsibly to balance their checkbook. Here is what we are doing with \ntheir tax dollars:\n  The International Fund for Ireland, funding the World Toilet Summit, \n$13.5 million; Richard Steele Boxing Club, $100,000--this is at a time \nwe are creating debt and waste every year--animal waste research and \nmanagement, $4.75 million; a study to determine if poultry litter can \ngenerate electricity, $225,000; the Tiger Woods Foundation--he is \nhurting for money--$100,000; golf charity, $3 million taken out of the \nDepartment of Defense budget for a golf charity; Museum of Glass, \n$550,000; a fake prison museum, $100,000; the Rock and Roll Hall of \nFame--a clear national priority--$200,000; The Historic Coal Library, \n$800,000; wine research, $11 million; Baseball Hall of Fame, $750,000; \nthe National Wild Turkey Federation, $500,000; grasshopper research, \n$775,000; bike paths, $6.8 million; Montana Sheep Institute, $400,000; \nNational Peanut Festival, $200,000; ornamental fish research, $600,000; \nGrammy Institute, $800,000; the American Film Institute, $90,000; DNA \nstudy of bears, $1 million; study to analyze bear fur, $300,000; wood \nresearch, $9.5 million; Cowgirl Hall of Fame, $90,000; Indoor Rain \nForest, $50 million; water-free men's urinals, $2 million; Charlie \nRangel Monument, $2 million; Teapot Museum, $500,000; an 85-foot \nspeedboat the Navy didn't want and refused to use, $4.5 million; \nWoodstock Hippie Museum, $1 million; Coconut Road highway project that \nwas unwanted by the city it was sent to, $10 million; shirts for the \nU.S. Marine Corps that were found to melt in battle and caused severe \ndisfiguring burns, $2 million; National Drug Intelligence Center that \nduplicates work already done by 19 other Federal agencies and which the \nOMB asked to be shut down--we still gave them $400 million; and, of \ncourse, the Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska, $320 million.\n\n  Folks, there are people who come to this floor during this debate and \ncite earmarks that they say are good, and certainly we can find some. \nBut for every one earmark that could be justified, we could find \nhundreds that sound just like the ones I read today. At a time when our \ncountry is in severe deficit, when we are at war and the American \nfamily is straining every month in their budget, we are throwing their \nmoney away--coffee stain after coffee stain, demonstrating to the \nAmerican people that we don't have the commitment to do what is best \nfor this country.\n  This is just scratching the surface. Did I read a couple of dozen? \nThere are almost 12,000 right here that Americans will never know how \ntheir money is spent.\n  Besides the waste, earmarks have also led to corruption. Let me say \nthat I have spent enough time working with my colleagues to know that \nmost are not corrupt. They love their country, and they want to make it \na better place. But the system of earmarking has taken our energy and \ndiverted it away from solving national problems and wasted it on the \ntask of steering tax dollars back home. This perversion of purpose has \nundoubtedly led to real corruption scandals that have caused the \nAmerican people to lose trust in Congress.\n  In 2006, former Congressman Duke Cunningham was sentenced to 8 years \nin prison for trading earmarks for over $2.4 million in personal \nbribes. As reported by ABC News at the time, Cunningham actually kept a \nbribe menu where he listed what payments he demanded in return for \nearmarks from Government. This card here shows an escalating scale for \nbribes, starting at $140,000 and a luxury yacht for a $16 million \nDefense Department contract. Each additional $1 million in contract \nvalue required $50,000 in bribes. The rate dropped to $25,000 per \nadditional million once the contract went over $20 million.\n  Also in 2006, former lobbyist Jack Abramoff was sentenced to nearly 6 \nyears in prison for corruption and fraud. Abramoff pleaded guilty to \ndefrauding numerous Indian tribes for which he helped secure earmarks. \nIt was Jack Abramoff who called the congressional appropriations \nprocess the\n\n[[Page S1931]]\n\n``earmark favor factory'' for his ability to secure millions in \ntaxpayer funds for his clients.\n  There are thousands of lobbyists who are sent here by towns and \nuniversities, small colleges, organizations that are up here trying to \nget a piece of these Federal handouts that we call earmarks. It is \ncorrupting the whole process.\n  Why is it so easy for this earmarking system to lead to corruption? \nIt is because there is so little oversight. Rather than being funded \nbased on merit, they are chosen based on political influence and \ncongressional seniority. Is a sewer or a highway project in West \nVirginia more worthy than one in Wyoming simply because the State's \nSenator holds a high-ranking appropriations seat? I don't think so.\n  Americans are frustrated with Congress. Congressional approval is at \nalltime historic lows. Voters threw out the Republicans in 2006 hoping \nfor a change, but not much has changed. Wasteful Washington spending \nhasn't stopped. We continue to wreck the Federal budget as Americans \nare struggling to balance theirs. The congressional favor factory \nhasn't been closed; it is just under new management.\n  When Members of Congress are sworn into office, we take an oath to \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States. This \nConstitution prescribes a limited role for the Federal Government, \nwhose purpose is to ``form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, \nensure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote \nthe general Welfare, and secure the blessings of Liberty.''\n  This purpose statement should give Congress a clear focus on national \npriorities and the good of the Nation as a whole. Unfortunately, many \nin Congress have forgotten that oath and lost sight of our \ncongressional purpose. I did not raise my hand and swear allegiance to \nthe State of South Carolina and promise to get them as much Federal \nmoney as I could. Those who say it is a constitutional responsibility \nto earmark are not using quotes from this document, the Constitution. \nIn fact, everything in here suggests a national priority. It suggests a \nuniform way in collecting taxes. It says: No preference should be given \nto a State when money is appropriated, and it says this, which is key: \nthat no money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of \nappropriation made by law.\n  Over 95 percent of the earmarks we produce here in this Congress are \nnot law, they are not constitutional, and there is no excuse for them \nat all. We can't hide behind this Constitution. It does not give us the \nauthority, explicitly or implicitly, to take on a local and State role, \ndecide where water and sewer plants go, where bike paths go, which \nlocal museum should be funded. That is not our job, but that is a \nreason we are not dealing with a broken Tax Code, a broken Social \nSecurity system, a broken Medicare system, how we deal with keeping \njobs in this country, because we are spending most of our time trying \nto figure out what needs to be done back in our local communities.\n  The primary culprit of most of the problems we are dealing with here \nis the addictive power of congressional earmarks that we are trying to \nstop today. My objection to earmarks is not to specific Members. The \nrequirement that earmarks now have names on them makes them more \npersonal, but it is really the earmarking system that is the problem.\n  When Members of Congress invest their time in securing Federal funds \nfor sewer plants and bike paths, as I have mentioned, they are doing \nmore than assuming a Federal role for a local responsibility; they are \nlocking themselves into voting for whatever bill contains their \nprojects. That is how leadership here in Congress gets us to vote for \nbills that are billions over budget and contain lots of bad policy--\nthey cram in their projects that make it very difficult for us to vote \nagainst. For this reason, Congress has repeatedly, regardless of which \nparty is in charge, demonstrated an inability to curb out-of-control \nspending. Members who may otherwise vote against a massive, wasteful \nspending bill end up voting aye because it contains a project for a \nspecial interest back home.\n\n  In January, the first baby boomer received her first Social Security \ncheck. In just 3 years, she will qualify for Medicare. With 77 million \nAmericans in line right now behind her, now is the time for Congress to \naddress the long-term fiscal crisis that lies ahead. Social Security \nand Medicare are trillions of dollars underfunded. Yet we are focused \non using earmarks to deal with local issues such as determining the \nlocation of local parks and community centers, and we are failing to \naddress these serious national problems. We are wrecking the Federal \nbudget while Americans are struggling to meet their family budget.\n  I didn't come to Washington to fight against earmarks. I didn't even \nknow what they were when I got here. I came here to work on tax reform \nand fixing Social Security and Medicare. But the culture of earmarks is \ndistracting the attention of Congress from much needed national \nreforms. So I have made eliminating earmarks an urgent and immediate \ngoal.\n  One of the things I found out in trying to improve the quality \nculture in organizations is you have to understand the root causes of \nproblems and not spend your time treating symptoms. The root cause of \nmany of the problems, particularly the wasteful spending in this \nCongress, is earmarks.\n  Already in this new Congress, which promised to be more transparent \nand to cut earmarks in half, we have seen many shameless requests for \npork projects, including taxpayer-funded monuments to individual \nMembers of Congress. Worse, Members of Congress insist on hiding these \nwasteful pork projects behind some of our Nation's most important \npriorities. We have held hostage health care for poor children, \nveterans benefits, and funding for our troops in order to sneak through \nporkbarrel projects.\n  We have basically made human shields of our most vulnerable \nAmericans, giving Members of Congress two bad choices: Either we vote \nfor bloated bills that are billions over budget and full of wasteful \nearmarks or we vote against national priorities and needy constituents. \nThis is no way to run the most important Government in the world.\n  So we ended another year with a lot more debt and a lot more broken \npromises. We have not helped Americans buy health insurance; in fact, \nwe have made it harder. We haven't cut spending; we have raised it. Our \nantiquated Tax Code continues to chase jobs overseas, and we have not \naddressed the huge entitlement crisis. Meanwhile, we increased the \nnumber of special interests and wasteful earmarks from last year, and \nboth parties are bragging that we did better than expected. Instead of \nkeeping promises, we have let the earmarking system pervert our purpose \nas Members of Congress.\n  The purpose of the amendment that I have with the budget is to take a \ntimeout. When you have a problem, when you have an addiction, you have \nto agree you have a problem and you have to get into rehab. Congress \nneeds to get into rehab. We need to stop earmarking this year, take a \ntimeout, and figure out how to reform the system. Those who continue to \ngive excuses, who say: No, we don't need a timeout, we will fix it, I \nhave been listening to for 8 years. They keep saying there is a problem \nwe need to fix, but they never do. It is time to take this issue \nseriously, to get earmarks off the table so that we can look at it \nobjectively.\n  I would encourage all of my colleagues to join me, the Republican \nnominee for President, John McCain; the two Democratic possibilities \nfor President, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton; and Claire McCaskill \nand vote for this amendment and show America we can be trusted.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I will yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nSenator from Kentucky and the Senator from Pennsylvania, both of whom I \nthink are to be recognized, I be recognized for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that the unanimous consent request be \nmodified as recognized for the purpose of speaking but not for the \npurpose of offering an amendment.\n\n[[Page S1932]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask that the request be so modified.

Mr. President, I spoke about this yesterday, and I have \nbrought it to this Chamber before on numerous occasions. In fact, the \nSenate adopted a very similar amendment by unanimous consent last year, \nand it passed on a recorded vote 2 years earlier.\n  My amendment would repeal an unfair tax that Congress enacted in \n1993. The Congressional Budget Office has said that over 15 million \nsenior citizens are affected by the taxation of Social Security \nbenefits. When Congress created the Social Security Program to provide \nincome security for seniors, part of the structure of that program, and \none of the reasons for its popularity, was that benefits were not \ntaxed. I will say that again.\n  Social Security benefits were not taxed when the program was created. \nIn 1983, the Greenspan Commission and Congress decided that half of the \nbenefits of some seniors should be subject to taxation and, in 1993, \nraised that amount to 85 percent of the Social Security benefits that a \nsenior citizen receives.\n  This tax affected supposedly ``wealthy'' seniors, with incomes above \n$34,000 for single seniors, and $44,000 for a couple. Those are \nsupposedly wealthy senior citizens. The goal of this seemed to be to \nimpose a type of means testing on Social Security beneficiaries--in \nother words, tilting the benefit structure in favor of low-income \nseniors, making it more like a welfare program.\n  This is the kind of change Senator Patrick Moynihan often warned \nCongress about. But the Ways and Means Committee and the President \nignored his warnings. If that was the goal, the legislation was \nfundamentally flawed. The $34,000 and $44,000 amounts were not indexed \nfor inflation. I can assure you that seniors earning these amounts do \nnot consider themselves wealthy at all--particularly with the increased \ncost of prescription drugs, rent, or mortgage payments, gasoline, \nparticularly with unleaded regular being $3.20 a gallon now, heating \noil, and even food prices that seniors are experiencing today.\n  My amendment is fairly simple. It drops the tax back to the pre-1993 \nlevel, starting in 2008, this year, in this budget. This means the 85 \npercent tax would be eliminated, and the maximum amount of Social \nSecurity benefits that could be taxed would be 50 percent. The revenue \nfrom the 1993 tax was applied to the Medicare trust fund.\n  My amendment would make the trust fund whole by offsetting the cost \nof the tax rollback by $89 billion over 5 years, with an adjustment to \nfunction 920 of the budget.\n  The inspector general's and the CBO's budget operation report \nidentified over $300 billion in potential savings on Government \nprograms over the next 5 years. I believe the committee of jurisdiction \ncan review wasteful Government spending in order to offset this \nextremely important tax cut for America's seniors. This was an unfair \ntax on our seniors when it was enacted, and it is time we repeal it.\n  Think of this now. A senior citizen, single, with an income of \n$34,000 receiving maybe $36,000 from Social Security and other income, \nand they have to pay 85 percent tax on that Social Security benefit--85 \npercent. That is the largest, highest taxation of any benefit we \nreceive from the Federal Government--85 percent of anything. Say I \nreceive $36,000 from the Federal Government in Social Security benefits \nand other income. On the $34,000 I receive from Social Security, 85 \npercent of that is taxed at the normal rate that I would pay in \nwhatever tax bracket I fall under. The same goes with a married couple. \nMarried couples, both seniors, both have unusual expenses as far as \nprescription drugs, and some have prescription drugs amounting to maybe \n$1,000 each per month--maybe $1,000 each per month, home heating oil, \ngas and electric to heat their homes or cool their homes, groceries--\nall these things add up for our seniors today. This tax is completely \nand totally unfair to the senior citizens we have today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, as many have in the \npast. This is something that should have been done a long time ago. I \nhave tried, since its inception in 1993, to get this repealed back to \nthe 50-percent level. I have not been successful. The majority, last \nyear, accepted this amendment by unanimous consent. It went to the \nconference committee and was kicked out. They accepted it, said they \nwould try to do it, and then because of the cost it was kicked out.\n  What does that tell our senior citizens in the United States--that \nthey are second-class citizens; they have to pay more on their Social \nSecurity benefits than anybody else. I don't think that is fair. I \nthink it is time that we did something about it.\n  So, please, I ask my colleagues on the Senate floor, help us this \nyear finally repeal this unfair tax that we added to our seniors in \n1993.\n  Mr. President, I will ask for the yeas and nays when the amendment \ncomes up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy and \nfor his work on the Budget Committee. Senator Martinez would like time \non a separate matter, not a budget-related matter. This might be a very \ngood time to do that. We hate to have dead time on the floor. How much \ntime would the Senator need?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. About 10 or 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we will give him up to 15 minutes off the \nresolution.\n\n[[Page S1933]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                    Honoring Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. I appreciate this opportunity. It is something that I am \ndoing in conjunction with Senator Menendez. Senator Menendez is at a \nBanking Committee hearing and will be here shortly to participate.\n  Today, I rise to speak about a man who is best described as a \ndefender of freedom and human rights, a consistent voice for change, \nand a shining point of defiance within a country rife with oppression.\n  This man is Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet--a Cuban who has made his life's \nwork being an advocate for democracy and a defender of human rights. \nThis individual risked jail time for publicly denouncing the countless \nhuman rights violations performed by the Cuban regime.\n  As a result, Dr. Biscet is today locked in a jail cell as one of \nCuba's hundreds of political prisoners--people held for crimes not \nagainst society but for speaking out against the systematic repression \nof the regime. What was Dr. Biscet's crime? He called for freedom.\n  I bring attention to Dr. Biscet because I believe, even in his \nrelatively young life, he has exhibited actions that rise to the level \nof the extraordinary and worthy of our recognition.\n  This is why today I, along with my colleagues, Senators Bob Menendez, \nBill Nelson, John Ensign, and Norm Coleman, will introduce a measure to \naward the Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet. This is \nin recognition of his courageous and unwavering commitment to \ndemocracy, human rights, and peaceful change in Cuba.\n  Over time, Congress has recognized many individuals who have made \ncontributions to advancing freedom around the world.\n  Among these individuals are proponents of peace and liberty, \nincluding Nelson Mandela, Pope John Paul II, the Dalai Lama, and Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. All have been awarded the highest award \nbestowed to civilians by Congress. Dr. Biscet is equally worthy of this \ndistinction. In fact, he has modeled his efforts after those of Dr. \nKing, the Dalai Lama, Thoreau, and Gandhi.\n  We should recognize him for speaking out, even though he knew he \nrisked the regime's harassment, censure, and incarceration, and for \ndrawing the world's attention to the regime's horrific record of human \nrights and disregard for human dignity and for always conducting his \nwork through peaceful means.\n  He is a hero among his people and deserves Congress's recognition for \nhis courageous commitment to the principles we hold dear: democracy, \nhuman rights, and freedom for all.\n  Throughout his life, Dr. Biscet has served others and has helped to \nbring the regime's injustices to light.\n  As a physician, he provided care to those living in his hometown of \nHavana, doing his best to practice in the poor conditions that are \ncommon in Cuba's hospitals and state-run health care facilities.\n  In 1997, Dr. Biscet founded the Lawton Foundation for Human Rights--a \ngroup named for the neighborhood in Havana in which he lived, and an \norganization whose main objective is to establish in Cuba a state based \non the rule of law.\n  In the talks he gave before being imprisoned and in his letters \nsmuggled out of prison these last few years remains a common theme \ninvolving the intrinsic value of liberty and human rights.\n  In establishing the Lawton Foundation, Dr. Biscet wrote that the \npurpose of it is ``to defend the inalienable rights of the human race \nwe understand the need to put limits on government to prevent the \nundermining of those rights. It is because of this that we have become \nactivists in this organization--to establish in our country the rule of \nlaw, so that each man and woman may be fulfilled as complete human \nbeings.''\n  And for defending these universal principles of freedom, the \nfoundation's members are often harassed, censured, and incarcerated.\n  The foundation's mission and objective may be simple; yet it is so \nimportant. ``It promotes the defense of all Cubans through nonviolent \ncivil disobedience''--a practice set forth by Henry David Thoreau, who \nwrote that ``the individual is [a higher and independent power] from \nwhich the state obtains its power.''\n  This is Dr. Biscet's belief; it is his guide; it is a truth he \ncontinues to promote today--even from the confines of a Cuban prison.\n  In 1998, after publicly criticizing the quality of the Cuban national \nhealth care system, the doctor was summarily thrown in jail and \nforbidden from practicing medicine anywhere in the country.\n  Even though he has been publicly disparaged and ostracized by the \nregime, he has always remained committed to advancing a message of \npeaceful political change and nonviolent disobedience.\n  In 1999, he was arrested for displaying the Cuban flag upside down at \na political rally and, as punishment, he was again thrown into a prison \nand savagely beaten, kicked, and burned.\n  For his work, he was arbitrarily detained 26 times in 18 months. This \nis without the benefit of a grand jury, an indictment, or counsel, and \nwithout the benefit of the types of protections that are commonly \nafforded to prisoners in most anyplace in the world, or certainly the \nkind of opportunity that those detained in Guantanamo had to have: the \nRed Cross visit and view and examine their conditions. None of these \nthings are permitted in Cuba's gulag of prisons. After his most recent \narrest in 2003, following a peaceful protest in Havana, Dr. Biscet is \nnow serving the fifth year of what is called a 25-year sentence. There \nwas no fair trial, there was no counsel. This was a sentence issued by \nnothing more than one of those courts that the Castro regime has \nutilized now for almost half a century.\n\n  The Castro brothers have described Dr. Biscet as a ringleader of \ncounterrevolutionary activities. The reality is Dr. Biscet wants his \npeople to be free. Amnesty International has declared Dr. Biscet a \nprisoner of conscience--someone who has been imprisoned solely for the \npeaceful expression of their beliefs.\n  The Cuban regime has put Dr. Biscet and his family through the kind \nof anguish few in this country could ever imagine. He has committed no \ncrimes, and yet he sits in prison fighting for a freedom he and most of \nthe island's 11 million Cubans have never known.\n  As a human rights activist, Dr. Biscet finds inspiration in the words \nof many men who share his desire to achieve peaceful change. He speaks \nof the Dalai Lama's message of peace, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s mission \nof tolerance, and Mahatma Gandhi's lifetime of unwavering faith.\n  This is a picture of Dr. Biscet. It is a picture before the last 5 \nyears have transpired, because now we cannot obtain a picture of him. \nHe is given very few visits, and those visits are closely monitored. It \nwould be unthinkable to have the opportunity to take a picture of him. \nI will speak a little more about his confinement in a moment.\n  We both share a passion to one day see a free and peaceful Cuba, one \nwhere the people can hold free and fair elections so they might choose \ntheir own leaders, so they will not live in fear under an oppressive \nand illegitimate dictatorship.\n  The Cuban regime, sensing the hope brought about by Dr. Biscet's \nefforts, sought to make him a tool of the regime. The regime offered \nhim a choice: He could stay in prison or he could leave Cuba and never \nreturn. He could leave the country or he could remain behind. Instead \nof leaving his jail cell, Dr. Biscet has courageously pleaded to stay \nand sacrifice his own well-being so he might continue providing hope \nand encouragement to the Cuban people.\n  This is a replica of the cell Dr. Biscet is in today. It is a mock-up \nbecause we could not take pictures of that cell, but it is faithfully \ndrawn from the types of cells the regime commonly holds prisoners in. \nAs you can see, it is completely closed. There is no light when that \ndoor is closed inside, the 3-foot-by-4-foot space that is provided for \na prisoner.\n  As a result of his refusal to abandon the cause he so dearly believes \nin, Dr. Biscet remains in deplorable conditions, in a rat-infested \ncellblock, and in fact is needing medical care and getting none. This \nreplica of the cell was described by Dr. Biscet in a letter to\n\n[[Page S1934]]\n\nhis wife. He once described the conditions he lives in today. This is \nwhat he wrote:\n\n       I'm arbitrarily confined in a cell with characteristics \n     that violate the law; there are no windows, only walls; a \n     gloomy space lacking sunlight and the sky's visibility. This \n     is humiliating and illegal. Of the 8 months I have been in \n     prison in Pinar del Rio, I have seen my family only once, \n     during 2 hours, in the month of August. I am not allowed to \n     have any type of communication with my son and daughter who \n     live abroad.\n\n  These are conditions no one should ever have to endure.\n  In his most recent letter, dated March 1, 2008, a few weeks ago--and, \nby the way, he writes on whatever he can find, toilet paper or any \nother means, because he is not provided paper and pencil to write--he \nagain called on the regime to change. He called for:\n\n       Freedom of all political prisoners and prisoners of \n     conscience without deportation; participation with the same \n     rights for all Cubans; allowing the legalization of all \n     political parties, to revoke the absolute rule of the \n     Communist party over society and a commitment to carry out \n     free and democratic elections.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have Dr. Biscet's full \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Message sent by Dr. Biscet on March 1, 2008 to his wife from \n         the ``Combinado del Este'' jail in Havana, Cuba where he \n         is currently imprisoned:\n       Fidel Castro has left power. He should have done it 20 \n     years ago when Mikhail Gorbachev traveled to the island. He \n     wisely recommended it to him, that way it would have reduced \n     the years of misery, lack of freedom and cruel suffering of \n     the Cuban people under a prolonged, unnecessary and poorly \n     run government.\n       His brother, Raul, inherited his job and his Communist \n     party maintains a totalitarian, one party system, with the \n     only change being that of imposing more laws on the \n     population during his short time in office.\n       The Cuban people and their opposition leaders should fast \n     and pray to God and demand that the authorities of the \n     country sign and carry out the International Covenants of \n     Human, Civil, Political, Cultural and Social Rights.\n       Thanks to the support from the Cuban exile community and of \n     the governments of free and democratic countries, after a \n     year and five months of demands, the regime in Havana \n     promised to carry out these objectives, although they have \n     yet to materialize. When the previously issued complaints are \n     addressed and the following rights are granted:\n       1. Freedom of all the political prisoners and prisoners of \n     conscience without deportation.\n       2. Participation with the same rights for all Cubans, \n     including the exiles, without exception, in the political and \n     economic life of the country.\n       3. To allow the legalization of various political parties \n     in accordance with the interests of the Cuban people.\n       4. To revoke the constitution and the absolute rule of the \n     communist party over society.\n       5. Commitment to carrying out free and democratic \n     elections.\n\n     then we will be able to say that the period of democratic \n     transition has begun in Cuba.\n       Gorbachev in the former Soviet Union, Pinochet in Chile, \n     and DeClercq in South Africa, had the courage and the \n     pragmatism to make democratic reforms. The goals of the Cuban \n     people are to live in peace, well-being, happiness, and to \n     achieve the goals, freedom is needed.\n       The current government should make openings to reach these \n     objectives and the citizens should continue to search for \n     them by means of civil disobedience.\n       ``Woe to those who make unjust laws, to those who issue \n     oppressive decrees, to deprive the poor of their rights and \n     withhold justice from the oppressed of my people, making \n     widows their prey and robbing the fatherless. What will you \n     do on the day of reckoning, when disaster comes from afar? To \n     whom will you run for help? Where will you leave your riches? \n     Nothing will remain but to cringe among the captives or fall \n     among the slain. Yet for all this, his anger is not turned \n     away, his hand is still upraised.''--Isaiah Chapter 10, v. 1-\n     4.\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, in a recent column discussing the \ndisaster that the Castro regime has visited upon Cuba, columnist George \nWill wrote about another Cuban, Armando Valladares, who withstood the \nregime's brutal prison system for 22 years. Of the prison's conditions, \nWill wrote:\n\n       Some doors are welded shut and prisoners are fed watery \n     soup sometimes laced with glass, or dead rats, or half a \n     cow's intestine, rectum included, containing feces.\n\n  This is the ugly reality of what speaking openly against the Castro \nregime gets you in Cuba. Today there are hundreds of political \nprisoners in the many prisons that have cropped up since the Castro \nregime took power. Dr. Biscet is one of those prisoners, a noble and \ndecent man choosing to fight for a cause greater than his own, risking \neverything in the process.\n  Throughout U.S. history, Congress, as an institution, has recognized \nthose who stand up for democracy, the rule of law, and human rights. We \nowe Dr. Biscet and those he inspires the honor of knowing that we \nsupport his worthy efforts and that Americans share his desire for \nseeing freedom take root in a country plagued by oppression for far too \nlong.\n  Awarding this honor to a man with such courage and conviction will \nstrengthen his cause and the cause of all Cubans and send a message to \nthe Cuban regime that they are on the wrong side of history, and they \nare on the wrong side of what is good and is right.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this man who seeks democratic change \nand the recognition of human rights by bestowing this honor of a \nCongressional Gold Medal to Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of time on this busy day \non the floor. I know Senator Menendez wishes to speak on this issue, \nbut at this time I yield the floor, and I thank the chairman for the \ntime allowed.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague and friend, \nSenator Martinez, in strong support of our resolution to recommend \nCuban dissident and political prisoner Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet for the \nCongressional Gold Medal. This medal is the Nation's highest and most \ndistinguished civilian award, and I can think of few who are more \ndeserving than this man. For his courageous commitment to democracy, \nfor his unwavering defense of human rights, for his lifetime of working \nfor peaceful change on an island where freedom dares not speak its \nname, Dr. Biscet has earned the admiration of his community, and he has \nearned the recognition of this Congress.\n  Just over 4 months ago, both Senator Martinez and I, along with \nSenators Nelson and Salazar, stood on this floor and declared our \nsolidarity with about 70 Cuban youths who had just been thrown in jail. \nTheir crime was nothing more than wearing this simple white bracelet \nthat says one word, ``cambio,'' change.\n  This one simple gesture was strong enough to have them held as \nprisoners. This one simple gesture was strong enough to have them \ndetained and harassed. But as I said on the floor 4 months ago, I also \nhoped this one gesture would be strong enough to inspire us and to \ninspire those who love freedom and democracy and have respect for human \nrights around the globe.\n  Today we stand here once again, in solidarity, to recognize someone \nwho has shown courage over and over again--courage in defense of human \nrights and democracy courage to speak out about the future he wants to \nsee on the island of Cuba.\n  When I last came to the floor to speak of Dr. Biscet, it was 1 week \nbefore he received the Presidential Medal Freedom, the highest civilian \naward bestowed by the President. Unfortunately, he received the award \nin absentia. He received it this way because has been languishing in \nthe jails of the Castro regime, serving a 25-year prison sentence.\n  And he continues to languish there today. His crime? Seeking peaceful \nchange in his country. His crime? Hanging a flag sideways. His crime? \nFighting against a repressive regime.\n  By awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Dr. Biscet, we would \ncreate a physical representation of so many years of political bravery.\n  In that medal, we will see a shining image of his courage and \naccomplishments.\n  In that medal, we will see the patient suffering of Dr. Biscet's \nwife, the fellow democracy advocate, Elsa Morjeon Hernandez, and the \npatient suffering of his two children who have had to grow up with \ntheir father in jail.\n  In that medal, we will see the 3 years Dr. Biscet spent in prison, 3 \nyears, after hanging the national flag sideways at a press conference.\n  In that medal, we will see that once he was released, Dr. Biscet \norganized engaged organizing seminars on the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights and continued to fight every day to bring democracy and \njustice to Cuba.\n  And in that medal, we will see a solid beacon of hope for the people \nof that island, recognition that people inspired\n\n[[Page S1935]]\n\nby Dr. Biscet will eventually bring democracy and justice to Cuba.\n  What Dr. Biscet and those young people arrested 4 months ago show us \nis inspiring: Cuba can change and will change. And this change will \ncome from within Cuba, from the Cuban people themselves.\n  Raul Castro has said, ``Fidel is irreplaceable, unless we all replace \nhim together.'' Now is the time to show that this can happen, that \nFidel can, in fact, be replaced not by one man but by a government of, \nby, and for the people of Cuba. Dr. Biscet himself in a letter 10 days \nago said, ``Fidel Castro has left power. He should have done it 20 \nyears ago when Mikhail Gorbachev traveled to the island. He wisely \nrecommended it to him, that way it would have reduced the years of \nmisery, lack of freedom and cruel suffering of the Cuban people under a \nprolonged, unnecessary and poorly run government . . . ''\n  The Cuban people can bring change. But they need our help. We must \ncontinue to fight here to do what we can to empower them and to support \nthem when they empower themselves as the United States did with \ndissidents from Lech Walesa to Vaclav Havel to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, \nso should it do with Oscar Elias Biscet. Here in the United States, \nthis is a time to further nurture the human rights activists, political \ndissidents, and independent-minded journalists inside of Cuba who have \nthe capability to stoke the movement toward freedom.\n  The Cuban people are speaking. In America, this is not the time for \nsilence. This is the time to speak out. Awarding the Congressional Gold \nMedal to Dr. Biscet will allow the American people to speak out, not \nonly to condemn the dark injustices of the Cuban regime but, more \nimportantly, to praise the efforts of one hero who has spent his life \nstanding for the values that unite the free peoples of the world, \nvalues that we know are more precious than gold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nNorth Dakota for permitting me to intervene for 10 minutes. I had been \non the list, but previous speakers ended, I believe earlier than \nanticipated, so we have worked out the scheduling on that basis.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, let me ask unanimous consent \nthat I be recognized following his completion of 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I thank both Senators for their \ncourtesy and their graciousness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to offer two \namendments, one amendment which will add $2.1 billion for the National \nInstitutes of Health, and the same amendment which will increase the \nfunding on LIHEAP. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senators \nHarkin, Snowe, Collins, Casey, Kennedy, Dole, Mikulski, Clinton, Levin, \nSununu, Dodd, Inouye, Brown, Menendez, Stabenow, Coleman, Kerry, \nDurbin, Stevens, Smith, Bingaman, Cochran, Cardin, and Rockefeller.\n  The funding for the National Institutes of Health is grossly \ninsufficient. For a period of time, in the range of 1999 through 2003, \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health has been increased very \nmaterially, with the increase on an annual basis rising as high in the \nyear 2003 to $3.77 billion. That increase in funding has produced \nremarkable results in scientific advances in many lines. The cancer \nrate has declined 2 percent for the last 2 years. The increase in \ntreatment for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, autism, and heart disease, has \nshown remarkable achievements. And with a budget of $3.1 trillion, I \nsuggest it is totally insufficient to have a budget for the National \nInstitutes of Health which would be projected at $29.2 billion.\n\n  In 1970, President Nixon declared war on cancer, and had that war \nbeen prosecuted with the same intensity as other wars, I wouldn't have \ngotten Hodgkin's. My good friend, Judge Edward R. Becker, Chief Judge \nof the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, would not have died \nprematurely of prostate cancer. My Chief of Staff, Carey Lackman, a \nbeautiful young woman of 48, would not have died from breast cancer.\n  On a daily basis, I have people come to see me from all over the \nUnited States who are urging increased funding on these very important \nlines: autism, prostate cancer, breast cancer, Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's, scleroderma, and heart disease. And with the capacity in \nthe United States to have cures for these ailments with sufficient \nfunding, I believe this should be a much higher priority than it is at \nthe present time. These ailments are curable.\n  As a footnote, one day we will recognize the availability of Federal \nfunding for embryonic stem cell research. Embryonic stem cell research \nhas enormous potential--enormous potential--to conquer these maladies. \nIf these embryonic stem cells were to be used to create life, there is \nno doubt that would have a higher call. But there is also no doubt that \nwith some 400,000 of these embryonic stem cells in storage, if they are \nnot going to be used for that purpose, it is a matter of either using \nthem or losing them.\n  This amendment also adds one billion to the funding for low-income \nenergy assistance for the people who are facing enormous increases in \ncosts. The escalating price of oil has produced a very heavy drain, \nespecially on our senior citizens, with so many faced with the prospect \nof either heating or eating. So this amendment will add materially to \nthat very important fund.\n  A second amendment which I am offering would repeal the 1993 increase \nof the alternative minimum tax. The alternative minimum tax was \nexpanded in 1993 when the tax rate was increased from 24 percent to 26 \npercent for taxable income under $175,000 and from 24 percent to 28 \npercent for taxable income that exceeds $175,000, without those limits \nbeing indexed for inflation. The AMT now has the potential for \ncapturing some 23 million people, 20 million more than anticipated when \nit was increased in 1993. There may be an amendment offered to \neliminate the AMT permanently, and I would be prepared to support that, \nbut in the absence of such an amendment, I believe it would be useful \nto propose this cure.\n  This differs from another amendment which may be offered on the AMT \nwhich would seek to have an offset. I believe that an offset is not \nappropriate, because this AMT was never intended to catch this number \nof people. So when you have a tax which was not intended to reach some \n23 million people, it ought to be eliminated; it ought to be not \neffectuated without having an offset.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my prepared statements \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Lack of Funding Will Result in Lost Opportunities\n\n       The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke \n     will be unable to implement fully the planned network of 10 \n     centers in the Special Program of Translational Research in \n     Acute Stroke--Funding is only available for 7 centers.\n       The National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development will be unable to launch a study to treat \n     children with critical asthma.\n       The National Eye Institute will be unable to fund several \n     clinical studies in minority populations, including Asian \n     Americans and Native Americans.\n       The National Institute of Deafness and Communication \n     Disorders will be unable to fund an initiative in Noise-\n     Induced Hearing Loss.\n       The National Institute of Mental Health will be able to \n     support only one clinical trial in the Bipolar Trials \n     Network.\n       The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism will \n     be unable to conduct a Phase III clinical trial in \n     medications development. In addition, clinical trials in \n     alcoholic liver and pancreatic diseases will go undone.\n       The National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney \n     Disease will eliminate a training program for pediatric \n     diabetes researchers.\n       The National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and \n     Bioengineering will be unable to pursue opportunities in \n     advanced imaging, which are crucial to early diagnosis and \n     treatment.\n       The flat funding of NIH will affect an entire generation of \n     young researchers. Many of this Nation's best and brightest \n     scientists are seeking opportunities outside of the lab or in \n     other countries because of lack of grant support.\n        NIH funded biomedical research has raised life expectancy, \n     improved the quality of life, and strengthened our economy. \n     If the United\n\n[[Page S1936]]\n\n     States is to continue its leadership role in providing the \n     medical breakthroughs to treat disease, the Congress must \n     commit to adequately supporting the funding of the National \n     Institutes of Health.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Floor Speech--Senator Arlen Specter\n\n        NIH/LIHEAP/Mentoring Amendment to the Budget Resolution\n\n\n                     NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n       The budget resolution currently recommends $30 billion for \n     the NIH in FY09, which is $950 million over the FY08 \n     appropriation. This $2.1 billion amendment, along with the \n     $950 million already contained in the resolution would \n     provide NIH with an increase of $3 billion or 10.3 percent \n     over the FY08 appropriation.\n       When I came to the Senate in 1981, NIH spending totaled \n     $3.6 billion. The FY 2003 omnibus appropriations bill \n     contained $27.2 billion for the NIH which completed the \n     doubling begun in FY 1998. However, since the doubling took \n     place, NIH has failed to keep pace with biomedical inflation \n     and as a result has lost 15 percent of its purchasing power. \n     The successes realized by this investment in NIH have spawned \n     revolutionary advances in our knowledge and treatment for \n     diseases such as cancer, HIV-AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, \n     Parkinson's disease, mental illnesses, diabetes, \n     osteoporosis, heart disease, ALS and many others. It is clear \n     that Congress' commitment to the NIH is paying off. Now it is \n     crucial that increased funding be continued in order to \n     translate these advances into additional treatments and \n     cures. Our investment has resulted in new generations of AIDS \n     drugs which are reducing the presence of the AIDS virus in \n     HIV infected persons to nearly undetectable levels. Death \n     rates from cancer have begun a steady decline. Stem cell \n     research could result in replacing diseased or damaged cells. \n     I anxiously await the results of all of these avenues of \n     remarkable research. This is the time to seize the scientific \n     opportunities that lie before us.\n       On May 21, 1997, the Senate passed a Sense of the Senate \n     resolution stating that funding for the NIH should be doubled \n     over 5 years. Regrettably, even though the resolution was \n     passed by an overwhelming vote of 98 to nothing, the Budget \n     Resolution contained a $100 million reduction for health \n     programs. That prompted Senator Harkin and myself to offer an \n     amendment to the budget resolution to add $1.1 billion to \n     carry out the expressed sense of the Senate to increase NIH \n     funding. Unfortunately, our amendment was tabled by a vote of \n     63-37. We were extremely disappointed that, while the Senate \n     had expressed its druthers on a resolution, it was simply \n     unwilling to put up the actual dollars to accomplish this \n     vital goal.\n       The following year, Senator Harkin and I again introduced \n     an amendment to the Budget Resolution which called for a $2 \n     billion increase for the NIH. While we gained more support on \n     this vote than in the previous year, our amendment was again \n     tabled by a vote of 57-41. Not to be deterred, Senator Harkin \n     and I again went to work with our Subcommittee and we were \n     able to add an additional $2 billion to the NIH account for \n     fiscal year 1999.\n       For fiscal year 2000, Senator Harkin and I offered another \n     amendment to the Budget Resolution to add $1.4 billion to the \n     health accounts, over and above the $600 million increase \n     which had already been provided by the Budget Committee. \n     Despite this amendment's defeat by a vote of 47-52, we were \n     able to provide a $2.3 billion increase for NIH in the fiscal \n     year 2000 appropriation's bill.\n       For fiscal year 2001, Senator Harkin and I again offered an \n     amendment to the Budget Resolution to increase funding for \n     health programs by $1.6 billion. This amendment passed by a \n     vote of 55-45. This victory brought the NIH increase to $2.7 \n     billion for fiscal year 2001. However, after late night \n     conference negotiations with the House, the funding for NIH \n     was cut by $200 million below that amount.\n       For fiscal year 2002, the budget resolution once again fell \n     short of the amount necessary to achieve the NIH doubling. \n     Senator Harkin and I, along with nine other Senators offered \n     an amendment to add an additional $700 million to the \n     resolution to achieve our goal. The vote was 96-4. The Senate \n     Labor-HHS Subcommittee reported a bill recommending $23.7 \n     billion, an increase of $3.4 billion over the previous year's \n     funding. But during conference negotiations with the \n     House, we once again fell short by $410 million.\n       In order to stay on a path to double NIH, an increase of \n     $3.7 billion was needed in fiscal year 2003. The fiscal year \n     2003 omnibus appropriations bill contained the additional \n     $3.7 billion, which achieved the doubling effort.\n       For FY04, I and Senator Harkin offered an amendment to add \n     an additional $2.8 billion to the budget resolution to ensure \n     that the momentum achieved by the doubling could be \n     maintained and translated into cures. The vote was 96-1. \n     Unfortunately, the amendment was dropped in conference. We \n     worked hard to find enough funding for a $1 billion increase \n     in FY04. We fought long and hard to make the doubling of \n     funding a reality, but until treatments and cures are found \n     for the many maladies that continue to plague our society, we \n     must continue our fight.\n       For FY05, Senator Harkin, Collins and I offered an \n     amendment to add $2 billion to discretionary health spending, \n     including NIH. The amendment passed 72-24. However, the \n     Subcommittee's allocation did not reflect this increase. The \n     final conference agreement contained an increase of $800 \n     million over the FY04 funding level.\n       For FY06, the Senate voted 63-37 to accept the Specter/\n     Harkin budget resolution amendment to add $1.5 billion for \n     NIH and $500 million for education, but again, the funding \n     was dropped in conference with the House. With overall \n     funding for the Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee cut $1.9 \n     billion below the FY05 enacted level, NIH did not receive an \n     increase over the previous fiscal year.\n       For FY07, Senator Harkin and I along with 28 others, \n     offered an amendment to the budget resolution to add $7 \n     billion to discretionary spending for Labor, Health and \n     Education programs offset by an increase in advance \n     appropriations. The amendment passed 73-27. Unfortunately, \n     the continuing resolution for FY07 did not realize the goal \n     set by the budget amendment. The continuing resolution \n     contained $28.9 billion, an increase of $636.7 million.\n       For FY08, once again Senator Harkin and I offered an \n     amendment, which the Senate adopted by unanimous consent, \n     which added $2.2 billion to NIH, CDC and Health Professions \n     programs. However, the FY08 appropriations bill only provided \n     increases of $328.6 million for NIH, $112.4 million for CDC \n     and only $15.5 million for health professions training over \n     the FY07 level.\n       I, like millions of Americans, have benefited tremendously \n     from the investment we have made in the National Institutes \n     of Health and the amendment that we offer today will continue \n     to carry forward the important research work of the world's \n     premier medical research facility.\n\n\n                   LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE\n\n       Paying heating and cooling bills for low-income households \n     throughout this Nation has always been a struggle, but never \n     more so than today with the soaring energy costs. The \n     inability to pay for heating and cooling homes, or having to \n     make decisions to forgo other needs such as food and medicine \n     pose health and safety hazards--especially to the elderly, \n     the disabled and children. This winter, Americans will spend \n     $977 to heat their homes which is 10 percent higher than last \n     winter. Nationwide average oil heating bills are expected to \n     be 22 percent higher than in the previous year. The $1 \n     billion amendment that I am offering today would help defray \n     some of the costs energy costs for next year.\n\n\n                               MENTORING\n\n       In this Nation it is estimated that more than 772,500 \n     juveniles are members of gangs, dropouts rates in some school \n     districts exceed 60 percent and the direct and indirect cost \n     of youth violence exceeds $158 billion a year. Mentoring \n     programs have proven to steer children away from gangs \n     violence and crime. Mentored youth are 46 percent less likely \n     to start using drugs and alcohol, 33 percent less likely to \n     act violently, and significantly more likely to graduate from \n     high school and go on to college, making mentoring highly \n     cost-effective. There are approximately 17.6 million children \n     nationwide who need or want a mentor. Yet only three million \n     children have been paired with a mentor--resulting in a \n     mentoring ``gap'' of approximately 14.6 million children. I \n     am pleased to see that the resolution contains an increase of \n     $5.5 billion above the FY08 appropriation for education and \n     training programs, and restores funds for the mentoring \n     program and the 47 other education programs slated for \n     elimination in the FY09 budget.\n       The increase provided for education and training programs \n     will help address juvenile crime, violence, delinquency, and \n     high dropout rates.\n\n\n                                 OFFSET\n\n       The $3.1 billion amendment would be offset by an across-\n     the-board reduction of less than 0.3 percent in Function \n     920--Allowances. The across-the-board reduction would not \n     result in any program reductions, but would reduce travel and \n     administrative expenses throughout the Federal government, \n     including domestic agencies, homeland security, and defense.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       In summary, this amendment would provide funding to \n     continue the advances in medical research and help states \n     assist low-income households in meeting the cost of home \n     heating and cooling. The amendment is fully offset and does \n     not break the cap on discretionary spending.\n       Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Statement of Senator Arlen Specter\n\n\n                                  AMT\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to \n     discuss an amendment that I intend to offer to S. Con. Res. \n     70, the Fiscal Year 2009 Concurrent Budget Resolution. My \n     amendment seeks to repeal section 13203 of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 by restoring the Alternative \n     Minimum Tax (AMT) rates that had previously been in effect.\n       The AMT is a flawed income tax system and should be \n     repealed. It is important to keep in mind that the first \n     version of the AMT was created in 1969 in response to a small \n     number of high-income individuals who had paid little or no \n     federal income taxes. Because of a series of changes made to \n     the AMT over the years, the AMT now affects over three \n     million taxpayers annually. Each year we are forced to take \n     legislative\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\n     action to prevent massive expansion where over 20 million \n     individuals pay this burdensome tax. Today, between a lack of \n     indexing for inflation and higher AMT tax rates relative to \n     the regular income tax system, we have a tax system which has \n     grown far beyond its intended result. Both problems are \n     worthy of analysis and legislative action.\n       The AMT is not indexed for inflation and taxpayers are \n     ``pushed'' into the AMT through so-called ``bracket creep.'' \n     Last year, Congress was late to enact a temporary increase in \n     the AMT exemption amount and millions of tax refunds will be \n     delayed this year as a result. I am pleased to see that this \n     Budget on the floor assumes a one-year ``patch'' without \n     offsets to prevent inflation from harming taxpayers. It is my \n     hope that Congress will not again wait until December to \n     address this problem.\n       Even with enactment of the ``patch,'' 3.5 million taxpayers \n     are still impacted, far more than what was originally \n     intended. The AMT tax rate relative to the regular income tax \n     impacts taxpayers who were never intended to pay the AMT. In \n     1993, President Clinton and a Democrat-controlled Congress \n     imposed a significant tax hike on Americans. The AMT tax rate \n     was increased from 24 percent to 26 percent for taxable \n     income under $175,000 and from 24 percent to 28 percent for \n     taxable income that exceeds $175,000.\n       My amendment cures this 2nd problem by repealing the 1993 \n     AMT tax increase and brings the AMT tax rate back to 24 \n     percent. During the course of this Budget debate, it is my \n     understanding that we will also vote on whether to repeal the \n     AMT altogether, without offsets. Clearly, the best option is \n     for the AMT to be repealed. However, if my colleagues cannot \n     support that approach, then I would urge them to vote for \n     this more modest approach which rolls back one of the many \n     changes that has brought millions of taxpayers under the \n     grasp of the AMT. This amendment, combined with the AMT \n     ``patch'' brings the AMT closer to its intended purpose.\n       This amendment would reduce revenues by $185.3 billion over \n     the five-year budget window. No offsets are included because \n     it is highly questionable to justify raising taxes elsewhere \n     to account for lost revenue that was never intended to be \n     collected. The Senate agreed with this philosophy last year \n     when it ``patched'' the AMT without offsets.\n       I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I again thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom North Dakota, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Next, we have the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will want to visit with Senator Conrad \nand Senator Gregg, the chair and ranking member, to try to determine \nwhen I will be able to offer my amendment. I wish to speak about the \namendment. My understanding is I am not yet able to offer it because of \nan objection, but my hope is we will be able to work this amendment \ninto the list of amendments very soon.\n  I have often described this budget process. One hundred years from \nnow, we will all be dead--not a pleasant thought--but historians will \nlook back at what we did and who we were and could evaluate a little \nsomething about us and our value systems by looking at how we spent our \nmoney. What did we think was important? What did we invest in? What did \nwe spend our money on? That is true for families and individuals, and \nit is especially true for governments--what the Federal Government \nthinks is important. What is its value system in this budget document? \nIt will tell historians a lot about who we were, the kind of people we \nwere.\n  I want to talk about an amendment I am offering to provide funding \nfor the Indian health care system. I am going to tell you why I am \ndoing that. American Indians were here first. We all came later. They \nwere the first Americans. Because we took their land, in most \ninstances, and put them on reservations, we signed treaties with them. \nOur Government said to them: Here is what we are going to do. Yes, we \nare taking your land, but we are going to have a trust responsibility \nfor certain things we are going to do for you, and we will even put it \nin treaties and sign the treaties. We are going to provide for your \nhealth care. So we have a responsibility here in the Federal Government \nto provide for Indian health care. If someone wondered why that is the \ncase--we promised. We signed treaties, we signed up, we said we will do \nit.\n  So we have a couple of million American Indians in this country who \nrely on the Indian health care system. Guess what. We do a pretty \nmiserable job. We spend half as much money providing health care to \nAmerican Indians, per person, as we do to those who serve in Federal \nprisons. When we incarcerate someone in a Federal prison, we are \nresponsible for their health care. We spend twice as much more on \nFederal prisoners' health care per person than we do for American \nIndians. We are not nearly meeting our responsibility. We are not even \nclose to keeping our promise, and nobody seems to care very much. There \nare people dying as a result of it, and still nobody seems to care very \nmuch.\n  We passed the Indian Health Care Improvement Act on the floor of the \nSenate recently. I am proud of that because it has been many years \nsince this Congress has addressed the issue of Indian health care. If \nthe funding available for Indian health care had kept pace with \ninflation, here on this chart is where we would be. Instead, we are \ndown here, dramatically underfunding the health care system for \nAmerican Indians, and as a result, we have full-scale health care \nrationing. It ought to be a scandal. It ought to be on the front page \nof the Washington Post, but it is not. It is a scandal, as far as I am \nconcerned. Health care rationing? That is unbelievable to me.\n  Let me describe this health care rationing, if I might. My colleagues \nhave heard me speak about this before when I talked about the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act, but repetition is fine, as far as I am \nconcerned, when you are talking about something this important.\n  Ardel Hale Baker was having a heart attack. She was a member of the \nthree affiliated tribes, the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Tribes. She \nis a member. She was having a heart attack. They put her in an \nambulance and sent her to a hospital 85 miles away. When she got to the \nhospital, they pulled her off of the ambulance gurney to put her in a \ngurney for the emergency room, and they found a piece of paper taped to \nher thigh. The piece of paper taped to her thigh said this, it said to \nthe hospital: This is Ardel Hale Baker. If you admit this patient to \nthe hospital, who is having a heart attack, by the way, understand you \nprobably will not be paid for it because there is no contract health \nfunding left for this individual Indian.\n  So Ardel Hale Baker is having a heart attack, and she is wheeled into \nan emergency room with a piece of paper taped to her thigh that says: \nOh, by the way, hospital, admit this woman, and you may not be paid.\n  I described the need for Indian health care in the names of two \nchildren, one 5, one age 14, both dead. Let me tell my colleagues about \nthem, as I have before. If, after we understand these issues that are \ngoing on all around the country in Indian Country, we still say there \nis no need here and it doesn't matter, then there is something \ncoldhearted about this institution.\n  Let me describe Ta'shon Rain Littlelight. This beautiful young girl \nloved to dance, as you can see from the costume. She used to go to the \npowwows and dance. She was 5 years old and very sick. She was taken to \nthe Indian health clinic again and again and again and again. They \ndiagnosed her illness; depression, they said. So this 5-year-old girl \nwas treated for depression. Then one day she could not bear the pain \nany longer. They took her to Billings, MT.\n  By the way, she was on the Crow Reservation in Montana. The way I \nknow about this young girl is her grandmother came to a hearing I held \nwith Senator Tester on the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana, and she \nheld up a poster this big with a picture of her grandchild, and she \ndescribed her death.\n  After being treated for depression, after going to the clinic time \nand time again and being treated for depression, one day she couldn't \nbear the pain, and they rushed her to Billings, MT, to a hospital \nthere, and then they rushed her to Denver, CO, to a hospital there, and \nthey said she had 4 months to live because she had terminal cancer--\nthis, after having been treated for depression for so many months.\n\n  Ta'shon Rain Littlelight said to her mom when they were in Denver \nthat the one thing she wanted to do was to go see Cinderella's Castle \nat Disney World. The Make A Wish Foundation\n\n[[Page S1938]]\n\ntook this little girl and her mother to Disney World in Orlando, FL, to \nsee Cinderella's Castle. The night before, in the hotel, as they \narrived in Orlando, the night before visiting Cinderella's Castle, \nTa'shon Rain Littlelight said to her mother: Mommy, I am sorry I am \nsick. Mother, I am going to try to get better. She cuddled up in her \nmom's arms and never again woke up. She died in her mother's arms the \nnight before she was to see Cinderella's Castle.\n  Her family told me this little girl spent the last 3 months of her \nlife in unmedicated pain with a terminal illness, diagnosed as having \ndepression. Her grandmother and her parents wonder, with decent health \ncare, would this young girl have died? Would Ta'shon Rain Littlelight \nperhaps have lived? Maybe so.\n  Does it matter that a 5-year-old girl dies because she doesn't get \nthe health care most all of us would expect? It does to me.\n  There was a 14-year-old girl named Avis Littlewind. She was on the \nSpirit Lake Nation Reservation. I talked to her family. I talked to her \nclassmates in school. I talked to the Indian tribal council. I did that \nbecause Avis Littlewind was a 14-year-old girl who spent the last 3 \nmonths of her life curled up in her bed in a fetal position, \ndesperately ill, desperately emotionally ill, with no treatment \nwhatsoever. At the end of that 90 days, she took her own life in her \nbedroom.\n  Her sister had taken her own life 2 years prior. Her father had taken \nhis life. She came from a very dysfunctional situation. But somehow a \n14-year-old girl is not missed for 90 days? Not in school? On that \nreservation, they didn't have any mental health treatment capability. \nThey told me they would have had to borrow--had someone known that Avis \nLittlewind, this child, was lying in bed for 90 days feeling hopeless \nand helpless, before she took her life--had they been able to find some \nmental health treatment somewhere, they would have had to borrow a car \nbecause there is no vehicle to take someone to treatment. It is a \ncompletely dysfunctional system.\n  These are two children who should not have died among us, but they \ndid, and others will--perhaps today--because we have a health care \nsystem in the Indian Health Service that is not working. It is \ndramatically underfunded.\n  My colleagues who oppose the bill on the floor of the Senate \nrecently, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act--a couple of my \ncolleagues who voted against the act said we need reform but we are \ngoing to vote for additional funding. We are at least $2 billion short \nof just providing the kind of thing we would expect for us and our \nfamily.\n  Let me ask you this: If your aunt or your grandmother went to a \ndoctor with bone-on-bone in a knee, so she couldn't even walk, it was \nso painful, a knee condition that was so unbelievably painful she could \nhardly move, what would we expect? Our families would expect she would \nget a knee operation and perhaps a new knee joint, have a replacement \nwith a new knee.\n  I will tell you what happened to a woman who contacted me from the \nIndian Health Service. She went to the doctor with this unbelievable \npain and the inability to move. She was told to wrap that knee in \ncabbage leaves for 4 days and it would be fine. That is not medicine, \nthat is malpractice. What we would expect for our family would be to \nhave a knee replacement. That is the kind of medicine we would expect. \nIt is not the kind of medicine that is now being delivered.\n  Yes, there are some good people in the Indian Health Service. There \nare some who should not be there as well. There are people who work \nhard and long hours and do a great job, and my hat is off to them. \nThere are some who, long ago, should have been fired, and no one seems \nwilling or able to do it.\n  In this case, I say people are dying because we are rationing health \ncare. That is a scandal.\n  I have offered an amendment that would restore $1 billion to this \naccount. The money would be paid for by--I believe it is function 920 \nthat will provide the payment for this. The question is, Will we decide \nthis is a requirement, this is a responsibility? I don't know the \nanswer to that. I have tried before. I guess some are willing to just \nblithely go along and act as if this doesn't exist, people are not \ndying, people are not suffering, or if they believe it exists, to say: \nYou know what, it is a tough life out there, it happens. We don't have \nthe funding.\n  It would have been nice, perhaps, to have told those first Americans, \nthe American Indians, when they sat down at the table and signed the \ntreaty and expected the Federal Government, the United States of \nAmerica, to keep its promise--it would have been nice, perhaps, when \nthe American Government signed it if they had just said: Look, we are \ngoing to try really hard, but we are not sure we can do what we are \npromising you we will do. We will do our best, but we are not sure we \ncan do that.\n  We don't have the money, apparently, to help Ta'shon Rain Littlelight \nor Avis Littlewind, and we don't have the resources or the will, I \nguess. That is what we are told. I happen to know how much money we \nhave to build health clinics in Iraq. I happen to know we are building \n950 water projects in Iraq right now. I know how many electricity \nprojects we are building in the country of Iraq. I know how much we are \nspending on road projects in the country of Iraq right now.\n  I went to a hearing yesterday and heard that $18 billion, most of it \nAmerican money, is unaccounted for in Iraq and wasted. I went to a \nhearing yesterday to hear that $4 billion, most of it American money in \nIraq to provide for additional equipment for Iraq's armed forces, is \nunaccounted for, and the head of their military who could not account \nfor $4 million is now living in London, a big property holder. So don't \ntell me there is not money. How about taking some of that money and \ninvesting it here at home? How about taking some of that money and \ndeciding to take care of our obligations and our commitments and our \npromises in this country?\n  We are going to have a long, tortured trail over this budget. I \nunderstand it. Everybody has their own sense of what is important and \nwhat is not. But if the health care for children and elders on our \nIndian reservations, for whom we have a trust responsibility for health \ncare, with whom we have treaties--if that is not an urgency, if that is \nnot something we are willing to commit to do, then, in my judgment, \nthere is something wrong with the value system here.\n  I know there are so many other priorities. I look at this S. Con. \nRes. 70. It doesn't contain much but numbers. It is 69 pages of \nnumbers. There are no jobs in here. There is no blood here. There is no \nhealth care here. It is just numbers. But all of these numbers mean \nsomething in a profound way. These numbers tell the American people \nwhat our priorities are and whether we are willing to keep our \npromises. I hope the answer from the Senate at last, at long, long \nlast, is we will begin--at least begin to keep our promises.\n  If you few decide you want health care to continue as it is with \nrespect to Indian Health Services, then you must stand up for saying: I \nbelieve in health care rationing; we are going to make a decision to \nwithhold health care from people who need it.\n  The Indian Health Service--let me give an example, on the Fort \nBerthold Reservation, you go to a clinic that is open from 9 to 5 \no'clock 5 days a week. You get sick on Saturday at 6 o'clock, or at \nnight on a weekday, you are in trouble. You are 85 miles from the \nhospital.\n  So you go to the hospital in an ambulance that is paid for with \ncontract health care, because they do not have that kind of capability \non the reservation. So contract health care. What do they say on Indian \nreservations? Do not get sick after June, because there is no contract \nhealth money. If you are going to get sick, it has got to be before \nJune. If you get sick, otherwise you end up on a gurney with a heart \nattack with a piece of paper attached to your leg. And the paper says: \nBy the way, hospital, admit this woman and you may not get paid.\n  That is an unbelievable way for us to meet our obligations. The fact \nis, we are not keeping our promises. I hope somewhere in the long trail \nof paper, somewhere in the deep abyss of all of these numbers, perhaps \nthere is a value system, somewhere there is a value system deep in the \nrecesses that will get people here in the Senate to say:\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\nYou know what, one of the first obligations of this country is to keep \nits promises. One of the first obligations of the Senate is to stand \nup. It is too late for Ta'shon Rain Littlelight, it is too late for \nAvis Littlewind, but other children will survive and other children \nwill live if we decide to do the right thing.\n  Now, I wish to say to my colleagues that I would like to offer this \namendment. I am told that at some point I will be able to. If I can \nhave a dialog with them, I wish to find out----\n  Mr. CONRAD. We can do that perhaps momentarily. We have worked out \nwhat we would like to be the order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4204\n\n  I send an amendment that is the side by side to the Bunning amendment \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4204.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4204) is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To add a deficit-neutral reserve fund for repealing the 1993 \n        increase in the income tax on Social Security benefits)\n\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR REPEALING THE 1993 \n                   INCREASE IN THE INCOME TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   BENEFITS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other levels in this resolution for one or \n     more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, motions, or \n     conference reports that would repeal the 1993 increase in the \n     income tax on Social Security benefits, by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for such purpose, provided that \n     such legislation would not increase the deficit over either \n     the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 through 2013 or \n     the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 through 2018.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Next, Senator Gregg will have an opportunity to send up \nSenator Specter's amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4203\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask that the amendment for Senator \nSpecter be called up. It is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for Mr. \n     Specter, for himself, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n     Casey, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Dole, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Clinton, \n     Mr. Levin, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n     Menendez, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Durbin, \n     Mr. Stevens, Mr. Smith, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n     Cardin, and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4203.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4203) is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for the National Institutes of Health and \n             the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program)\n\n       On page 19, line 16, increase the amount by $2,100,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 17, increase the amount by $2,100,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 16, increase the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 17, increase the amount by $700,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 21, increase the amount by $280,000,000.\n       On page 21, line 25, increase the amount by $20,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $3,100,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $2,800,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, decrease the amount by $280,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 25, decrease the amount by $20,000,000.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that after Senator Dorgan sends \nhis amendment to the desk, that then Senator Alexander will be \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. With one alteration, if I could, that we would--if you \nrecall, we talked about this--I would then discuss the side by side to \nBunning, then the Alexander group would be recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then the next amendment would be Senator Alexander.\n  Mr. CONRAD. After I give brief remarks on the side by side I have \nsent up. Senator Dorgan can offer his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4198\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have an amendment I have filed. It is amendment No. \n4198. It is at the desk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4198.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4198) is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the Indian Health Service by $1 billion in FY \n                                 2009)\n\n       On page 19, line 16, increase the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 17, increase the amount by $915,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 21, increase the amount by $70,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 25, increase the amount by $10,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 4, increase the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $1,000,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $915,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, decrease the amount by $70,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 25, decrease the amount by $10,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 4, decrease the amount by $5,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have described my amendment at some \nlength. I shall not do so again. But I do appreciate the courtesy of my \ncolleagues, Senator Conrad and Senator Gregg.\n  I ask that as you consider what you would intend to vote on as we \nmove along this process, that you will give me the opportunity to have \na recorded vote as early as is possible.\n  Mr. CONRAD. By the sequence we have gone through, we have gotten you \nin the queue. And so that will be--as we work down the amendments that \nhave already been in order, yours is now in order. And that will be the \norder that is followed. So the Senator can expect when we turn to \namendments, yours will be in line. We very much appreciate the \nextraordinary courtesy of the Senator from North Dakota, who, as I \nknow, has had to wait a couple of times here because of various snafus. \nWe apologize to him and thank him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would ask the Senator from North \nDakota or New Hampshire to restate what his unanimous consent request \nis of the order to be pursued.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as I understand it, the sequence would be, \nof the amendments just offered, that the side by side for Senator \nBunning of Senator Conrad, followed by Senator Specter, followed by \nSenator Dorgan, followed by Senator Alexander, who has not yet sent his \nto the desk.\n  In the intervening period, I understand the chairman wishes to take \nsome time. That is my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is precisely correct. I thank my colleague. I will \ntake a few minutes to describe the side by side to the Bunning \namendment earlier offered.\n  The Bunning amendment would repeal the 1993 increases on Social \nSecurity benefits--tax increases on Social Security benefits. The \namendment would offset the $89 billion 5-year cost with reductions to \nfunction 920. What does that mean? Mandatory 920 offsets would lead to \nan across-the-board cut in all mandatory programs, programs such as \nSocial Security and Medicare. I do not think that is the intention of \nthe Senator.\n  If discretionary 920s were offset, it would reduce programs affecting \neducation, veterans health, homeland security, and law enforcement. In \naddition, the amendment would remove a dedicated source of revenue \nthrough\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\nthe Medicare trust funds, adding to the financial problems of that key \nprogram.\n  Our alternative, the alternative I have sent to the desk, would \nprovide for a reserve fund that would allow for the repeal of the 1993 \nincrease on Social Security benefits in a way that would protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare, and not increase the deficit over the period of \nthe resolution.\n  The budget resolution already includes a reserve fund with the \nprimary purpose of providing a mechanism for enacting tax relief, \nprovided it is paid for. This alternative would establish a new \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund that specifically highlights repeal of the \n1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits.\n  Over the 5-year period covered by this resolution, the cost of \nrepealing the 1993 tax increase is about $89 billion as I earlier \nreferenced. We have already acknowledged in the course of the debate on \nthe resolution we have to limit ourselves when it comes to additional \nspending or additional tax cuts, because we need to balance the budget.\n  There are places we can go to cut spending or to raise revenue. I \nhave addressed those repeatedly in terms of the tax gap, the offshore \ntax havens, and abusive tax shelters.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the alternative that I have sent to \nthe desk that would not lead to a cut in Medicare or Social Security or \nother elements I identified.\n  With that, we would be prepared to go to Senator Alexander for the \npresentation of his amendment. I see Senator Alexander is in the \nChamber. Would the Senator like a moment, or would the Senator prefer \nto proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would be happy to proceed. Senator Domenici is going \nto join me in making our presentation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator and indicate that the intention would \nbe, after Senator Alexander and Senator Domenici--Senator Alexander, do \nyou have anyone else whom you wish to speak on your amendment?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, there is no other Senator whom I know \nwishes to speak at this moment. Senator Domenici will be to the floor \nshortly.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wish to indicate that after you have presented, the \nintention was to go to Senator Kennedy for the purposes of offering an \namendment. Senator Salazar is here.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I was going to \nspeak in connection with the estate tax amendment the Senator offered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Very well. I offered it in the Senator's name. It is very \nappropriate that he is here to speak on it.\n  Senator Alexander, could you tell us how much time you and Senator \nDomenici may consume?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will consume not more than 20 minutes. I would \nassume Senator Domenici would consume not more than 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could we then have an agreement that those two Senators \nhave up to 40 minutes combined, 20 minutes to Senator Alexander, 20 \nminutes to Senator Domenici; at the end of that time, which would be at \n1:40, that Senator Salazar be recognized.\n  How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, so that the Senator from Colorado be recognized for \n15 minutes at that time. That would take us to roughly 1:55, and \nSenator Kennedy be recognized for 15 minutes at that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me add to that, after Senator Kennedy, then Senator \nBiden be recognized for 10 minutes, not to offer an amendment but to \ntalk about an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4207\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his courtesy. Senator Domenici is here and Senator Salazar is here.\n  I send to the desk an amendment and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4207.\n\n  The amendment (No. 4207) is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to improve energy \n                       efficiency and production)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3___. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND TO IMPROVE ENERGY \n                   EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), the Chairman of \n     the Senate Committee on the Budget may revise the \n     allocations, aggregates, and other levels in this resolution \n     by the amounts provided by a bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report that would \n     encourage--\n       (1) consumers to replace old conventional wood stoves with \n     new clean wood, pellet, or corn stoves certified by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (2) consumers to install smart electricity meters in homes \n     and businesses;\n       (3) the capture and storage of carbon dioxide emissions \n     from coal projects;\n       (4) the development of oil and natural gas resources \n     beneath the outer Continental Shelf; and\n       (5) the development of oil shale resources on public land \n     pursuant to section 369(d) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 \n     (42 U.S.C. 15927(d)), without regard to section 433 of the \n     Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act, 2008 (Public Law 110-161).\n       (b) Deficit Neutrality.--Subsection (a) applies only if the \n     legislation described in subsection (a) would not increase \n     the deficit over the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2013 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2018.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I ask the Senator to withhold for 1 moment for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will be happy to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4196, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate the Senator's courtesy.\n  Senator Salazar's amendment was earlier sent to the desk. He wishes \nto modify his amendment. It has no effect on the policy, on the \nnumbers, or the effect of the amendment. It is just language. I wonder \nif we would allow that to go forward?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this amendment No. 4196?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct. He is asking unanimous consent to modify \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ESTATE TAX REFORM INITIATIVE.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the aggregates, allocations and other appropriate \n     levels in this resolution for a bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report that provides up to \n     $45,000,000,000 in tax relief over the period of the total of \n     the fiscal years 2008 through 2013 for additional estate tax \n     reforms that address the current flaws in the estate tax law \n     in order to protect families, family businesses, and family \n     farms and ranches from the estate tax, by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for such purpose, provided that \n     such legislation would not increase the deficit over either \n     the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 through 2013 or \n     the period of the total of fiscal years 2008 through 2018.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleagues. I again thank Senator Alexander \nfor his courtesy.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we are talking this week about the \nFederal budget. Senator Gregg, Senator Grassley, and others have \npointed out, with appropriate response from the Senator from North \nDakota, that in our belief we will wreck the Federal budget by raising \ntaxes and increasing debt.\n  At the same time we have an obligation on our side to say what our \nplan is, and we have a progrowth Republican plan which we have been \ndetailing this week which focuses on lower taxes, less government, \nlower energy costs, making health insurance affordable for every \nAmerican, without the Government choosing your doctor, support for \nbetter schools, the support for the kind of investments it takes to \nincrease science and technology. That has been\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\nour plan. That has been our progrowth economic plan to help balance the \nfamily budget.\n  So while they would wreck the Federal budget, we would help balance \nthe family budget, and no part of that would be more important than \ndealing with energy costs. Energy costs to most American families \nworried about the family budget come down to $3.50 gasoline or electric \nbills that might be constantly rising. We have the goal of making sure \nthat in this Nation, which consumes 25 percent of all the energy in the \nworld, that we have a realistic policy for making sure we have a low-\ncost supply of clean electricity, dealing with the clean air issues--\nnitrogen, sulfur, and mercury--and with the climate change issue, \ncarbon, that we have a low-cost supply of clean electricity and that we \ngradually begin to reduce our dependence on foreign oil so we can clean \nup our environment, No. 1, and so we can stop shipping billions of \ndollars to people who are not friends of the United States, and so we \ncan lower the price of gasoline over time to help balance the family \nbudget.\n  We will have other opportunities during this year to offer proposals \nfor keeping energy costs low, realistic proposals, not proposals that \nfit some desert island which uses electricity occasionally but for the \nUnited States which uses 25 percent of all the energy in the world and \nwhose demand for energy is growing, not declining.\n  For example, in my part of the country, in Tennessee, we have the \nTennessee Valley Authority, which is the largest utility in the \ncountry. It covers several States. They operate at about 27,000 \nmegawatts all the time. Sometimes they go as high as 33,000 megawatts. \nThat is 33 big, new nuclear powerplants and twice that many gas or coal \nplants. All that electricity for our local region is supplied by the \nTennessee Valley Authority.\n  So we have selected five different proposals which would create a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to lower energy costs for families by \nencouraging energy efficiency on the one hand and increasing oil and \nnatural gas supply on the other. There are only two ways we can reduce \nthe price of gasoline or electricity. One is to increase the supply and \nthe other is to reduce the demand. There are other ideas, but \nparticularly in a big economy, that is what we need to do.\n  No. 1, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, has suggested one way to \nincrease the supply of clean electricity would be to allow the Finance \nCommittee or the Energy Committee to encourage the use of biomass by \nenacting legislation that would encourage the replacement of old, pre-\n1920s wood stoves with new EPA-certified wood pellet or corn stoves, \nEnvironmental Protection Agency certified. These new EPA-certified \nstoves will help families save money on heating bills because the new \nstoves are up to 50 percent more fuel efficient than the old stoves. \nGiven the rise of oil and natural gas prices, this idea would produce \nsavings that would be much appreciated by families in Maine, all of New \nEngland, and in much of America.\n  Secondly, the amendment allows the Finance Committee or the Energy \nCommittee to encourage energy efficiency by enacting legislation that \nrewards the installation of smart electricity meters in homes and \nbusinesses. Let me give an example of what I mean by that. With this \nchart, we see how electricity is generated in America today. This is \nthe reality. Half of it comes from coal, 19 percent from nuclear power, \n7 from hydroelectric, 1.4 from biomass--that is what Senator Collins is \ntalking about--and 20 percent from gas. We don't want the gas to go up \nbecause when it does, the price of natural gas goes up, and our \nchemical companies move to other parts of the world. Farmers pay four \ntimes as much for fertilizer. So we need to look for another way to \ncreate clean electricity. The first way to do that is through \nconservation.\n  Let me take the hometown example of Tennessee. The TVA is a big \nutility, maybe the biggest in the country, $10 billion of revenue a \nyear. I saw an article in the newspaper that said if we have plug-in \nhybrid cars, we will create a lot more pollution because we will have \nto build new plants such as coal plants. That is dead wrong because the \nTennessee Valley Authority, even though it operates at 27,000 megawatts \non the average every day, that is between 3 and 7 o'clock when we are \nall turning on lights, coming home from work, using our electricity. \nThe TVA has lots of spare electricity to use at night, 7 or 8,000 \nmegawatts. That is 7 or 8 nuclear plants for the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority. We could plug in our hybrid cars in the middle of the night \nwithout building another new nuclear plant, another new coal plant, \nanother new any kind of plant because we have excess capacity in our \nregion and so does virtually every other part of the country. We \nencourage consumers to use smart meters so they know that electricity \nis going to cost more between 4 and 7 o'clock and less at night.\n  Then if the car companies wanted to develop a plug-in hybrid car with \nadvanced battery technology, we can operate on that electricity and \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil without building any new plants \nfor that purpose. So that is the second proposal we have. The same \napplies to water heaters. People have their water heaters on at all \ntimes. Any utility should be able to make an agreement with the Senator \nfrom New Jersey or the Senator from Tennessee or from Colorado to say: \nTurn your water heater over to me and some of your other appliances, \nand I will turn them off and on at peak hours so your electric bill \nwill stay flat or go down. We could save enormous amounts of \nelectricity and avoid building new plants. That is what this amendment \nwould do.\n  This would permit us to clean up existing coal plants. Here is how we \nwould propose to do that. Forty-nine percent of our electricity is \nproduced by coal. We are the Saudi Arabia of coal. Other countries in \nthe world are building coal plants because it is the technology they \nknow how to build. Some people are putting up large wind turbines. We \nare spending $11 billion of taxpayer money on wind turbines, but it is \nhard to find wind turbines on this list for the United States because \nit doesn't produce much energy. But coal does. What we need to do is \nclean up the coal production. This amendment would allow the relevant \ncommittees of Congress to give tax credits to recapture the carbon that \ncomes from coal. A great many people are concerned about climate change \nand the use of carbon. This would help meet that demand in a realistic \nway in the near term.\n  A fourth idea: I said earlier there are two ways to lower the price \nof $3.50 gasoline. One is more supply, and one is less demand. The \nadvanced battery technology car, the plug-in hybrid car that runs more \non electricity than it does on oil, will help reduce demand. We have a \nproposal for that direction. Another proposal--and I am sure the \nSenator from New Mexico will want to say something about this--is the \nidea of, in appropriate places, using our existing oil and gas that \nexists offshore. Two years ago, the Senator from New Mexico, then \nchairman of the Energy Committee, pushed through legislation that \npermitted us to expand drilling in lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico for \noil and gas. We took some of those revenues and helped mitigate some of \nthe problems that exist on the coast; in other words, used it for \nconservation purposes. For the first time, we put some of those \nrevenues into the land and water conservation fund on a permanent \nbasis, which has been a 40-year goal of the conservation community.\n  The Senator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar, was key to that effort. I am \nproud of that bipartisan effort. We could do more of that. This \namendment doesn't specify exactly what we would do. That would be up to \nthe authorizing committees. But an example of the next step might be to \nallow the State of Virginia, as it has asked Congress to permit it to \ndo, to go 50 miles out and look for gas and then take half the revenue \nand put it in a trust fund for the State of Virginia to improve beach \nnourishment or to keep taxes down or to have a trust fund so the \nalready excellent higher education system can be among the best in the \nworld. If I were Governor of Virginia, I would want to do that. I was \nGovernor of Tennessee, and we don't have an ocean. But many States do. \nIf they asked for that and if they can produce more oil and gas, which \nwill lower the price of $3.50 gasoline, then they ought to be allowed \nto do so.\n  Finally, oil shale development--the Senator from New Mexico will \ndirect\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\nmore of his attention to the oil shale development issue--the amendment \nwould allow the Energy Committee to enact legislation that would \nincrease domestic oil supplies by allowing the development of oil shale \ndeposits in green basins in Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming.\n  So what we have suggested is an amendment that is sponsored by \nRepublicans, but we hope it is compelling enough to attract a great \nmany Democrats to support it. It is an amendment that will help balance \nthe family budget by lowering the cost of energy. It would be the \nCollins amendment to help use biomass--wood pellets, corn--in more \nefficient stoves in New England and other parts of America. It would be \nto create incentives for electricity meters, smart meters which could \nmake more effective use of hybrid cars or water heaters and avoid \nbuilding dozens of new powerplants. It would create room for the \ncreation of incentives to allow existing coal plants to deal with \ncarbon. If we want to deal with climate change in this generation, we \nhave to deal realistically with the coal plants we have today which are \nproducing one-half of the electricity we use in this country or 12.5 \npercent of all the electricity that is used in the world. To lower the \ncost of gasoline and natural gas or to stabilize it, we want to create \nnew supply in two ways: By, in appropriate instances, allowing offshore \ndrilling. We would suggest, not in this legislation but as the \ncommittee works on it, that it be offshore 30 or 50 miles and that the \nroyalties go to conservation purposes or to the States. The final idea \nwas to use our oil in shale.\n  In conclusion, there is one glaring omission in this set of five \nrecommendations that we have made, and we need to work on it. The \nSenator from New Mexico is the leading Senator on this subject, but we \ndon't have anything in our amendment about nuclear energy. I believe it \nis important to repeat, every time we talk about electricity, if we \nwant to talk about realism, the United States, in the next 10 years, \nhaving control of mercury, having control of sulfur and nitrogen so it \ndoesn't create health problems, and dealing with climate change in this \ngeneration, that after conservation, nuclear power is the only real \ntechnology we have today for that purpose.\n  We do want to recapture carbon from coal, but we cannot do that in a \nwholesale way yet. We will never be able to put up enough wind turbines \nto make much of a difference. Someday maybe solar thermal powerplants \nmay make a difference. But if we are talking about the next 10 or 12 \nyears, nuclear power will make the difference.\n  Here is why I am saying that. As shown on this chart, this is the \nclean electricity generated in the United States of America last year. \nSixty-six percent of the clean electricity--meaning electricity with no \nsulfur, no nitrogen, no mercury, and no carbon--came from nuclear \npower, a technology we invented in the United States in the 1950s, that \nour Navy has used without one single incident in submarines since the \n1950s; nuclear power that has now been adopted by France: 80 percent of \ntheir electricity is nuclear power; nuclear power that has been adopted \nby Japan: They build a new nuclear plant every year or so.\n  We appropriated $5 billion to lend to Westinghouse in this body to \nhelp China build nuclear powerplants. When are we going to get serious \nabout cleaning up the air?\n  So we have ideas about that--not in this proposal. One would be to \nreprocess the waste, reduce it by 95 percent, so we can store it more \nsafely. That is one idea. Another idea would be giving increased \ncredits for the production of nuclear power. If we were to subsidize \nnuclear power by the kilowatt hour in way proportional to how we \nsubsidize wind, we would be subsidizing nuclear power with about $340 \nbillion a year.\n  So the Republican proposal to help balance the family budget on lower \nenergy costs has five general areas as part of a reserve fund the \nappropriate committees can make a difference with. They have to do with \nconservation, and they have to do with increasing this supply. But what \nit means is, these are realistic ways to deal with the $3.50-a-gallon \ngas price and realistic ways to make sure we have large amounts of \nclean electricity, so we can deal with clean air as well as climate \nchange in the near term instead of some later time.\n  This is a real proposal and not a fairytale. This is for the country \nthat produces 25 percent of all the energy in the world and not for \nsome desert island. This will help balance the family budget. We hope \nit earns strong Democratic support as well as Republican support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. The next speaker is the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, the long-time chairman of the Energy Committee as well \nas the Budget Committee and the leading spokesman for nuclear power in \nthe Senate.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I wish to correct the record, if the Senator from Tennessee has no \nobjection. The lease we modified, which had a moratorium on it in the \noffshore, was lease 181. I believe the Senator said: 187. I would not \ncorrect it, but it is commonly known as 181, so I thought we should fix \nit.\n  I am not going to speak very long because the truth of the matter is, \nthe distinguished Senator, Mr. Alexander, has done a marvelous job \nexplaining this package. Everybody should know we Republicans tried, on \na budget resolution, to come up with some ideas. Some of them are \nsimple, but all of them are good. All of them will do some significant \ngood for the energy problems that confront everyday people and that \nconfront the budgets of everyday people.\n  It is good we sit down and say: Well, even though this is a budget \nresolution, can we come up with some things that will be helpful? I \nthink we have. This amendment he has put in will attempt to bring down \nthe price of gasoline, which would have the biggest effect on family \nbudgets. As he says, we are looking at ways to help the family budget, \nwhile the Democratic budget we are on is going to wreck the Federal \nbudget.\n  What I am going to do is talk about, quickly, things I see in this \namendment that are important. First of all, as the price of gasoline at \nthe pump continues to rise, and our level of dependence on unstable \nforeign regions continues to rise, we must take action every \nopportunity we get. But instead, when the majority has chosen to take \naction on their own--and they had a chance a couple months ago--they \nhave taken action that moves things in the wrong direction.\n  Consider the Omnibus appropriations bill from last year. Hidden \nwithin those hundreds of pages, without transparency, were provisions \nthat could have a profound negative effect on the Nation's energy \nsecurity.\n  First, it contained a 1-year moratorium on final regulations on oil \nshale. This little amendment my good friend Senator Alexander has \noffered says that regulation change--which was made in the back room, \nnot open to daylight, not part of debate--be removed.\n  I suggest we have already, in the Omnibus Energy bill, provided \nwhatever the citizens of this country need as protection--environmental \nprotection and the like--for this shale development. We have a company, \nShell Oil, that is spending a huge amount of money onsite to see if \nthey can find a way to convert this shale oil so it can be used as part \nof America's ever-growing need for oil and related products. We should \nnot have put a moratorium on final regulations in an appropriations \nbill. So it takes that away.\n  Secondly, in that same appropriations bill--in the dark of night, \nwithout being open to public discussion--a $4,000 fee was added to \npermits for drilling for oil. The Senate did not know anything about \nit. We have not debated it. It is the wrong direction. When you are \nproducing something, you do not add more cost to the production and \nhope to get more. When you add a secret $4,000 fee, you cause less \nproduction, not more. This amendment does the right thing and says, \nopenly and publicly: We want to address it. We take that $4,000 fee off \nbecause it never should have been there. It is moving in the wrong \ndirection.\n\n  According to the Department of Interior, the oil shale in the United \nStates is the equivalent of 1.23 trillion barrels of oil. As we import \nmillions of barrels of oil and send $400 billion this year to\n\n[[Page S1943]]\n\nunstable regions of the world, the majority chooses to make it more \ndifficult to produce American resources.\n  With the second provision, the majority chooses to increase the costs \non small producers in my home State and others by putting this $4,000 \npermit fee on the drilling using ordinary rigs to drill for oil. That \nshould not have been done, and we fix that.\n  The Alexander amendment takes a better approach than the majority \ndid. It removes the impediments to producing more of the subject matter \nthat will help us out of our dependence and makes things better for the \naverage American in due course.\n  One last thing I would mention as my last observation: In this bill, \nwe considered that on the Atlantic and Pacific side of the offshore \nwaters, we are leaving over 15 billion barrels of oil and over 50 \ntrillion cubic feet of natural gas in the ground. As we debate about \nthe price impact of 60,000 barrels per day being put in the strategic \npetroleum reserve--our Nation's energy security asset--we leave over 1 \nmillion barrels per day locked up underground in Arctic Alaska, and we \nhave allowed about 15 billion barrels of oil to remain locked up under \nour ocean.\n  The Alexander amendment does only what it can do, but it seeks to \nrevisit the debate on domestic production in light of these new facts \nand new costs facing Americans.\n  The amendment also seeks to improve the efficiency and cleanliness of \nthe way we produce and use electricity. The Senator has explained that \nas much as it needs to be, and better than I can, so I will say no \nmore.\n  This amendment overall does not do all that we need to do to \nstrengthen our Nation's energy security, but it is a vast progrowth \nimprovement over the approach laid out by the majority in two \nprovisions which I have talked about, and then we have added an \nadditional three that are good and will help the American people.\n  I wish to close by saying, I am firmly convinced the American people \nare being hurt every day. We are being made poorer--day by day, week by \nweek, month by month, year by year--because the cost of oil has gone up \nso high. Yet we have not been able to minimize our dependence, although \nwe passed some very formidable laws to address it in time, in due \ncourse. But for now we continue to use more than we did last year and \nmore than we did the year before. At $100-plus a barrel, there is no \nquestion we are not adjusting to that very well.\n  We must do everything we can to avoid that continued use. This \namendment will do a little bit. If the committees that are charged with \nand given jurisdiction were to pass it, it would help. In the meantime, \nthere is no question we should seek every opportunity to minimize our \ndependence upon foreign oil so as to permit our economy to grow again \nand become powerful again. This Senator is fearful we are going in the \nwrong direction, principally because oil is too expensive, and we must \nimport too much of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the Senator for permitting \nme to join him in his amendment today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4196, as Modified\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on \namendment No. 4196, as modified, which Senator Conrad offered for me \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, my amendment is a very simple amendment. \nIt deals with the estate tax. What it does is set aside a deficit \nreserve fund that will protect family businesses and family farms and \nranches from the estate tax. It is a straightforward amendment that \nwill address the complexity of the changing estate tax law that we \ncurrently face.\n  Let me say at the outset that when one looks at what we are facing \nwith respect to the estate tax in the years ahead, I think it is clear \nwe must act to provide certainty to people with respect to their \nestates and to deal with issues that have been raised by Senators on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle as well as Senators on the Republican \nside of the aisle.\n  It is clear, when you look at what is happening now with respect to \ncurrent law--in 2007 and 2008, you have an effective exemption of $2 \nmillion and a top tax rate of 45 percent. When you look at the year \n2009, under current law, we are looking at an effective exemption of \n$3.5 million and a 45-percent top tax rate. Then, in 2010, for that \nyear, it is completely repealed, so there is no estate tax. Then, in \n2011 and thereafter, you are looking at a framework of law that will \neffectively provide a $1 million exemption, and then we will have what \nis a 55-percent taxable rate, plus a potential 5-percent surtax, with \nrespect to estates.\n  The reality of it is, no one knows when they are going to die. We do \nnot know whether it is a 2008 event--2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 or 2013. So \nthis is an area of the law which we must fix.\n\n  I am proud of the fact that our chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Baucus, has started to hold hearings on the estate tax. We had \none this morning in which we heard different concepts of how estates \nare taxed in places such as Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and \ndifferent approaches to dealing with this issue. So I am hopeful as we \nmove forward in the year ahead, we can find a bipartisan solution to \ndeal with the estate tax issue that faces us.\n  For me, as one Senator, there are three principles that I will keep \nin mind, and I hope we all will keep in mind. First is fiscal \nresponsibility. We have, in fact, as the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee has so often stated over the last 7 years, created this huge \nmountain of debt. I think it is important for us to abide by the pay-go \nprinciples which we have adopted in this Chamber so that as we are \ncreating new programs or as we are creating new tax cuts and we are \nfinding ways of paying for those deficits or for those programs that we \nare creating, this will all become part of, hopefully, what will be a \nnew wind that will blow upon Washington--that has started to blow upon \nWashington--as we need to be responsible with the fiscal resources of \nthe Government.\n  The second imperative for me as we move forward with the estate tax \nis that we deal with those estates that don't have liquidity, as \nhappens in the case of farmers and ranchers who sometimes have to split \nup their estates because of the fact that they can't find the money to \nbe able to pay off their estate tax. That does, in fact, happen. It \nhappens from time to time in my own State of Colorado. So I am hopeful \nwe will be able to create a law that will allow farmers and ranchers to \nstay on their land.\n  Thirdly, as I said at the beginning, there is no way anybody can \npredict when they are going to die. It is important for those looking \nahead at their own estates that there be some certainty with respect to \nthe law that will apply to their assets and to their estate. Our \namendment addresses all of those issues.\n  The estate tax is a complicated and intimidating law. It does need, \nin my view, serious reform. The Finance Committee will hold a number of \nhearings on this issue. The first amendment which Senator Baucus \noffered on a variety of middle-class tax cuts for Americans provides \nsome relief and some certainty to American families and small \nbusinesses by ensuring that there will be no increase in the estate tax \nthrough a permanent extension of the 2009 estate tax law. I am a proud \ncosponsor of that amendment. I believe the manner in which we address \nthe estate tax in that amendment is a minimal level of reform that the \nCongress can accomplish.\n  That is why I have introduced the amendment before us, which has \ncreated a deficit-neutral reserve fund for the purposes of providing \nadditional estate tax relief. The reserve fund will provide sufficient \nfunds to accommodate a proposal to raise the estate tax exemption to $5 \nmillion, indexed for inflation, and to lower the tax rate to 35 \npercent. But my amendment will not lock in the structure of the estate \ntax reform. It may be that we will need to provide additional relief \nand tailor the legislation in the Finance Committee in a manner that \neffectively addresses the needs of family farmers and ranchers and \nfamily businesses.\n  We also learned this morning in a hearing of the Senate Finance \nCommittee there are many options for us to consider as we move forward \nwith fixing the estate tax law. There are many\n\n[[Page S1944]]\n\noptions to estate tax reform, and we should continue to work our way \nthrough the process to identify the most appropriate way to move \nforward on a bipartisan basis. This morning's hearing was the second \nestate tax hearing we have held in the Finance Committee, and we will \nhold a third hearing on this matter in early April. We are working \nthrough the process. We are examining the challenges posed by the \ncurrent estate tax system, and we are considering a wide range of \nproposals to provide comprehensive, permanent, and fiscally responsible \nreform.\n  I remain committed to working with Chairman Baucus, Senator Conrad, \nand other colleagues on the Finance Committee and in the Senate for \nachieving meaningful reform in the near term. My amendment and the \namendment by Senator Baucus will help pave the way for that reform, and \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I also wish to spend a few minutes speaking to the Baucus amendment, \nof which I am an original cosponsor. That amendment by Senator Baucus \nwill take surplus funds in the budget resolution to make sure that we \nare taking care of the middle class of America as we move forward. What \nthat amendment does again is, it makes the permanent extension of the \n10-percent income tax bracket permanent. It addresses the extension of \nthe increased refundable child tax credit with additional eligibility \nfor lower income Americans and makes that permanent. It addresses the \nmarriage penalty tax relief provisions and makes that tax relief \nprovision permanent. It addresses the extension of the tax credit for \nchildcare expenses, and it makes that credit a permanent credit. It \naddresses the increased adoption tax credit and makes that permanent, \nand it also addresses the estate tax issues, as I mentioned earlier.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will support both the Baucus \namendment as well as the Salazar amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, is Senator Kyl seeking recognition?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thought I would like to respond to Senator \nSalazar while he is here, and I ask unanimous consent to have my time \ntaken off the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me speak for just a few minutes in \nresponse to my colleague from Colorado because earlier today I offered \nan amendment which, as I gather, it would accomplish essentially the \nsame thing as the amendment of the Senator from Colorado.\n  My amendment explicitly would provide in the budget an accommodation \nfor an exempted amount of $5 million per spouse, for a total of $10 \nmillion, as part of the unified gift and estate tax exemption, and a \ntop rate not to exceed 35 percent. As I understand it, the amendment of \nthe Senator from Colorado would accommodate that same relief. I noted \nthat with my amendment we also ensured that the $5 million per person \nexempted amount was indexed for inflation. We provide a step up in \nbasis, the existing period of time to pay the tax. I presume, or I \nwould gather, that those same items are included in the Senator's \namendment, but he can respond to that.\n  I guess my point is that we have a difference between the amendment I \nhave offered and the amendment of the Senator from Colorado. There is \none difference between them, and that is this: Last year, we passed a \nsimilar amendment to the budget. No legislation was ever brought \nforward. Last year, the 10-percent tax bracket renewal or extension was \npassed unanimously, I believe, as part of the budget. The chairman of \nthe Finance Committee never brought forth legislation to deal with \nthat. He has advised me this year there will be no action on the death \ntax. We are going to have hearings, but there is not going to be any \naction on the Senate floor. I suspect that one of the reasons is \nbecause of the way he has approached it, the way the Senator from \nColorado has approached it, which is to put the Government before the \ntaxpayers; to say that before we can do any of this, we have to make \nsure the Government is made whole, which means we have to find a way to \n``pay for'' the tax. That is the language that has been used. We have \nto ``pay for'' the tax.\n  I ask, why should the American taxpayers have to pay for a reduction \nin their own taxes, if you start with the premise that the American \nworker earns money, and we want the American family to keep as much \nmoney as possible in their own pockets so they can provide for the \nneeds of their families? Also, in this time of economic downturn, we \neven decided we would try to put more money in their pockets, urging \nthem to spend it as a way to try to stimulate the economy. I would \nthink we would start from the premise that the money belongs to the \ntaxpayers, and we want to allow taxpayers to keep as much of that money \nas possible.\n  If we are going to do taxes on one side, then we ought to hold them \nharmless; that is to say, if we believe their tax liability is too much \nor that a particular tax is wrong, as we believe that the estate tax \nis, that it is in desperate need of, if not repeal, at least \nsignificant reform, that the point is to reduce that estate tax burden \nand not to reduce it with one hand and then require a tax increase to \n``pay for'' it on the other hand. How have you helped the American \ntaxpayer if you say: We will reduce your taxes over here, but in order \nto keep the Government whole, we need to somehow make up the revenue \nfor the Government because it matters more than you do, and therefore \nwe are going to have to raise taxes on you someplace else in order to \n``pay for'' this tax relief. We don't do that when we pass a farm bill \naround here.\n  The baseline for the farm bill, what we spent this year, is something \njust under $600 billion. If we spent the same amount of money on the \nfarm bill next year, we would not have to ``pay for'' any of that. We \nwould only have to ``pay for'' an increase. Yet if we are going to \nextend an existing tax rate, say, the 10-percent bracket of the \namendment of the Senator from Colorado, the idea is somehow we have to \npay for that, even though it is exactly the same bracket it is today. \nIf we are going to extend the capital gains rate or the dividends rate \nor any other marginal rates, keep them exactly the same as they are \ntoday, why should we have to raise taxes permanently someplace else in \norder to ``pay for'' that? You only get to that conclusion if you think \nthe Federal Government is more important than taxpayers.\n  Well, the way our country was founded is based on, ``We, the \npeople.'' We created the Government. The Government is supposed to \nserve us, not the other way around. So you don't start from the premise \nthat somehow, the Government has an amount of money today and no matter \nwhat happens, no matter how much we want to provide tax relief for \npeople, the Government still has to have the same amount of money. So \nif we are going to provide tax relief for people, somehow we have to \nmake up the money that we give back to the people.\n\n  If you want to provide tax relief for people, the whole idea is that \nthey don't have to pay for it in some other way. They get to keep the \nmoney. We trust them to spend it. That is the fundamental difference I \nhave with the amendment of the Senator from Colorado.\n  If the terms with respect to the amount exempted and the rate is the \nsame--and I presume it would be--the question is, are we ever going to \nact on it?\n  My amendment will be acted on this year one way or another. We are \nnot just going to pass it in the budget as we have in the past. This \nisn't just going to be a show exercise where we all vote on the budget \nto cut taxes, but the cuts never really materialize. Why don't they \never materialize? Because the majority doesn't bring a bill to the \nSenate floor and try to get the bill passed. If the bill doesn't pass, \nthe President doesn't sign it, and there is no tax relief.\n  The budget is merely like the family budget. It is a goal. It is a \nblueprint. It is something you want to try to follow if at all \npossible. Yet when we pass tax relief in the budget, we are not really \npassing tax relief. We are just saying: This is something we would like \nto do. We would like to accommodate this in the budget. But if you \nnever follow through with any action, what have you done except to fool \nthe American people, make them think you are going to reduce taxes but \nyou never, ever get around to actually doing it.\n\n[[Page S1945]]\n\n  My amendment will be brought to the Senate floor. It doesn't have to \nput the Government first. We don't have to pay for it by increasing the \ntaxes on you over here so we can cut your taxes here.\n  Now, my colleagues can either vote for it or against it, but we are \ngoing to get a vote on the floor of the Senate on reform for the death \ntax, and it will be very much along the lines of the amendment I \nintroduced and the Senator from Colorado introduced. It will have a $5 \nmillion exemption per person, a step-up in basis for the property. It \nwill be indexed to inflation, and it will either have one rate or two, \nbut the top rate will not exceed 35 percent.\n  The difference will be we will either give tax relief to people or we \nwon't. If we give tax relief to people, we are not going to then have \nto ``pay for'' it in order to keep the Federal Government whole. \nGovernment gets about a little over 1 percent of its revenues from the \nestate tax. This reform would still allow a huge amount of revenue to \ncome in because there are still a lot of estates that will pay that 35 \npercent rate on amounts above $5 million or $10 million.\n  What it will do is take about 130,000 people who otherwise would have \nto file an estate tax return off of the rolls. They would not have to \nworry about it. They are the smaller businesses, the smaller farms--not \nthe big estates but the smaller ones--that have to pay anywhere from \n$5,000 to $1 million to just plan around the eventuality of death, \nwhich, unfortunately, comes to all of us. So they buy insurance. They \nhire lawyers and accountants, and they pay a lot of money. In fact, in \nthe aggregate, Americans pay as much money to avoid paying the tax as \nthey pay to the Federal Government in the tax itself.\n  What we want to do is to get most of those people off of the rolls so \nthey don't have to worry about it.\n  I certainly agree with my colleague from Colorado when he said the \nfirst principle should be certainty. We should know--especially with \nthe death tax there should be some certainty. Well, you don't have any \ncertainty if you don't know whether you are going to have to pay the \ntax. Unfortunately, the way it is right now, the way it is under the \nbudget that has been brought before us is, you have at least 130,000 \npeople who are going to have to file a return.\n  You don't know how many are going to have to actually pay the tax. \nWhat our amendment does is reduce that number to a little over 11,000, \nso that people don't have to spend a lot of money hiring lawyers and \naccountants and buying insurance on the off chance they are going to \nhave to pay for it; nor do they have to expend large amounts of money \nin tax preparation--38 hours, on average, per tax form filed.\n  We don't want people to have to pay that amount of money. That is why \nwe hope to get the number of filers down to something like 11,000. Then \nif they have to pay the tax, so be it. But the majority of Americans \nwould be spared the tax.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. The Senator from Arizona is correct that this is a \nproblem we have to deal with, and there are very significant \nsimilarities between our two amendments. In fact, the $45 billion fund \nwe have created will allow for indexing and for a stepped-up basis. The \nkey difference between the Senator's amendment and mine is that his is \nnot paid for. The reality is we in this Congress and in the Senate and \nin the White House need to understand we need to be fiscally \nresponsible. That is a debate we have had here with respect to pay-go. \nIt is my view, given the fact we already have a $10 trillion national \ndebt that continues to grow, we have a war that now is projected to \ncost over $2 trillion that we have not funded, but we have allowed that \ncredit card debt to basically be passed on to our children, we need to \nbe fiscally responsible.\n  So while we both recognize--the Senator from Arizona and I--that we \nneed to have certainty with respect to estate tax reform--and I think \nwe both recognize the Senator from Montana, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, is doing his best to get ideas from around the country and \nthe world on how to deal with this issue and move forward in a good-\nfaith effort--the distinction here is whether you pay for this change.\n  My question to my good friend from Arizona, with whom I enjoy working \non the Finance Committee, is: How would he propose that we pay for this \n$10 trillion mountain of debt, built up largely over the last 7 years?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am happy to respond to my colleague. The \ndebate now is not how to pay for a $10 trillion debt. We have a deficit \nof around $400 billion. We need to focus on not increasing the debt by \nincreasing the amount of the deficit more than we have to. I share the \nSenator's goal for that.\n  There are three fundamental ways you can reduce the deficit. You can \nreduce spending--and I am going to pick two out of the three. First, \nyou can reduce spending. I will vote for that. I have a good record \naround here on trying to reduce spending. Yet there isn't anything in \nthis budget that reduces spending.\n  If we have a cost, the automatic action under the budget is to \nincrease taxes, which is the second way you can do it. I reject that \nfor the reasons I have pointed out. You don't help people by cutting \ntheir taxes here and raising their taxes over there. At best, you have \ncreated a neutral situation.\n  The third way, of course, is to ensure that our economic policies are \nprogrowth policies. We don't have too much in the way of regulation, \ntoo much in the way of taxation, that the Government basically tries to \nget out of the way of our economy so it can grow, produce jobs, create \nmore wealth and, with that wealth, by the way, pay more taxes, which is \na good thing. One of the reasons why we are collecting today in Federal \nrevenues above the 40-year average in tax collections, with our Federal \ntax policy--we are collecting roughly 18.8 percent of GDP, more than \nthe 40-year average. The reason is we have a growing economy, although \nit is slowing right now, to be sure. But because that economy has been \nrobust, even at slightly lower tax rates, we are paying more in taxes, \ntax revenue, because the economy has grown. So the textbook answer to \nmy friend is you can reduce the deficit, and ultimately the debt, in \none of three ways: reduce spending, increasing taxes--though it has \ndiminishing returns; if you do it too much, you don't get revenue, you \ncan promote economic growth and you can bring the debt down.\n  The last point. My colleague pointed out we were having hearings in \nthe Finance Committee this morning and one of the witnesses there, as \nmentioned by my colleague, talked about what countries such as Canada, \nNew Zealand, and Australia are doing. Do you know what they are doing? \nThey are repealing their estate taxes. Why would they be repealing \ntheir estate taxes? This gets to the third way you make money. You \ngrow. What happened in Australia is they found toward the end of life \npeople with any means were moving to New Zealand, because they didn't \nhave an estate tax. They wanted to keep them in Australia, so they \ndecided, for competitive reasons, that they would eliminate the estate \ntax. So they stayed in Australia rather than moving to New Zealand. \nCanada and others are doing the same thing.\n  Our rate, now at 43 percent, which would be locked in by the budget, \nis far above the worldwide average, which is an 18-percent rate. A lot \nof countries don't have an estate tax. My answer is that our better \nresponse is, if we are not going to repeal the estate tax, reform it in \na way that doesn't inhibit economic growth and enables us to compete, \nenables our economy to produce revenue, even at a slightly lower tax \nrate because, at the end of the day, that will do us all more good than \ntrying to do what my colleague would do--raise taxes as the way to pay \nfor a tax reduction. To me, that doesn't make the kind of sense I would \nwant to be associated with in promoting legislation.\n  Let me simply yield the floor so my colleague can respond and not \nhave to pose a question in order to make the point.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I respect the Senator from Arizona and \nhis raising the issue of the estate tax and its need to be reformed, as \nwell as the fiscal crisis we face. Obviously, it will be a debate that \nwill consume a tremendous amount of time on the part of\n\n[[Page S1946]]\n\nthe Senate and the Congress and, hopefully, an administration that \nhelps us get back on a line of fiscal integrity and honesty for the \npeople of America.\n  Mr. President, I note that my friend from Massachusetts is on the \nfloor. He has a very tight schedule. I will yield the floor. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Massachusetts be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4151\n\n  Mr. Kennedy. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up amendment No. 4151.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4151.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To add a deficit-neutral reserve fund for increasing federal \n  student loan limits to protect students against disruptions in the \n                        private credit markets)\n\n       On page 55, line 18, after the word ``program'' insert ``or \n     increasing Federal student loan limits''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering is intended \nto give additional protections for students and families struggling to \npay for college.\n  Americans are anxious about the slumping economy and how it affects \ntheir families. They are losing their homes. They are seeing \nskyrocketing health costs. They wonder if they can afford today's gas \nprices to drive to work every day. The cost of heating their homes has \njumped at least 50 percent in the last 2 years. And now they are \nhearing that the loans they rely on to afford the high cost of college \nmay be at risk. Financial aid officers in some colleges are telling \nthem that loans may not be available when the school year starts this \nfall.\n  What we are seeing is that the credit crunch that is affecting the \nmortgage industry and many banks and corporations may affect the \nability of families to secure student loans at fair rates so their \nchildren can go to the college of their choice.\n  We are here today to say that we cannot allow the credit crunch to \nprevent our young people from going to college. The ability of young \nAmericans to pay the high cost of college should not be determined by \nthe quarterly earnings of banks.\n  There are three steps we must take to help families cope with the \ncost of college education. First, we must increase our commitment to \nPell grants and other aid. We do that in this budget. This budget meets \nour promise to increase the maximum goal to $5,400 by the year 2012.\n  This chart represents the legislation that was passed last year where \nwe provided additional funding for the Pell grants. The budget \nresolution showed that help is on the way for more than 5 million Pell \ngrant recipients across the country. This chart illustrates how the \nbudget resolution will help hard-pressed young people, who are in the \neducational system.\n  Second, we should make sure that secure loan options are available to \nstudents in case the market collapses. We have programs now that are \nbacked up by the Federal Government that are not affected by the \nmarket. Those are the direct loan programs in which the Federal \nGovernment makes the loans and not the banks--and the lender of last \nresort program that allows guaranty agencies to become lenders with the \nbacking of the Federal Government.\n  Congressman George Miller, the chairman of the House Education \nCommittee, and I have urged the Secretary of Education to make sure \nthese two options are fully available to students and colleges should \nthey be needed.\n  Third, we should strengthen the federally subsidized student loan \nprogram, and my amendment does that. We all know that student loans are \nindispensable for millions of students and parents struggling to pay \nfor college. In the last 20 years, the cost of college has tripled, and \nmore and more students are forced to rely on student loans to pay the \nhigh costs of a college education. In 1993, less than half of all \nstudents had to take out loans. But in 2004, nearly two-thirds had to \ntake out loans to finance their education. This chart illustrates this \npoint, showing the increase in students taking out loans from 1993 to \n2004.\n  The average student now graduates with more than $19,000 in debt--a \ndramatic increase on the financial burden on the students and their \nfamilies.\n  In Massachusetts, the cost of attending a 4-year public college \nincreased 59 percent between 2001 and 2005, while family incomes only \nwent up 20 percent. This chart illustrates where the family income \nincreased and where the cost of attending college has increased even \nmore.\n  The best way to help students and families afford college is to \nincrease grant aid. More aid up front means fewer loans and less debt \non graduation day.\n  Last year, the new Democratic Congress delivered on a 7-year old \npromise by President Bush to raise Pell grants. The maximum grant will \nincrease to $5,400 by 2012--an increase of $1,350 over the level at \nwhich it had stagnated under this administration. This increase means \nthat students eligible for the maximum Pell grant will have to borrow \n$6,000 less in loans over the course of their college career.\n  The effect of borrowing less saves the average student about $6,000 \nin a reduction of their debt. The legislation enacted last year also \nmakes Federal loans less costly for students by reducing interest \nrates. These benefits, however, will be meaningless if students cannot \nobtain the loans to pay for the college of their choice.\n  The current crisis in the credit market is making it more difficult \nfor student lenders to obtain capital. This has cut into the lenders' \nprofit margins, causing some lenders to pull out of the student loan \nmarket and causing those operating outside the Federal loan program to \ncut back on lending to high-risk borrowers.\n  So far, the attractiveness of the guarantee in the federally \nsubsidized program is encouraging other lenders to fill in the gaps in \nthat program. Since interest rates in the Federal program are capped, \nstudents are protected from exorbitant interest payments.\n  But many families need additional loans beyond Federal loans while \nthey are in college. We have a responsibility to ensure they can obtain \nthe loans at affordable rates.\n  One step we can take is to increase the amount that students can \nborrow in low-interest, federally backed student loans, which means \nthey won't have to rely on the higher cost, riskier private loan \nmarket.\n  The amendment I am offering today expands the deficit-neutral reserve \nfunds for higher education in the budget resolution so that Congress \ncan take whatever action is needed to increase the amount students can \nborrow under the Federal programs.\n  Over the last 20 years, as the cost of college has continued to \nskyrocket, Federal student aid has essentially remained flat. As this \nchart shows, the cost of attending a 4-year college has tripled--from \nabout $4,000 in 1987 to $12,000 today. Over the same period, the amount \nof Federal assistance available to students in grants or loans has been \nessentially flat.\n  This goes back, if you extend these lines to 1965, to when they \npassed the Higher Education Act. The basis for passing the Higher \nEducation Act in 1965 was a national commitment, which was debated in \nthe 1960 campaign, heavily debated, that this Nation was making a \ncommitment to the young people of this country. Any young person who \nwas able to gain entrance into a school or college of their choice \nwould be able to, on the basis of academic merit, put together \nsufficient grants and loans--and what they were able to earn \nthemselves--to be able to go to any school or college in this country \nand come out relatively free from indebtedness. That was what the \ndebate was at that time.\n  But look how we have betrayed that commitment.\n  We have seen that assistance to the students has become basically \nflat, but the extraordinary increase we have\n\n[[Page S1947]]\n\nseen in college costs has had a dramatic impact, obviously, on the \nstudents and their ability to go to school and on their income.\n  I wish to illustrate the point we are trying to make with this chart.\n  This is a typical family in my State of Massachusetts. Let's say the \nmedian family income is $68,000 which is higher than the national \naverage but not by much, maybe $10,000 or so. Now, the expected family \ncontribution is $8,000 to $10,000. The median cost of college is \n$17,000. So after all of the grants and loans, the family still has to \nmake up $2,675 in unmet need. This assumes they can even, with this \namount, put up the $8,000 to $10,000. Many of these families have two, \nthree, four, or five children and are hard-pressed even to meet this \nkind of commitment, but they still have this to pay.\n  If a member of this family misses a payment, a car payment or some \nother credit card payment, they will be forced to pay the most \nexorbitant high interest rates, which will result in paying thousands \nand tens of thousands of dollars more in interest costs.\n  We address this very important point right here with this \nlegislation. It might not seem like a very considerable amount, but it \nis the difference between a student going on to college or not \nattending college.\n  Mr. President, we have talked to the Budget chair on this issue, and \nwe understand we will be moving on to other amendments. This is a very \nimportant area. The impact of the economic challenge we are facing is \nreflected most particularly in housing but spills over in terms of \nstudents and their families. This will only be used if we have the kind \nof emergency we hope will not take place, but it will ensure that this \nSenate is going on record to say to families in this country that we \nare aware of the challenges they may very well be facing, and if those \ndevelop, we are going to have some assistance for them and for their \nfamily so that the value and worthwhile effort to continue the \neducation of their children in the family will be able to continue.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for the \nopportunity to present this, and hopefully later in the discussion \nthere might be an opportunity to have this favorably considered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Kennedy especially for \nhis passion and commitment to educating the children of our country.\n  I was raised by my grandparents. My grandmother was a schoolteacher \nand was only 5 feet tall. We called her Little Chief. She told us, as \nwe were growing up, there were three priorities in our household: \nEducation was No. 1, No. 2 was education, and No. 3 was education. We \ngot the message.\n  I deeply appreciate the absolute passion and commitment that the \nSenator from Massachusetts shows to the education issues. It is \ninspiring that he is able to maintain this level of commitment over \nthese many years and has achieved such extraordinary results, including \nlast year.\n  I thought one of the greatest accomplishments of the budget \nresolution was the education package that Senator Kennedy brought \nbefore the body and that passed and became law. It increased Pell \ngrants, which reduced the cost of getting a college education by \nenhancing and improving the loan program. I thought it was one of the \ntwo most significant accomplishments of last year. I thought the other \none was the expansion of assistance for veterans health care. That, \ntoo, became law, and it did so because it was included in the budget \nresolution. No one had more to do with that package than the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, and we thank him for his leadership.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, and if he will yield \nfor a moment, I want to thank him for his comments.\n  As he has mentioned, we had the opportunity to follow the rules of \nthe Senate in getting the final resolution and judgment, which was \nbasically supported in a very strong bipartisan way, ultimately, to \nmove in that direction. But, as the Senator pointed out, we have \nprovided increased opportunities to more than 5 million of the children \nof hard-working Americans who are hard-pressed trying to go on to \ncontinue their education with the enhanced Pell grants.\n  Included in that legislation was the loan forgiveness program that \nsaid: If you work in a public service profession, if you work with \nspecial needs children, if you work as an assistant district attorney, \nif you work as a legal aid officer, or if you work in areas of \neducation, you will be able to get your loan forgiven.\n  We also, as the Senator knows, put the limitation on monthly \nrepayment amounts, so that individuals, idealistic young people in \nAmerica who want to go into some form of public service, would not pay \nmore than 15 percent of their income to pay off their debt. This gives \na pathway to millions of young people in this country who want to give \nsomething back to their local community or their State or their country \nthrough some form of public service. This will enhance their \nopportunity to do so.\n  I must say, of course, that we would not have been able to do that \nhad we not had the chance through the Budget Committee, in compliance \nwith the rules of the Budget Committee, to ensure that we were able to \nsave hundreds of millions of dollars that went to deficit reduction. As \na result of the leadership of the Budget chair, we were able to do \nsomething good for students but also to do something valuable and \nworthwhile in terms of the budget. So I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee for the opportunity and for all his cooperation and help.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Next, we have Senator Lincoln, and I would just like to ask Senator \nLincoln how much time she would seek.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. No more than 10 minutes, or less.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will provide up to 15 minutes off the resolution, and \nwhatever the Senator consumes.\n  I would say to the Senator, at the end of her remarks, if she would \nwithhold actually sending the amendment to the desk, that will allow \nSenator Sununu to come to the floor so that we maintain the back-and-\nforth order. Then, if the Senator is not here after her remarks, I will \njust enter her amendment so that it will be in the queue, but we will \ndo this in a way that is fair to both sides.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator very much. I thank her for all she \nhas done to help us form this budget. I very much appreciate the effort \nand the energy she has brought to it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I, too, wish to thank the Budget \nCommittee chairman and express my appreciation for his hard work and \nthat of the ranking member for their diligence throughout this budget \nprocess.\n  I would also like to thank my colleague from Massachusetts for the \nmany ways that he affects the lives of Americans all across this great \nNation in support of a multitude of things but without a doubt in terms \nof higher education and in making that opportunity available to young \nadults across this country who want to reach their potential, who want \nto give back to their country, and through reaching that potential are \nable to add more of the gift they have to give this world and certainly \nto our Nation. His tireless work in those areas has been unbelievably \nimportant to students in Arkansas--I know myself, having gone to school \nwith a student loan--but without a doubt realizing that potential, \nrealizing that opportunity, and making it available for Americans all \nacross this country. Senator Kennedy has done tremendous work, and we \napplaud that.\n  I also again want to applaud Chairman Conrad, who has done a \nphenomenal job in bringing together a budget that I believe truly \nreflects the values of this country and the values of the American \npeople. The budget is a blueprint document. It is a place for us to \nreally express our priorities as a Congress. We move forward with a \nbudget that we hope reflects the things we hear from our constituencies \nand the ways they want to see their Nation, their Government, investing \nin this country.\n  They want to see us investing in the education, the human capital \nthat is going to continue to make this country great. They want to see \nus investing in infrastructure and in children, in health care and in \nopportunity, where we can improve on all of these many\n\n[[Page S1948]]\n\nthings; investments in rural America as well as the needs that exist in \nour urban areas.\n  It is a tough job to balance all of that and truly reflect our values \nas Americans, because we are diverse. It is one of the greatest things \nabout being a part of this Nation, to know that region upon region is \ndifferent, and individuals in those regions are different. But the fact \nis, we are all under one common denominator--Americans. As a country \nand as a government, we want to see that investment in who we all are. \nI think the chairman has painstakingly looked at how we combine in this \nbudget the values, the morals, and the issues of who we are and the \ninvestments we want to make and setting those as priorities as we move \nforward in the process we have.\n  My purpose for rising today is a simple one, and that is to better \nensure that the men and women who have courageously served our Nation \nin uniform receive the benefits to which they are entitled in a more \ntimely manner.\n  Last year, we came before the Budget Committee and set forth our \npriorities. One was very similar to what Senator Kennedy was just \nvisiting about, and that was to ensure that our Guard and Reserve are \ngoing to get the educational benefits they deserve, the ones they had \nearned.\n  Our Guard and Reserve have been called to duty in a much different \nway in the conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan than we have seen ever \nbefore, and making sure their rewards and their incentives for \neducation are commensurate with the Active-Duty members they are \nfighting alongside is important. We were successful with that, we were \nsuccessful in ensuring their ability to access those benefits in a \ntimely way, because before they only had 1 year. Now we have given them \nmore time to be able to access those benefits when they return home out \nof theater and out of Active Duty.\n  This, again, is another issue in terms of timeliness, in how we \nrespond to our veterans and the courageous men and women who serve us. \nThe amendment that will be offered on my behalf momentarily--and I will \nbe offering it with my friend and colleague from Maine, Senator Olympia \nSnowe--would do just that on timeliness. We are joined by Senators \nBiden, Clinton, Mikulski, and Pryor.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to ask unanimous consent that my \ncolleague, Senator Lieberman, be added as a cosponsor as well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I would also note that we had 25 Senators who joined us \nin a letter to the Budget Committee recently requesting this as a \npriority in the budget, and I would encourage my colleagues to take a \nlook at this amendment and join us because it is truly the right thing \nto do. This amendment would provide an additional $50 million for the \nVeterans Benefits Administration.\n\n  In the scheme of things, and how we talk about things in Washington, \n$50 million is not a great deal. It is not a huge amount in the overall \nscheme of the dollars we talk about in our Nation's budget. But we \nbelieve it can truly make a difference in providing the Veterans \nBenefits Administration with the additional resources it desperately \nneeds to more effectively meet its increasing workload and its \nunacceptability in terms of the large backlog of pending claims.\n  In recent years, Congress has taken the lead in tackling the claims \nbacklog and improving the management of the VBA. In last year's budget, \nmuch needed resources were provided to increase the number of claims \nprocessing staff essential to reducing the pending claims backlog and \nimproving the timeliness of that claims process.\n  There is not a Member in this body, I am sure, who has not dealt \nwith, in their constituent services and their casework, the issues of \nveterans' benefits that have been backlogged, the time it takes to get \nthese veterans the benefits they deserve. They have fought hard for \nthis country and need and deserve those benefits.\n  The leadership and guidance of Chairman Akaka and Chairman Conrad and \ntheir staffs certainly made all of this possible. Today we seek to \ninvest further in the commitment we already made in last year's budget \nand what we were pushing forward and were successful in, in terms of \nadditional funding for the VBA dealing with that backlog of cases.\n  According to the Veterans Benefits Administration's Workload Report \nfrom March 8, 2008, the total number of pending compensation and \npension claims was 666,710. That was up from 627,429 this time last \nyear. So we are seeing an increase in our caseload while all the while \nwe still have a backlog in those cases that are pending.\n  The amount that has been pending for more than 180 days is nearly 27 \npercent. Additionally, claims requiring a disability rating \ndetermination, which are the most time consuming and resource intensive \nto the process, have increased more than 50 percent since 2003.\n  This is inexcusable--veterans who return home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan, veterans who are out there with disability claims from \nother circumstances, who have been put into these backlogs. It is \ncontinuing to grow. We are only asking for $50 million to be able to \nimprove upon that situation for these veterans.\n  Between the fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2007, the number of \nfiled claims increased 45 percent, from almost 579,000 to 838,000. For \nfiscal year 2009, the VA, which has consistently underestimated its \nworkload in the past, projects the number to increase to approximately \n872,000. These numbers are increasing and we have to get a handle on it \nso we can stop those overloads and certainly the workloads that are \nbacklogged.\n  Further, the VA cautions that ongoing hostilities in Iraq and \nAfghanistan could increase its workload even further. So we know \nunfortunately there is not going to be a lessening. There is only, more \nthan likely, going to be an increase. We have to make sure we have the \nresources there.\n  In light of all these mounting challenges, this amendment would \nprovide an additional $50 million to the VBA's general administration \naccount so it would have the flexibility to explore pilot programs and \ninvest more in training or technology initiatives to help tackle the \nclaims backlog. This is not a process that is going to go away if we do \nnot address it. It is simply not fair to our veterans.\n  It complements the recommendations that are provided in the Budget \nViews and Estimates from both the House and Senate Committees on \nVeterans' Affairs. As discussed in those documents----\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Gallery.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will suspend. The \nSergeant at Arms will restore order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for a recess subject to the call of the Chair.\n\n\n                Recess Subject to the Call of the Chair\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will stand in recess \nwhile the Sergeant at Arms clears the gallery.\n  Thereupon, the Senate, at 2:21 p.m., recessed until 2:22 p.m. and \nreassembled when called to order by the Acting President pro tempore \n(Mr. Cardin).\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas may \ncontinue.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, there are many passionate pleas we hear \nacross our country. Hopefully, the passionate pleas we make here on the \nfloor of the Senate on behalf of our constituents can be seen as \npassionate as many we witness--some here today, and certainly others. I \ncontinue with my passionate plea on behalf of the soldiers, the brave \nAmerican men and women who serve this great country. In what we have \nseen in the backlog, through the Veterans' Administration, certainly it \nis an indication that we can do a better job in providing those \nbenefits to the service men and women who have done such a courageous \njob on behalf of this great Nation and all of us.\n\n  What I recommended in my amendment are recommendations that I think \ncomplement the recommendations provided in the Budget Views and \nEstimates from both the House and Senate Committees on Veterans' \nAffairs. Again, I thank Chairman Akaka for all of his hard work and \nChairman Conrad for working with us on this issue.\n  Our veterans are a very passionate issue to many of us, coming from a\n\n[[Page S1949]]\n\nfamily where my dad was an infantryman in Korea. We talked earlier \nabout the impression our families leave on us. Senator Conrad mentioned \nhis grandmother who believed in education. I grew up in a household \nvery much like that. My husband did as well. My husband's grandmother \nis going to be 111 this year and she is still preaching education. She \nis still on her own, still out there making sure that every child who \ngot her Christmas letter this year knew the importance of education. \nCertainly, without a doubt, those of us who grew up in households that \nhad tremendous respect for the patriots, the brave and courageous men \nand women who serve this country in the Armed Forces, deserve that same \nkind of passion.\n  We discussed in those documents, coming to a close here, that it is \nimperative for the Veterans Benefits Administration to make greater \ninvestments in the training programs to prepare new hires for the \ncomplicated process of compensation claims adjudication.\n  Additionally, workload production initiatives such as technological \nimprovements offer the hope of reducing additionally the average time \nfor a claims decision. The brave men and women who have served our \nNation in uniform should be a priority for each one of us. As we hear \nall kinds of conversation and talk about people's positions on whether \nwe should be in conflict, whether we should be engaged in war, there \nshould be no debate, there should be no conflict, in whether those who \nare serving this country in uniform deserve to be sure that the \nbenefits they have earned and they deserve are rightly in place for \nthem, and something they can use, not set about waiting 180 days to \nhear back from somebody to tell them they have yet another 180 days to \nwait until they actually get those benefits. The number of veterans who \ncontact my office for help grows each year, and I am sure it does in \nthe offices of many of my colleagues. Unfortunately, the backlog is \noften denying them the benefits they desperately need for years; not \njust weeks or days, but years. It is simply unacceptable.\n  The lessons ingrained in me since childhood have taught me that after \na person has served in the military, we should make absolutely every \neffort, not just priority but every effort, to fund and make real their \nbenefits and to honor those individuals who have earned them and care \nfor them and their families, those who have served this great country. \nIt is the least we can do for those to whom we owe so much. It is the \nleast we can do to reassure future generations, and those who are \nserving in the field today, that a grateful nation will not forget them \nwhen their military service is complete.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairmen for working with us, hopefully, \nagain, as passionately as the passion that has been displayed in this \nChamber today about people's views on military service and certainly \nthe conflict in Iraq. We can make good on the promise we made to our \nsoldiers who have served so courageously and bravely.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield back the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, under the agreed upon order, Senator \nSununu was to be next. Do we know if Senator Sununu is on his way? \nUnder the agreed upon order, Senator Sununu was to be next. He was to \nbe here at 2:30.\n  The plan is this. I should do this through the Chair. I say to the \nChair, the intention is, the agreement was Senator Sununu--we are \nrunning a little bit ahead of schedule, but Senator Sununu will be here \nshortly. He will go for approximately 15 minutes. Then we will come \nback.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then we will call up Senator Lincoln's amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, we will call up Senator Lincoln's amendment. So we \nwill be back and forth.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then we are supposed to go to Senator Alexander.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will then go to Senator Sanders for 15 minutes?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Twenty.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Then we will come back to Senator Alexander and then we \nwill come back to Senator Nelson.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield, then we will be out of order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will not let people send up their amendments. We will \nmake sure that we maintain the order as we have previously, so that we \nwill keep going back and forth.\n  Senator Sununu will send up his amendment; then we will send up \nSenator Lincoln's amendment; Senator Sanders, we will ask him to \nwithhold so we are not out of order, we ask him to withhold; Senator \nAlexander could send up his amendment; then we will enter Senator \nSander's amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Senator Sununu tells me he only needs 5 to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4221\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I certainly wish to thank the Chairman of \nthe Budget Committee for recognizing the frugality of us from the \nGranite State. Whether it is money or time, we try to be concise, try \nto be direct, and try to use what resources we have very wisely.\n\n (Purpose: To save lives, promote overall health care efficiency, and \nlower the cost for the delivery of health care services by facilitating \n   the deployment and use of electronic prescribing technologies by \n                              physicians)\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that any pending amendments be set aside and \nI send an amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Sununu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4221.\n\n  The amendment (No. 4221) is as follows:\n\n       On page 62, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n       (3) Electronic prescribing.--The Chairman of the Senate \n     Committee on the Budget may revise the allocations, \n     aggregates, and other levels in this resolution for one or \n     more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, motions, or \n     conference reports that promote the deployment and use of \n     electronic prescribing technologies through financial \n     incentives, including grants and bonus payments, and \n     potential adjustments in the Medicare reimbursement \n     mechanisms for physicians, by the amounts provided in such \n     legislation for those purposes, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over either the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2008 through 2013 or the \n     period of the total of fiscal years 2008 through 2018.\n\n  Mr. SUNUNU. In calling up this amendment, I wish to make sure this \nbudget resolution effectively addresses the issue of health information \ntechnology. I know the issue was addressed, in part, in the \nconstruction of the budget resolution, but I think we have a historic \nopportunity to enact legislation this year that makes a difference, and \nthe kind of technology available to providers, to doctors and nurses, \nto patients, technology that improves efficiency, reduces medical \nerrors, and improves the quality of care, not for thousands but for \nmillions of Americans, especially older Americans on Medicare.\n  A lot of these benefits were recognized in the resolution, but I \nthink we need to go further. We need to make sure this budget \nresolution, and the health care fund that was established in it, \nfocuses on electronic prescribing in particular.\n  While there are a number of areas of health care information \ntechnology that have great potential, this is an area of health care \nIT, electronic prescriptions, whose time is now. In hundreds of \nthousands of places around the country, electronic prescribing systems \nare being used, being used effectively, to save time, to save money, to \nreduce unnecessary errors in the dispensing of medicine, ultimately \nimproving the quality of care and reducing costs.\n  I think it is essential that this budget resolution focus on \nelectronic prescribing and legislation to expand the use and access of \nelectronic prescriptions because it is something we can get done this \nyear. There is a lot of partisanship, a lot of differences of opinion \non many different parts of this budget resolution. But in this \nparticular area, we have a bipartisan approach. This has been \nintroduced, and Senator Kerry, Senator Ensign, Senator Stabenow, and I \nhave crafted electronic prescribing legislation that will do all these \nthings and I think more.\n  It reduces the number of errors, it increases the usage of electronic \nprescriptions. As I say, in the end, I think\n\n[[Page S1950]]\n\nit significantly improves the Medicare Program for all our seniors. It \nis legislation that is ready to go. It is legislation that can be \nenacted today. It is legislation that has bipartisan support.\n  The way we make this difference, the way we improve the acceptance of \nelectronic prescribing is, first and foremost, by providing some \nincentives, some costs and funding to physicians to purchase the \nsystems, to purchase the software, to fund the hand-held units that are \nespecially valuable in remote locations or rural areas.\n  So we have grants to make those systems available. Second, we provide \na bonus, Medicare provides reimbursement to physicians who are using an \nelectronic prescription system. We give them a 1-percent bonus in their \nreimbursement rate. We do this over a 3-year period. Then, at the end \nof that period, grants and incentives for those who have not been able \nto or have not been willing to use electronic prescription systems, we \nhave a penalty.\n  Even with that penalty provision, we do allow the head of Health and \nHuman Services to make exceptions because there are some underserved \nparts of the country, rural parts of the country, where such a system \nmight not be as effective or as feasible. But in the vast majority of \nnetworks and provider systems and parts of the country, this is a \ntechnology whose time has come.\n  There are over 1 million cases a year where a mistake is made, where \nthere is an adverse reaction because of a mistake in issuing a \nprescription. If this legislation can even reduce a fraction of those \nerrors, we will have done a great deal to improve the health care \nsystem under Medicare for our seniors.\n  Because of the impact this legislation has, it has actually been \nevaluated as saving Medicare money in the near term, saving Medicare \nbetween $1 and $3 billion a year in the long term. There are not many \npieces of legislation where you can say we are reducing the cost of the \nprogram for the taxpayers and improving the quality of care and the \noptions available to the beneficiaries, to the seniors, and the \nretirees who depend on Medicare every day.\n  So this amendment would add to the language that establishes a health \ncare technology fund to make clear that our priority within that fund \nneeds to be on legislation to improve access to electronic \nprescriptions; that such legislation should use financial incentives; \nit should provide grants to purchase equipment; it should include bonus \npayments; in the long run it should even consider changing the \nallocations of those who are not willing to use this incredibly \nvaluable technology that is available today.\n  I think this is an amendment that makes the reserve fund for health \ninformation technology even stronger. It sets the priorities in the \nright way. I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4194\n\n    (Purpose: To provide the Veterans Benefits Administration with \nadditional resources to more effectively meet their increasing workload \n      and to better address the unacceptably large claims backlog)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, before my colleague speaks, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the pending \namendment is set aside in order for the Senator to offer the amendment.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for Mrs. \n     Lincoln, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Biden, Mrs. \n     Clinton, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4194.\n\n  The amendment (No. 4194) is as follows:\n\n       On page 23, line 16, increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 17, increase the amount by $44,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 21, increase the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 25, increase the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, decrease the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 17, decrease the amount by $44,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, decrease the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 25, decrease the amount by $1,000,000.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. My understanding, I ask Senator Murray, is that my \namendment will be called up later this afternoon; is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. We will be offering his \namendment later.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, I find it interesting that almost every candidate for \nPresident today is talking about change. It is not only the candidates \nfor President. For candidates at every level across this country, the \nmantra out there is: change, change, change.\n  And the reason the candidates at all levels are talking about change \nis they understand something. They understand that from one end of our \ncountry to the other, by vast majority, the American people want to \nmove America in a new direction. They want a new set of national \npriorities.\n  The American people are angry. They are frustrated with the status \nquo, with politics as usual, and they want action not talk. They want \naction from their elected officials.\n  The American people are tired of paying $3.20 for a gallon of gas, \nwhen ExxonMobil is enjoying recordbreaking profits. The American people \nare tired of paying more and more for health care, and over 8 million \nAmericans have lost their health insurance since President Bush has \nbeen in office, while the insurance companies and the pharmaceutical \nindustry continues to rip them off.\n  The American people are tired of seeing their good-paying jobs go to \nChina or the other low-wage countries while they work 50 or 60 hours a \nweek to pay the bills. When we talk about the economy today, let's not \nforget the American people now work the longest hours of any people in \nthe industrialized world. People are working incredibly long hours, two \nor three jobs, to pay the bills.\n  Most importantly, the American people are deeply worried that the \nAmerican dream is disappearing, that no matter how hard they work, no \nmatter how many hours they spend on the job, that for the first time in \nthe modern history of the United States, their kids will likely have a \nlower standard of living than they do.\n  From a values perspective, I believe the American people are tired of \nthe culture of greed which has been so pervasive in recent years, a \nculture which says: Yes, I am rich and I am powerful and I have \nbillions and I want billions more. I do not care about anybody else in \nour society; I have got it; I want more.\n  That is the culture of greed which is so pervasive in our society \ntoday. The amendment that will be offered today, that I am offering, is \ncosponsored by Senators Kennedy, Durbin, Clinton, Harkin, Schumer, \nBrown, and Mikulski. I am quite confident that if this amendment is \nadopted, it will not be solving all the problems facing our country.\n  But on the other hand, if this amendment is passed, it will begin to \nmove America in a very different direction, with a very different set \nof moral and economic values. This amendment will tell the American \npeople we understand that Washington must adopt a new set of national \npriorities, that we must be concerned not with the wealthy and the \npowerful who have so much influence over what goes on in Congress but \nthat the time is long overdue for Congress to begin paying attention to \nthe needs of the middle class and low-income people who have been \nignored and left behind year after year after year.\n  I am very proud to tell you my amendment has been endorsed by over 50 \ngroups representing tens of millions of Americans. These groups include \nthe AFL-CIO, AFCSME, the National Education Association, the Children's \nDefense Fund, the American Federation of Teachers, the YWCA, and the \nNational Organization of Women, among many other groups.\n  The budget President Bush recently sent to Congress was nothing less \nthan a disaster. It gave much to those who did not need any help, while \nit took from those who need help, including those living in \ndesperation.\n\n[[Page S1951]]\n\n  As I mentioned to the people in my home State of Vermont, it was a \nRobin Hood proposal in reverse. It took from the poor and it gave to \nthe rich. As a member of the Budget Committee, I am happy to say that \nunder Chairman Conrad's leadership and hard work, the budget we passed \nout of committee was far superior to what the President proposed and is \nquite a reasonable document.\n  I think we can improve upon that document. We can improve upon that \nbudget. That is why I am offering this amendment today with my \ncolleagues who are cosponsoring it.\n  This amendment addresses three major trends in American society that \nwe must deal with in the budget process.\n  First, the United States has the most unequal distribution of wealth \nand income of any major nation in the industrialized world; and the gap \nbetween the very rich and everyone else is growing wider.\n  Secondly, it is a national disgrace that here in the United States of \nAmerica, this great Nation we are so proud of, that we have by far the \nhighest rate of childhood poverty of any major country on Earth.\n  And third, year after year, we have had recordbreaking deficits, and \nour national debt is now approaching $10 trillion, a grossly unfair \nburden to leave to our children and grandchildren and, in fact, a \nstaggering sum of money which is economically unsustainable.\n  This amendment addresses all three of those issues.\n  The amendment I am offering today puts the needs of our children, \nworking families, seniors on fixed incomes, persons with disabilities, \nand the middle class ahead of the needs of the wealthy.\n  It says to the wealthy: You do not need any more tax relief when the \nmiddle class is shrinking, when poverty is increasing, and when the top \n1-percent level has never had it so good since the 1920s.\n  It says to my colleagues in the Senate, let's get our priorities \nright. Specifically, this amendment simply restores the top income tax \nbracket to 39.6 percent for households earning more than $1 million per \nyear and uses that revenue to address the most urgent unmet needs of \nour children, for job creation, and for deficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, 99.7 percent of Americans would not be impacted by \nthis amendment. The only families that would be impacted are those \nearning at least $1 million a year. That is the top three-tenths of 1 \npercent. What we are simply doing is asking that the upper tax rates go \nback to where they were during the Clinton administration when, I \nremind my colleagues, the economy was far stronger.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee, restoring the top income tax \nbracket for people making more than $1 million to what it was in 2000 \nwould increase revenue by $32.5 billion over the next 3 years, \nincluding $10.8 billion in fiscal year 2009 alone. Instead of giving \n$32.5 billion in tax breaks to the very wealthiest people, including \npeople who have billions and billions of dollars, people who really \ndon't need any more tax breaks, this amendment would invest money in \nthe following areas over the next 3 years.\n  It would put $10 billion into special education, into the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act. Over 30 years ago, the Federal \nGovernment made a promise that it would fund 40 percent of the cost of \nspecial education. Unfortunately, the Federal Government--shock of all \nshocks--has not kept its promise. Today we only spend about 17 percent \nof the cost of special ed. What does this mean? I can tell you what it \nmeans in Vermont and I am sure it is the same all over the country. \nSchool districts are faced with growing costs regarding an influx of \nspecial ed kids. Property taxes are going up to accommodate those \nincreased costs, and kids with special ed needs do not get the \nattention they deserve. This amendment begins to reverse that process, \nbegins to tell school districts all over America that we are going to \nkeep our promise. We will begin adequately funding special education.\n  Secondly, this amendment increases Head Start funding by $5 billion \nover the next 3 years. The simple truth is, Head Start works. Its goal \nis to make sure that when low-income kids get into kindergarten or the \nfirst grade, they are not already far behind everybody else so that by \nthe time they are in the fourth or fifth grade, they have given up, \nthey have dropped out intellectually. Head Start works. The problem is, \nthere are many families who want to take advantage of Head Start, but \ncommunities don't have the resources to open the doors for those kids. \nAfter adjusting for inflation, Head Start has been cut by 11 percent \ncompared to fiscal year 2002. Boy, is that moving in the wrong \ndirection. Meanwhile, less than half of all eligible kids are enrolled \nin Head Start and only 3 percent of eligible children are enrolled in \nEarly Head Start.\n  This amendment will not solve all of those problems, but $5 billion \nwill help open the doors to large numbers of kids who desperately need \nHead Start education.\n  This amendment would also provide $4 billion for the Child Care \nDevelopment Block Grant Program. I can tell you the issue of childcare \nis one of those issues that we have managed in Congress to sweep under \nthe rug, from one end of this country to the other. Where you have mom \nand dad both working, where is that working family going to find the \naffordable, quality childcare they desperately need? We tell single \nmoms, go out and work, but we forgot to tell them where they are going \nto find the childcare they need to take care of their kids. This \namendment begins to do that with a $4 billion increase for the Child \nCare Development Block Grant Program.\n  This amendment would provide $3.5 billion more for the Food Stamp \nProgram. I don't have to tell my colleagues that in the United States, \nshamefully, disgracefully, we are seeing more and more of our citizens \ngo hungry. I know in Vermont, and I expect in communities all over the \ncountry, we are seeing working people, not unemployed people, working \npeople going to food shelves to get the food they need to take care of \ntheir families. That is not the way it should be. This $3.5 billion \nincrease for food stamps is a step forward.\n  This amendment would also increase funding for LIHEAP, the Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, by $4 billion. In Vermont and other \nStates, it gets very cold in the winter. We have seniors living on \nfixed incomes who cannot pay the rapidly escalating cost of home \nheating oil. LIHEAP is a successful program. It is underfunded. Nobody \nshould go cold, and we put $4 billion into LIHEAP.\n  We also provide more for school construction. Not only is it terribly \nimportant that our kids study in decent schools, schools that are not \nfalling apart, schools which are energy efficient, but by putting money \ninto school construction, we create a lot of good-paying jobs, and that \nis what that provision does.\n  Finally, last but certainly not least, this amendment would also \nreduce the deficit by $3 billion. In other words, at a time when we \nhave seen recordbreaking deficits, we are now closing in on a $10 \ntrillion national debt. This amendment takes a small step forward in \nlowering this year's deficit.\n  Let me quote from a letter I received in support of this amendment \nfrom over 50 groups across the country, including the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, \nthe NEA, the Children's Defense Fund, the American Federation of \nTeachers, the WYCA, the National Head Start Organization, SEIU, and the \nNational Organization for Women, among others:\n\n       The economic downturn is creating a crisis for parents who \n     work hard but struggle to afford nutritious meals as food \n     prices escalate; to pay for energy for their homes and fuel \n     for their cars; to pay for child care so that they can work; \n     and to assure that their young children receive the building \n     blocks of a solid education to prepare them for the future. \n     Programs that assist in meeting these needs have been cut \n     significantly in recent years, while tax breaks for \n     millionaires have soared. Your amendment addresses these \n     needs. . . .We are urging the Senate to adopt your fiscally \n     responsible amendment to address the pressing needs of \n     working families while restoring greater progressivity to the \n     tax system.\n\n  I thank these organizations that represent tens and tens of millions \nof working Americans.\n  The choice we face is simple. A lot of rhetoric goes on around here. \nIt is pretty warm in this Chamber, and it is not only from the heat. It \nis from a lot of hot air from all of us. The time for talk is over and \nthe time for action is now. This amendment will not solve all the\n\n[[Page S1952]]\n\nproblems, but it does say to the American people that the time is long \noverdue for us to move in a new direction. It is a very simple choice \nwe have to make. The richest people in this country have not had it so \ngood since the 1920s. Frankly, they do not need any more tax breaks. \nThey are doing just fine. But our children are not doing just fine. \nSenior citizens on fixed incomes are not doing just fine. What this \namendment begins to do is to develop a new set of priorities for our \nNation. It tells the people we understand that working people are in \ntrouble, they need assistance, and that the time is now to ask the \nwealthiest people to rejoin the United States and to help us address \nsome of our major social needs.\n  My understanding is that later this afternoon this amendment will be \noffered.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the game plan, as the Presiding Officer \nlaid out, is to go to Senator Alexander and then come back. We will go \nto the Sanders amendment and then come back. I am not sure which is \nnext, but there will be another amendment from our side.\n  I wanted to respond briefly to Senator Sanders. I respect Senator \nSanders because he believes fervently in his view of the way Government \nshould work, which is, we should keep making it bigger and keep raising \ntaxes to accomplish that. I have to disagree with the basic philosophy \nthat the present tax law isn't effectively raising taxes from high-\nincome Americans. The simple fact is, over the last 4 years especially, \nwe have seen a higher growth in revenues than we have ever seen before. \nThat growth in revenues has come from wealthy, high-income Americans.\n  Today under this tax law, we have a more progressive tax system than \nwas in place under President Clinton. The lowest 40 percent of wage \nearners who don't pay income taxes, for all intents and purposes--some \npay, but the majority do not; they actually get money back under the \nearned income tax credit--are getting about twice as much back today \nunder our tax laws than they got back under President Clinton's term. \nThe highest percentage income earners, the top 20 percent, are paying \nmore into the Federal Government than they were paying into the Federal \nGovernment under the Clinton years. I think it was 82 percent of \nFederal revenues came from the top 20 percent of income tax payers \nunder President Clinton. Today almost 85 percent of revenues come from \nthe top 20 percent of income earners. That is a progressive system--\nlower income people getting more back; higher income people paying more \nof the burden.\n  The reason it works this way under our tax laws is that we have \ncreated a fair and level playing field where people are willing to do \ntaxable investment. Somebody who has income of significant levels has \ntwo options. They can take action to invest in a way which takes risks \nand generates jobs and also is taxable, or they can take action which \ntakes risks, hopefully generates jobs, and probably isn't taxable \nbecause they use our tax laws in order to legally position their money \nso they don't have to pay the tax burden. It is only human nature, as \nhas been proven over and over again, that if you get the tax rates up \ntoo high, higher income people start to use legal means to reduce their \ntax burden. But if you get the tax burden set correctly, then higher \nincome people take the risk, pursue entrepreneurship, and create jobs, \nall of which generates income to the Federal Government. That is what \nis happening today.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will yield after I finish making my comment.\n  The point is, what is the right tax burden. If you have a progressive \nsystem where 85 percent of your revenue is coming from one group, the \nhigh-income people, and the bottom income folks are getting much more \nback than they got back historically, you have a progressive system. If \nyou are generating more revenue than you have ever historically \ngenerated over a 4-year period, and you are well above the average \namount the Federal Government receives, then you have a pretty \nreasonable tax structure which is giving a fair amount of revenue to \nthe Federal Government. In fact, as a percent, we are well over what is \nthe norm over the last 20 years.\n  I argue that the tax structure which we presently have in place is \nworking to the benefit of the Federal Government in getting more \nrevenue which is being spent rather aggressively by the other side of \nthe aisle. The Senator from Vermont says: Let's just raise it some \nmore. Raise that tax some more, and we will get even more revenue. I \nwould argue that when you start to jump those rates back up, you will \nprobably not get more revenue. You will dampen economic activity. You \nwill cause people to take action which causes them to invest in a way \nwhich reduces their tax liability. You will probably end up reducing \nrevenues with that type of action. It is human nature, and human nature \nin a capitalist system tends to produce revenues when you have fair \ntaxes and tends to reduce revenues when you have an overly burdened tax \nsystem.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I don't know if it is a New England characteristic that \nI share, but we make the same points over and over again. The Senator \nis the ranking member of the Budget Committee. He has heard my point. \nLet me make it again.\n  My friend from New Hampshire, from the other side of the Connecticut \nRiver, says we have a progressive system. My God, those rich people are \npaying a fortune. Well, wealthy people do pay a lot. Do you know why? \nThe richest people in this country are earning far more than they used \nto, while the middle class is shrinking and poverty is increasing. For \nexample, according to Forbes magazine, the collective net worth of the \nwealthiest 400 Americans increased by $290 billion last year--400 \nfamilies, $290 billion. The wealthiest 1 percent earn more income than \nthe bottom 50 percent. Yes, my friend from New Hampshire, I do know \nthey pay more in taxes. The reason is, they get all of the money.\n  Every economist understands that in recent years what has been going \non is the middle class is shrinking, real income is going down, and \npoverty is increasing. The rich are making out like bandits. Yes, they \nare paying more in taxes because they are making a huge amount more. \nThat is not progressive taxation. What that is about is the fact that \nwe have the most unfair distribution of wealth and income of any major \nnation on Earth.\n  I ask my friend, don't you agree with me? That is my question. Of \ncourse, you do.\n  Mr. GREGG. My answer to the Senator from Vermont is, we get two \nthings from Vermont and New Hampshire: bad weather and bad economics.\n  At this point, I will yield the floor and allow the Senator from \nTennessee to pursue his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I wonder if I might ask the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire a question before he leaves the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if the Senator has time, I will be happy \nto try to respond to a question.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I have some vague memory in my mind \nthat in the late 1960s, or some time in that time period, a \nmillionaire's tax was proposed. I am wondering if the Senator from New \nHampshire remembers that and remembers how many millionaires it was to \napply to, how many rich people was it whose money they were going to \nget?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, it is the \nSenator's time, so let me put it in the form of a question to ask him \nback.\n  It is my understanding--and I believe the Senator would agree with \nthis--at the time it was supposed to be the top 1 percent of taxpayers. \nIt turned out it exploded over the years. It was supposed to apply to 1 \nmillion people. It has ended up applying to potentially 20 million \npeople.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the great danger with these \nconversations about ``let's get the rich'' is, we got 115 of them, I \nthink, with the so-called AMT tax. Today it traps, according to the \nSenator from New Hampshire, 20 million Americans. That seems to be the \nway things go.\n  So I thank the Senator for his time, and I wish to move on to a \ndifferent\n\n[[Page S1953]]\n\nsubject. We are talking really--it is the same subject--about the \nFederal budget and how to fix the family budget. The Senator from New \nHampshire has eloquently described how the Democratic budget will wreck \nthe Federal budget by raising taxes--which we have just had a beautiful \nspeech about the need for higher taxes--more debt, and more spending. \nThat is one view of how we move ahead in this country.\n  The view on this side is that we wish to help balance the family \nbudget.\n  Now, the subject I wish to talk about has to do with where most \nfamilies get their jobs. We balance the family budget by lower energy \nprices, which we talked about earlier, by lower taxes--that is one way \nto do that--by helping every American have access to health insurance \nwithout the Government picking their doctor.\n  Another way is to make sure the small businesses of America have the \nopportunity to make a profit, to create jobs, to take some money home, \nand to avoid unnecessary costs.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4222\n\n  Madam President, I wish to speak for a moment about an amendment I \npropose to send to the desk in a moment that relates to keeping the \nfamily budget in balance by reducing the costs of small businesses, and \nit has the even more important advantage of helping to unify our \ncountry. The subject is the same subject that is chiseled into stone \nthere: e pluribus unum--the motto of our country, what has been the \nmotto of our country: one, from many.\n  Let me begin with this story.\n  In March of 2007, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a \nFederal agency, sued the Salvation Army for allegedly discriminating \nagainst two of the Salvation Army's employees in a Boston area thrift \nstore. What had the Salvation Army done to earn this lawsuit from the \nFederal Government? Well, it had required its employees to speak \nEnglish on the job.\n  The English rule was clearly posted, and the employees were given a \nyear to learn it. But this lawsuit, in plain English, means that a shoe \nshop in Tennessee or a small business in Missouri or in Washington \nState would have to hire a lawyer in order to make sure they have a \nclear business reason to require their employees to speak our common \nlanguage on the job. So I have an amendment to bring some common sense \nto this subject. It would be to take $670,000 used by the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission, which it is using to bring actions \nagainst employers who require their employees to speak English, and \ninstead uses the money to help teach English to adults through the \nDepartment of Education's English Literacy/Civics Education State Grant \nprogram, which is one of the principal ways we help American adults \nlearn our common language.\n  So, Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Alexander] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4222.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To take $670,000 used by the EEOC in bringing actions against \n employers that require their employees to speak English, and instead \n  use the money to teach English to adults through the Department of \n   Education's English Literacy/Civics Education State Grant nrogram)\n\n       On page 4, line 14, decrease the amount by $583,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $415,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $134,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $34,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, decrease the amount by $583,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $415,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, increase the amount by $134,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $34,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, decrease the amount by $583,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $168,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, decrease the amount by $34,000.\n       On page 5, line 16, decrease the amount by $583,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, decrease the amount by $168,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, decrease the amount by $34,000.\n       On page 18, line 16, increase the amount by $670,000.\n       On page 18, line 17, increase the amount by $20,000.\n       On page 18, line 21, increase the amount by $482,000.\n       On page 18, line 25, increase the amount by $134,000.\n       On page 19, line 4, increase the amount by $34,000.\n       On page 24, line 16, decrease the amount by $670,000.\n       On page 24, line 17, decrease the amount by $603,000.\n       On page 24, line 21, decrease the amount by $67,000.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, this is not the first time I have \noffered this amendment. I offered it in the Appropriations Committee of \nthe Senate in June of 2007. Enough Democrats as well as Republicans \nvoted for it to be reported to the Senate floor as a part of the \nCommerce, Justice, Science appropriations bill.\n  On October 16, 2007, the full Senate voted 75 to 19 to approve that \nappropriations bill, containing similar language to the amendment I \nhave just sent to the desk.\n  On November 8, 2007, the House of Representatives, with the support \nof 36 Democrats, voted 218 to 186 to instruct its appropriations \nconferees to recede to the Senate position on the EEOC.\n  However, the Speaker of the House canceled the conference of the \nCommerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittees over this \nissue, even though the Senate and the House both voted that a Federal \nagency should not be suing businesses that ask their employees to speak \nEnglish on the job. The Speaker of the House, for some reason, thought \nit was so important that she canceled the entire appropriations bill \nrather than accept this language. So it must be a matter of great \nsignificance. I hope the Senate, having already passed this language \nbefore in the appropriations bill, as I have said by a vote of 75 to \n19, will do it again when the opportunity comes tomorrow.\n  Madam president, there are thousands of small businesses across \nAmerica. They may be a Japanese restaurant where the owner may say: I \nwould like for my employees all to speak Japanese. That is fine. They \nmight be an Irish pub, and the owner might say: I would like for them \nall to speak with an Irish lilt. Or it might be a Chinese restaurant, \nand for a whole variety of reasons, the owner of the restaurant might \nsay: We would like for all our employees to speak Chinese. That's fine. \nBut in America, if the owner of a business wants to ask his or her \nemployees to speak English on the job, that ought to not be an issue. \nYou shouldn't have to go ask a lawyer to come up with a business reason \nwhy you can tell some Federal agency why you asked your employees to \nspeak English on the job. There are practical reasons for it. There are \nsafety reasons for it. There are communications reasons for it. There \nmay be customer reasons for it. But it is a bigger picture than that.\n  We have, in this country, valued English as our common language for a \nlong time, and let me go back to the reasons why. One of our country's \ngreatest characteristics is its diversity. But diversity is not our \ngreatest characteristic. Our greatest accomplishment as a country may \nbe that we've taken all that diversity and molded it into one common \ncountry. It is a source of our great strength. No other country has \nbeen able to do it as well. We see many European and Asian countries \nthat wish they had our practice in inviting people from all over the \nworld to come to their country and becoming one country. How do we do \nit? Because we say at the beginning in our Constitution that we do not \nmake any distinctions based on race or gender or where your \ngrandparents came from.\n  We say to anyone who wants to become a citizen here: You must become \nan American. You have to raise your right hand. You have to say \nessentially the same oath that George Washington and his officers said \nat Valley Forge, and you basically renounce where you came from. You \nprove you are of good character. You wait for 5 years. You learn our \nhistory. You must learn our common language. Then we are all Americans.\n\n[[Page S1954]]\n\n  We are proud of where we came from, but we are prouder to be \nAmericans. We have made that a great part of our tradition.\n  The late Albert Shanker, the head of the American Federation of \nTeachers for many years, felt passionately about the importance of \nhelping children and new Americans learn what it means to be an \nAmerican. Once he was asked the rationale for a public school. He said \nthe rationale of a public school is to help children learn English, to \nlearn the ``three Rs,'' and what it means to be an American. The hope \nwas that these students would then go home and teach their parents.\n  Since 1906, we have required every new citizen to learn English. \nFederal law requires that all children learn English in public school. \nWe have programs to help adults learn English--including the program I \nwish to put the EEOC's lawsuit money into. We have in No Child Left \nBehind, passed not long ago by this Congress, programs to help children \nlearn English, and schools are held accountable for students learning \nour common language.\n  When the Senate has recently debated immigration, it has passed two \namendments to help value our common language. One was that by 64 to 33 \nwe declared English as our national language. Another, I introduced, \nwas to say that if a new citizen or an applicant for citizenship \nlearned English to a proficient level, that person would be able to \nwait only 4 years instead of 5 years to become a citizen--a way of \nvaluing our common language. We even said we will give a $500 \nscholarship to any applicant for citizenship who wishes to learn \nEnglish, helping them learn English. So in many ways through the last \ncentury we have asserted the importance of our common language.\n  I am sure many of us in the Senate--and many Americans--saw Ken \nBurns' epic series on World War II. My wife and I went to see a preview \nof that series last fall, and we were struck by how magnificent it was. \nKen Burns said he felt, after doing years of work on World War II, the \nwar was the period of the greatest unity in our country's history. \nQuoting a book by the late Arthur Schlesinger, ``The Disuniting of \nAmerica,'' which was written in the 1990s, Ken Burns said: Maybe what \nwe need is a little less pluribus and a little more unum.\n  Where do we get our unum? We do not get it from race. We do not get \nit from gender. We get it from learning American history, and we get it \nfrom our common language.\n  The reason we learn American history is so we can understand and \nlearn the principles that unite us. It is those principles and that \nlanguage which makes it possible for us to say we are all Americans.\n  So the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has turned the civil \nrights laws upside down when it sues the Salvation Army and says: You \ncannot ask your employees to speak America's common language on the \njob.\n  The purpose of the civil rights laws is to unify us, to say no \ndistinctions based on race. We want to be one country. Well, if we want \nto be one country, we need to have a common language, and in this \ncountry that language is English.\n  It was my hope when I was Education Secretary that every child would \ngrow up to speak at least two languages well. One of them would be \nEnglish. That is still my hope today.\n  As I look at the motto above the Presiding Officer's desk, and I \nthink about whose century this is going to be--is it going to be a \nChinese century, a Japanese century, an Indian century, a European \ncentury, an American century?--part of it has to do with our economy, \npart of it has to do with our military strength, a big part of it is \nwhether we can stay one country or whether we become just another \nversion of the United Nations--the United States of America or the \nUnited Nations; whether we can say we are all Americans or whether we \ncan't. One way to help us be able to say we are all Americans, one way \nto unite us is to value, not devalue, our common language.\n\n  So in some ways this is a very small and simple amendment, taking the \napproximate amount of money that a Federal agency is using to sue the \nSalvation Army and other businesses to say: You can't require your \nemployees to speak English on the job, and let's instead use that \namount of money to help adults who want to learn English.\n  We have been sacrificing our unity in the name of diversity for too \nlong. Diversity is a great strength, but our most magnificent \naccomplishment is our unity. You can't become German, you can't become \nJapanese, you can't become French very easily, but in order to be a \ncitizen of this country, you must become an American. The way you \nbecome an American is by showing good character, waiting 5 years, \nlearning our history, and speaking our common language. The Federal \nGovernment ought to be consistently on the side of valuing that common \nlanguage and not on the side of devaluing it.\n  So I hope the Senate, when it has the opportunity, will find the same \nsort of bipartisan support that it had last year, October 16, 2007, \nwhen the Senate voted 75 to 19 to approve the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill containing substantially the language in this \namendment. We will then be able to say to American small businesses, of \nwhich there are hundreds of thousands: No, you don't have to go hire a \nlawyer to come up with some business reason why you need to ask your \nemployees to speak English on the job.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the order is that we will go to Senator \nNelson of Nebraska, and we will reserve the side-by-side for Senator \nAlexander that I will offer on behalf of others at a subsequent moment. \nWe will go to Senator Nelson, and I will ask Senator Nelson not to send \nhis amendment up because in order to maintain the back-and-forth, we \nneed to send a Republican amendment up next. Then, if the Senator from \nNebraska is not here, I will send his amendment up so that it is in the \nqueue.\n  How much time does the Senator require?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Four or 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield up to 5 minutes off the resolution, and if the \nSenator needs more, we will provide it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4212\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I am here to speak about \namendment No. 4212. It is already at the desk, and as Senator Conrad \nsaid, he will call it up at the appropriate point. But I rise today to \nspeak about this amendment to the budget resolution that will create \njobs and make a lasting investment in our national infrastructure. I \nask unanimous consent to add Senator Conrad and Senator Stabenow to the \namendment as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Let me thank as well the current cosponsors \nof the amendment: Senator Baucus, Senator Voinovich, Senator Klobuchar, \nSenator Durbin, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, and Senator Schumer. I \nam pleased to work with my colleagues to increase our investment in \ninfrastructure to help create jobs. I also wish to thank the National \nConference of State Legislatures for supporting my amendment. I believe \nthat as more information is developed about this amendment, others will \nseek to join as well.\n  This amendment is very straightforward. It says that if we are going \nto do additional economic stimulus, then we should invest, not simply \nspend, taxpayer dollars.\n  My amendment doubles the amount in the stimulus in the budget for \n``ready-to-go'' infrastructure projects from $3.5 billion to $7 \nbillion. It is fully paid for and does not increase the deficit \ncompared to the underlying resolution.\n  The budget resolution before us sets aside $35 billion over 2008 and \n2009 for a second economic stimulus package, if necessary, as we \ncontinue to keep a close eye on the economy. Included in this stimulus \nat the present time is $3.5 billion for these ``ready-to-go'' \ninfrastructure projects--projects that can be up and running in a \nmatter of weeks. My amendment would increase this amount to $7 billion \nand is paid for by reallocating a portion of the $30 billion of \nstimulus resources to transportation infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S1955]]\n\n  If Congress decides that additional stimulus is necessary, we need to \nensure that we make a real investment in the economy. Including \ninfrastructure investment will create jobs and make a lasting \ninvestment in infrastructure that is so desperately needed. These are \nprojects that will go wanting without the necessary financial support \nto have them concluded, but they won't go away. Infrastructure needs \nwill continue, and the only way to reduce the need is by investing in \nthem.\n  This amendment in effect kills two birds with one stone: We get the \nimmediate boost to the economy by investment in job creation, and when \nthe economy recovers, the roads we pave and the infrastructure \nimprovements we make will last for years. They are truly, in that \nsense, an investment.\n  When the initial stimulus package was under consideration, the States \nidentified nearly $18 billion in projects that would be classified as \nready to go within 3 months. These are projects that are waiting for \nonly one thing, and that is funding.\n  This amendment does, in fact, create jobs. According to a U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation study, over 40,000 jobs are created for \neach $1 billion we spend on roads and infrastructure. This amendment \nwill create jobs in Nebraska and in all 50 States and will provide an \nimportant boost to the economy at the same time.\n  I also want to be clear what this money is intended for: projects \nthat are ready to go, as I have said, projects that can begin nearly \nimmediately and certainly as soon as funding is available. There are \nalready ready-to-go projects in Nebraska and in all 50 States, as we \nhave been able to determine.\n  States are crying out for help in this area. The National Conference \nof State Legislatures supports this amendment. Our Nation's \ninfrastructure needs are immense and are continuing to the point of \nbeing staggering. We have an opportunity to stimulate the economy, make \nlasting improvements to our infrastructure, and assist in more job \ncreation. We can invest more in this area, and we should invest more in \nthis area. So I urge the adoption of this amendment by my colleagues. I \nask that their support continue as others will join in over the next \nday or so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if I could ask a question of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, this is $3.5 billion in spending which would occur in \nthis budget year, not over the 5 years; is that correct?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. This is not offset in any way, so it would just be added \nto the deficit; is that correct?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. This is part of the allocating, part of the \nstimulus package as it is right now for emergency spending. What it \nwould do is it would allocate part of the $35 billion already set aside \nin the budget to be added to the $3.5 billion to make a total of $7 \nbillion. It doesn't add any more to the deficit or outside of the \ndeficit than is currently indicated in the current budget resolution. \nIn other words, of the $35 billion right now, only $3.5 billion is \nallocated to infrastructure. With this amendment, $7 billion would be \nallocated to infrastructure.\n  Mr. GREGG. So if I could ask the Senator another question, the \nSenator from Nebraska is saying that his amendment simply reallocates \nthe $35 billion----\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. The $3.5 billion.\n  Mr. GREGG. But there was $35 billion put in the mark that was \navailable for stimulus. Is the Senator reallocating those dollars or is \nthe Senator putting $3.5 billion on top of those dollars?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Not on top. We are reallocating, of that $35 \nbillion, an additional $3.5 billion within the $35 billion to \ninfrastructure, making a total of $7 billion within the $35 billion.\n  Mr. GREGG. And if I could ask further, where is the Senator taking \nthe money from?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. It wouldn't be taking money from, it would be \nallocating money that has not yet been allocated. So there would be \nother projects that would not be funded because of this, but it \nwouldn't be taking any money away from anything already allocated \nbecause the balance of it is unallocated.\n  Mr. GREGG. So this is not a 920--this is not offset with a cut in the \n920?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. It moved from function 820 over to 400.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am not sure I understand how this is paid for, to be \nhonest. Maybe the chairman can help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the Senator from Nebraska is exactly \nright. What he is doing with this amendment, which I support, is of the \n$35 billion which is unallocated, the second stimulus package, an \ninsurance policy against further economic downturn, he doesn't add any \nmoney. What he does is of the $3.5 billion that was reserved for \ninfrastructure in the $35 billion, he is doubling that amount to $7 \nbillion of the $35 billion for infrastructure.\n  I think that is a wise thing to do because I frankly think the \ninfrastructure projects are the most stimulative. We know for every $1 \nbillion spent on highways and bridges, 45,000 jobs are created, and \nthose are jobs in America. As my colleague knows, the money is \nreserved--the Budget Committee doesn't have the ability to dictate at \nthe end of the day how it is used. Committees of jurisdiction will do \nthat. But what the Senator from Nebraska is doing is sending a message \nthat of this $35 billion, instead of $3.5 billion dedicated for \ninfrastructure projects that are ready to go--and, in fact, we know \nthere are more than $3.5 billion of infrastructure projects ready to \nfund.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if I could reclaim my time, I think the \nexplanation is that this is a reallocation within the $35 billion which \nwas in the original budget, which basically was added to the deficit.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is true.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you. I think Senator Sessions is ready to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4231\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself, Mr. \n     Vitter and Mr. DeMint, proposes an amendment numbered 4231.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund for border \nsecurity, immigration enforcement, and criminal alien removal programs)\n\n       On page 69, after line 25, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 308. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR BORDER SECURITY, \n                   IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT, AND CRIMINAL ALIEN \n                   REMOVAL PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate may revise the allocations of 1 or more \n     committees, aggregates, and other appropriate levels in this \n     resolution by the amounts authorized to be appropriated for \n     the programs described in paragraphs (1) through (6) in 1 or \n     more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, motions, or \n     conference reports that funds border security, immigration \n     enforcement, and criminal alien removal programs, including \n     programs that--\n       (1) expand the zero tolerance prosecution policy for \n     illegal entry (commonly known as ``Operation Streamline'') to \n     all 20 border sectors;\n       (2) complete the 700 miles of pedestrian fencing required \n     under section 102(b)(1) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. 1103 note);\n       (3) deploy up to 6,000 National Guard members to the \n     southern border of the United States;\n       (4) evaluate the 27 percent of the Federal, State, and \n     local prison populations who are noncitizens in order to \n     identify removable criminal aliens;\n       (5) train and reimburse State and local law enforcement \n     officers under Memorandums of Understanding entered into \n     under section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)); or\n       (6) implement the exit data portion of the US-VISIT entry \n     and exit data system at airports, seaports, and land ports of \n     entry.\n       (b) Limitation.--The authority under subsection (a) may not \n     be used unless the appropriations in the legislation \n     described in subsection (a) would not increase the deficit \n     over--\n       (1) the 6-year period comprised of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2013; or\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\n       (2) the 11-year period comprised of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2018.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we are dealing with an important \nissue; that is, the budget of the United States. Under the Budget Act \nand rules we have established, a budget can be passed without a 60-vote \nmargin, a supermajority. Only a simple majority is required. I think \nthat is a healthy rule because for years there were so many \ndifficulties in creating a budget. So it really gives the majority \nparty the power to pass a budget.\n  The power of a majority party alone to pass a budget means that \ndocument is a defining document, and it defines the agenda for that \nparty. It tells where they stand on matters of taxing, spending, \ndeficits, and the like.\n  I say that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who promoted \ntheir move to majority status--and I certainly understand that goal--\nindicated over the last several years President Bush was spending too \nmuch, they would be more responsible when given the control of the \nCongress and they would produce a better budget for working families in \nAmerica.\n  I note that this budget has a major increase in spending--as did last \nyear's--over the President's request for domestic discretionary \nspending. It contemplates a major tax increase and it will, fairly and \nobjectively stated, increase the deficit. I am concerned about that and \nI wished to make that statement.\n  Chairman Conrad is a wonderful gentlemen, a fabulous leader of the \ncommittee. He asked that I offer the amendment on the floor and not in \nthe committee, and I agreed to do that.\n  I would like to explain the amendment I have offered. It creates a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund for border security, immigration \nenforcement, and a criminal alien removal program. It sets aside room \nin the budget to fully fund existing border security and immigration \nenforcement programs. It is another statement. Also, the members of \nthis Congress meant what we said when we said we wanted border security \nand to complete the fence and many other immigration reform measures \nthat we voted on last year. I will talk about that later. We voted on \nthose things. One of the things that is eroding public confidence in \nthis Congress is that we vote for things and we say we are for things \nand some of them pass and some of them are blocked, but even those that \npass don't get carried out. So a Congressman or Senator can say I voted \nto build a fence, whereas, they may not at all be taking the necessary \nsteps to fund or otherwise ensure that the fence gets built. There are \nother items that are necessary to create a lawful form of immigration, \nbut that is where we are.\n  This amendment, I think, is another opportunity for the Members of \nour body to say we are prepared to move forward and do the things that \nare necessary to follow through on what we promised when we cast votes \npreviously. My amendment is broad. It covers all border security and \nimmigration enforcement programs. But, specifically, it highlights six \nprograms that will need special attention in this year's budget cycle.\n  Those programs are: Operation Streamline, the so-called ``zero \ntolerance'' prosecution policy for illegal entry now in place and being \nutilized by the Department of Justice and Homeland Security in 4 of the \n20 border sectors. I will go into detail about these later. Then there \nis the border fence construction amendment that would complete the 700 \nmiles that we voted on. It would maintain the presence of a National \nGuard at the border. It would provide help and assets to effectively \nexecute the criminal alien removal program, to remove those who have \nbeen convicted of crimes, as it is supposed to be. The section 287(g) \nprogram, which trains State and local officers, would be expanded, as \nwe voted before to do. And the US-VISIT exit portion of the immigration \nlaw that was supposed to have been completed in 2005 yet remains \nuncompleted.\n  I offered this amendment earlier, but I think some objected that the \namendment would create open-ended funding for immigration programs. But \nthis money is not free to be spent. It is not open-ended in reality. It \nhas to be paid for. Full funding for each of these items can only be \napproved if the proper committees come up with the proper funds.\n  Simply put, my amendment gives Congress budget flexibility to fund \nthese immigration enforcement programs if we can find a way to pay for \nthem. And we certainly can. These are not that expensive in the scheme \nof things. They are matters our constituents care about and that we \nhave voted for on a number of occasions.\n  Also, I note the budget resolution our Democratic colleagues have \npassed includes at least 35 of these reserve funds, and only 4 of them \nhave any limitation on funding. The other 31--88 percent--are drafted \njust like my amendment.\n  So here are the proposals. First, it would allow for funding to \nexpand the zero tolerance prosecution policy for illegal entry. Until \nrecently, only the most serious illegal entries and reentries were ever \nprosecuted. Routine offenders caught by the Border Patrol were \nprocessed in a matter of hours and, if they were from Mexico, they were \nsimply returned to Mexico. If they were not from Mexico, they were \nreleased on bail and asked to come back so they could be shipped back \nto South America or the Middle East or wherever, and we would send them \nback to those locations. Of course, 90 percent never showed up once \nthey were released because their goal was to get in illegally from the \nbeginning. That has been improved a good bit. We are still, in most of \nour border sectors, releasing people immediately to return to Mexico. \nThere was a CNN report on this recently. I saw the video. Within hours \nof two individuals being arrested, they videoed the Border Patrol agent \nwalking them, escorting them, back to the middle of the bridge that \ndivides our countries and basically sending them off back to Mexico. \nThe conclusion of the program was that these individuals, probably the \nnext day, again commenced their effort to enter illegally. Since they \nweren't recorded as being apprehended, the program indicated they \nprobably successfully made it into the United States. The result has \nbeen a ``revolving door'' at the southern border.\n  According to the Department of Homeland Security, between 20 and 30 \npercent of all illegal immigrants physically removed from the United \nStates will return within the same year. So a third of them come \nback, we know, the same year. In 2004, of the 169,000 illegal \nimmigrants removed from the United States, 65,000 returned illegally. \nIn 2006, 37,000 out of 195,000 returned.\n\n  In recent months, however, progress has been made. The new zero \ntolerance prosecution policy, called ``Operation Streamline'' by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, has been put into place in 4 of the 20 \nborder sectors--Del Rio, Yuma, Laredo, and Tucson.\n  In just over a year, the guaranteed jail time given under this \nprogram, the conviction process--instead of escorting them back but \nhaving an actual prosecution because it is a crime to enter illegally \nin that manner--has resulted in a 50-percent decrease in the number of \narrests in Del Rio and a 68-percent decrease in the arrests in Yuma, \nproving, I think, with certainty that this kind of consistent \nprosecution and conviction is a critical factor in deterring illegal \nentry.\n  In fact, Secretary Chertoff, a former Federal prosecutor I served \nwith and have known for some time, was in my office last week. I have \nbeen a critic of some of the things he has done, and I have admired \nsome of the things he has done. Secretary Chertoff believes this \nprosecution sends a different kind of message--and I believe it, too--\nthat the United States of America is serious about deterring illegal \nentry into our country. When you are simply escorted back to the border \nand turned loose, that sends a pretty clear message it is not a big \ndeal to enter illegally. These people are not serving long periods of \ntime in jail, but they are prosecuted. A record is made of it, they \nserve some time in jail and a second offense can lead to a higher \npunishment.\n  So I am strongly encouraging DHS and the Department of Justice to \nexpand the zero tolerance policy to the entire southern border by the \nend of the year 2009. Their efforts ought to be praised. In fact, their \nsuccess in deterring illegal entry exceeded what most people would have \never expected. It is a proven technique that ought to be replicated \nacross the border. It would need extra funding to make this happen.\n\n[[Page S1957]]\n\nThis amendment would allow for that. I will note, parenthetically, does \nit cost us more as taxpayers to prosecute everybody who comes across \nthe border when, in fact, you see a 68-percent reduction in the number \nwho come? I suspect that maintaining a clear message that our borders \nare not open will cause the number to reduce, and the number of illegal \nentries is what drives up our costs. If you reduce the number who \nattempt to come illegally, you reduce costs at the same time.\n  No. 2, the Secure Fence Act of 2006 required the construction of 700 \nmiles of fencing on the southern border. Eighty Senators voted for the \nSecure Fence Act. 26 were Democrats. In the House, the bill passed 283 \nto 138. We know the fence construction, combined with other border \nenforcement increases, is already having some deterrent effect.\n  Last year, illegal entries at the border, across the entire border \nfell by 20 percent. Let me ask--I like to ask this question--how many \npeople were arrested last year? That is how we determine basically what \nis happening. The number of arrests fell 20 percent. Well, last year we \narrested, even after a 20-percent drop, 877,000 people trying to enter \nthis country illegally. It was over a million the year before--1.1 \nmillion.\n  A survey conducted by the Mexican Government, released in November, \nshowed a 30-percent drop since 2005 in the number of Mexican nationals \n``looking for a job in another country, or preparing to cross the \nborder.''\n  In other words, the message is getting out. The National Guard \nincreased border patrol, fencing, and prosecution, but people will \nfollow what reality tells them.\n  In San Diego, where the first 14 miles of fencing were built years \nago, the results were significant and immediate. Crime rates fell \ndramatically. According to the FBI crime index, crime in San Diego \nCounty dropped 56 percent. Vehicle drive-throughs fell from between 6 \nto 10 per day, to only 4 drive-throughs in a year. Those occurred only \nwhere the secondary fence was incomplete.\n  It does make a difference. Good barriers make a difference. Good \nborders make good neighbors. If you want to enforce your immigration \nlaws, you have a million people a year coming illegally, and if you are \nnot prepared to build some sort of barrier that is effective, you are \nfooling yourself and attempting to fool the American people. That is \nthe fact.\n  Drug trafficking dropped in the area--marijuana smuggling by 38 \npercent and cocaine smuggling by 88 percent. These new miles of fences \nalong the other parts of the border are expected to mirror the San \nDiego success. There are news articles already describing the deterrent \neffect of the new fencing in Arizona. This is new fencing. On November \n4 of last year, an article in the Houston Chronicle, titled ``Fences \nPresence Felt: Residents on both sides of one border crossing say \nbarrier is doing what it was intended to do'' stated these things:\n\n       The fence works, residents north and south of it say.\n       ``From a law enforcement perspective, it's curtailed a lot \n     of our problems,'' said Sharon Mitamura, a deputy sheriff who \n     patrols the border on either side of Columbus.\n       ``That fence, I love it,'' Robinson, a Minuteman in New \n     Mexico said. ``But being a Minuteman in New Mexico is getting \n     pretty boring. There's no illegals here to be found,'' he \n     said wistfully.\n\n  The bottom line is, the message is being heard: Our borders are no \nlonger open in certain areas. And to continue sending that message we \nmust complete the 700 miles of fencing the Secured Fence Act of 2006 \nrequires.\n  By the end of 2008, the administration, unfortunately, plans on \ncompleting only 370 miles of actual fencing. We need to ensure that \nfunding for the construction of the remaining 330 miles are included in \nthe budget. This amendment will help ensure that occurs.\n  Now, No. 3. This amendment would allow funding for the National \nGuard. In May of 2006, the President announced the deployment of 6,000 \nGuard members to assist Customs and Border Control with surveillance, \ninstalling fences, and vehicle barriers.\n  Since June 15 of 2006, the National Guard units have assisted the \nBorder Patrol by executing logistical and administrative support, \noperating detection systems, providing mobile communications, and \naugmenting border-related intelligence.\n  Operational successes made possible with the National Guard members \ninclude direct assistance in 88,000 apprehensions. They cannot \nthemselves apprehend because of the Posse Comitatus Act, but they are \nable to provide intelligence and surveillance. They accounted for \nincreases in the amount of drugs seized. Marijuana seizures went up by \n309,000 pounds, with the National Guard locating 201,000 pounds of \nthat. There have been 91 aliens rescued from being in trouble in the \ndesert. So they even help save lives in the desert.\n  Although Operation Jump Start has been effective, it is currently \nscheduled to end. Guardsmen currently stationed on the border number \naround 3,000. By this summer, the number will be zero--zero. The Senate \nhas already voted twice that the Guard should stay on the border \nthrough the end of this calendar year at a minimum.\n  The Ensign amendment offered during comprehensive reform authorized \nGovernors to deploy Guard troops through 2008 to engage in border \ncontrol activities to meet training requirements. That was agreed to 83 \nto 10. My amendment, offered to the DOD appropriations bill, funded \nOperation Jump Start through the end of fiscal year 2008. It was agreed \nto by unanimous consent but was stripped from the conference committee.\n  See, we all agree to it. Everybody is for the Sessions amendment. \nYes, we should keep the National Guard longer. But it goes off to a \nconference committee because we have a bill and the House Members have \na bill and the conference committee meets--sometimes I refer to them as \nmasters of the universe--and they just take them out, so the bill comes \nback to the floor and passes and funding for the National Guard on the \nborder doesn't become law.\n  So I, along with the majority of the Senate, do not believe Operation \nJump Start should end before operational control of the border has been \nachieved, as required by the Secured Fence Act, which 80 Senators voted \nfor. If we want to continue stationing Guardsmen on the border in 2009, \nwe must make sure the budget resolution permits funding for the \ncontinuation of Operation Jump Start.\n\n  The mission of the Department of Homeland Security's Criminal Alien \nProgram is to identify criminal aliens--criminal aliens--who are \nincarcerated in Federal, State, and local facilities, evaluate whether \nthey should be removed at the end of their sentences, and to coordinate \na seamless transition from prison to DHS deportation proceedings. A \nperfectly logical thing. Despite this important mission, DHS is only \njust beginning to effectively implement the Criminal Alien Program. \nCongress provided $400 million in 2008 for this program.\n  The Director of the Bureau of Prisons, Harry Lapin, testified before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee that 27 percent of the entire Federal \nprison population is composed of non-citizens--individuals who \ncommitted crimes after they entered the country. They are not in jail \nfor immigration offenses. I am not talking about that. We are talking \nabout assault, robbery, drug trafficking, murder, and the like. That is \na dramatic number.\n  We don't know the exact percentages for all State and local prison \nfacilities, but we do have some snapshot statistics. These statistics \nillustrate that the percentage of State and local jail populations made \nup of illegal aliens is likely to be similar to Federal prison \npercentages in a number of areas.\n  According to a February 2008 California Public Policy Institute \nreport titled ``Crime, Corrections, and California,'' 17 percent of \nCalifornia's jail population was born outside the United States. The \nNew York Times reported that the Los Angeles County Sheriff has \nreported that 23 percent of inmates in county jails were deportable.\n  A Center for Immigration Studies study, authored by Manhattan \nInstitute Scholar Heather McDonald, states that:\n\n       In Los Angeles, 95 percent of all outstanding warrants for \n     homicide (which total 1,200 to 1,500) target illegal aliens. \n     Up to two-thirds of all fugitive felony warrants (17,000) are \n     for illegal aliens.\n\n  A 2007 DOJ report indicates that 73 of 100 criminal aliens are \nrearrested at least once, and that the average criminal alien is \nrearrested six times before\n\n[[Page S1958]]\n\ndeportation. A 2005 GAO report found the average arrest rate for a \nsample population of aliens incarcerated in Federal, State, and local \njails to be even higher, an average of eight arrests per illegal alien.\n  In 2009, we have the opportunity to expand and carry out effectively \nthe existing Criminal Alien Removal Program and to fully evaluate all \nnon-citizens in Federal, State, and local prison populations. It would \nensure that criminal aliens are deported to their home countries at the \nend of their sentences and that they are not released back into society \nfirst.\n  This is the problem. What if a person is in jail serving a sentence, \nis going to be released, and is an illegal who, by law, must be \ndeported as a result of being convicted of a crime in this country. If \nyou allow them to be released from the State or Federal jail before you \nset up the procedure to have them deported, how many do you think are \nshowing up to be deported? They are not showing up. It completely \neviscerates the whole concept of the system.\n  Of course, if we are going to have a deportation system, we need to \nbe evaluating those persons who appropriately and lawfully should be \ndeported as a result of their convictions for crimes--drugs, assaults, \nmurder--and they ought to be deported. It is just not happening \neffectively, and it indicates to me that our Government still does not \nget it--about the things necessary to create a lawful system of \nimmigration that we can be proud of. We ought to be encouraging law-\nabiding people to come here--people with skills, people who speak \nEnglish, people who are going to contribute to our society--and not \nallowing our immigration slots to be filled with persons who come and \ncommit crimes. How logical is that?\n  The success of any nationwide law enforcement effort depends on \neffective partnerships with all levels of law enforcement. Federal \nimmigration agents alone--there are less than 20,000 in the interior of \nthe United States--will not solve our interior enforcement problem. It \nis just a fact. A partnership with the 700,000 State and local law \nenforcement officers is essential if we want to make this system work. \nAnd everybody knows that, frankly. Some who don't want the system to \nwork know it too, and that is why they oppose any effort to give any \nincreased ability of local law enforcement to supplement our effort.\n  To achieve that partnership, cross-designation of State and local \nofficers as Federal agents through the 287(g) program, as done in my \nhome State of Alabama and some other States, should and can occur \nthroughout the country.\n  We talked about this for years. The program was on the books. We had \nto push the Department of Homeland Security to partner with Alabama's \nState troopers to create these cross-designated officers, and it was \nnot easy, but we finally got it done. It has worked exceedingly well \nand it should be done around the country.\n  The latest reported figures show that 34 law enforcement agencies in \nAlabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida,--which has a pretty \ngood program, I know--Georgia--and Saxby Chambliss and Senator Johnny \nIsakson have sponsored this legislation because it was first championed \nby Congressman Charlie Norwood from Georgia, now deceased, and they \nbecame interested in this--Massachusetts, North Carolina, New \nHampshire, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia--have all signed \nmemorandums of understanding with the ICE agencies, and nearly 600 \nofficers have been trained.\n  But that is just a small fraction of the potential that is out there. \nOver the past 2 years, these officers have been credited with \nidentifying more than 37,000 people with possible immigration \nviolations. State and local law enforcement agencies that voluntarily--\nnobody is mandated under this--offer their services to help enforce \nFederal laws should be supported and affirmed. The training we require \nthem to receive should be paid for, and the expenses they incur while \nassisting the Federal Government in enforcing our immigration laws \nshould be reimbursed. So increasing this funding would be helpful.\n  My final point would be to the US-VISIT system. Researchers at the \nPew Hispanic Center estimate that as much as one-half of the illegal \nalien population was admitted legally. Other numbers are about 40 \npercent. They come here on some sort of visa or legitimate crossing \ncard but they just stay and do not return.\n  We don't know who the visa overstayers are because we don't record \nwhen visa holders leave or even if they do ever leave. Until the US-\nVISIT exit system is put into place, we are never going to be able to \nidentify visa overstays. This system was first required 10 years ago. \nThe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \nrequired an automated entry and exit data system that would track the \narrival and departure of every illegal alien as they crossed our \nborders.\n  Following the September 11 attacks, Congress repeated the mandate. \nSeveral provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act, the Border Security Act of \n2002, and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \nrequire the immediate implementation of the automated entry and exit \ndata system and call for enhancements in its development.\n  On September 2005, DHS announced that it would have the entry portion \nof the US-VISIT system installed at the land border ports of entry by \nDecember 31, 2005. Implementation of the exit portion at our land \nborders has yet to occur. Only pilot programs now exist at airports and \nseaports--this despite the fact that deadlines for US-VISIT exit \ncompletion are in current existing law. Are people upset about this? No \ndoubt. We have passed law after law. They are just not getting \nexecuted. For example, December 31, 2003, was the deadline for exit \nsystem implementation at airports and seaports. December 31, 2004, was \nthe deadline for exit system implementation at the 50 busiest land \nports of entry. December 31, 2005, was the deadline for the exit system \nimplementation at all ports of entry--land, air, and sea.\n  Failure to complete this system, I am sad to say, is an indication of \na lack of seriousness about immigration reform by the executive branch, \nand it is an affront to Congress and to the rule of law. Until its \ncompletion, Congress cannot move forward responsibly on a myriad of \nother immigration-related issues, such as expanding a temporary worker \nprogram to meet domestic labor needs that may be critical.\n  How can you have a strong entry and exit system when you can't even \nknow whether somebody leaves the country when they promised to leave or \nthey exceeded their time limit? This is not impossible to do. Workers \nall over America clock in and clock out when they go to work every day \nwith some card that is computerized. Americans can place their card in \na bank machine in France or Brazil or anywhere else and get money from \ntheir banks in the United States. Surely we can clock out people who \nleave this country.\n  My amendment makes sure there is room in the budget resolution to \nfund the completion of the US-VISIT exit system and the other important \ncomponents of a legitimate, workable, lawful system of immigration that \nwe in this Nation should have.\n  The American peoples' instincts on this are absolutely right. We \nallow a million people to enter our country legally every year. We \nought to improve that system in a lot of different ways, but we cannot \nallow large numbers of people to enter our country unlawfully because \nit makes a mockery of law. It breeds disrespect and anger in people who \nwait for months or years to be chosen to enter the country when \nsomebody they know enters illegally.\n  It is the right thing for us to do, to create a lawful system of \nimmigration that meets our highest standards as Americans. It is time \nto get that done. Each one of these things I have mentioned in this \nlegislation is a critical component of creating that lawful system. It \ncannot be done without these. More needs to be done than these, but \nthese are critical.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment as they have \nsupported most of these matters already that are referred to in the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Alabama \npublicly for the courtesy he showed in the Budget Committee markup. We \nhad a circumstance where he offered an amendment. I asked him to \nwithhold a vote on the amendment until we had a\n\n[[Page S1959]]\n\nchance to see if we could work out the amendment. It turns out we kind \nof ran out of time, so we were not able to work out the amendment.\n  Another Senator wanted to have an alternative amendment offered, but \nSenator Gregg and I had already agreed that we would not have \nadditional amendments.\n  The Senator from Alabama was a consummate gentleman and agreed to \nwithhold his amendment until we got to the floor so as not to \ndisadvantage a colleague, although he would have had the right to do \nso. I want to say how much I admire that. That, again, is in the best \ntraditions of the Senate and I think reflects well on the whole body. \nCertainly it reflects well on the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the chairman. Senator Gregg \nand he have alternated chairmanships of the Budget Committee. It is a \ncontentious committee, there is just no doubt about it, because we have \nthings about which we disagree that are important to our members and \nour constituents. But I think both of them have done a really good job \nof conducting the committee with grace, gentility and courtesy, so it \nwas not at all unusual that I would agree with that request, and I \nthank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the key to what the Senator from Alabama said is \nthat we alternate chairmanships, and it is my turn.\n  Mr. CONRAD. You know, at about this stage, you might be careful what \nyou ask for.\n  I ask Senator Pryor if he would not send his amendment up at the end \nof his remarks about his amendment so we can maintain the going back \nand forth? We will slot it in as soon as we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4181\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I rise today to talk about amendment No. \n4181 which, at the appropriate time, I would like to call up but not \nright now. I will defer to the wisdom of the bill managers and their \nprotocol and procedure they have set up.\n  This is a deficit-neutral reserve fund amendment. Even though it is \ndeficit-neutral and only a reserve fund, I do think it is important for \nthis country that we agree to this amendment. It deals with science \nparks. Science parks provide a launch pad that startup companies need \nwhen they are spun out of a university or a company. Many are \naffiliated with a university. They do not have to be. I have \nlegislation I will talk about in a minute that makes it clear that they \ndo not have to be, but nonetheless one of the patterns we see is that \nthey oftentimes are affiliated with a university and that becomes a \nsymbiotic and very productive relationship.\n  Science parks go by many names. They are also called research parks, \ntechnology parks, incubators or business incubators, and technopoles. \nWhatever we call them, they are good at doing one thing; that is, \ncreating jobs and spurring innovation. That has really been their \nhallmark, that they create jobs and they spur innovation. At a time \nwhen our economy is slowing and international competition is growing, \nwe need to do everything we can in this country to spur innovation and \ncreate jobs. These are not just any jobs, these are good-paying jobs, \noftentimes high-tech jobs.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced a bill called Building a Stronger \nAmerica Act, along with Senators Snowe, Bingaman, and seven other \ncosponsors. Many countries, including China, Hong Kong, Singapore, \nIndia, Japan, and the European Union, are investing heavily in science \nparks in order to attract a talented and educated workforce. America \nshould too.\n  My amendment builds on a commitment we made through the America \nCOMPETES Act to develop an infrastructure that will again enhance \ninnovation and competitiveness in the United States. We see that things \nhere in this country are undergoing a dramatic transformation. Our \neconomy is changing. Now our economy is really based on knowledge and \ntechnology.\n  The world's first science park was started in the 1950s and led to \nwhat we now call Silicon Valley. Another park that was early on in this \nwas designed in North Carolina to stop the brain drain in that State. \nToday, it is the Research Triangle Park, and it is home to many of the \nworld's most advanced high-tech businesses, and they employ over 40,000 \npeople.\n  Science parks are often recognized as the gold standard of \ntechnology-led economic development. These are formats, these are \nvenues where smart people, scientists, innovators, and entrepreneurs \ncan collaborate, come together and not just come up with ideas but \nactually come through with the commercialization of new products and \nnew technology.\n  Last year in the Commerce Committee we had a hearing on science \nparks, and Dr. Randall Kempner of the Council on Competitiveness said:\n\n       American job growth will come primarily from small- and \n     medium-size businesses and science parks will play a critical \n     role in accelerating entrepreneurship and innovation.\n\n  According to a study by Battelle, the typical North American science \npark is located in a suburban community with a population of less than \na half million. Most parks are operated by university or university-\naffiliated nonprofits. More than 30,000 workers in North America work \nin a university science park. Every job in a science park generates an \naverage of 2.57 jobs in the economy. Most of these parks were built in \nthe 1980s and 1990s and really have outgrown their original space. \nMadam President, 78 percent of science parks expanded beyond their \nphysical presence after they were created.\n  In Arkansas, we have two excellent examples of successful science \nparks, first with the Arkansas Research and Technology Park, which is \naffiliated with the University of Arkansas and within the city limits \nof Fayetteville. That park today has 27 companies. The average salary \nfor the people who work in that park is $81,000. It is the home of \nGENESIS Technology Incubator, the Innovation Center, the Engineering \nResearch Center, the High Density Electronics Center, and National \nCenter for Reliable Electric Power Transmission. That is at the \nUniversity of Arkansas in Fayetteville. At Arkansas State University at \nJonesboro, AR, the Arkansas Bioscience Institute is focused on plant \nbiotechnology and is completing its Commercial Innovation Center as we \nspeak.\n  Last year, the Arkansas General Assembly established a research park \nauthority to facilitate the development of research parks. The \nauthority and the Little Rock Regional Chamber of Commerce are looking \nat establishing new science parks to leverage the basic research being \ndone at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock and the University of \nArkansas for Medical Sciences, which is also in Little Rock. All three \nof these groups have told me they need additional funding to meet the \ngrowing demand of companies that want to locate in their science parks.\n  Here again we see an opportunity for the Senate to spur innovation \nand create jobs for the U.S. economy. This is not a short-term game. \nBut for a small financial commitment from the Congress, we can really \nspur innovation over the next several decades.\n  Again, I mentioned Silicon Valley. I mentioned the Research Triangle \nin North Carolina. Those are two great examples. There is no reason we \ncannot start this phenomenon all over the country and really build on \nthis knowledge-based and technology-based economy we have today.\n  I am offering this amendment to try to build in the right budget \nroom. Hopefully, what we will do is later this year, in the coming \nmonths--at some point we will pass the broader authorization bill, and \nthen, of course, we will fight the fight when it comes to \nappropriations at the appropriate time. But I believe strongly this \nwill be a very positive thing for the U.S. economy.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider this amendment and consider the bill. \nI definitely ask their support for this amendment today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be charged equally to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1960]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes off the resolution to \nthe Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I will speak for a few minutes about \nthe amendment I have cosponsored with Senator DeMint concerning the \nearmarking process in Congress.\n  It is very unusual that a problem is as bipartisan as this problem \nis. Spending public money is something we should take very seriously. \nIt is one of the most important things we do. We all have to remember, \nit is not our money. This spending of public money should be done on \nmerit; it should be done on a cost-benefit basis; it should be done on \ngetting the most bang for our buck.\n  Spending public money should not be based on your political party. It \nshould not be based on what State you come from. It should not be based \non which committee you are assigned to. And it should certainly not be \nbased on how politically vulnerable you might be in the next election.\n  If you look at the numbers, for example, the minority Members of the \nHouse of Representatives who represent primarily African-American \ndistricts, it is frankly hard to explain that they get less in \nearmarking money than even the Republican Members of the House. Why is \nthat? Many of them are in politically safe seats.\n  In other words, what happens around here sometimes is you get more \nmoney if everyone thinks you need to be able to spend more money \nbecause that will help you get reelected.\n  Well, that is a goofy way to spend public money. That is not the way \nwe should be spending public money. Many of these projects that are \nfunded are great projects. Many of them I support. But distribution is \nnot done on merit.\n  I have heard over and over again the arguments about the power of the \npurse, and that somehow if we do not do earmarking we are ceding \ncongressional authority to the executive branch. Well, with all due \nrespect, for 200 years we did fine without earmarking. I do not recall \nPresident Lincoln or Thomas Jefferson or FDR or LBJ saying it was \nessential for the balance of power in our constitutional form of \nGovernment to make sure that individual Members of Congress have the \nability to personally decide how to spend public money.\n  So I think the idea that this practice, which started in the 1980s, \nlate 1980s, and did not become an art form until the last 5 or 6 years, \nis kind of a hollow argument to say somehow this building is going to \nshake and lightning is going to strike and our power is going to \ndissipate.\n  We are debating this week all the power we have. The power of the \npurse is reflected in our budget amendments and is reflected in the \nappropriations. We continue to make the decisions. We will always \ncontinue to make the decisions about the priorities of the way our \nGovernment should spend its money. That is the way the Constitution was \ndesigned.\n  Finally, there are practices that continue to occur that hurt many \nStates and hurt many citizens in terms of the way we are sacrificing \nthe formula grants and the competitive grants in order to fund \nearmarks.\n  We give haircut after haircut after haircut to our formula grants and \nto our other grants. If you look at the Byrne grants, if you look at \nthe violence against women grants, if you look at the COPS Program, all \nof these were based on merit. I know, because I used to apply for them \nwhen I was a prosecutor. They have been cut and cut and cut while \nearmarks have gone up and up and up. We are still air-dropping. We are \ncontinuing to fund private companies for projects not even requested by \nthe Government.\n  It is time for, as I would say to my kids when they were young, a \ntime-out. We need to take a deep breath, see if we can take another run \nat more reform and see if we cannot get to the business of spending \npublic money based on merit and getting the best value for the dollar, \nnot on the power of an individual Member or who you know.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that \nthe time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nher remarks.\n  Next up is Senator Cornyn. Could the Senator give us a rough idea of \nhow long he will require?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I should not take more than 10 minutes, \nperhaps as few as 5.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator, who is always a gentleman.\n  Then Senator Reed wishes to speak or offer an amendment?\n  Mr. REED. I would offer an amendment. I need 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will have to ask the Senator to speak on the amendment \nbut to reserve sending it up, because we have this order where we have \nto go back and forth. If you are not here, I will send up your \namendment when your slot arrives. It may be a while before your slot \narrives. We are going to go back and forth. It requires a delicate \nbalance. Is that okay with the ranking member?\n  Mr. GREGG. We wish to see the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If you could share the amendment with the Republican side \nso they have a chance. They give us their amendments, we give them \nours.\n  I yield to Senator Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4242\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I have an amendment that will create a \n60-vote point of order against any legislation that raises income tax \nrates on the American people.\n  If this sounds familiar, it is. Last year the Senate voted, by a vote \nof 63 to 35, to pass this particular amendment. In a time when there is \nprecious little bipartisan cooperation in the Senate on important \nmatters, this is a list of the Senators on the other side of the aisle \nwho, on March 21, 2007, voted in favor of this point of order that \nwould require a vote of at least 60 Senators in order to raise income \ntax rates on the American taxpayer.\n  Now I know the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee and \nothers have claimed that this budget does not contemplate an increase \nin taxes for the American people. I frankly do not understand that, \nbecause I do not know how you raise the kind of revenue that is \nnecessary in order to make this budget balance without raising taxes \ndramatically on the American people.\n  But I believe this point of order is an insurance policy, so when \nCongress decides to look into the pocketbook of taxpayers for more \nrevenue, we ought to look first to eliminate Government waste, fraud, \nand abuse.\n  What concerns families and small businesses have about the economy is \nnow is not the time to think about raising taxes. Of course, this \namendment will not hinder our efforts to close down illegal tax \nshelters or close perceived loopholes in the Internal Revenue Service \nCode.\n  The amendment deals with the tax tables contained in 1040 forms that \nthe IRS annually sends to every American taxpayer. Nor will it hinder \nefforts to overhaul the Tax Code. I believe the Tax Code is way too \nByzantine and complex. We need to make our Tax Code fairer, simpler, \nand our tax rates flatter. But any tax simplification and reform effort \nwill need bipartisan support from the Senate.\n  I believe the support for the amendment as we had last year would \ndemonstrate a strong bipartisan commitment not to raise taxes at a time \nparticularly when our economy is starting to show some softness.\n  As former Chief Justice John Marshall once said:\n\n       The power to tax is the power to destroy.\n\n  The power to tax is indeed one of the most powerful tools available \nto the Congress. My amendment puts in place safeguards that will \nprotect the pocketbooks of middle-class families, college students, and \nhard-working American taxpayers, put a safeguard in place that will \nprotect them.\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\n  I know there will be strong bipartisan support for this amendment \nwhen it is offered. I believe it is important that the American people \nhear the Senate's voice that now is not the time to raise income tax \nrates. I ask my colleagues once again to support this strong bipartisan \nprotection for American taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would ask the Parliamentarian, through \nthe Chair, a series of questions, if I could, about the Cornyn \namendment.\n  Does the Parliamentarian have the Cornyn amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not been proposed.\n  Mr. CORNYN. The amendment has not been called up. I would be happy to \ndo so, but I was told that is not possible; that there was an objection \nto calling up the amendment at this time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Actually, I would ask the Senator--we are in this \nsituation in which we try to go back and forth on both sides. There are \na number of other Senators who have preceded you in presenting the \nargument for their amendment, but they have had to withhold actually \nsending it up so we can go back and forth. I do not know if we are at \nthe point where Senator Cornyn can send his amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I am happy to wait for my turn in line.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is next. The amendment can be sent to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I certainly do not want to cut in line \nahead of my other colleagues who have already talked about their \namendments. I will patiently wait my place in line and then call it up.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is OK. You would not be going out of line. We have \ncleared the others who are before you. It would be OK for you to send \nyours up.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4242\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4242.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4242) is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To protect the family budget by providing for a budget point \nof order against legislation that increases income taxes on taxpayers, \n   including hard-working middle-income families, entrepreneurs, and \n                           college students)\n\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. POINT OF ORDER ON LEGISLATION THAT RAISES INCOME TAX \n                   RATES.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--\n       (1) In general.--In the Senate, it shall not be in order to \n     consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report that includes a Federal income tax rate \n     increase.\n       (2) Definition.--In this subsection the term ``Federal \n     income tax rate increase'' means any amendment to subsection \n     (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of section 1, or to section 11(b) \n     or 55(b), of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, that imposes \n     a new percentage as a rate of tax and thereby increases the \n     amount of tax imposed by any such section.\n       (b) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended only \n     by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, dully \n     chosen and sworn.\n       (c) Appeals.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. While we are giving a chance for the Parliamentarian to \nreview this amendment, maybe we can go to Senator Reed for discussion \nof his amendment.\n  How much time does the Senator require?\n  Mr. REED. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island \noff the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am not sure the Senator from Texas heard that \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thought I had the floor, Madam President.\n  Mr. GREGG. If I could interject, what has happened is the \nParliamentarian desires a few minutes to look at the amendment of the \nSenator from Texas. We thought we could grant him that and then during \nthat period have Senator Reed speak for 5 minutes and then come back to \nthe amendment of the Senator from Texas, which would remain pending.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I have no objection.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Texas for his courtesy. We are \ntrying to use the floor time as efficiently as possible. The \nParliamentarian needs a chance to review the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. I thank Senators Conrad and Gregg for graciously allowing \nme to speak.\n  We are debating the Federal budget today. While we do that, thousands \nof families in my State of Rhode Island and across the country are \nstruggling to balance their household budgets. They are, in many cases, \nin dire circumstances. They are dealing with the effects of failed \neconomic policies. Over the last several years, wages have been \nstagnant for most Americans. There has been no real increase in family \nincome for almost a decade. In addition to a stagnant income, they have \nbeen assaulted by extraordinarily high prices. I had bakers in my \noffice today whose bakeries in Rhode Island have to pay 100 percent \nmore for wheat. What is staggering today is a fact my colleagues are \nprobably aware of. The price of a barrel of oil is exceeding $110. That \nis the highest price ever for oil. It is even higher in real terms than \nwe saw in the wake of the oil embargo of the 1970s. So wage growth and \nskyrocketing costs, particularly energy costs, are crushing and \nsqueezing families. I regret that the President's budget proposal does \nnot respond realistically to these current challenges. Instead, it \noffers more of the same.\n  Since he took office, President Bush and his allies in Congress have \nincreased our national debt to over $9 trillion, which is roughly \n$30,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. They have also made \nit harder for working families to make ends meet. In contrast, the \nresolution advanced by Senator Conrad and the majority would provide \nmuch-needed relief for millions of Americans and begin to reverse some \nof the negative trends that have accelerated with President Bush's term \nof office.\n  I am pleased, for example, that the Budget Committee has increased \nthe fiscal year 2009 authorization for low-income home heating energy \nassistance to $2.5 billion, $500 million more than the President's \nrequest. But I believe we need to do more. We certainly need to do more \nwhen the price of oil is soaring above $110 a barrel. That cost will \nquickly translate into heating oil costs, increased prices at the pump, \nand other energy costs throughout the economy and will have dire \nimpacts on families.\n  I will, at the appropriate moment, offer an amendment, along with \nSenator Collins, to provide an additional $2.6 billion for LIHEAP for a \ntotal level of $5.1 billion, the fully authorized amount. As my \ncolleagues know, LIHEAP helps low-income families, seniors, and \nindividuals with disabilities with their heating and cooling bills, \nbills that have become unmanageable, and with the skyrocketing price of \noil, will become even more so. Family budgets have been squeezed. We \nhave to do something to help them out.\n  For example, heating oil prices have increased 138 percent from \nJanuary 2000 to January 2008. Paychecks for working families have not \nincreased 138 percent and neither has LIHEAP funding. We are not even \nkeeping pace with the acceleration in the cost of energy. LIHEAP helps \nthese households avoid making the tough choices between paying their \nenergy bill or putting food on the table or also, in this environment, \npaying their mortgage. So we have to increase, not cut, LIHEAP funding. \nFunding LIHEAP at $5.1 billion would help literally millions of \nfamilies cope with high energy prices during bitter cold winters and \naccelerating costs of energy and hot summers for those who live in the \nSoutheast and Southwest and other parts of the country.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join with me and Senator Collins in \nsupporting\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\nthis vital amendment to the budget. At this juncture, I ask unanimous \nconsent that in addition to the 16 cosponsors listed on amendment 4154, \nas submitted, further, Senators Coleman, Kohl, Leahy, Lieberman, \nLincoln, and Schumer be added as original cosponsors as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. In conclusion, this budget resolution and the amendment I \nhave offered provide a blueprint for legislative action. The amendment \nthat will be offered in its appropriate turn by Senator Conrad will \naddress the critical issue of helping families make ends meet by \nhelping them with their energy costs, both in severe winters and \nscalding summers.\n  However, we have to do much more than this. We have to help people \nwith mortgage bills, the rising cost of food and energy and stagnant \nwages. I hope the administration and my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle will join us in the coming months to enact legislation that \nwill make a huge difference for Americans in all phases of the economic \nissues that challenge them--paying the mortgage, feeding the family, \nheating their home, paying the health care bills, getting jobs in the \nUnited States that pay wages with which they can support their \nfamilies. We could do that. We have done it in the past. There is no \nreason we cannot work together to make it happen now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4181\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I send the Pryor amendment to the desk to be in order \nafter the Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for Mr. Pryor, \n     for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4181.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To add a deficit-neutral reserve fund for Science Parks)\n\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR SCIENCE PARKS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations of a committee or committees, \n     aggregates, and other levels in this resolution for one or \n     more bills, joint resolutions, amendments, motions, or \n     conference reports that would provide grants and loan \n     guarantees for the development and construction of science \n     parks to promote the clustering of innovation through high \n     technology activities, by the amounts provided in such \n     legislation for such purpose, provided that such legislation \n     would not increase the deficit over either the period of the \n     total of fiscal years 2008 through 2013 or the period of the \n     total of fiscal years 2008 through 2018.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Maybe we should thank the desk crew for working under \nvery challenging circumstances because we know we are sending them a \ntremendous flood of amendments and paper. They are having to keep it \nstraight, and we very much appreciate their diligent work.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4242\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I was wondering if we could set the order here before we \ngo back to the Cornyn amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think we could.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the order is now, the Cornyn amendment is the regular \norder, that would be followed by the Pryor amendment in the voting \nsequence, followed by the Allard amendment, followed by a side-by-side \nto the Allard amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, we may have a side-by-side for the Allard amendment. \nWe have reserved that slot at least.\n  Mr. GREGG. And then after this discussion, we would turn to Senator \nBiden.\n  Mr. CONRAD. After I ask the Parliamentarian a number of questions \nwith respect to the Cornyn amendment, which we set aside so the \nParliamentarian could study it.\n  I ask, through the Chair, the Parliamentarian if the Cornyn amendment \nis germane to the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not germane.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask further if this amendment was accepted on the \nfloor, if that would be corrosive to the privileged nature of a budget \nresolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask further if the Cornyn amendment came back from \nconference committee, if that would be fatal to the privileged nature \nof the budget conference report?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would be.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Therefore, I have no choice but to raise a point of order \non germaneness on the Cornyn amendment at the appropriate time. I will \nnot do that now, but I wished to have this conversation in the presence \nof the Senator from Texas. We had this conversation last year. I \nalerted him that this issue was raised with us afterwards, and I wanted \nhim to hear for himself the answers of the Parliamentarian.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I understand the concerns of the \nSenator. It will take 60 votes to waive the point of order. Sixty-three \nSenators voted for the amendment last year. My hope would be they would \nvote with me to waive the point of order. Unfortunately, the Senator is \ncorrect. After 63 Senators voted on a bipartisan basis for this \namendment last year, it was stripped in the conference. Unfortunately, \nthis is the kind of thing that tends to undermine public confidence in \nwhat we are doing, when we see a strong bipartisan show of support for \na commonsense amendment and then, behind closed doors, it is later \nstripped from the legislation. I respect and understand the concerns of \nthe Senator. I will move to waive the budget point of order at the \nappropriate time.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. Now we have time for Mr. Biden, the \nsenior Senator from Delaware. Would 15 minutes be plenty?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask if the chairman would be agreeable \nto recognizing Senator Allard around 5:15 and that debate on his \namendment and any substitute to his amendment be for 1 hour, up to an \nhour equally divided.\n  Mr. CONRAD. One understanding we might have, if that amendment \nconsumes less time or the side-by-side consumes less time, that we go \non to other business.\n  Mr. GREGG. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4164\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. It is a job I don't envy.\n  Let me say at the outset, I have two purposes in rising today. One \nis, I am going to, at the end of my comments, introduce an amendment \nthat restores full funding for the 150 function, the State Department \nbudget, cosponsored by Senators Feinstein, Smith, Durbin, Sununu, Dodd, \nMartinez, Menendez, Snowe, Kerry, Collins, Levin, Voinovich, Obama, \nCorker, Leahy, and Hagel. \n  What I rise to speak to now is an amendment already at the desk, \namendment No. 4164. That amendment will add $551 million to the $599 \nmillion already provided in the budget resolution for the COPS Program \nfor a total funding of $1.15 billion. I thank the Budget Committee for \nallocating the $599 million to the COPS Program in this resolution. \nThat is a significant increase from the President's priorities. In \nfact, for the first time since its inception in 1994, the President's \nbudget proposes to eliminate the COPS Program entirely. I am offering \nmy amendment to get us closer to full funding of the level of $1.15 \nbillion that proved successful in driving down crime in the 1990s.\n  I realize I am a broken record on this issue. Each year my colleagues \nhear me come down and talk about the COPS Program, the fact that we \nhave to fully fund the program. Why am I such an advocate for the COPS \nProgram? Mostly because I wrote the original legislation. There is a \ntendency around here, if you write something, you hang onto it, even if \nit no longer functions. But that is not the reason. It is not pride of \nauthorship. I support it because it works. It worked. It continues to \nwork. And it will work even better if we fund it.\n\n[[Page S1963]]\n\n  In the 8 years following the creation of the COPS Program, we have \ndriven down violent crime by 30 percent in the United States. Cops and \nsheriffs themselves have told us the COPS Program works and is critical \nto their ability to keep communities safe. In addition, we have one \ndozen academic studies showing that COPS grants help reduce crimes in \ncities of all sizes.\n  If it ain't broke, as Ronald Reagan used to say, why fix it? I have \nnever heard the other side argue that this program does not work. They \nall agree it works. But they choose not to fund it because they think \nfunding of local law enforcement is not a Federal responsibility or \nthat we need to defund the program to be fiscally responsible. The \ntruth is, this devolution of Government argument I find not very \ncompelling. The argument that the Federal Government has no \nresponsibility for local crime would be true if the Federal Government \nhad no responsibility, if the States were able to do something about \nthe drugs pouring across our international borders, if, in fact, States \nwere able to affect crime coming across their borders from some other \nStates, if, in fact, they had jurisdiction to reach out and deal with \n60 percent of the crime that occurs in their communities because of \ndrug abuse and drug trafficking. So there is an overwhelming Federal \nresponsibility here.\n  My view is that allowing crime rates to grow and not doing everything \nin our power to protect our constituents is irresponsible. It is not \nthat we are being fiscally responsible, we are being irresponsible by \nnot funding programs we know work.\n  I should point out, the COPS Program actually saves money in the long \nrun. I hear from some of my neoconservative friends, who are big on the \ndevolution of Government and fiscal responsibility, as they talk about \nit. I also hear them use phrases as businesspeople: You have to spend \nmoney to make money. Well, we should, as I say, change the paradigm \nhere.\n  Last March, the Brookings Institute issued a study showing that the \nCOPS Program greatly benefits society as a whole. The study found that \nevery $1.4 billion invested in COPS generates a benefit to society of \nbetween $6 billion and $12 billion by reducing crime. According to \nBrookings scholars:\n\n       COPS appears to be one of the most cost-effective options \n     available for fighting crime.\n\n  That is because when you prevent a crime or you fight crime, you do \nnot pay for the cost of the injury, you do not pay for the cost of the \nphysical damage done to the community, you do not pay for all the \nancillary costs that are associated with high crime rates. You actually \nsave money by spending money on COPS.\n  The Bush administration argues that because crime is lower than it \nwas in the early 1990s, we can afford to slash crime-fighting \nassistance. Well, I find that striking. I start with the basic premise \nthat if we do not see a drop in crime rates each year, then we failed. \nThe fact is, we talk about the number of crimes, violent crimes being \ncommitted in America. If you take the total number of crimes being \ncommitted, even though they have leveled out or are only slightly \nincreasing, they are down from the high points in the mid 1980s and the \nearly 1990s. The fact is, there are still over 1,400,000 of those \ncrimes being committed. Is that OK? Should we not spend money to deal \nwith what is still an incredible number of crimes committed in \nAmerica--17,000-plus murders this year? We need to get back on track \nnow.\n  Our law enforcement agencies are facing a perfect storm. Let me \nexplain why I mean by that.\n  Since he took office, the President has cut annual funding to COPS \nand Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Programs by $1.7 billion. The \nPresident's budget proposes now to eliminate these programs entirely. \nAt the same time, he asks State and local law enforcement to take on \nnew responsibilities--new responsibilities--relating to \ncounterterrorism, homeland security, and immigration duties. The \nPresident is asking cops to do much more and giving them considerably \nless.\n  The FBI agents reassigned away from fighting crime to terrorism--and \nthey must do that--have not been replaced. One investigative report \nlast year stated that the number of criminal cases investigated by the \nFBI has dropped by 34 percent. I am not being critical of the FBI, nor \ncritical of the commitment to counterterrorism. But in our effort to \nprotect America from terrorism, we cannot leave them vulnerable to \nviolent crime on their streets. It does not matter if you get blown up \nby a terrorist or shot by a drug thug on the street, you are dead. You \nare dead. Family members do not make a distinction between how you die. \nWe have to protect them from both the crime on the street and from \nterrorism. That takes a commitment of resources that has been lacking \nin recent years.\n\n  Finally, the economy has slowed down. The Washington Post reported \nrecently that next year 20 States expect their budgets to be in the \nred. As State governments are forced to tighten their belts and cut \nback on critical law enforcement funding, as they do that, Federal \nassistance is going to become even more important.\n  Many of you have heard me say this before: Fighting crime is like \ncutting grass. This spring, when the grass begins to grow, you go out \nand cut it. For 1 week, it is going to look great. Don't cut it for 2 \nweeks, it looks a little ragged. Don't cut it for a month, it is really \nragged. Don't cut it for the summer, and you have a jungle in your \nfront yard.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson once said in another context: Society is like a \nwave. The wave moves on, but the particles remain the same.\n  God hasn't made a new brand of man in a millennia. As long as there \nare people and the population is increasing, there is going to be \ncontinued crime. The idea that we can spend less money one year than \nthe year before in fighting crime I find preposterous because you do \nnot change human nature.\n  Many of you have, as I have said, heard me say this for a long, long \ntime. But the fact is, we have neglected State and local law \nenforcement for much too long, and we have an increasing problem on our \nhands.\n  A recent poll published by the nonpartisan Third Way indicates that \n94 percent of Americans view crime as a ``very serious'' or ``fairly \nserious'' problem. Sixty-nine percent of Americans think violent crime \nis a bigger threat to them than the possibility of terrorist attacks. \nIt is sort of a self-evident proposition, but it is interesting to know \nthey feel that way.\n  The concerns of these Americans are serious, and they are real. Last \nyear, 1.4 million Americans were victims of violent crime. Now, if \ncrime is down from what it was a decade ago, is that an acceptable \nrate? Is it acceptable to say we do not have to spend any more money, \nwe can level off violent crime at 1.4 million violent crimes a year? \nAre we doing our job? Are we winning the war? Are we protecting \nAmericans? How can we justify spending less money when there are still \n1.4 million violent crimes in America? More than 445,000 Americans were \nrobbed. More than 17,000 were murdered. Is there anyone in this body \nwho does not think these numbers are unacceptably high for a civilized \nnation? We know what the solution is. We know how to make American \ncommunities safer. But we know it takes a commitment, and it takes a \nfinancial commitment.\n  In all my years dealing with this issue of crime and the criminal \njustice system, there are only a few things we know for sure. One is, \nthe older you get, the less violent crimes you commit because it is \nharder to run down the street being chased by a cop and to jump a \nchain-link fence when you are 50 years old. So violent crime decreases \nas you get older. The other thing we know for sure is that cops matter. \nIf there is going to be a crime committed at an intersection and there \nare three cops at that intersection, the crime is going to be committed \non the corner of the intersection where the cops are not standing. Cops \nmatter.\n\n  So I find it preposterous that no one has argued against the merits--\nthe merits--of the COPS Program and the crime bill originally written. \nNo one argues that it does not work, but they argue we fiscally cannot \nafford it. Can we afford 17,000 murders in this civilized country? Can \nwe afford 1.4 million violent acts against our fellow citizens? Can we \nafford 445,000 robberies, for which we know if we commit these \nresources of $1.15 billion a year we can significantly reduce the \nnumber\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\nof people being victims of violent crime?\n  My amendment will add $551 million for the COPS Program to support \nthe local law enforcement officials on the front lines, and it is fully \noffset by an across-the-board cut to nondefense, discretionary \nspending.\n  So when the appropriate time comes, I will urge my colleagues to vote \nfor this amendment. I might add, it passed last year. It passed, and it \npassed the appropriations process until we ended up with a continuing \nresolution. So there has been overwhelming support for this, and I \nthink it is needed.\n  Now, Madam President, I would like to turn, in the moments I have \nleft, to an amendment I would like to offer at this time for myself and \nSenator Lugar. We are joined by a number of our colleagues whom I \nmentioned earlier. Our amendment builds on similar work done by Senator \nFeinstein. We all share the same goal.\n  My amendment restores the full amount of the President's requested \n$39.5 billion to the international affairs budget. To put this in \nperspective, for every $19 we spend on the military, we spend $1--$1--\non diplomacy and development.\n  Last week, two distinguished former senior military officers, GEN \nAnthony Zinni and Admiral Smith, came before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee to tell us that we must reorder our Nation's priorities in \norder to protect our national security. With more than 50 of their \nfellow former flag officers behind them, they are calling for a new \nemphasis on smart power--using our Nation's diplomatic and economic \nresources to protect our interests.\n  Secretary of Defense Gates has made the same point absolutely clear. \nHe said:\n\n       Having robust civilian capabilities could make it less \n     likely that military force will have to be used in the first \n     place.\n\n  We can all see the results in both Iraq and Afghanistan of not having \nthose capabilities, the resources, or the plan to turn military action \ninto a sustainable peace.\n  But Secretary Gates was also perfectly clear about the real issue. In \nhis words:\n\n       Sometimes there is no substitute for money.\n\n  He was talking about the need for an international affairs budget \nthat can do the jobs that are now increasingly shifted onto our \noverburdened military or simply are not being done at all. The way we \ndo things now, we have, in his words, ``field artillerymen and tankers \nbuilding schools and mentoring city councils--usually in a language \nthey don't speak.''\n  We have to do better. We face many challenges around the world in the \nrise of religious fundamentalism, the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, the spread of disease, and failed states. They are all \nvectors that, in fact, intersect and cause great threats to us. Not one \nof them can be met solely or even primarily with military force. No one \nknows that better than our men and women in uniform.\n  The message we heard in our committee last week was: ``We cannot rely \non military power alone to make our nation secure.'' Yet, as I said, \nfor every $19 we spend on military resources, barely $1 goes toward \ncivilian programs that can prevent military action, support a balanced \nresponse to security threats, or secure the peace once the shooting \nstops. We spend more in 3 weeks on military operations in Iraq, for \nexample, than we have spent since 9/11 to rebuild and secure \nAfghanistan--the total amount of money spent in Afghanistan, which is \none end of the superhighway of terrorism between Afghanistan and \nPakistan. We have spent less money, since 9/11, in Afghanistan \ndefeating the Taliban and dealing with its civilian as well as military \nneeds than we spend for 3 weeks in Iraq. This amendment will not fix \nthat problem, but it will keep us from making it worse.\n  Last month, I wrote to my colleagues on the Budget Committee asking \nthem to treat the President's budget for international operations ``as \na floor, not a ceiling.'' I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, to \nhave a copy of my views printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Foreign Relations,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2008.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad, Chairman,\n     Hon. Judd Gregg, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate,\n      Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Conrad and Senator Gregg: I write in response \n     to your request for the views and estimates of the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations, as required by Section 301(d) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974, regarding the budget for \n     programs under the jurisdiction of the Committee. Most, but \n     not all, of the programs within function 150 are under the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n       At the outset, I repeat my suggestion made in years past \n     that the Committee consider functions 050 and 150 as part of \n     a ``national security budget.'' Both national defense and \n     international affairs programs are essential to the security \n     of the country, and we should fund both adequately. This was \n     true before the attacks on the United States in September \n     2001, and is even more so today.\n       International affairs funding is the ``first line of \n     defense,'' and the request should be treated as a floor, not \n     a ceiling. The international affairs agencies remain \n     underfunded and understaffed, in spite of increases in the \n     last decade. That is not my conclusion alone, but that of \n     several recent studies performed within and without the \n     government. Therefore, in preparing the budget resolution, I \n     urge you not to reduce the money allocated to function 150 \n     under the President's request.\n       I also urge the Committee to bear in mind the difficulty of \n     estimating foreign affairs funding over the duration of the \n     budget resolution. Predicting the future in foreign policy \n     can be difficult, because so many events outside the control \n     of the United States can affect the course of American \n     policy. I think it safe to say, however, that our \n     international interests are unlikely to diminish over this \n     period; the opposite is true. In the age of globalization, \n     with ever-increasing links in commerce, travel, and \n     communications, it is more likely that our interests will \n     increase. Most important, we face a continuing threat of \n     attack by international terrorist organizations. The \n     unclassified portions of a National Intelligence Estimate, \n     issued in July 2007 (entitled ``The Terrorist Threat to the \n     U.S. Homeland''), stated that the ``U.S. Homeland will face a \n     persistent and evolving terrorist threat over the next three \n     years.'' The main terrorist organization threatening the \n     United States--al Qaeda--has its base of operations overseas. \n     Our foreign policy institutions devote substantial resources \n     to combating al Qaeda and its affiliates in numerous \n     countries overseas. In sum, our security and economic \n     interests dictate that we continue to provide adequate \n     funding for the international activities of our government.\n       Against this background, let me discuss several specific \n     items that your Committee should consider in preparing the \n     budget resolution.\n     Funding for Iraq and Afghanistan\n       The President has requested a relatively small amount of \n     foreign affairs funding for Iraq in the FY 2009 budget--$397 \n     million in foreign assistance funds, and $65 million for \n     State Department operations. But this modest request obscures \n     a much larger supplemental request of over $2 billion for \n     State Department operations in FY 2008. I would expect \n     additional supplemental funds to be requested in FY 2009. \n     This continues an objectionable practice of treating these \n     costs as somehow unforeseen and worthy of exemption from the \n     normal budget discipline. We should not force the taxpayers \n     of tomorrow to bear the costs of today's military and foreign \n     policy priorities.\n       I am pleased that the President's budget contains over $1 \n     billion in additional assistance for Afghanistan, but I \n     remain concerned that the level of commitment falls far short \n     of the President's pledge, made in 2002, of a reconstruction \n     program modeled on the Marshall Plan. In fact, over the past \n     six years the funds spent on Afghanistan's reconstruction \n     equal what we spend on military operations in Iraq every \n     three weeks. The budget presents little cause for optimism \n     that the Administration will adopt a coherent plan for \n     combating the illicit narcotics trade, which remains a major \n     threat to the objective of establishing a secure and stable \n     society. We, and the Afghan people, have waited half a decade \n     for the President's promises to be fulfilled for Afghanistan. \n     It is in our vital national interest to see that this budget \n     funds a new strategy for success rather than a continuation \n     of the failing policies of the past. Accordingly, I expect \n     that the Committee on Foreign Relations will closely review \n     the ongoing programs in Afghanistan and will reauthorize the \n     Afghan Freedom Support Act (P.L. 107-327) at levels higher \n     than those in the President's budget.\n     Non-proliferation programs\n       An ongoing priority of the Committee will be to improve the \n     non-proliferation and counterterrorism posture of the United \n     States. The Administration has emphasized military action \n     against states, but has paid insufficient attention to. non-\n     military efforts to keep the world's deadliest weapons, \n     materials, and technology out of the hands of the world's \n     most dangerous people.\n       Committee priorities in this area will include: ensuring \n     that sufficient resources and authority are available to take \n     advantage of opportunities to verifiably disable and \n     dismantle sensitive nuclear facilities in North Korea and, if \n     possible, Iran (additional resources will be of particular \n     importance if\n\n[[Page S1965]]\n\n     Congress is unable to enact a budget-neutral Glenn Amendment \n     waiver for disablement, dismantlement, and verification \n     activities related to North Korea's nuclear programs, a \n     proposal that is supported by the Administration, Senator \n     Lugar and me); providing robust funding in a timely manner to \n     key international organizations carrying out critical \n     nonproliferation tasks, such as the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency and the Organization for the Prohibition of \n     Chemical Weapons; funding new State Department efforts to \n     promote biosecurity worldwide; and enacting the Global \n     Pathogen Surveillance Act to strengthen the ability of \n     developing countries to detect and combat bioterrorism \n     threats and infectious diseases. I first developed this \n     legislation in 2002, and it has been approved by the \n     Senate twice (most recently in December 2005 as S. 2170, a \n     Frist-Biden-Lugar bill). The authorization of \n     appropriations for these initiatives is expected to be \n     $150 million in FY 2009 and $180 million in each of the \n     out years.\n       Lastly, I would highlight a need that Senator Lugar has \n     rightly raised in the past. The Department's Directorate of \n     Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) is seriously under-staffed and \n     in need of funds to hire more full-time personnel to process \n     munitions license applications. Without an increase in funds \n     for the activities of DDTC, license applications for critical \n     arms sales to support our allies and their activities in \n     Afghanistan and Iraq will continue to be processed far more \n     slowly than we believe would be the case if more funds were \n     available. Last year, for instance, DDTC had to process more \n     than 40,000 cases with only 34 licensing officer positions \n     filled. By comparison, the Bureau of Industry and Security at \n     the Department of Commerce has far more staff to process far \n     fewer cases involving dual-use export licenses. Yet the \n     President's budget request for FY 2009 includes no funding \n     for additional staff at the Licensing Office at the \n     Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-228) \n     authorized $10 million to be available in FY 2003 for DDTC \n     salaries and expenses. Six years later, the Administration's \n     request for FY 2009 is only $6.9 million. A doubling of that \n     figure is warranted, to ensure that DDTC has sufficient \n     funding to hire additional licensing officers.\n     Reconstruction and stabilization assistance\n       A priority for Senator Lugar and me continues to be to \n     significantly improve the U.S. civilian capacity to undertake \n     stabilization and reconstruction missions in countries that \n     are recovering from War or conflict. I am encouraged that the \n     President has requested $248 million for the Civilian \n     Stabilization Initiative (CSI), and I urge your Committee to \n     assume funding for this initiative. The request level for the \n     CSI would support a civilian active response corps of 250 \n     personnel, a standby response corps of 2,000, and a civilian \n     reserve of 2,000 drawn from the general U.S. workforce. This \n     capacity is the core of legislation which Senator Lugar and I \n     have introduced in every Congress since the 108th Congress. \n     The Senate approved our bill in the 109th Congress and, with \n     strong support from the Administration, we are working for \n     enactment of the current version (S. 613).\n     Global health\n       Progress in the battle against HIV/AIDS constitutes one of \n     the leading accomplishments of this administration and U.S. \n     foreign policy in recent years, but the President's request \n     for global health funding, including HIV/AIDS, will fail to \n     build on those achievements. The request includes a very \n     small increase for HIV/AIDS funding overall, but it cuts \n     funding for the multilateral Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis, and Malaria by $340 million from the enacted \n     funding level for FY 2008, requesting only $200 million \n     within State and Foreign Operations and $300 million within \n     the Health and Human Services budget. In keeping with \n     Congress's strong support of the Global Fund, I urge that the \n     budget resolution assume additional funds for a U.S. \n     contribution that will be provided within the 150 account. \n     The President's budget request also significantly reduces \n     funding for Child Survival and Health, including a \n     substantial cut in bilateral funding to combat tuberculosis, \n     despite the fact that drug resistant strains of tuberculosis \n     are growing increasingly common and more dangerous.\n       Additionally, I would note that the authorization period \n     for the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 will expire at the end \n     of FY 2008, unless extended by Congress. I believe that a \n     strong, bipartisan majority in Congress is committed to the \n     reauthorization of these important and successful programs. I \n     expect that the Committee will initiate and Congress will \n     pass reauthorization legislation. Therefore, the budget \n     resolution should assume the continuation and, I hope, \n     expansion of these programs.\n     International Violence Against Women\n       Current U.S. efforts to address violence against women are \n     well intentioned, but fragmented and piecemeal, and lack \n     systemic integration into current U.S. foreign assistance \n     programs. Our approach to this issue can, and needs to be, \n     more effective. Senator Lugar and I recently introduced \n     comprehensive legislation to address the issue, entitled the \n     International Violence Against Women Act (S. 2279). The bill \n     contains three primary components: First, it reorganizes and \n     rejuvenates the gender-related efforts of the State \n     Department by creating one central office, directed by a \n     Senate-confirmed Ambassador who reports directly to the \n     Secretary. The Coordinator will be charged with monitoring, \n     coordinating, and organizing all U.S. resources, programs and \n     aid abroad that deals with gender-based violence. Second, we \n     know that in humanitarian crises, conflict and post-conflict \n     environments, women and girls are even more vulnerable to \n     horrific acts of violence. The legislation requires training, \n     reporting mechanisms and other emergency measures for those \n     who are working directly with or protecting refugees and \n     other vulnerable populations. Finally, the Act mandates a 5-\n     year, comprehensive strategy, with coordinated programming, \n     to prevent and respond to violence against women in 10 to 20 \n     targeted countries. The Act authorizes $175 million a year to \n     support programs to prevent and address violence. against \n     women in areas such as strengthening criminal and civil \n     justice systems, enhancing women's access to property and \n     inheritance rights, improving access to health care and \n     education, and supporting public awareness campaigns to \n     change social norms. I urge your support for the additional \n     funding contemplated by this bill.\n     Millennium Challenge Corporation\n       The President has requested $2.225 billion to fund the \n     Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in FY 2009, which is \n     significantly below the FY 2008 request of $3 billion. I \n     remain concerned about the lack of funds disbursed by MCC and \n     delays in implementing its Compacts. Of the nearly $7.6 \n     billion appropriated to MCC since 2004, only $145 million has \n     been disbursed to date. At the same time, MCC enjoys the \n     continued support of the development community and represents \n     one of the few institutions in the U.S. Government dedicated \n     to providing longterm development funding. Given the slow \n     pace of disbursements, Congress has continued to reduce the \n     President's requests. This year, he has scaled back his \n     budget request to an appropriate level. Therefore, I \n     request the Committee assume MCC will receive its full \n     funding request.\n     Development Assistance funding\n       The President requests an increase in funding for the \n     Development Assistance account to over $1.6 billion, \n     reversing a declining trend in this account as well. I have \n     watched with increasing concern as the Administration has \n     diverted funds from the development assistance account to the \n     shorter-term Economic Support Funds. I believe adequately \n     funding both accounts is critical to supporting a multi-\n     faceted and balanced foreign policy. The programs supported \n     by Development Assistance funds--basic education, water and \n     sanitation, agriculture and trade capacity building--are \n     essential building blocks for developing countries. I support \n     the request level for this account.\n     Humanitarian assistance\n       I am concerned by the President's reduced request for \n     humanitarian assistance funding, especially funds for the \n     International Disaster and Famine Assistance account. The \n     Administration has conveyed that it intends to request \n     additional funds for this account through a budget \n     supplemental. I do not believe this represents the best \n     approach for dealing with emergencies as they arise. In each \n     of FY 2004 through FY 2007, the total appropriation for the \n     International Disaster and Famine Assistance account has \n     exceeded $500 million. There is little reason to expect this \n     year to be any different, yet the President's request stands \n     at $298 million. As a result, humanitarian agencies working \n     on the ground are forced to plan in a vacuum, leading to \n     lives lost and inefficient expenditure of taxpayer funds. I \n     believe it is much more sensible to fully fund these accounts \n     in the regular budget.\n     Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities\n       The President's request for Contributions for International \n     Peacekeeping Activities--the account through which we pay the \n     U.S. share of United Nations peacekeeping operations--\n     significantly underestimates the amount that we will be \n     required to pay for the United States' proportionate share of \n     assessments in 2009. The estimate of U.S. payments for fiscal \n     year 2008 was $2.3 billion; the budget request for fiscal \n     year 2009 is $1.5 billion. We know that the need for \n     peacekeepers in Africa alone is immense, and projected to \n     remain the same, if not grow. Darfur, Chad, and Somalia are \n     still in the grips of terrible conflicts. The Democratic \n     Republic of Congo, which has seen horrendous violence in \n     recent years and contains the largest of the U.N. \n     peacekeeping missions, may be on the verge of a breakthrough \n     toward genuine peace and needs a stable environment to \n     support such a breakthrough. The President's budget request, \n     however, would effectively cut funding for nearly all of the \n     U.N. peacekeeping operations from estimated 2008 levels, and \n     in particular a cut of $75 million for the Congo mission, a \n     $56 million cut for the mission in Liberia, and a cut of $39 \n     million in the Cote d'Ivoire mission. No justification for \n     these reductions is provided in the budget request; the \n     budget resolution should assume that these projections are \n     inadequate.\n     Migration and Refugee Assistance\n       The request for $764 million for the Department of State's \n     Migration and Refugee Assistance (MRA) account represents \n     deep cuts from the Fiscal Year 2008 appropriation of $1.023 \n     billion. These cuts are most troubling at a time when \n     significant refugee crises\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\n     continue in nations such as Thailand and Chad. and where \n     refugees remain in camps for a decade or more in some regions \n     of the world. Of greater concern is that the President's \n     request makes these cuts following a year where up to two \n     million Iraqis have now sought refuge in neighboring \n     countries in the Middle East, millions more Iraqis are \n     internally displaced within Iraq, and at a time when the \n     world community is struggling to address the needs of these \n     populations. The budget resolution should assume a higher \n     level of funding, at least consistent with last year's level.\n     USAID operating expenses\n       The President reverses a declining trend of funding towards \n     USAID's operating expenses by increasing its FY 2009 funding \n     request to over $767 million. This will cover critical \n     salary, operational, administrative, IT and central support \n     costs. I believe it is a well-needed and much delayed step in \n     the right direction. In particular, this request will allow \n     the Agency to recruit, hire and train 300 new Foreign Service \n     Officers, barely covering attrition rates. We have asked the \n     Agency to expand its mission and operations into new theaters \n     like Iraq and Afghanistan. We cannot expect it to achieve \n     U.S. foreign policy objectives if we do not provide \n     appropriate resources. I view this request as just the first \n     step in a comprehensive reform and overhaul of how USAID \n     operates.\n     State Department operations\n       The President has requested a 6.5 percent increase in the \n     operating budget of the Department of State. Much of this is \n     devoted to addressing personnel shortfalls and the need for \n     more officers trained in difficult languages. The lack of \n     experienced officers with adequate language skills in \n     languages such as Arabic or Chinese is well known. In \n     addition, several studies in the past few years--including by \n     the Government Accountability Office and the Center for \n     Strategic and International Studies--have noted that the \n     Department suffers from serious personnel shortages. \n     Altogether, the budget requests 1,543 new positions in the \n     Department, of which 448 would be funded by fees in the \n     Border Security program (i.e., visa and passport fees). I \n     support this increase in personnel.\n     Extension of Overseas Private Investment Corporation\n       The basic authorities of the Overseas Private Investment \n     Corporation (OPIC), set forth in Section 234(a), (b), and (c) \n     of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, expired at the end of \n     FY 2007, but have been extended by Congress to April 1. The \n     House has approved a four year reauthorization (H.R. 2798); \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations ordered reported a \n     substitute version of this bill on February 13. I believe a \n     majority of the Senate supports OPIC programs. Therefore, the \n     budget resolution should assume the continuation of OPIC \n     operations.\n     Direct spending\n       I request that the Committee provide the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations with a small allocation (not more than $10 \n     million) for direct spending for Fiscal Year 2009. In recent \n     authorization legislation for the Department of State, the \n     Committee has approved provisions related to management and \n     personnel in the Department that have resulted in small \n     amounts of direct spending, though most of these provisions \n     affect direct spending and revenues by less than $500,000 \n     annually.\n       I appreciate your consideration of these views and look \n     forward to working with you on the budget resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, working under tight constraints, the \ncommittee reduced the President's budget request by $4.1 billion. I \nunderstand they have a difficult task and a great staff, but I believe \nwe have to do a lot better.\n  I ask my colleagues today to join me, when this amendment comes \nforward, in restoring the full $39.5 billion the President requested. \nThat will allow us to at least continue the work now underway to help \nrebuild Iraq and Afghanistan, to support our ongoing nonproliferation \nprograms, to provide the manpower and skills for our Civilian \nStabilization Initiative, to fight AIDS, and to do all the things that \nreduce threats, relieve human suffering, and help to rebuild the moral \nstature of the United States in the world.\n  Our amendment is supported by the One Campaign, Interaction, the U.S. \nGlobal Leadership Campaign, and many other groups, many of whom are men \nand women who have worn the uniform their whole life.\n  The money we are asking for is less than a couple weeks of military \noperations in Iraq. It is an absolutely essential investment in our \nnational security. So at the appropriate time, I will urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleagues for the time on the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to enter a plea to my colleagues: \nWe need an attitude adjustment around here. We need an attitude \nadjustment around here. Here it looks pretty placid. Underneath all of \nthis, there is a great deal of turmoil. If we are going to complete \nthis in any reasonable way, we have to have people be more cooperative, \nless confrontational, less insistent on side-by-side amendments for \neven minor matters. I plead with my colleagues. I have a feeling what \nwe have here is a lot of staff members who have gone into hyperactive \nmode, insisting on things in the name of their boss, and I bet their \nboss doesn't even know. I bet a lot of bosses would be a little \nembarrassed, frankly, about the insistence being made here from their \nstaffs about how they have to have this and they have to have that, no \nmatter how minor, no matter how insignificant, no matter how petty. I \nwill tell my colleagues, it is wearing pretty thin with me. It is \nwearing real thin with me. I want to send that message.\n  Senator Gregg and I have been here for hours, we will be here hours \nmore. We were here all day yesterday. Let's get serious. If we want to \nget done, then everybody is going to have to start getting a little \nbetter attitude about getting done. I hope people think very carefully \nabout what I have said.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Conrad-Pryor \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4246\n\n  (Purpose: To raise taxes by an unprecedented $1.4 trillion for the \npurpose of fully funding 111 new or expanded Federal programs)\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk has not yet reported the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4246.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I simply ask--we have an order to go \nthrough. We will protect the rights of the Senator from Colorado to \nhave it voted on and he is actually in the queue to come after Senator \nPryor at this point. So I don't think the Senator from Colorado needs \nto ask for the yeas and nays right now.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire, and I will \nrespect those wishes. I will move right to the debate on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, one of my goals for this debate is to \nfight what I see as an erosion of fiscal discipline in the budget. I \nhave offered an amendment to fully--I planned on offering an amendment \nto fully budget for the war, a war we know we are going to pay for but \nwe are underbudgeting for by about $100 billion. I had planned on \noffering an amendment to tighten the requirements on reserve funds so \nthey cannot be gimmicked into adding billions of dollars in spending. I \nplan on offering an amendment to curb the use of time shifts to allow \nbudgets to falsely make claims on spending levels when the true picture \nis unchanged. I had planned on offering an amendment to allow authority \nto fight Medicaid waste, fraud, and abuse to be extended.\n  I am offering another ``truth in budgeting'' amendment now. I think \nwe\n\n[[Page S1967]]\n\nneed to work harder to tie what is in this budget with what is actually \ngoing to be spent by the U.S. Government.\n  As a component of that work, I want to add an amendment--an amendment \nI intend to vote against, but an amendment I think needs to be a part \nof this process--that will budget for some of the rhetoric we are \nhearing on the campaign trail. Three of these amendments could be \noffered, but I am going to offer only one.\n  Senator Obama has offered 188 campaign proposals that would add up to \nat least $300 billion in new annual spending. That has a 5-year cost of \nmore than $1.4 trillion. Of the 188 new spending proposals, the $300 \nbillion pricetag only covers 111 proposals. There are another 77 \nproposals with unknown cost estimates that will add billions to this \nnumber. This new spending, if enacted, would represent an almost 10-\npercent increase over the President's budget for fiscal year 2009.\n  To put this in perspective, this $300 billion spending proposal would \ncost more than 42 States' budgets combined when we look at their \ngeneral fund expenditures. It is more than the United States spent last \nyear on imported oil, and it is more than 60 percent larger than any 1-\nyear Federal spending increase ever.\n  Who will pay for the proposed $300 billion increase in spending? The \nmiddle-class American taxpayers and small businesses, which are the \nengine of growth for our economy, that is who. Raising taxes on just \nthe rich simply won't cover it.\n  Under pay-go budget rules, new spending or tax cuts are paid for by \nspending cuts or tax hikes. The CBO budget baseline already \nincorporates the extra revenue due to higher tax rates, so the end of \nthe Bush tax cuts won't pay for the proposed spending and still satisfy \nour pay-go requirements.\n  Senator Obama has promised to pay for his record new spending \nincreases with a tax increase on families making $250,000 and over. \nHowever, this increase would only yield $225 billion over 5 years. Now, \nthat is a far cry short of the $1.4 trillion required under his new \nspending plan. So we will need to raise taxes on the middle class and \nsmall businesses or deficit spend. Those are the choices we have.\n  According to CBO, President Clinton's 1993 tax increase raised taxes \n$240.6 billion over 5 years. The late Senator Patrick Moynihan called \nit the ``largest tax increase in the history of public finance in the \nUnited States or anywhere else in the world.'' This proposal will \nincrease spending $300 billion in a single year.\n  To finance the first year of this proposed spending--the $300 \nbillion--Congress would need to increase taxes on the top 1 percent of \ntaxpayers by 57 percent. Under that scenario, taxpayers with incomes \nover $365,000 would see a tax hike of at least $40,300 on top of what \nthey are currently paying. That is simply not realistic. So if Congress \ndecides to widen the pool of taxpayers footing the bill, it would have \nto raise taxes on the top 5 percent by 38 percent. It would have to \nraise--the top 10 percent of taxpayers, it would have to raise their \ntax rates by 32 percent; or the top 25 percent by raising their tax \nrates 26 percent; or the top 50 percent of taxpayers by raising their \ntax rates 23 percent.\n  The top 50 percent of American taxpayers, who already pay 96.9 \npercent of all Federal income taxes, are those who earn $31,000 of \nadjusted gross income or more.\n  To translate this point into language everyone can understand, if you \nhave an income of $104,000 or more, the plan would cause your tax bill \nto go up at least an additional $5,300 a year. If you have an income of \n$62,000 or more, the plan will cause your tax bill to go up at least--\nat least--$2,300 a year. This is on top of the $2,300 increase already \nassumed by the failure to extend the current tax policy that was put in \nplace by this President and a Republican Congress. But we are not just \nlooking at new spending. He also wants to balance the budget and stop \nspending the Social Security surplus. If he follows through with these \npromises, it would mean the average taxpayer earning $62,000 would see \ntheir income tax bill rise 5,300 or 61 percent, or the average taxpayer \nearning $104,000 would see their income tax bill rise by 12,300, or 74 \npercent. The average taxpayer earning $365,000 would see their income \ntax bill rise by an astounding $93,500. That is a 132-percent increase.\n\n  Keep in mind that all these tax increases would be on top of the \n$2,300 tax increase 43 million families will feel, when the current tax \npolicy expires; the $2,200 tax increase seniors will experience, when \nthe current tax policy expires; and the $4,000 tax increase small \nbusiness will have to pay, when the current tax policy expires.\n  If such a massive hike is deemed politically undoable, all of this \nstaggering spending would simply be added to the Federal debt each \nyear, to the tune of over $1.4 trillion over 5 years. That debt would \nbe passed along to our children and grandchildren, with interest.\n  I will oppose this amendment. But I think we need to include these \nproposals in our budget debate. I refer to, and other Members have \nreferred to, this as the ``Obama spend-orama.'' It is a huge spending \nproposal that he is talking about in the campaign, which we can expect \nhim to present to Congress if he is elected President. The consequences \nare a huge increase. When you pay for that, he is going to have to \nimplement a huge tax increase. That is on top of the expiring taxes \nthat will be taking place in the next 2 or 3 years.\n  So we have a tax increase built into current law that will be \ncompounded by this type of spending plan.\n  My point is that the taxpayers of this country simply cannot afford \nthis kind of budgeting. Their taxes are too high. They are going to be \ntoo high in the next 2 or 3 years. We are going to have tax increases \nwhen our economy can least afford to deal with them.\n  So I ask my colleagues to join me in voting against this ``Obama \nspend-orama'' amendment. I think it is the wrong answer in today's \nworld. We need to have the American people keep their money in their \nown pockets so they can spend it on their own family needs, so it can \nbe used in their local communities to take care of the needs of those \ncommunities in which they live. Sending it to Washington and sending it \nback in some type of programmatic dollars simply will not do the trick \nto keep our economy growing, and that is certainly not what I want to \nsee.\n  I came to Washington to make sure we kept power at the State and \nfamily level. So I am proposing this amendment so we can have this \ndebate and move forward with this budget policy, which we may have to \ndeal with after this particular Presidential election.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator Burr. I will yield the floor so he can \nraise his concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his amendment. I \nwant to make it clear to my colleagues in the Senate that you should \nnot vote for this amendment. I will say that again. You should not vote \nfor the Allard amendment.\n  The amendment reflects the proposals that one candidate made in the \nPresidential race to, in a blanket way, spend $300 billion a year--the \nfirst year. We all know if you have 1 year of spending up here, all you \nneed to do is multiply it by how many years you are going to watch it \nbecause you will end up close to what the total is. If you look at over \na 5-year period, you are looking at a tremendous growth in spending.\n  Now, this may be considered by some an economic stimulus package--I \nthink that is probably the only way it could be billed--and that we are \ngoing to grow the size of the Federal Government through what they \nspend. That is not how I envision economic growth. I envision that when \nyou fuel, through policies, the commitment by the private sector to \ninvest in bricks and mortar and buy new equipment, to create jobs and \nhire our children and grandchildren, to continue to innovate to bring \nnew resources to the marketplace and make sure the U.S. economy grows--\nnot the U.S. Government--I think if the American people wish for \nanything today, they wish we would slash the size of the Federal \nGovernment. They wish we would cut the number of employees and that we \nwould actually take a look at the programs that the Federal Government \nhas that we have funded--and that we created many times--that don't \nwork today, and actually fix them and make\n\n[[Page S1968]]\n\nthem work or get rid of them. But, no, in typical fashion, every \nelection year we say the Government is broken, this or that doesn't \nwork, so let's create new programs. Let's not try to fix the ones that \nare there. Maybe they will just go away on their own. But they never \ndo. Spending piles up and piles up.\n  So there is a big difference as we go into this budget debate, and as \nwe go into this election year. The question is, are you going to ask \nthe private sector to fuel the economic growth? Are you going to ask \nthe private sector to invest in bricks and mortar and job creation or \nare you going to let the Federal Government do it? Our track record in \nthe Federal Government is not too good.\n\n  Senator Obama's $300 billion spending proposal--in one year, again--\nwould cost more than 42 State budgets combined; 42 of the States in \nthis country, in total, have a smaller budget than the $300 billion \nthat Senator Obama is proposing to spend in the first year of his \nadministration.\n  Quite frankly, who will pay for the $300 billion increase in the size \nof the Federal Government, the spending and the number of employees in \nthe Federal Government? The American people will, the middle class \nwill. I think my colleague from Colorado said it very well--that even \nthough the rhetoric says we are going to target those people at just \nthe top of the income level, that Congress would need to increase taxes \non the top 1 percent of taxpayers 57 percent, which would be a $40,000 \nincrease, if you want to try to raise it just on the backs of the \nwealthiest or highest taxpayers. In all likelihood, the average \ntaxpayer earning $62,000 a year would see their income tax rise $5,300 \nor 61 percent. That is how low you would have to go on the taxable \nscale to be able to raise the money you need to fund the $300 billion \nincrease in the Federal Government.\n  Let me put things into perspective. CBO said that President Clinton, \nin 1993, raised taxes in this country $240.6 billion over 5 years. The \nlate Senator Moynihan, from New York, called it the ``largest tax \nincrease in the history of public financing in the United States or \nanywhere else in the world.'' Now, what Senator Obama is proposing for \na spending increase in 1 year is bigger than the 5-year increase that \nPresident Clinton imposed on the American taxpayer, which was the \nlargest in the history of the country or, as Senator Moynihan said, \nanywhere else in the world. Senator Obama has promised to pay for this \nnew record spending with tax increases on families making over $250,000 \na year. That is a pretty attractive target, as we have learned. I think \nmore Americans aspire to get there than worry about getting there.\n  However, as my dear friend from Colorado points out, this increase \nwould only yield $225 billion over 5 years, which is a far cry from \nwhat the amount is that we will need, which is $1.4 trillion. I will \nsay that again. It is $1.4 trillion, which is required under the new \nspending program.\n  So in typical Washington fashion, we have a proposal by somebody to \nspend $1.4 trillion and to pay for it in total with the taxes on just \nfamilies making over $250,000 in income, which would equal $225 billion \nover 5 years. Somehow in Washington that is understood as a promise to \npay for it in total--$225 billion collected in taxes and $1.4 trillion \nspent.\n  I don't need to belabor the point. I am here to beg my colleagues to \nvote against this amendment. Vote against my friend from Colorado. Turn \nhim down. America doesn't need us to spend more money. They need us to \nfix the programs designed to affect the American people today. We don't \nneed to tax the American people more. We need to tax them less. We need \nto look at corporate taxes in this country and we need to reduce them. \nWe need to look at health care and fix it. We need to look at education \nand we need to figure out how every child crosses the goal line of \ngraduation on time. Government is not going to do that. Communities and \nthe private sector are the ones that will invest in bricks and mortar \nand will create the jobs. If we create them here, it is not the job \nmost Americans want. If we allow the private sector to create those \njobs, the future of every child in this country is unlimited, only \ncontrolled by their commitment and their willingness.\n  Let's make sure our investment is to make sure our policies support \nthe private sector, our programs help the American people, and that we \ndon't fuel the economy fictitiously by proposing that the Federal \nGovernment can increase spending and, in fact, balance it on the backs \nof a select few. It will be like every other tax increase. We will \nbalance it on the backs of Americans who cannot afford any more taxes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina \nfor his comments. He is entirely right. This is an appropriate time to \nconsider this because we are talking about the budget of 2009. Whoever \nis going to be the next President, we are talking about his or her \nbudget. We are talking about the same year he or she will be in his or \nher first year in office.\n  There is a debate going on out on the campaign trail for President, \nand I think we need to seriously look at the proposals that are being \nput forward on the campaign trail. This particular amendment looks at, \nright now, the leading Democrat candidate for President, the proposal \nhe is going to be making, with the 188 programs he is promoting out \nthere. We have done an analysis on 111 of them. Spending just goes \nthrough the roof. Consequently, taxes will go through the roof. If you \ndon't raise taxes to take care of the spending program, then your \ndeficit spending is going to go through the roof.\n  I think this is a meaningful amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote \nno, and my view is that, if you make this argument that you are going \nto make the rich pay for all these programs, that just cannot happen. \nIt will filter down, and the middle class and small businesses are the \nones that will carry most of it.\n  I have mentioned this before on the Senate floor, and I will say it \nagain. If you want economic growth in this country, it comes out of the \nsmall business sector. When you raise their taxes markedly, it is going \nto have an adverse effect on the economy. So this is the wrong solution \nat the wrong time. I ask my colleagues to vote no on this important \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how is the time being charged now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Then I ask that the time I am on the floor and the time \ngoing forward be charged against the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the order. Time is being charged \nagainst the resolution.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I might have the floor, there are a \nnumber of folks who wish to speak to this bill and have amendments \nrelative to the bill. I strongly urge them to wander over here in the \nnext few hours and give their talks and talk about their amendments. It \nis possible that we will start the vote-arama tomorrow. Once we start, \nthere is not going to be any discussion. There will be one vote after \nanother, with a very brief time period in between equally divided. If \npeople want a substantive discussion on their amendments, now is the \ntime to come over and make their presentation.\n  Taking my own advice, I will mention an amendment I intend to offer \nwhich deals with the H-1B issue. H-1Bs are visas which go to people who \ncan contribute immensely to our economy. We have an economy that \ndepends on value added--smart people creating ideas which create jobs. \nA lot of those smart people come from overseas, and we should take \nadvantage of them wanting to come to the United States. One of our \ngreat strengths as a nation is people want to come here, and we should \ntake advantage of that strength and convert it to an economic engine.\n  The way to do that, of course, is to encourage people who want to \ncome here and who are going to contribute to the economy by being job \ncreators--rather than taking jobs, they will be actually job creators--\nto come to the United States. So I will have an amendment to expand the \nH-1B program. This is critical to the high-technology industry \nespecially.\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\n  I expect that this amendment will be strongly supported by those who \nwish to expand our economy, especially by advancing our leadership in \nthe area of technology, and I know it will be strongly supported by \neverybody----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Illinois for a \nquestion. There will be no dead people brought over to the United \nStates.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Lucky 7,000.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from New Hampshire, if I might, is he \naware of the companies that took advantage of the H-1B visas in 2006, \nwhich companies led in the number of H-1B visa awards?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I know the Senator from Illinois doesn't like the H-\n1B visa program, doesn't desire it to be expanded. I appreciate that \nand I understand we have a difference of opinion on that, and when he \nwants time, I will be happy to listen to his views again. But the fact \nis I happen to think, even though there may have been abuses in the \nprogram, I don't think they were at the core of the problem; that the \nprimary energy of this program has been to create jobs in the United \nStates by bringing smart people here.\n  We should be going across the world and saying to the best and the \nbrightest----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will in a second--and saying to the best and the \nbrightest in the world, if you want to come to the United States and be \na job center that adds to the value of our economy, we would like to \nhave you come. We would like to consider you as being a participant \nunder an H-1B visa program.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator inadvertently misstated my position. I know \nit was an accident. We are good friends. He is probably not aware I do \nsupport the H-1B.\n  But is the Senator aware that out of the top 10 companies that \nsecured H-1B visas, 6 of those companies were Indian corporations; \n5,000 visas to Infosys, an Indian corporation which is a body shop \nwhich moves H-1B engineers from India to the United States for a fee \nand then back to India to compete with American companies; WoodPro, \nwhich is the second largest company, 4,000 visas; and the first \nAmerican company on the list for H-1B visas was Microsoft, with 3,000. \nSo 9,000 had already been awarded to Indian companies, and the \nGovernment of India has said the H-1B is what they consider their \noutsourcing visa so they can send engineers to the United States to \nlearn how to compete against American companies.\n  Does the Senator believe that is an abuse which should be addressed?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, I would say to the Senator from Illinois that when \nyou bring a person here who has the capacity to add to the strength of \na Microsoft, for example, which is probably our single biggest \ninternational producer of economic activity for us as a nation, after \nmaybe, I don't know, Wal-Mart, but it is a value-added company of the \nfirst level, and that when you bring somebody here who Microsoft feels \nadds to their ability to be more competitive, if that person decides to \ngo back to India or back to China, well, that will be a choice they \nmake.\n  But I suspect the odds are pretty good if that person has the \nopportunity to stay here under an H-1B visa program, they will probably \nend up staying here, or at least a large enough percentage of them will \nstay to add to our economy.\n  Now, what my amendment does----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will in a second. What my amendment does, to make it \nclear, is it recaptures visas that are unused and it uses those visas \nnow. It also specifically targets bringing in high-skilled nursing, \npeople who are trained in the nursing facility area, which is very much \nin demand right now.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GREGG. Certainly. Of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does the Senator feel the option of job vacancies that \nmay be filled by H-1B visa holders should first be offered to Americans \nto fill those jobs before an H-1B visa is given to a person coming from \nanother country?\n  Mr. GREGG. I happen to believe the H-1B program is one of those \nprograms that expands jobs in the United States, and by getting people \nhere, you actually create jobs and you will create more jobs for \nAmericans rather than lose jobs.\n  So, no, I don't happen to think you create a uniform rule that says \nnobody can come here if somebody else can take the job because then you \nare going to get the bureaucracy behind that which would basically bar \nthose people from ever getting here. That becomes then a bureaucratic \nnightmare for building those jobs. It makes much more sense to bring \nthese smart, intelligent people here, have them create jobs here, \nrather than leave them creating jobs in China and India.\n  Bill Gates speaks to this far more eloquently than I do. He speaks to \nmost things more eloquently than I can because he can pronounce the \nwords. But as a practical matter, he says these people are centers for \nthe energy that creates the ideas, that creates the jobs that drive the \neconomy. And if you leave them in China, if you leave them in India, as \nthose types of individuals creating jobs, they become huge competitors \nto the entrepreneurship of America. If you bring them here, they become \nadjuncts to our economy.\n  I think the proposal makes a lot of sense from the standpoint of job \ncreation and from the standpoint of making our economy stronger, so I \nwill be offering it later in the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can ask my friend to withhold for a \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had a conversation with Senator \nMcConnell, and he and I have had a discussion as to what is going on \nhere and what needs to go on. We believe we should start voting about \n11 o'clock tomorrow, or maybe a half-hour earlier. We have an event in \nthe Rotunda that he and I have to attend, and there is a moment of \nsilence for our troops, so we can start about 10:30 or 11 o'clock.\n  Tonight, Members should offer any amendments they want, talk as long \nas they want. But it appears, based on my conversation with the \nRepublican leader, it will not be necessary that we be in all night. So \nthat would be all I have to say, and that is also based on the \nconversation we had with the two managers of the bill earlier in the \nevening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would ask the leader, for the purposes \nof clarification, if Members would be permitted to speak tonight on \ntheir amendments but to call them up tomorrow. We already have a very \nlong line of amendments in the queue. I think the ranking member would \nprobably agree that we would permit Members to speak tonight, but they \nwould have to sequence their amendments tomorrow because we already \nhave a long line of amendments in the queue. I think that would provide \na better discipline for the process tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend, if the managers of the bill agree \nto that, I am sure Senator McConnell would agree to that. So unless we \nhear from the Republican leader to the contrary, I would say, based on \nthat, there will be no rollcall votes tonight and that we will proceed \nalong that line. Staff will draw up a consent agreement the two of you \ncan take a look at and make sure it is in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I take it the Senator from North Dakota is suggesting we \nwill continue this evening, but in debate only, unless the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the committee agree to put an amendment in order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think that would be the best way to proceed, don't you, \nto maintain some discipline for what is to come tomorrow?\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree. I wished to make certain.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Dodd is going to \nspeak for 20 minutes. At the end of Senator Dodd's presentation, I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Ensign be recognized.\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would not object, but if Senator Ensign can give an \nidea, for the knowledge of other Members, how long he will take. An \napproximation.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. About 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That might be helpful to our colleagues who might be \nlistening, in knowing how much time it would take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. So the order will be the Senator from \nConnecticut for 20 minutes and the Senator from Nevada for 20 minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator the Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to talk about a couple amendments I \nwill be offering, but let me inquire, if I may, of the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, if it would be appropriate for us to submit our \namendments this evening. I understand the sequence will be left to the \ncommittee, but I am not sure whether I should be submitting an \namendment or whether we can do that tomorrow.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think you can file one, but it can't be called up.\n  Mr. DODD. I understand that. That is the point.\n  Well, Mr. President, what I will do, then, is I would like to file \ntwo amendments, and I send them to the desk and ask they be filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me discuss these two amendments, and I \nwill reserve about 5 or 6 minutes at the end to talk about the present \nhousing issue that is critical to all of us. I wish to take a few \nminutes, which is far more than I will probably get tomorrow with the 1 \nminute allocated to talk about these amendments that are important in a \nnumber of aspects.\n  I wish to thank Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Senator Schumer, the \nPresiding Officer, and Senator Durbin for joining me in the first \namendment I will be offering to increase funding for the Maternal and \nChild Health Block Grant. This amendment that I will be calling up is \nsupported by a large coalition of organizations, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the list of organizations and letter from the \norganizations be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Friends of the Title V Maternal\n\n\n                                     and Child Health Program,\n\n       Dear Senator: As organizations committed to improving the \n     health of America's women, children, and families, we urge \n     you to support full funding for the Title V Maternal and \n     Child Health (MCH) Services Block Grant. Full funding at the \n     authorized level of $850 million will enable all states and \n     territories to provide vital public health and health care \n     services to millions of women, infants and children, \n     including children and youth with special health care needs.\n       The MCH Block Grant is the only Federal program that \n     focuses solely on improving the health of all of our nation's \n     mothers and children. State and territorial health agencies \n     and their partners use MCH Block Grant resources to reduce \n     infant mortality, deliver services to children and youth with \n     special health care needs, support prenatal and postnatal \n     care, screen newborns for genetic and hereditary health \n     conditions, deliver childhood immunizations, and prevent \n     childhood injuries. MCH Block Grant funding assists states in \n     addressing critical health workforce needs, including the \n     training of health professionals, and supports the \n     development and testing of innovative public health \n     practices.\n       State and territorial MCH programs coordinate their work \n     with Medicaid agencies, state Special Supplemental Nutrition \n     Programs for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) and other \n     programs serving vulnerable and at-risk populations. This \n     collaborative work assures that every dollar is used to \n     provide necessary services without duplication to underserved \n     mothers, children, and families in your state.\n       Six years ago, funding for the MCH Block Grant was $731 \n     million and has remained flat or has decreased ever since. \n     The FY 2008 omnibus appropriations bill cut MCH Block Grant \n     funding to $666 million, the lowest level since 1993. Five \n     years of cuts have curtailed progress in improving the health \n     of mothers, children, and families. Full funding for the MCH \n     Block Grant will allow states to efficiently meet increased \n     demand for public health and health care services in their \n     communities.\n       We strongly urge you to fully fund the Title V MCH Block \n     Grant at $850 million. Your support of this vital program is \n     appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n         Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs; \n           American Academy of Pediatrics; American College of \n           Obstetricians and Gynecologists; American Public Health \n           Association; Association of Public Health Laboratories; \n           Association of State & Territorial Health Officials; \n           Association of University Centers on Disabilities; \n           Autism Society of America; CityMatCH; Children's Dental \n           Health Project; Division for Early Childhood of the \n           Council for Exceptional Children; Epilepsy Foundation; \n           Family Voices; Families USA; First Focus; IDEA Infant \n           Toddler Coordinators Association (ITCA) March of Dimes \n           Foundation National Association of County and City \n           Health Officials; National Assembly on School-Based \n           Health Care; National Center for Children in Poverty; \n           National Healthy Start Association; National Hispanic \n           Medical Association; Prevent Blindness America; The Arc \n           of the United States; The Children's Defense Fund; The \n           Children's Health Fund; United Cerebral Palsy.    \n                                  ____\n\n\n  Support for Dodd Amendment on Maternal and Child Health Block Grant\n\n       Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs; American \n     Public Health Association; Association of Public Health Labs; \n     Association of State & Territorial Health Officials; Autism \n     Society of America; AFSCME; Child FIRST, Bridgeport Hospital, \n     Yale New-Haven Health System; Child Welfare League of \n     America; CityMatCH; Division for Early Childhood of the \n     Council for Exceptional Children (DEC); Easter Seals; \n     Epilepsy Foundation; Family Voices; First Focus; IDEA Infant \n     Toddler Coordinators Association (ITCA) March of Dimes \n     Foundation; National Assembly on School-Based Health Care; \n     National Center for Children in Poverty Mailman School of \n     Public Health, Columbia University; National Center for \n     Learning Disabilities; National Child Abuse Coalition; \n     National Healthy Start Association; Prevent Blindness \n     America; SEIU; Voices for America's Children.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, among the associations and organizations \nthat are supporting this amendment is the Association of Maternal and \nChild Health Programs, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the March of \nDimes, and many others.\n  In a minute, I will speak to the second amendment I am offering \nrelating to autism funding.\n  Under the President's budget, the Maternal and Child Health Block \nGrant will be funded at $666 million for the second consecutive year. \nThis amount represents a cut of $65 million from 5 years ago, when \nfunding peaked at $731 million. These persistent cuts and flat funding \nhave a real impact on the services States are able to offer to nearly \n35 million women, children, and youth affected by maternal and child \nhealth programs.\n  The Maternal and Child Health programs include direct health care for \nchildren with special needs, preventive and primary care for children \nand youth, integration of health care with other child and family \nservices, newborn screening for genetic disorders, lead poisoning \nprevention, injury prevention, and public education.\n  We must ensure that the States are able to continue to offer these \nservices to those in need. That is why I am offering this amendment, \nwhich will increase the funding of this block grant by $184 million to \nthe authorized level of $850 million.\n  Again, I wish to thank Senators Hatch, Schumer, and Durbin for \nsupporting this effort in a bipartisan way. The Maternal and Child \nHealth Block Grant services act as a critical source of care for many \nof our Nation's uninsured children. Of the more than 23 million \nchildren receiving services in 2006, 6.8 percent, or nearly 1.8 million \nchildren, had no known source of health insurance at all.\n  More than a third of MCH funds are used to provide primary and \npreventive health care services to children--including immunization \nclinics, outreach to enroll eligible children in Medicaid and the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, and funding and technical \nassistance to school based health centers, that serve adolescents.\n  In other words, MCH funds are used to ensure that mothers and \nchildren in traditionally underserved populations receive absolutely \nnecessary care.\n  Yet, despite this important mission, we continue to ask State MCH \nprograms to do more with less. According to the Association of Maternal \nand Child Health Programs, the purchasing power of the MCH block grant \nhas decreased close to 24 percent since 2003.\n\n[[Page S1971]]\n\n  Consider this: at present, low birth weight and preterm births are \nincreasing, the U.S. ranks 32nd out of 33rd of the world's \nindustrialized nations in the rate of infant deaths with African \nAmerican infants in the United States more than twice as likely as \nwhite infants to die before their first birthday, and childhood obesity \nrates for some age groups representing a three-fold increase in rates \nover the past two decades. We can do much better. This program has \nproven it works. Thus you have the support of Senator Hatch and others \nwho know that this program has made a difference in the lives of \nmillions.\n  Nearly one-half of all preterm births have no known cause but what we \ndo know is that by reducing certain risk factors in the mother such as \ncigarette smoking and obesity, we can help reduce rates of prematurity.\n  I chair the Children and Families Subcommittee of the HELP Committee \nand authored the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act with Senator Hatch--\npassed the Senate unanimously last December--and the Preventing \nPrematurity Research Expansion and Education for Mothers who deliver \nInfants Early Act, better known as the PREEMIE Act with Senator \nAlexander, enacted into law. These initiatives have made important \nsteps toward giving children a healthy start at life. But now it's time \nfor us to ensure that the money will be there to continue the success \nof these vital programs.\n  The MCH block grant is a proven success for helping ensure a healthy \nfuture for our Nation's children. States are required to match $3 for \nevery $4 of Federal funds provided by the block grant. The MCH block \ngrant has performance measures and evaluations that document the \neffective impact of this modest investment. To quote the Bush \nadministration:\n\n       The program is well designed. The [MCH Block Grant] serves \n     as a safety net to help improve the health of mothers and \n     children and has a positive impact on their health.\n\n  The MCH program is critical to the health and well-being of millions \nof families across this country, including some of the most vulnerable \nmembers of our society. Years of funding cuts and level funding have \nstretched maternal and child health programs to their limits. I urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment to increase MCH block grant funding \nto $850 million in this year's budget resolution. On behalf of Senators \nHatch, Schumer, Durbin and others, we hope that members will be in \nfavor of something that has enjoyed broad support.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to speak on an amendment I will be \noffering with Senators Collins and Kennedy. I thank Senator Collins and \nSenator Kennedy, the distinguished Chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee for their support for this amendment. I \nwould also like to thank Autism Speaks for their support for this \namendment.\n  The amendment increases funding for autism in the fiscal year 2009 \nbudget by $197 million in a budget-neutral manner, bringing autism \nfunding up to its authorized level and then doubling our commitment to \nfunding research into the causes of and treatments for autism.\n  In 2006, the Congress unanimously passed the Combating Autism Act, \nwhich my colleague from Pennsylvania former Senator Rick Santorum and I \nauthored along with the strong support of Senators Kennedy and Enzi. \nThis initiative was the largest Federal expansion of funding and \nprograms for children and families with autism spectrum disorder. It \nauthorizes $800 million to find the causes and decide how to treat the \nmyriad of problems faced by families of children with autism.\n  At the time the bill passed, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, CDC, estimated that 1 in 166 children were diagnosed with \nautism. Today the CDC estimates that number to be 1 in 150. In fact, 67 \nchildren are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder per day. A new \ncase is diagnosed almost every 20 minutes.\n  It continues to be a challenge to determine how much Federal funding \nis actually going to study the causes of and treatments for autism. In \nfact, some estimates are that actual NIH funding for research specific \nto autism is less than half of what is being reported.\n  That is why this amendment is so critical. It will redouble our \nFederal commitment to funding autism, the fastest-growing developmental \ndisability in the U.S.\n  At a time when the number of children and families living with autism \nhas grown exponentially, the President's budget proposes to freeze \nFederal spending on autism at levels that are insufficient to make the \nkind of discoveries in autism that are needed.\n  Many of my colleagues no doubt have been visited by children and \ntheir families with autism. Autism is a complex neurological disorder, \nwhich manifests itself differently in each individual but occurs in all \nracial, ethnic and socioeconomic groups. It is a lifelong condition \nthat affects not only the individual with the disability, but impacts \nthe entire family, often requiring intensive levels of support and \nintervention.\n  There are so many unanswered questions about autism. And it will \nrequire a major scale-up in funding to bring us closer to answering \nthem. We should close no doors on promising avenues of research into \nthe causes of autism and my amendment allows all biomedical research \nopportunities on autism to be pursued.\n  The amendment I am offering would enable us to redouble our efforts \non autism research and treatment services by increasing funding for \nresearch, treatments, education and interventions by $197 million in \nfiscal year 2009 and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Again, I emphasize it is the fastest growing developmental disability \nin our country. The number of children who will be born with autism is \nincreasing every day in this country. Again, on behalf of Senator \nCollins and myself, Senator Kennedy and others, we urge you to be \nsupportive of this amendment when it comes up. It is deficit neutral, \nwhich ought to make it easier for Members to support this amendment.\n  Lastly, I want to take a couple of minutes, to commend the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad and Senator Judd Gregg, the \nranking member as well, and the other members of the Budget Committee. \nI served on that committee for many years and have nothing but \nadmiration and respect for those going through this process. This \nbudget is a positive step to address the serious challenges our economy \nis facing today. Having just spoken on the specific issues regarding \nthe resolution, on autism and maternal and child health, I want to take \na moment to again address some of the problems that are plaguing our \neconomy.\n  I have been coming to the floor with some regularity in recent weeks \nto speak on economic issues. I do not wish to test the patience of our \ncolleagues. But I believe that these issues are of such paramount \nimportance at this point in our national life that they merit the \nconsideration of our colleagues.\n  Just yesterday the Federal Reserve announced a significant new action \nthat attempts to address the liquidity lock-down that has spread \nthrough our credit markets and crippled the ability of lenders to lend \nand borrowers to borrow. The announcement by the Fed is a significant \nmeasure that is intended to address this very serious situation. The \nmarkets' strong positive reaction to the Fed's action demonstrates that \npolicymakers can undertake actions which have the potential to improve \nour situation. However, I do not believe that the Fed's action alone \nwill be enough to right our Nation's economic ship. Additional steps \nshould also be considered to address the root cause of the present \nmarket turmoil--namely, the housing market and specifically the \nforeclosure crisis.\n  New data was released last week regarding the condition of America's \nhomeowners. It is stark, even alarming in certain respects. \nForeclosures have hit a new all-time record, according to the Mortgage \nBanker's Association, MBA. This data shows that more than 1 in every 50 \nhomes with a mortgage in the country is in foreclosure, as of the end \nof last year. Foreclosure rates have been growing at record levels for \nsome time. Foreclosures are increasing because people are continuing to \nstruggle to make their payments, and because those payments are \nincreasing for millions of Americans. The report tells us\n\n[[Page S1972]]\n\nthat 1 in every 13 homeowners with a mortgage has fallen behind on \ntheir mortgage.\n  The Federal Reserve also released new data, which shows that \nAmericans' equity in their homes is at a record low. Home equity has \nfallen for three straight quarters and now, for the first time in \nrecorded history, which dates back to the end of the Second World War, \nAmericans own less than 50 percent of the value of their home. By \nvirtually all estimates, the housing problem is getting worse, not \nbetter.\n  Congress can and in my opinion, must, address the situation. There \nare several pieces of legislation that I, along with others, am working \nto do just that. I am working with my ranking member, Senator Shelby \nand our colleagues in the House on legislation to reform the Federal \nHousing Administration. I remain committed to creating a world-class \nregulator for the GSEs. I also believe that we need to expand the \ncommunity development block grant program to enable cities and \nlocalities with the tools and funding they will need to address the \nforeclosure crisis which is upon us. I have worked with Senators \nSchumer, the Presiding Officer Bond and others to make sure that high-\nquality counseling is available to homeowners who are facing the brunt \nof the storm, and I remain committed to this important program.\n  Congress should consider creating a home ownership preservation \nentity that can help restore stability and liquidity to the mortgage \nmarket and credit markets generally. Fed Chairman Bernanke called for \nsuch an entity in an important address last week.\n  In addition to addressing the problems in the housing market, which \nare at the epicenter of our current economic crisis, we also need to \nmake sure that our economy is fundamentally strong for the future. One \nof the most effective ways to do that is to invest in our Nation's \ninfrastructure. Just yesterday, I chaired a hearing of the Senate \nBanking Committee on the condition of our Nation's infrastructure and \non ideas as to how to improve it. The hearing generated some good ideas \nthat I believe we need to act on. One such idea is contained in \nlegislation written by Senator Hagel and myself to establish a national \ninfrastructure bank.\n  I commend Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Senator John Thune for \ntheir efforts as well, on a similar idea which we intend to incorporate \nwith our idea that can help us in this effort as well.\n  The budget resolution before allows for such action. It establishes a \nreserve fund for the specific purpose of meeting our infrastructure \nneeds. The fund could encompass the legislation Senator Hagel and I \nhave introduced. I appreciate the willingness of the Budget Committee \nto work with us on this issue. I commend Chairman Conrad and Senator \nGregg for establishing this fund. It is evidence of a growing consensus \nin Congress and the country that complacency can no longer substitute \nfor action.\n  From the days of the Roman aqueducts to the present, a nation's \nability to grow and prosper rests upon its success at effectively \nmoving people, goods, and information. Ask any American today how we \nare doing in achieving this objective, and chances are the response \nwould be the same: we can do better. When the average American spends \n51.5 hours a year in traffic congestion, we can do better. When 33 \npercent of all urban and rural roads are in poor, mediocre, or fair \ncondition, we can do better. When the United States invests less than 2 \npercent of its gross domestic product on infrastructure while countries \nlike China and India invest between 7 and 12 percent, we can do better.\n  Economist Stephen Roach, in a recent op-ed in the New York Times, \nsuggests that investing in infrastructure would be an effective \nstrategy for dealing with the current economic slowdown. Specifically, \nhe recommends that:\n\n       Fiscal initiatives should be directed at laying the \n     groundwork for future growth, especially by upgrading the \n     nation's antiquated highways, bridges, and ports.\n  I have been working closely with Senator Shelby on these issues and \nremain hopeful that when the Senate returns after the Easter recess, we \ncan get back to working on cost-effective approaches to allow people to \nkeep their homes and bring liquidity to the housing market.\n  Lastly, the budget resolution was a good step to address the problems \nbefore us by allocating funds to existing programs, such as the \nCommunity Development Block Grant Program, as well as, of course, I \nmentioned the reserve account here to deal with infrastructure needs.\n  I commend the authors of this resolution. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider the two amendments I will be offering dealing with maternal \nand general health offered by myself, Senators Hatch, Schumer, Durbin, \nand others.\n  Dealing with autism, Senator Collins and I will be offering two \ncritical issues. We are accounting for them here in the budget \nresolution, so they are budget neutral but also making a difference in \nthe lives of people in the kinds of proper investments we may have.\n  I thank the chair for the time. I thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator from Nevada wait to proceed for one \nmoment for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I would.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this appear \nbefore the gentleman's remarks so his remarks are not interrupted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have talked with Senator Gregg about this matter. The \none thing we did not agree to formally that needs to be agreed to is \nthat Senator Menendez would have a right to offer the side-by-side \namendment to Senator Sessions' this evening. That would be the only \nthing that would be permitted tonight, other than additional agreements \nbetween the ranking member and the chairman.\n  But that is one piece of business we previously agreed to informally \nbut have not done formally. We should do that at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the gentleman for his courtesy.\n  Madam President, to modify that request, there are a number of \nSenators wanting to know what the order would be following the Senator \nfrom Nevada. I see Senator Gregg here. We have Senator Akaka, Senator \nCorker, Senator Chambliss. How much time will the Senator from Georgia \nseek?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. No more than 10 minutes, probably less.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Tennessee?\n  Mr. CORKER. Six or seven.\n  Mr. GREGG. Senator Grassley is here.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. May I speak at 8:05?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. For how long at 8:05?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Six minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would you be again praising the resolution and the \nchairman of the Budget Committee or would it not be so favorable?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I know you will not believe it, but I will not have \nanything negative to say.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is my birthday. I wonder if we can agree, after the \nSenator from Nevada, that Senator Chambliss be recognized for 10 \nminutes, Senator Akaka for 10 minutes, then come back to Senator Corker \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CORKER. Six will work for me.\n  Mr. GREGG. And that Senator Grassley be recognized at 8:05.\n  Mr. CONRAD. After Senator Corker, then Senator Menendez have his \nopportunity for 15 minutes, Senator Grassley at 8:05.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell.) The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4240\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I wish to speak on two amendments I will be offering to \nthe budget. The first amendment has to do with means testing Medicare \nPart D, the new prescription drug benefit, by making sure that seniors \nwho are wealthier pay a little more so that middle-class Americans are \nnot subsidizing their prescription drug benefits to the extent they do \ntoday.\n  As Members of Congress, we have an obligation to all Americans to \nensure that senior citizens and individuals\n\n[[Page S1973]]\n\nwith disabilities have access to medical care. We must maintain that \ncommitment by strengthening the program and controlling costs. We \nalready means test Medicare Part B, which helps cover doctor services \nand outpatient care.\n  Today, I am proposing that we finish the job. In order to put the \nMedicare Program on better financial footing, we should means test the \nMedicare prescription drug program so that beneficiaries with higher \nincomes pay higher Part D premiums.\n  Five short years ago, many of my colleagues, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, voted with me in support of a Feinstein amendment to \nrequire high-income Medicare beneficiaries pay a greater share of their \nMedicare Part B premiums. Many of these Senators are still with us in \nthe Senate today. In fact, the current chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Senator Conrad, supported an amendment to means test \nMedicare Part B. Other Democrats who supported the measure include \nSenators Biden, Carper, Dodd, Feingold, Kohl, Landrieu, and Wyden.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle recognize that our \nentitlement programs are in serious danger. As our Nation grows older, \nthese programs will only devour more and more of our Federal budget. \nWithout reform, our entitlement programs will consume our entire \nFederal budget somewhere around 20 years from now, leaving no funds for \nnational security, education, transportation, or anything else.\n  Unfortunately, the Democrats are not proposing anything to solve the \nproblem of entitlements in this budget.\n  Today, I am asking my colleagues to again show the courage to make \ntough choices and to take our lead from American families across the \ncountry who make hard choices each and every day.\n  My amendment would impose an income test on the wealthiest seniors to \nensure that they pay their fair share for prescription drug coverage. \nThis amendment will extend the existing Medicare Part B income test to \nthe Medicare Part D program, the prescription drug part of the program. \nBy doing so, we will save almost $2 billion over the next 5 years.\n  Under the proposal, single Medicare patients with an adjusted gross \nincome over $82,000 and couples with incomes of more than $164,000 will \nbe responsible for a greater share of their Medicare Part D premium \nbased on a sliding scale. For example, a single Medicare beneficiary \nwith an adjusted gross income between $82,001 and $102,000 a year will \nsee an increase of only about $10.41 in the monthly Medicare premiums \nthey pay. These income levels will be adjusted in the future for \ninflation.\n  The vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries will not be impacted by \nthis proposal. This chart shows the percentage of Medicare \nbeneficiaries who are impacted: 96.6 percent of all seniors enrolled in \nMedicare Part D will not be affected by my amendment. Almost 3.5 \npercent of seniors will be affected, just the wealthiest of those \nseniors.\n  This proposal does not deprive senior citizens of the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. What it does say is that if you can afford \nto pay a little more, then you should pay a little more. I believe it \nis wrong for the retired CEO of a Fortune 500 company not to pay a \nlittle more so that middle-income taxpayers are not subsidizing their \nprescription drug benefits. It really makes no sense for someone like \nBill Gates' father to have his prescription drugs subsidized by a \nwaitress in Las Vegas or a truck driver in Elko, NV. I strongly believe \nthat American taxpayers, struggling to make ends meet, certainly should \nnot be subsidizing, to the current extent, the Medicare Part D premiums \nof those seniors who can afford to pay for the cost of premiums \nthemselves.\n  In this instance, means testing is fair. Remember, this prescription \ndrug benefit is a new benefit. It is not something seniors paid for \nthrough their taxes, it is a new entitlement benefit that current \ntaxpayers are subsidizing. I think it is only fair to the school \nteacher, the firefighter, the police officer, and the small \nbusinessperson who is struggling to make ends meet, that wealthy \nseniors pay a little more per month for this new prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  Madam President, the second amendment I am going to be offering has \nto do with an issue that is fundamental to our country, the right of \nemployees to have a secret-ballot election for determining whether you \nare going to have a union represent you in the workplace. This issue is \nalso known as ``card check.'' We need to ensure the right of employees \nto a secret-ballot election conducted by the National Labor Relations \nBoard. My amendment will create a reserve fund to ensure that the \nNational Labor Relations Board has sufficient resources to conduct \nsecret-ballot elections.\n  The NLRB is a Federal agency that was created by Congress in 1935. It \nis responsible for administering the Labor Relations Act, which is the \nprimary law governing relations between unions and employers in the \nprivate sector. The NLRB works to protect the rights of employees to \norganize and collectively bargain with or without a union.\n  We need to ask a fundamental question: Should Americans have the \nright to a secret ballot in choosing whether to have a union represent \nthem?\n  The Democrats offered a bill last year, that passed in the House, \nwhich was filibustered by Republicans in the Senate. Their bill would \nsay: No longer are we going to allow employees the ability to have a \nsecret ballot on whether to have a union represent them. Instead, they \nsay: We are going to have a card check.\n  The Democrats have offered something they deceptively title the \nEmployee Free Choice Act. As I was saying, instead of secret ballot \nelections to determine whether or not to be represented by a union, \nthey would pass out cards, have employees sign them, and as long as \nthey get 50 percent of the employees, plus one, to sign a card saying \nthey wanted a union, they automatically have a union.\n  The problem is that when you use these cards, instead of a secret-\nballot election, coercion and intimidation can take place. That is why \nwe have secret-ballot elections to elect our representatives virtually \neverywhere. Right here in the Senate, when we elect our leaders in each \nparty, we do secret-ballot elections. This reduces the opportunity for \nintimidation.\n  People want secret-ballots so that they are free to exercise their \nright and their conscience while voting. In whatever they do, whether \nit is a union or electing somebody to represent them in the Halls of \nCongress, they elect them through the use of a secret ballot. It is \nfundamental to the American system of government and the American way \nof life.\n  Unfortunately, the Democrats have sided with the big labor bosses on \nthis, and not with the union members. If you read the polling data, 80 \npercent of union members want to maintain their right to secret ballot \nelections. As a matter of fact, that number is pretty consistent \nwhether you are in a labor union or not. Eighty percent of the American \npeople support the right to secret ballot elections to decide whether \nor not to have a union represent them.\n  We have had actual experiences with this in my hometown of Las Vegas.\n  Bruce Esgar, then an employee at the MGM, testified in front of a \nHouse Committee about his experience. He talked about how, when the \nunion wanted to come into his workplace, he and others asked for a \nsecret ballot vote. They were labeled ``anti-union.'' And when the card \ncheck campaign began, they were threatened that if they did not sign \nthe card and the union came in, they would lose their jobs and their \nbenefits.\n  He said that employees were harassed in the dressing rooms before \nshifts, and that these tactics worked. Employees got tired of being \nharassed all the time so they signed the cards. Mr. Esgar testified \nabout a coworker whose wife was the union at another casino, and that \nthe union threatened to fire her if her husband did not sign the card \nat MGM. Another coworker was told that the union knew where his wife \nworked and where his kids went to school. He was told, ``accidents \nhappen.'' I wonder which of these workers feels that the union is \nstanding up for them?\n  Bruce summed it up pretty well. He said:\n\n       These are the things that the employees put up with. We did \n     it for two years. And all we were asking for was our right to \n     vote. In America, you vote for your future.\n\n\n[[Page S1974]]\n\n\n  My amendment is fundamental. It says, let's preserve the secret \nballot right that Americans have in choosing whether to have a union \nrepresent them in the workplace. This is a critical issue facing our \ncountry today. It literally goes to the very fabric of our society. I \nrealize that labor unions are big supporters of the Democratic Party \nacross the country. I realize this is their No. 1 issue, the labor \nunions' No. 1 issue. It is and the labor union bosses No. 1 issue, but \nit is not for the labor union members. We need to make sure we are \nstanding up for the rights of American workers everywhere, of union \nworkers everywhere and make sure that we preserve their right to a \nsecret ballot in the workplace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after \nSenator Menendez speaks, Senator Enzi be recognized for 10 minutes, \nthen Senator Casey for 15 minutes, and then if Senator Cardin seeks \ntime, he be recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4230\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise to discuss and support \namendment No. 4230 which has been filed by Senator Feinstein and \nmyself. While this amendment is identical to amendments Senator \nFeinstein and I have offered previously to budget resolutions and that \nhave been adopted by unanimous consent, Senator Feinstein has been an \nexcellent partner and colleague in developing this amendment. She has \nbeen a strong supporter not just of this particular provision but of \nlaw enforcement in general. It has been a pleasure to work with her.\n  What this amendment does is to provide for an increase in the funding \nlevel for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, \nwhich we commonly refer to as the Byrne/JAG provision, to a total of \n$906 million. This amendment is fully offset, and I am pleased to say \nthat the following Senators have asked to be added as cosponsors in \naddition to myself and Senator Feinstein: Senators Bond, Harkin, \nCantwell, Biden, Inhofe, Brown, Coleman, Clinton, Bingaman, Obama, \nCollins, Durbin, Isakson, Kerry, Burr, Lincoln, Feingold, and Dole.\n  The Byrne/JAG program is the primary provider of Federal criminal \njustice funding to State and local jurisdictions, and the funding \nsupports all components of the criminal justice system--\nmultijurisdictional drug and gang task forces, community crime \nprevention programs, substance abuse programs, prosecution initiatives, \ndomestic violence programs, and information-sharing initiatives. Our \nlaw enforcement officials, our sheriffs, prosecutors, and drug court \nprofessionals, and many other public servants in the law enforcement \ncommunity, rely on these particular grants to fight the drug issue in \ntheir particular jurisdictions. They are making their communities safer \nbecause of the awarding of these grants over the years.\n\n  According to a survey conducted by the Iowa Governor's Office of Drug \nPolicy, in the 2004 grant year, multijurisdictional drug enforcement \ntask forces, funded by the Byrne/JAG program, made more than 221,000 \ndrug arrests. Almost 18,000 kilograms of cocaine was seized, with an \nestimated consumer street value of $1.6 billion. Almost 5,500 kilograms \nof methamphetamine was seized, with an estimated street value of $518 \nmillion. The total value of drugs seized was over $12 billion, \nrepresenting $63 in seized drugs for every $1 spent on drug task \nforces.\n  I know the results our law enforcement community gets with Byrne/JAG \nfunding are tangible and real. In my State of Georgia, we have used \nthis program extensively. It has been essential to fighting crime, \ndrugs, and gangs across the State. Last year in Georgia, with Byrne/JAG \nfunding, the following successes were achieved: Multijurisdictional \ntask forces were able to make 5,600 drug arrests and seize almost $50 \nmillion in drugs; 2,500 law enforcement officers were trained in more \nthan 100 different classes offered by the Georgia Public Safety \nTraining Center through its drug enforcement training program; the \nGeorgia Bureau of Investigation's State drug task force led a \ncooperative investigation resulting in an interstate drug enforcement \neffort with Alabama that received national recognition. The Georgia \nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center is Georgia's Homeland Security \nState-level fusion intelligence center. The center expanded its \nSouthern Shield initiative and widened the focus for intelligence \nintegration in the region by coordinating with 12 other States within \nthe Southeast on intelligence collection and dissemination. Nine drug \ncourt programs were supported, as was a mental health court diversion \nprogram.\n  One great thing about this Byrne/JAG program is that the money is \nallocated so that 40 percent of the funding is distributed to local \ngovernments. In many cases, grants from the Byrne/JAG program are the \nonly source of Federal funding for sheriffs and police in smaller \ncommunities. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthis amendment.\n  The former president of the National Sheriffs Association happens to \nbe a good friend and constituent of mine, Sheriff John Cary Bittick in \nForsyth County, GA. Sheriff Bittick was here recently when Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Harkin, Senator Biden and I, along with Senator \nBond, talked about the Byrne/JAG program. During that conversation, my \nfriend Sheriff Bittick related the fact that there are a number of \njoint programs in our State that, due to the decrease in the funding \nlast year in the omnibus bill, were having to eliminate their programs. \nIf we eliminate these programs in small rural communities around my \nhome State and the other 49 States, what we are going to see is \ncertainly an increase in drug and illegal trafficking activities in \nthose rural areas. This program is essential to fighting the drug \nproblem in rural America.\n  Our amendment is supported by the following organizations: the \nNational Criminal Justice Association, the National Sheriffs \nAssociation, the American Correctional Association, the American \nProbation and Patrol Association, the National Narcotic Officers' \nCoalition, the National Association of Drug Court Professionals, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, International Association \nof Chiefs of Police, Major County Sheriffs' Association, National \nCenter for Victims of Crime, National Association of Counties, \nInternational Community Corrections Association, and Boys and Girls \nClubs of America.\n  It is pretty obvious that this program is very popular in the law \nenforcement community. The reason is because it works. Lives are being \nsaved. More drugs are being confiscated. More bad guys who are \nmanufacturing and distributing drugs around America are being locked up \nand put away because of this program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 4230 sponsored \ninitially by Senator Feinstein and myself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I am pleased to discuss funding for VA in \nthe budget resolution for fiscal year 2009. Chairman Conrad and his \ncolleagues on the Budget Committee have done impressive work on this \nresolution.\n  They have demonstrated sound judgment in their funding recommendation \nto address the needs of our country.\n  Service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, like those who \nreturned from Vietnam, Korea, World War II and all previous wars, bear \nthe effects of their service.\n  They show us that the costs of war do not end on the battlefield. In \ncrafting this budget, we are in a position to ensure that care for \nreturning service members, of every war, is a top priority.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs provides superior health care to \nmillions of veterans every year.\n  It is widely regarded as one of the top health care systems in \nAmerica. Today, VA faces a growing wave of new demands--veterans of \npast wars are aging and making greater use of the system, and younger \nveterans of the current conflicts require a new range of services from \nVA.\n  Congress must provide the resources for VA to meet all of these \ndemands.\n  This budget resolution acknowledges the challenges facing VA. It \nmeets our responsibility of caring for our Nation's service members and \nveterans.\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\n  In recent years, VA and Congress have made a tremendous investment in \nmental health services. I am pleased that this budget reflects an \nongoing commitment to better serve the needs of veterans with mental \nhealth concerns.\n  Madam President, I remind my colleagues that battle wounds frequently \nmanifest themselves as invisible wounds. These wounds can be just as \ndevastating as physical wounds. Indeed, many mental health disorders, \nincluding substance use disorder and PTSD, have both physical and \nmental manifestations.\n  They impact the veteran's relationships and his or her ability to \nwork and to interact in society. The effects of many mental health \ndisorders can be limited or even avoided if they are caught and treated \npromptly, before long-term disabilities develop.\n  This budget resolution provides the funds to continue the essential \ntask of providing timely access to mental health care for all veterans.\n  Families play a critical role in the well-being of veterans. As \nchairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I held a hearing \nyesterday on the role of families in veterans' lives, and on the \nsupport VA and DoD provides them.\n  Families are often the primary caregivers for injured veterans, and \nprovide essential assistance in recovery and rehabilitation through \nreintegration into civilian life. The degree of support provided by \nfamily members is directly related to a veteran's ability to deal \neffectively with readjustment and mental health concerns.\n  Providing support to veterans' families is in VA's vital interest.\n  One of the harshest realities of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is \nthe number of soldiers who have sustained complex and multiple injuries \nin combat.\n  Significant improvements in battlefield medicine have enabled many \nseriously wounded servicemembers to survive their injuries. These men \nand women are coming home with extraordinarily complex health care \nneeds.\n  VA and Congress have focused on addressing the needs of these \nveterans. There have been improvements in screening and care for \nservice members with traumatic brain injury, but much remains to be \ndone.\n  In addition, Congress directed VA to establish specialized centers \nfor rehabilitative care in response to the challenging medical and \nrehabilitative needs of veterans with multiple and complex injuries.\n  VA's four lead polytrauma rehabilitation centers are essential to \nmeeting the needs of the most severely injured veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  As we work to meet the needs of all returning servicemembers, we must \npay close attention to the full range of war wounds--from eye trauma \nand damage to servicemembers' hearing, to PTSD and depression, to burn \ninjuries.\n  Another important tool which VA is still developing is comprehensive \nhealth screening for returning servicemembers. This is absolutely \nessential. Without effective screening for mental health disorders, \ntraumatic brain injury, hearing and vision loss and other injuries or \ndisorders, VA will miss opportunities to help veterans in need of \nservices.\n  Further, I believe comprehensive health screening before deployment \nis essential to help with the evaluation and understanding of the \neffects of combat on servicemembers. As chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I have worked to ensure that all veterans receive \nappropriate health screenings. I will continue to advocate for these \nscreenings.\n  On the benefits side of the ledger, in the last year, Congress has \nprovided a significant amount of funding to VA for much-needed staffing \nto adjudicate claims. Our Nation's veterans deserve nothing less than \nhaving their claims rated accurately and in a reasonable period of \ntime. Now, the American people, especially veterans, will expect to see \na decreasing backlog and increased timeliness and quality.\n  I pledge my continuing support to get veterans the benefits they need \nin an appropriate amount of time. Congress must now assure that VA has \nsufficient funding for technology and training initiatives to aid in \nits endeavor to reduce the backlog of claims. This budget resolution is \ncertainly a step in the right direction.\n  The entitlement funding provided to veterans in this budget \nresolution reflects the Nation's continuing responsibility to care for \nhe who has borne the battle, long after the last shots of war have been \nfired. Indeed, I view funding for veterans' entitlements as a \ncontinuing cost of war.\n  The administration's VA budget request proposed severe cuts to many \nessential programs and accounts. Research, the inspector general, the \nNational Cemetery Administration, and grants for State home \nconstruction would all be unnecessarily cut.\n  I am particularly troubled by the proposed cuts of nearly 50 percent \nto the VA construction accounts. Over the past year, internal reviews \nidentified widespread maintenance concerns, in addition to already \nplanned construction projects. I find it unconscionable that in the \nface of the pressing demands across the country, the President would \nsuggest such cuts. The budget proposal advanced by Chairman Conrad and \nhis colleagues rectifies these mistakes in the President's request, and \nI appreciate their foresight on these issues.\n  I am pleased with the investment in veterans programs that is made in \nthis budget resolution. I again commend Chairman Conrad and the Budget \nCommittee for their thoughtful and responsible work. Care for our \nNation's veterans is truly a cost of war, and it is our responsibility \nto meet their needs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of the resolution \nbefore us.\n  I thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I know Senator Corker is next. I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Voinovich be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes at the conclusion of Senator Cardin's remarks and that Senator \nBarrasso be recognized at 8:45 for 15 minutes and that after Senator \nVoinovich, Senator Brown be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  So the order, as it presently stands, is: Senator Corker, Senator \nMenendez, Senator Enzi, Senator Casey, Senator Cardin, Senator \nVoinovich, Senator Brown, then Senator Grassley, who would like his \ntime to be expanded to 20 minutes, and then Senator Barrasso at 8:45. \nSenator Grassley is recognized at 8:05.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, it sounds like it is going to be a long \nnight. I hope you have some relief coming. But I wish to thank the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  I rise today to talk about the budget that is getting ready to be put \nforth. I do not wish to talk specifically about this budget. But having \ngone through this process once before, it is obviously a very \nundignified process we are getting ready to enter into tomorrow, where \nwe will have 30, 40, 50, maybe 60 amendments to a budget, many of which \nare set up solely to send messages, cause people to vote on things that \nmight make them look good in the next election so that 30-second ads \nmight be generated. I do wish to say I have tremendous respect for our \nbudget chairman and ranking member. I think they are outstanding \nleaders in the Senate. I realize they are dealing, if you will, with \nthe process that has been set forth in the Senate. I think they both \nexercise their duties very diligently.\n\n  I know there are differing points of view as to how we might deal \nwith this next year's budget. Let me say in general I think this entire \nprocess is not what it ought to be. It is, to me, a great disservice to \nour country the way we handle our budgeting, and appropriations \nprocesses that follow. I wish to talk about a couple things as it \nrelates to this issue.\n  First of all, I know one of the amendments that will come up tomorrow \nwill be the DeMint amendment relating to earmarks. It is an amendment I \nwill support because I do believe earmarks have gotten way out of \ncontrol in the Senate. I do not believe people who earmark necessarily \nin any way are doing bad things. I think it is actually an outcome that \nhas been generated due to processes breaking down in the Senate.\n  When various Senators want to see road projects go forward or other \nthings that are needed, they have now sort of sidelined the processes \nwe ought\n\n[[Page S1976]]\n\nto be going through, which requires planning and responsibility on our \npart--a little bit of discipline. Instead, now we have moved to this \nvery cumbersome and, I will say, most inefficient earmarking process. I \nthink that is not a good thing.\n  I realize, in essence, in the Appropriations Committees earmarking \npots are set up and allocated based on numbers of things, in most cases \nhaving nothing to do with the priorities of our country. I do wish to \nsay that while I support this amendment in the hopes that together \nsomehow or another through a moratorium this year on earmarks we will \nbegin to look responsibly at ways of funding--funding infrastructure, \nfunding projects that are very needed in our country--that is done so \non merit and with oversight, I do not believe that solving the earmark \nproblem in any way is going to deal with our overall budgetary process, \nnor with the appropriations process that follows that.\n  As a matter of fact, I worry sometimes that we talk so much about \nearmarks that we feel like if we were to solve this earmark issue--and \nthe American public, I think, is beginning to buy into this--we would \nsolve all the financial woes this country has. Earmarks--as bad as I \nthink they have gotten out of control and need to stop--do nothing of \nthat sort. It is a small piece, very small piece, in a bigger picture \nthat needs to be solved. As a matter of fact, I hope at some point all \nof us in this body will realize how ridiculous the processes are that \nwe go through and realize we are not in any way dealing with the longer \nterm issues our country faces. One of those things I would like to see \nus do--I know there is an amendment that has been brought forth before: \nthe biennial budgeting process, where we would actually look at the \nbudget in a 2-year process.\n  I know Ranking Member Judd Gregg has brought forth such an \namendment--I am a cosponsor of that amendment--so that in the odd years \nwe are actually allocating resources and in the even years--election \nyears--we are actually doing oversight and making sure we are spending \nmoney wisely.\n  One of the things in the process we go through right now that I think \nwe are totally blind to is the tremendous entitlement tsunami that is \ngetting ready to face our country. I think most people realize we as a \nbody are not dealing with that issue. For us to even be down here \npassionately debating amendments over a budget and not dealing with \nthat, again, does not serve the country well. I think everybody knows \nwe have huge problems that are coming up in the future. Let me give a \nlittle bit of a picture of that.\n  Today, if you took in all the money we have set to come in over the \nnext 75 years and then looked at the liabilities we have toward Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid, we have $66 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities. Yet tomorrow you are going to see us on the floor haggling \nover amendments that, at the end of the day, will have no effect \nwhatsoever on this huge problem we have to deal with in the very near \nfuture.\n  To put that in perspective, today if you looked at the entire net \nworth of our country, it is only $57 trillion. So because of the Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid entitlement issues, we have a greater \nunfunded liability than the entire net worth of our country. I think \nthat is a pretty big issue.\n  To put that in perspective, since our Government was formed a couple \nhundred years ago, we have taken in during that entire time only $42.7 \ntrillion in revenues.\n  So, Madam President, I look forward to coming tomorrow and going \nthrough an exercise--an exercise that I realize will have some impact, \nif you will, on the amount of money we spend on various programs. Then \nI realize at the end of the year we will have an appropriations \nprocess. Then, during that period, unless we are able to have a \nmoratorium on earmarks, we will have another 10,000 or 15,000 earmarks \nthat direct money out in various places. But I know in the process of \nall that occurring, we still will not have dealt with the major issues \nthis country has to deal with. I hope somehow this body will have the \ncourage, in a bipartisan way, to come together and deal with this \nissue.\n  I strongly support the Gregg-Conrad amendment that would cause this \nbody, in a bipartisan way, to bring forth solutions to this problem--to \nthis entitlement problem--in a manner that can only be voted on up and \ndown, with no amendments, so we as a body, hopefully, will have the \ncourage to deal with the real issues our country has to face as it \nrelates to fiscal issues.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4259\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, pursuant to a previous unanimous \nconsent agreement, I ask that the pending amendment be set aside and \nthat amendment No. 4259, which is at the desk, be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4259.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund for immigration reform and \n                              enforcement)\n\n       On page 69, after line 25, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 308. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM \n                   AND ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the Senate may revise the allocations of a \n     committee or committees, aggregates, and other levels in this \n     resolution for 1 or more bills, joint resolutions, \n     amendments, motions, or conference reports, by the amounts \n     provided in such legislation for the purposes described in \n     paragraphs (1) through (7), that--\n       (1) provide for increased border security, enforcement of \n     immigration laws, greater staffing, and immigration reform \n     measures;\n       (2) increase criminal and civil penalties against employers \n     who hire undocumented immigrants;\n       (3) prohibit employers who hire undocumented immigrants \n     from receiving Federal contracts;\n       (4) provide funding for the enforcement of the employer \n     sanctions described in paragraphs (2) and (3) and other \n     employer sanctions for hiring undocumented immigrants;\n       (5) deploy an appropriate number of National Guard troops \n     to the southern or northern border of the United States \n     provided that--\n       (A) the Secretary of Defense certifies that the deployment \n     would not negatively impact the safety of American forces in \n     Iraq and Afghanistan; and\n       (B) the Governor of the National Guard's home State \n     certifies that the deployment would not have a negative \n     impact on the safety and security of that State;\n       (6) evaluate the Federal, State, and local prison \n     populations that are noncitizens in order to identify \n     removable criminal aliens; or\n       (7) implement the exit data portion of the US-VISIT entry \n     and exit data system at airports, seaports, and land ports of \n     entry.\n       (b) Limitation.--The authority under subsection (a) may not \n     be used unless the legislation described in subsection (a) \n     would not increase the deficit over--\n       (1) the total period comprised of fiscal years 2008 through \n     2013; or\n       (2) the total period comprised of fiscal years 2008 through \n     2018.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment, an \nalternative to the amendment offered by Senator Sessions, an \nalternative that I think actually has a chance to help fix our broken \nimmigration system.\n  My amendment would increase border security and enforce immigration \nlaws without wasting our resources in unnecessary and potentially even \ndangerous ways. We have to be smart when we think about solutions to \nthe immigration problem. We have to enact measures that do more than \nsound tough. They have to be tough. We have to consider the impact our \nlegislation will have on other programs and other priorities, and we \ncannot just throw money and personnel at the border without thinking \ncarefully about the consequences.\n  My amendment gets to the real heart of the problem. It provides for \nincreased border security and increased enforcement of immigration \nlaws. It gives us the manpower we need to address our immigration \nproblems by providing for greater staffing for the Department of \nHomeland Security because the Department can't do its job if it simply \ndoesn't have sufficient staff.\n  My amendment addresses the real root of the immigration problem: the \nincentive--the incentive for crossing\n\n[[Page S1977]]\n\nthe border without a visa. It helps eliminate this incentive by getting \ntough on employers who hire undocumented immigrants. We know \nundocumented immigrants come to the United States--for what? They come \nlooking for a job. They want a better life. They see an American \npaycheck as the means to get it. Well, without the draw of the job, \nwithout the draw of income, the motivation to risk it all to cross the \nborder illegally dries up. Building a bigger, stronger, taller fence \nsimply doesn't cut it because, as we all know, if there is a will, \nthere is generally a way. Rather than create new obstacles that \nundocumented immigrants are going to try to figure out how to get \naround, we need to address the underlying motivation that is the magnet \nthat drives them to migrate in the first place. The way to do this is \nto come down harder on the employers who provide them the incentive.\n  My amendment would do this by increasing criminal and civil penalties \nagainst employers who hire undocumented immigrants. It seems clear that \ntoday's penalties are not a sufficient deterrent for these companies. \nSo my amendment sends them a clear message: we are going to hold you \naccountable for your actions. There are going to be real consequences \nfor breaking the law.\n  My amendment would also prohibit employers who hire undocumented \nimmigrants from receiving Federal contracts. There is simply no reason \nany company that receives a Federal contract should be breaking the law \nby hiring undocumented immigrants. It is interesting that there are \nsome news stories about those who are actually building the wall doing \nexactly that. Isn't that ironic? The amendment I am offering isn't just \nabout getting tough; it is about getting smart.\n  Senator Sessions and others on the other side of the aisle would not \nonly build a bigger, longer, taller fence along the border--something \nwe have seen which simply will not work on its own--they also want to \ndeploy a significant number of our National Guard to help support the \nBorder Patrol.\n  Let me say from the outset I am not at all opposed to sending \nreinforcements for the Border Patrol. I voted for those increases in \nthe Border Patrol agents. They are understaffed and underfunded, and \nthey need all the help they can get. What I am opposed to is taking one \nresource away from a desperate situation in order to give that resource \nto another allegedly desperate situation. Just like our Border Patrol, \nour National Guard is stretched thin. Right now, there are over 15,500 \nmembers of the National Guard deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the \ntime between September of 2001 and November 30, 2007, close to 255,000 \nNational Guard troops have been deployed in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. This year, my home State of New \nJersey, by way of example, will witness the largest deployment of \nNational Guard personnel since World War II.\n  So before we rush to act, we should know what the impact of moving \nthe National Guard would have on the safety of our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan in terms of those needs. That is why my amendment would \nprohibit deployment of the National Guard--would ensure, I shouldn't \nsay prohibit--would ensure that deployment of the National Guard to the \nborders could take place, but two important things would have to happen \nfirst. First, the Secretary of Defense would have to certify that the \ndeployment would not negatively impact the safety of our troops in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. Second, the Governor of the home State of the National \nGuard must certify that the deployment would not have a negative impact \non the safety and security of that home State. After all, protecting \nthe people of the home State is the whole reason States have National \nGuard units in the first place.\n  We cannot endorse a policy that robs Peter to pay Paul. We have to \nthink long and hard about the impact of taking resources away from Iraq \nor Afghanistan, taking resources away from the States that face the \nrisk of natural disasters as big and as devastating as Hurricane \nKatrina. We have to know that taking these resources away will not hurt \nus more than it helps us. My amendment makes sure that before we act, \nwe know what we are getting into.\n  Now, I do not disagree with every aspect of my colleague's \namendments. In fact, there are two provisions in the Sessions amendment \nthat I wholeheartedly support and they are in my amendment as well. I, \nas Senator Sessions, believe we can do more to remove those \nundocumented immigrants in our prison system who should be removed. \nThat is why my amendment would evaluate the Federal, State, and local \nprison populations that are noncitizens in order to identify removable, \nundocumented immigrants.\n\n  I also believe, as Senator Sessions does, that we need to do more to \nimplement the US-VISIT entry and exit data system to make sure we are \nkeeping track of those who actually exit our country once their visas \nexpire. That is why my amendment would help to implement the exit data \nportion of that program.\n  So I will close on this issue by simply saying it is interesting to \nsee some of those who have some of the harshest rhetoric, as well as \nsome of the harshest legislative initiatives, then come and say: But \nwhile I am doing this, we need ag workers, we need H-1B high-tech \nworkers, or we need H-2B lower skilled workers. So they want their \npiece of the immigration pie, but they also want to portray themselves \nas sentries at the border. It just doesn't quite work that way. It just \ndoesn't quite work that way.\n  Immigration is a difficult problem to tackle. That is something I \nthink we can all agree on. Any solution needs to be smart, it needs to \nbe tough, and it needs to be effective. That is what my amendment is--\nsmart, tough, and effective. It provides for enhanced, improved border \nsecurity and enhanced enforcement of immigration laws, while allowing \nthe Department of Homeland Security and the States to determine how \nbest to use Federal resources. It provides support for our Border \nPatrol without threatening the safety or security of our troops serving \noverseas, or for that matter, people of our States. It gets to the root \nof the immigration problem by beefing up enforcement against employers \nacting illegally by hiring undocumented immigrants, the very essence--\nthe magnet--of what drives people to this country.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment when we have the \nopportunity tomorrow rather than the amendment offered by Senator \nSessions. I think it gets to the heart of the problem that all of us \nare challenged to achieve.\n  Very briefly, let me move to one other issue while I still have time. \nI have said before that our debate over this budget is a fight for the \neconomic future of America. The core of our economy is America's middle \nclass: How productively they work, how much they save, how much they \nspend. It is clear as day, clear from the tsunami of foreclosures, \nclear from the reports that are coming in about thousands of people \nlosing their jobs, clear from rising gas prices and health care bills \nand college tuition, it is clear that the middle class needs help.\n  What the middle class does not need is another round of tax giveaways \nfor some of the richest members of our society in which their \ncollective taxes are being used in a way that is disproportionate to \nthose who least need it.\n  Budgets are about priorities; they are about choices. We have to \nchoose. Are we going to do what many of my colleagues on the Republican \nside of the aisle are advocating and spend the people's money helping a \nbillionaire avoid taxes when he bequeaths his mansion to his child or \nare we going to help out two parents who are struggling with the \nmortgage payments on a house for them and their children?\n  When Senate Democrats put together this budget, we made the choice to \nput middle-class families first. I am proud to join Senator Baucus in \noffering a responsible plan for expanded middle-class tax relief.\n  The amendment he is offering will take some of the pressure off the \nfamilies who are most in need of help by providing $300 billion in tax \nrelief for working families.\n  First, it provides tax benefits to members of America's armed \nservices. It is up to us to make sure that when our men and women in \nuniform risk their lives overseas, they have some measure of financial \nsecurity at home. This amendment would help those servicemembers in \nneed by allowing combat pay to count toward eligibility for\n\n[[Page S1978]]\n\nthe earned income tax credit. It would also provide additional relief \nto small businesses that continue to pay the salaries of National Guard \nand Reserve members who are called to duty.\n  The amendment extends relief to parents and married couples. It would \nexpand the child tax credit to provide relief to more families, provide \npermanent relief for married couples from the marriage penalty, and \nmake the 10-percent tax bracket permanent.\n  I am also especially pleased that this amendment includes a provision \nthat I have worked closely in the past with Senator Baucus on expanding \nFederal tax relief for property taxes. It is a provision that would be \nwelcome news to thousands of New Jersey families since property taxes \nare always a top concern. We would create a new standard deduction for \nproperty taxes that could benefit more than a half million New Jersey \ntaxpayers alone, and could send $86 million to the people across the \nState. So that is only one example of how it is replicated across the \ncountry.\n  So I say to my colleagues: remember that American families are all \nwatching us right now to see what we are going to do. Are we going to \nspend $51 billion to hand out tax breaks to Americans who are earning \nover $1 million a year? Or are we going to focus our resources, spend \nthem wisely, to put tax breaks in the hands of those who need it: \nfamilies, service men and women, and Americans who are working hard \nevery day to achieve the American dream? Are we going to do the same on \nthe amendment on immigration? Are we going to focus our resources \nagainst the very essence--the magnet--of what drives people to come to \nthis country in an undocumented fashion and to make sure that our \nNational Guard and Reserves are used the right way and to pursue the \nassistance of the Border Patrol where they ultimately need the help? \nThose are our choices. That is what we will have tomorrow.\n  I hope we will join together to give this responsible tax relief to \nmiddle-class families in America who need it most.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I am here today to explain the three \namendments I have filed to the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution.\n  The Federal Government is now telling a majority of the States, which \nof course includes Wyoming, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, and other \nStates that allow for the production of minerals in their State, that \nan even split is not enough for the Federal Government, even though the \nlaw--the agreement in effect for years--says there will be a split. So \nin an attempt to satisfy an insatiable appetite for money, the \nadministration's budget is to take more of it away from these States--\n$40 million more every year. I am referring to net receipt sharing. \nThat title kind of gives you an idea that these Federal mineral \nroyalties are divided in half--net--that is after expenses--the sharing \nof receipts from mineral leasing activities on public lands. This is \nmoney that our State governments actually use for roads, for health \ncare, for residents of our States, for education for our children, and \nmore efficient and environmentally friendly development of our energy \nresources. It is money that finds its way directly to the people, not \ndown in some bureaucratic black hole. Similar policy that was \nimplemented in 1991 was repealed in 2000. At that time, they were \nstealing 1 percent after the net receipts. That led to a loss of nearly \n$250 million in State revenues. Now they are back again, trying to take \nmore money away from the States. This time they said 2 percent is \nbetter. The Federal Government has maneuvered itself to be in a \nposition where it can take an even higher percentage of our mineral \nroyalty money.\n  Last year, the fiscal year 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act took \n2 percent of the net receipt sharing of Federal mineral royalties from \nthe States. Furthermore, the administration's budget includes a plan to \nmake permanent a 2-percent net royalty receipt sharing provision in \nfiscal year 2009.\n  I ask my colleagues now whether your State is being taken advantage \nof, whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, I am asking you to \nstand with us and support this amendment, amendment No. 4214, to \nrestore the 2-percent net receipt sharing of Federal mineral royalties \nlost to the States in last year's appropriations bill. You know as well \nas I do that your State's money could be next.\n  The Federal Government collects mineral royalties from States that \nallow for energy production on lands in their State. Under the law, the \nStates are entitled to half of the loyalties collected. To distribute \nthe State share, the law intends for the Minerals Management Service to \ndivide the amount of mineral royalties collected by two, write a check \nfor that amount, and mail it to the States. That is all it entails. But \nthe Federal Government's feeble excuse was that it needed an extra 2 \npercent share for ``administrative costs.'' Now, they have been doing \nthis for years without the administrative costs, but they remembered \nthere was this time they were able to steal it before, so now they are \ntrying to steal it again and decided to double the amount. It is not \nanything that is done from an accounting standpoint. It is a Washington \nshakedown.\n\n  As an accountant, I can tell you that dividing by two and writing a \ncheck doesn't take a significant amount of time. Somehow the \nadministration believes it deserves approximately $40 million per year \nto do this activity. This is logic that only happens inside the \nbeltway, and I am telling you that it is patently unfair. If they can \ndo it here, they will do it on other things. It drastically affects my \nState of Wyoming, which supplies a disproportionate share of energy to \nour country. Yet the Federal Government still wants more.\n  We need to pass my amendment not only to keep the mineral royalty \nsystem fair and equal, not only to ensure that more money is used \ndirectly to help people rather than for trumped-up administrative \ncharges, but also to ensure that a few States aren't trapped in a \ncorner by the administration and some in Congress who have their ideas \nfor the money.\n  Unlike bureaucrats, we answer to our constituents. Mine are telling \nme they don't want the Federal Government to take anymore of the \nState's money. I am sure yours will tell you the same thing, either now \nor later. Think about that and support my amendment, which will help \nensure the Federal Government gets a fair share but just a fair share.\n  I also want to speak about two amendments I filed earlier today and I \nwill offer at a later time. One amendment, No. 4215, is designed to \nensure that our States continue to receive formula funding for animal \nhealth research and disease programming. It is administered by the \nCooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service in the \nDepartment of Agriculture. This assistance allows State research \ninstitutions to carry out critical animal health research that is used \nin our communities.\n  We know that animal health is one of the greatest threats to the \nanimal agriculture in our Nation. Recent experiences in other countries \nwith foot-and-mouth disease, avian flu, and mad cow disease bring home \nthe importance of how animal diseases can affect the food supply, human \nhealth, and even national economies.\n  In Wyoming, these funds have been used to help State officials and \nresearchers respond to outbreaks of brucellosis in cattle and help stop \nincidences of blue tongue in livestock. This Animal Health Research and \nDisease program is an excellent investment in American agriculture. \nThis amendment seeks to ensure that animal health formula funding is \nfully funded so our Nation can continue to enjoy the benefits of \nhealthy animals and a safe food system.\n  The third amendment, No. 4216, concerns Ryan White CARE Act funding. \nSome have wondered why we need to discuss this issue. The answer is \nsimple: We need to ensure that the authorization process and the \nappropriations process work in sync with each other. The budget is the \nfirst step in doing that.\n  I worked diligently with Senator Kennedy and others for over a year \nto retool our discretionary domestic HIV/AIDS care program--the Ryan \nWhite CARE Act. In putting that reauthorization together, Senator \nKennedy and I did some background research. We learned that more \nAfrican Americans,\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\nmore women, and more individuals in rural areas--especially in the \nSouth--are infected and dying from HIV than ever before. We learned \nthat the old Ryan White formulas didn't count someone until they had \nAIDS, instead of trying to help them when they had HIV only--that is \n``only'' with a very small ``o.'' We learned that the funding formulas \nhurt areas where most African Americans lived because they were more \nlikely to have HIV and not AIDS. Given what we learned, Senator Kennedy \nand I had a principle that the money should follow the person. We \nrealized the program had to be fairer, the money had to follow the \nperson.\n  The Senate passed the revised Ryan White funding formulas by \nunanimous consent on December 6, 2006. A few days later, the House also \npassed the Ryan White program unanimously. We were all pleased when the \nPresident signed that bill and that formula into law a week or so \nlater. Then, of course, we all worked to ensure that the Ryan White \nprogram received the appropriate funding for those newly revised \nfunding formulas. You can imagine my dismay when, during the \nappropriations process last year, the Ryan White funding formulas were \nhijacked for other purposes. As noted by the GAO, one provision, which \nwas called on the Senate floor a ``Pelosi fix,'' funneled $4.8 million \naway to the San Francisco metropolitan area, or EMA, from all of the \nother cities receiving funding. In other words, one city changed the \nformula in appropriations, as opposed to authorization, and stole money \nfrom the other cities to give themselves a level of funding that was \nnot related to the people who had HIV. GAO also noted that ``the San \nFrancisco EMA continues to be the only urban area whose formula funding \nis based on both living and deceased AIDS cases.'' I will repeat that--\n``deceased AIDS cases.'' San Francisco continues to receive funding for \ndead people.\n\n  So, in effect, this misguided appropriations process took money from \nthe growing population of individuals infected with HIV, including \nAfrican Americans, women, and people living in rural areas, so that San \nFrancisco could receive more dollars. This is further infuriating \nbecause a recent report by the HHS Office of the Inspector General \nnoted that in the last 5 years, San Francisco has been unable to spend \nall of the funds it has received. This simply doesn't make sense.\n  Therefore, I hope this year we will start the debate off right and \nreaffirm our commitment to those who have the HIV domestically by \nstanding by our newly revised Ryan White funding formulas, which passed \nby unanimous consent in both Houses, and were addressed in an amendment \nreferred to the budget where, again, those people objected to having \nmoney stolen from their funds to go to a community that didn't follow \nthe authorization funding. So we don't want it funneled off for \ninappropriate purposes. That is why I will be offering this amendment, \nand I hope the Senate will be able to accept it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the next speaker in order is in the chair. \nWhen somebody replaces him, I will yield the floor. I rise to say a \ncouple of words about what I consider to be a very dangerous precedent \nthat appears about to be reset through the House resolution on the \nbudget. There is something called reconciliation, which is the true \nhammer in the budget resolution. It allows changes in things such as \nMedicare, Medicaid, entitlement programs, or tax policy to be passed \nunder an expedited procedure here in the Senate with only 51 votes. It \nis at the essence of the Budget Act.\n  Its whole purpose, and the reason it was created, was in order to \ndiscipline the rate of growth of entitlement programs as its primary \ncause and to address tax policy.\n  Last year, there was a token reconciliation instruction given of $750 \nmillion. I say that because reconciliations passed always have been \nused to save considerable sums of money, or reduce the rate of growth \nof programs by considerable sums.\n  When I chaired this committee, we reconciled primarily Medicare, but \nother spending accounts, including agriculture, to the tune of almost \n$40 billion. In 1996, reconciliation was used for, I believe, $96 \nbillion of savings and reductions in the rate of growth of programs. So \nthis $750 million alleged savings put in the House vehicle last year \nwas essentially a fig leaf to cover up not a use of reconciliation for \nthe purpose it was originally designed, which is to control the rate of \ngrowth of spending, but to actually use it as a stalkinghorse to \nradically expand programmatic activity, with the protection of a 51-\nvote procedure that is basically not amendable.\n  What happened last year was that under that $750 million of savings, \nalmost $19.2 billion of new spending occurred--new spending, new \nprograms, expanded programs.\n  As a result of that, the Government grew by $19.2 billion in the long \nrun. Yes, there were savings taken from other accounts, basically \nreducing the reimbursement to student lenders, but those savings pale \ncompared to the outyear costs of what the programmatic activity that \nwas added under reconciliation will be in last year's bill. Now we see \nthis game being played again.\n  This is a cynical game, because reconciliation applies only to the \nSenate. The House doesn't need reconciliation protection. They have a \nHouse Rules Committee. No bill in the House can come to the floor \nwithout a rule, and the Rules Committee has the ability to enforce the \nwill of the majority--without the filibuster.\n  In the Senate, of course, there is the filibuster. Reconciliation was \ndesigned for the sole purpose of addressing these very significant \nprogrammatic activities, and trying to control their rate of growth in \na way that would not have the filibuster applied, because these \nprograms were so significant and because making progress on controlling \nthe rate of growth is always a challenge.\n  So reconciliation is a vehicle that only disciplines the Senate \nactivity. It doesn't discipline House activity. What it does in the \nSenate is denies the minority rights, because it basically eliminates \nthe filibuster, as things are put under reconciliation.\n  Why would the House of Representatives include reconciliation \ninstructions? The Senate bill doesn't have any reconciliation \ninstructions--none. Well, there is a game going on. As I said, it is \ncynical, and it is a game that undermines the basic purpose of the \nBudget Act. This is a direct attack on the rights of the Budget Act and \nthe rights given under that act. When the House puts in that \nreconciliation instruction for a token amount of money--it is a lot of \nmoney, but under the terms of this budget, it is a fig leaf event--$750 \nmillion. What happens is when they go to conference, they will claim \nthey have the right to pursue reconciliation instructions, which will \nnot affect the House's ability to pass a bill, but it will affect the \nSenate's bill and how the Senate proceeds. We may see that \nreconciliation instruction--in fact, I almost guarantee we will see it \nin conference balloon into a massive programmatic expansion of some \nnature, and it could be two or three different programs, protected by \nreconciliation, and then passed in the Senate under a procedure of \nreconciliation; and while the savings may be a token amount that is put \nforward in the House bill, the expansion in the size of the Government \nwill be extraordinary.\n  The whole purpose of the Budget Act, which is to discipline the rate \nof growth of the Federal Government and put some discipline into the \nprocess of budgeting, will have been made a farce by this procedure. It \ntruly damages and destroys the Budget Act, in my humble opinion, for \nthis process to go forward. It is also an incredibly cynical act.\n  If the Senate leadership wants to expand programs in the Senate with \nreconciliation protection, have the courage to bring the language to \nthe floor of the Senate and let us vote on it during the budget \nprocess. Don't use this backdoor procedure of having the House Budget \nCommittee do your dirty work, which is what is happening in this \nsituation.\n\n  So this, regrettably, appears to be the game that is about to be \nplayed. I happen to think it violates the privilege of the budget \nresolution. I think when something like this happens, which is such a \nclear and obvious affront to the process of the budget and is so \noutside the scope of what was\n\n[[Page S1980]]\n\noriginally considered as the purpose of reconciliation, that basically \nundermines the privilege of the budget resolution. Clearly, if it does \nnot do it from a standpoint of a parliamentary situation, it does it \nfrom a standpoint of what is fair play around here and what is a proper \nprocedure and the proper way to budget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and whoever is in order next I \nguess will be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4238\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, \namendment 4238, which I will call up at the appropriate time, but for \nnow I would like to explain to my colleagues what this amendment is \nabout.\n  This amendment is very similar to a provision Senator Gregg included \nin the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget resolution. It would stop Congress's \naddiction to emergency spending. It would create a point of order \nagainst any spending over a designated amount set aside for \nemergencies--called an ``emergency reserve fund.'' By now Congress \nknows that we will have emergencies every year.\n  We should, therefore, set aside a designated amount for true \nemergencies to meet that obligation and try to stick to it, rather than \ncontinuing on with an unlimited emergency designation that just invites \nabuse and irresponsible budgeting.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio I had a rainy day fund, or a savings \naccount, for those economic downturns or unforeseen events beyond the \ncontrol of even the best money managers. Soon after I arrived at the \nstatehouse, I discovered that Ohio's rainy day fund was at 14 cents, \nbut by the end of my eight years as Governor, I had increased the rainy \nday fund balance to $906.9 million.\n  Again and again, the United States Congress has abused the emergency \ndesignation to skirt around budget limits and pay-go. We all understand \nthat on occasion we face natural disasters or unanticipated crises such \nas Hurricane Katrina and 9/11 that require emergency resources. For \nthis reason, we cannot estimate all of our emergency spending in the \nbudget each year.\n  But I am extremely concerned that Congress has abused the emergency \ndesignation in recent years to spend large sums of money outside the \nbudget for purposes that are not true emergencies. Congress doesn't \neven count the money as spending. If spending is designated as \n``emergency,'' it is exempted from budget controls and spending limits. \nCongress doesn't even count the money on spending.\n  An example of the sort of abuse of emergency spending that concerns \nme is the designation of funding for the 2000 Census as an emergency, \neven though the U.S. Constitution has required a census be conducted \nevery 10 years since 1790. The definition of ``emergency'' uses words \nlike ``sudden'' and ``unforeseen.'' But in 2000 we had known about the \ncensus for 210 years. This is absurd.\n  As part of my effort to reign in wasteful spending and conduct \nmeaningful oversight of government programs, I asked the GAO to review \ntrends in so-called ``emergency'' and ``supplemental'' spending over \nthe decade stretching from 1997 through 2006, as well as propose \nreforms to ensure that emergency funding truly is for real emergencies \nand not simply a way to camouflage spending that is driving up the \nnational debt.\n  GAO found that $31 billion over a 10-year period did not fit the \ndefinition of an ``emergency,'' 35 spending accounts received emergency \nfunding in at least six out of 10 years, and over one-third of \nemergency spending has no time limit on when agencies can spend the \nmoney.\n  My amendment would state that the fiscal year 2009 emergency \ndesignation can only be used for $65 billion worth of spending-\nreserving $50 billion for the global war on terror and leaving another \n15 billion for any legitimate emergencies. Of course, this $50 billion \nwould be in addition to the $70 billion already in the Budget for Iraq \nand Afghanistan-and so my amendment would allow $120 billion total for \nthe global war on terror outside the discretionary spending limits.\n  This point of order could be raised against any spending over the \ndesignated amount set aside for emergencies and would make clear that \nthis increase in spending would have to bust through the regular \nbudget. Of course, the Senate could still bust the budget with 60 \nvotes, but at least someone would be throwing a penalty flag so that we \nare being honest about it, instead of using the emergency label to \nclaim we are staying within the budget when we are not.\n  Mr. President, $50 billion is based on the 5-year average for \nemergency defense spending and $15 billion is based on the 10-year \naverage for certain other types of emergencies, as estimated by the \nGAO. These levels are based on a recent study conducted at my request \nby the Government Accountability Office evaluating recent trends in \nemergency spending.\n  I hope that my amendment can find broad bipartisan support, and that \nwe can begin to eliminate some of the outright abuses of the emergency \ndesignation.\n  It is time for us to be honest with the American people about the \ntrue state of our nation's fiscal health and stop relying on smoke and \nmirrors. The longer Congress waits before it gets serious about fiscal \nresponsibility, the heavier the burden will be for our kids and \ngrandkids. And it all starts with honest and transparent budgeting.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the Presiding \nOfficer has the right to the floor as soon as someone comes over and \nhelps him out. Pending him being relieved of his duties as the \nPresiding Officer, I ask unanimous consent that we yield to Senator \nCollins 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4209\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this is the only time I am happy that a \nDemocratic Senator is in the chair. It actually worked out well \ntonight. I thank Senator Gregg for his courtesy as well and also for \nhis tremendous leadership on budget issues.\n  Senator Levin and I have filed an amendment, No. 4209, that will help \nset us on a path toward energy independence, as well as provide a more \nsensible and balanced energy tax policy.\n  This has been a very long, hard, cold, and snowy winter in the State \nof Maine. As I have visited communities across the State, I hear time \nand again that the high cost of energy is imposing such a burden on our \ncitizens.\n  My hometown of Caribou, ME, saw 17 days of at or below zero \ntemperatures in February. Caribou is only inches short of setting a \nrecord for snowfall in the winter. The previous record was 181 inches \nof snow. It is clear that record is going to be broken. In fact, more \nsnow and cold weather is forecast for this weekend. It takes a great \ndeal of energy to heat a home under such conditions.\n  Rapidly increasing prices for home heating oil, gasoline, diesel \nfuel, and other products refined from fuel are a huge burden for most \nMaine families, for our truckdrivers, for our small businesses, for so \nmany people. High oil prices affect virtually every corner of our \neconomy in Maine and throughout the Nation, and they are a significant \ncause of the current economic downturn.\n  With net profits of a single oil company reaching almost $10 billion \nin a single quarter, I believe we should not expect taxpayers \nstruggling to pay their bills to continue to subsidize the oil industry \nthrough tax incentives.\n  Last year, I introduced a bill that would take away needless tax \nbreaks for the oil industry, and along with my colleague, Senator \nLevin, I am proposing much the same approach today with the Collins-\nLevin energy independence amendment. These are the very tax breaks that \nat a hearing in November of 2005 executives of the big oil companies \nthemselves conceded are not necessary. I simply see no justification to \ncontinue to provide reduced tax rates for one of the world's most \nprofitable industries at a time when so many families and small \nbusinesses are struggling due to the high cost of oil.\n  Mr. President, does it not make sense for us to take a look at these \ntax subsidies which the oil companies themselves have admitted they do \nnot need\n\n[[Page S1981]]\n\nas incentives? In fact, obviously, with oil over $100 a barrel, it is \ndifficult to think that price alone is not a sufficient incentive for \nexploration and drilling to find additional supplies.\n  We also must embrace the goal of energy independence. I think we \nshould establish the year 2020 as the date by which we want to be \nenergy independent. We need to pursue this goal of energy independence \nwith just as much fervor and commitment as we pursued the goal of \nlanding a man on the Moon in the 1960s.\n  I am pleased that the Budget Committee included provisions to extend \nthe renewable energy production credit, the clean renewable energy \nbonds, and provisions for energy-efficient buildings, products, and \npowerplants in section 304 of the budget resolution. But we need to do \nmore. We need to develop policies that are all aimed toward the goal of \nfreeing us from our dependence on imported oil.\n  I know it must trouble you, Mr. President, as much as it does me when \nI hear the dictator in Venezuela threatening to shut off oil to this \ncountry. The fact is, with 12 percent of our oil coming from Venezuela, \nthat would hurt our economy. I don't think we should be dependent on \nMiddle East oil given the instability of that region as well.\n  So we can embrace the goal of energy independence by the year 2020. \nWe have taken a step toward that goal by increasing the fuel-efficiency \nstandards for our cars, light trucks, and SUVs. That will help save a \nmillion barrels of oil a day. But there is more we can do.\n  In addition to the energy tax credits that I have mentioned that are \nin the budget resolution, the Collins-Levin amendment would provide for \na tax credit for replacing old, inefficient wood stoves with clean-\nburning, more efficient wood stoves and pellet stoves that can provide \nmuch more heat for far less fuel than was once the case.\n  In addition, we should provide a production tax credit for cellulosic \nethanol and a vehicle tax credit for plug-in hybrid electric drive \nvehicles. I know that has been a goal of the Senator from Utah for many \nyears as well.\n  Unlike the current language in the budget resolution, the Collins-\nLevin amendment also proposes offsetting some of the costs of these \nrenewable energy credits and other kinds of conservation credits by \npulling back some of the tax breaks for the large oil companies. \nEstimates of savings from this proposal range up to $6.4 billion over 5 \nyears. I think that is reasonable, and that will help shift our tax \npolicy toward credits and other incentives that will help us reach the \ngoal of energy independence.\n  Let me describe a little bit more the provisions having to do with a \ntax credit for clean-burning wood stoves or for wood pellet stoves.\n  During the height of the oil crisis in the 1970s, many families \nthroughout the country turned to wood as an affordable way to heat \ntheir homes. With oil prices soaring once again, wood is the fuel of \nchoice for an increasing number of households, particularly in a \nheavily forested State such as the State of Maine. But, unfortunately, \nmany of the wood stoves purchased decades ago are outdated, \ninefficient, and are contributing to both indoor and outdoor air \npollution. The emissions from these old-style wood-burning stoves \npresent a serious health concern, contributing to respiratory ailments \nsuch as asthma.\n\n  There have been great, exciting advances in wood stove technology. I \nsaw them personally at a Jotul plant in Gorham, ME. They now have a \nsecond burn of the emissions, which makes them far more efficient and \nalso far cleaner burning. New EPA-certified wood and wood pellet stoves \ncan cut emissions by more than 70 percent and use as much as a third \nless firewood for the same amount of heat.\n  But it is expensive to make that transition from the old, dirty, \ninefficient wood stove to the clean-burning stove. That is why our \namendment includes a $500 tax credit to help consumers purchase and \ninstall these new clean-burning stoves as well as the efficient, clean \nwood pellet stoves.\n  We also provide a tax credit for the production of cellulosic \nethanol. While there has been a great deal of focus on corn-based \nethanol in order to decrease our reliance on foreign oil, there are \nother renewable plant-based energy sources.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the University of Maine is doing exciting \nwork in this area.\n  In addition and finally, our proposal would provide a tax credit for \nplug-in hybrid vehicles. That, too, would help reduce our reliance on \nforeign oil.\n  This amendment takes a balanced approach toward our tax policy, and \nit will help advance us toward the goal of energy independence.\n  The Collins-Levin amendment would provide for a tax credit for \nproduction of cellulosic ethanol. While there has been a great deal of \nfocus on using corn-based ethanol in order to decrease our reliance \nupon foreign oil, there are other renewable, plant-based energy sources \nthat are more environmentally friendly and have greater potential to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. These technologies will help move our \npetroleum-based economy toward a renewable, sustainable forest bio-\neconomy. In fact, researchers at the University of Maine recently \nteamed up with a local pulp mill to demonstrate cellulosic ethanol \nproduction at a commercial scale. It is an exciting time for this new \ntechnology.\n  Finally, the Collins-Levin amendment would provide for a tax credit \nfor plug-in hybrid vehicles. If all new vehicles added to the U.S. \nfleet for 10 years were plug-in hybrids, an additional 80 billion \ngallons of gasoline could be saved each year. Obviously, we won't be \nreplacing all new vehicles with plug-in hybrids, but that statistic \nillustrates the large impact plug-in hybrids can have on reducing our \nuse of oil.\n  The provisions in our amendment are in addition to renewable energy \nproduction and energy efficiency provisions already in section 304.\n  Section 304 would allow for extension of the renewable electricity \nproduction tax credit. I believe it is important to give companies \ncertainty now to plan investments in renewable electricity generation \nfor the near future. These efforts represent a large up-front capital \ninvestment. Thus, companies will not continue to expand renewable \nenergy production in the absence of this credit, which makes such \nprojects cost competitive with traditional energy sources.\n  Section 304 also would allow for legislation to encourage energy \nefficient buildings, products, and powerplants. Making buildings more \nenergy efficient can dramatically reduce our use of oil and save money \nfor consumers at the same time. For example, on average, weatherizing a \nhome reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by \n$358 per year.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, this \namendment provides for the rescission of tax breaks that the oil \ncompanies themselves testified they do not need. It uses that revenue \nfor additional renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Collins-Levin energy independence \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Collins-Levin \namendment when it is voted on.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the close \nof business tonight, all statutory time be yielded back, except for 30 \nminutes to be equally divided and controlled between the chair and the \nranking member for their use when the Senate resumes consideration of \nthe concurrent resolution on Thursday, March 13.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment my distinguished colleague \nfrom Maine. She does such a great job around here, and we all respect \nher and know how hard she works. She has terrific ideas, so we are very \ngrateful to have her as a colleague.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment designed to protect \nMedicare beneficiaries' coverage choices. It will protect beneficiaries \nliving in rural areas. It will protect beneficiaries with chronic \nconditions such as diabetes, congestive heart failure, and even cancer. \nIt will protect beneficiaries who use preventive health screening \nbenefits. It will protect low-income Medicare beneficiaries from high \nout-of-pocket costs.\n\n[[Page S1982]]\n\n  Simply put, my amendment creates a budget-neutral reserve fund so \nthat if Congress takes action to improve the Medicare, Medicaid, or \nCHIP Programs, it may not limit coverage choices for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. It also may not reduce the benefits of those who are \nenrolled in Medicare Advantage Plans.\n  The Medicare Advantage Program was established by the 2003 Medicare \nModernization Act. I know; I was on the conference committee and one of \nthe key people in helping to pass that bill. Through the Medicare \nAdvantage Program, health plans receive a monthly payment to provide \nbeneficiaries at least all of the health benefits covered by \ntraditional Medicare.\n  Prior to the MMA, these plans had difficulty existing in rural areas, \nsuch as Utah, due to very low monthly payments. In fact, Utah did not \nhave Medicare Plus Choice Programs for any length of time because the \nplans simply could not exist due to low reimbursement rates, and that \nwas true in almost every rural area in the country. The Medicare \nModernization Act of 2003 increased payments to these plans, and as a \nresult, every State now has Medicare Advantage Plans that are offered \nto its residents, and each State's residents are benefiting greatly \nfrom this.\n  Medicare Advantage Plans provide a lot more to beneficiaries than \ntraditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage Plans provide a range of \nadditional benefits not available in traditional Medicare, such as \nvision and dental care, annual physical exams, and hearing aids. \nMedicare Advantage Plans also have chronic-care programs for \nbeneficiaries with chronic diseases, such as diabetes or congestive \nheart failure. Through chronic-care plans, these beneficiaries are able \nto manage their illnesses because their doctors provide a coordinated \ncare approach to their conditions. That is why these plans work. That \nis why they are so much appreciated by seniors, especially, all over \nthis country. In other words, health care providers actually talk to \neach other under Medicare Advantage, and they try to figure out the \nbest course of action so that the patients will stay healthier longer.\n  This is not the case in traditional Medicare. A beneficiary in \ntraditional Medicare may see as many as five or six physicians for \nvarious health problems--a nephrologist for kidney failure, an \northopedic surgeon for a broken ankle, an endocrinologist for an \nunderactive thyroid, and an internist for general health issues. In \naddition, medicines are prescribed by each of these physicians without \nconsultation, which sometimes may have disastrous results, all maybe \nnot even understanding the others in the picture. Would these \nphysicians talk to each other when the beneficiary is covered by \ntraditional Medicare? Chances are very high that they would not. That \nis why Medicare Advantage Plans are so good for beneficiaries. These \nplans encourage providers to approach health care collaboratively--\nsomething that I believe is in the beneficiary's best interest.\n  Health plans have been covering Medicare beneficiaries for many years \nthrough programs authorized by Congress. However, these Medicare health \nplans were typically limited to beneficiaries living in urban areas. \nThe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 prompted Congress to take action to \nprovide more coverage choices for beneficiaries living in rural areas.\n  Mr. President, in Pennsylvania, in your State, there are a lot of \nrural areas. In fact, I remember my good friend, Senator Chuck \nGrassley, the ranking Republican of the Senate Finance Committee, \npushing for equitable payments in rural areas so that plans could be \noffered to beneficiaries living in areas such as Pennsylvania, Utah, \nand Iowa. At that time, payment rates to plans offered in urban areas \nwere higher--in some cases, a lot higher--than payments in rural areas. \nUnfortunately, we didn't quite get it right in the BBA 1997, the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. We should have listened to Senator \nGrassley because he was right. In fact, my home State of Utah could not \nkeep Medicare Plus Choice plans in the State primarily because the \npayment rates were too low, and that is true of every rural State. \nIronically, many Utahns wanted to participate in these plans because \nthey were the only ones offering the supplemental benefits such as \nvision care, preventive benefits, and prescription drugs to Medicare \nbeneficiaries at that time.\n  Now, let me go to chart one here. We finally were able to achieve the \nappropriate payment rates for both rural and urban parts of the country \nthrough the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. In fact, this chart \nshows how many Medicare Advantage Plans are available throughout the \ncountry since its passage. While this chart illustrates the different \npayment levels of Medicare Advantage Plans across the country, it also \nshows that many Medicare Advantage Plans are available in every county \nin every State in this country. Think about that. In other words, all \nMedicare beneficiaries have access to at least one Medicare Advantage \nPlan, but every part of the United States of America is covered by \nMedicare Advantage. It has been a terrific thing for our people who \nhave suffered in these areas and who now are covered under Medicare \nAdvantage.\n\n  Now, these people may choose between traditional Medicare or a \nMedicare Advantage plan. They can make the choice of whatever plan they \nwant. The primary goal of the Medicare Modernization Act was to give \nbeneficiaries a choice of coverage.\n  Now, again, when we first established ceilings for Medicare Plus \nChoice plans, we discovered that our floor payments for rural areas \nwere too low. Medicare Plus Choice plans simply could not exist in \nrural areas.\n  Congress learned an important message from that experience, and that \nis why we adjusted the payment ceilings and floors for Medicare \nAdvantage Plans in the Medicare Modernization Act, to ensure access to \nMedicare Advantage Plans in both rural and urban parts of the country. \nThey are in all parts of the country today because of the changes we \nmade in that bill. This chart proves that we accomplished that goal.\n  Now, let me go to chart two. This next chart will give my colleagues \nand everybody in America who is watching an idea of what could happen \nif Congress eliminates the rural and urban floor payments for Medicare \nAdvantage Plans. The white parts of this map highlight the regions of \nthe country where Medicare Advantage Plans may no longer be offered. It \nis the vast majority of America, if we do what some are saying we \nshould do. It is very disconcerting to me that my very home State of \nUtah is almost completely white--right over there. There is only one \nlittle yellow spot and one dark-blue spot. In other words, we would \ndecimate one of the programs that has worked so doggone well.\n  In essence, if we eliminate these payments from Medicare Advantage \nPlans, we will have a repeat of what happened with Medicare Plus \nChoice. Plans will pull out of the rural parts of the country, and \nbeneficiaries will be left without any choice at all. It will be deja \nvu all over again. I, for one, do not want to see that happen again.\n  Now, let me go to chart three. This is important because another \ninteresting point about the Medicare Advantage Plans is that \nbeneficiaries are less likely to have problems accessing care compared \nto beneficiaries enrolled in traditional Medicare.\n  This chart shows that Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, as \nrepresented by the light blue on the left--there is light blue, green, \nthen dark blue--Medicare Advantage beneficiaries have an easier time \naccessing care compared to those in traditional Medicare with and \nwithout supplemental health care. The light blue are Medicare Advantage \nenrollees, the green are all fee-for-service enrollees, and the dark \nblue are all fee-for-service who get supplemental coverage. When we \nwere creating the Medicare Advantage Program, we strongly believed that \nbeneficiaries should be able to have access to health care similar to \nthe health care plans of Members of Congress.\n  Now, let's take a couple of minutes to go through this chart. It is \nan important chart. Only 2.8 percent of Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiaries have no usual source of care, compared to 11.8 percent of \nthose beneficiaries in traditional Medicare who do not have \nsupplemental health coverage. Only 7.7 percent of Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiaries do not have a usual doctor, compared to 24.6 percent of \nbeneficiaries in traditional Medicare without supplemental coverage. \nOnly 4.5\n\n[[Page S1983]]\n\npercent of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries had trouble getting care, \ncompared to 8.4 percent of those beneficiaries in traditional Medicare \nwithout supplemental health coverage. Only 6.5 percent of Medicare \nAdvantage beneficiaries delayed getting their care due to costs, \ncompared to 18.6 percent of those beneficiaries in traditional Medicare \nwithout supplemental coverage. Only 7.5 percent of Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiaries needed to see a doctor but didn't, compared to 14.3 \npercent of those beneficiaries in traditional Medicare who do not have \nsupplemental coverage.\n  Look at it, starting on the left. No usual source of care--the light \nblue shows that they do have care compared to the other two. No usual \ndoctor--the light blue again shows that they have their doctors. The \nthird one over in from the left had trouble getting care, and you can \nsee the light blue had less trouble than the other two. Then you go to \ndelayed care because of cost. The light blue again was not delayed, \ncompared to the green and the dark blue. Needed to see a doctor but \ndidn't--the light blue, compared to green, compared to the dark blue \ndidn't see the doctor and saved money over that time.\n  These statistics, based on the 2006 Medicare Current Beneficiary \nSurvey, make one point very clear: Beneficiaries in Medicare Advantage \nPlans have been getting better care.\n  So let me conclude by urging my colleagues to keep in mind the \nfollowing:\n  Today, beneficiaries across the country, whether they live in a rural \nState, such as Pennsylvania, Iowa, Utah, or in almost every State in \nthe Union, or urban areas such as Boston, they have better coverage \nchoices.\n  Today, beneficiaries are offered more choices in Medicare Advantage, \nmore benefits, and lower out-of-pocket costs. Today, most beneficiaries \nare satisfied. Over 90 percent of beneficiaries are satisfied with \ntheir Medicare Advantage plans. That is historically an astounding \nsuccess story. We all need to remember that these policy decisions, in \ncreating the Medicare Modernization Act, were created on a bipartisan \nbasis. I was there.\n\n  These bipartisan decisions helped achieve these impressive results, \nand these results should be protected. This is really important, and \nunfortunately we have people who want to get money out of Medicare \nAdvantage and take away these benefits that have helped so many people \nin our country today, especially in the rural areas. We just cannot let \nthat happen. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to protect \nthese Medicare Advantage plans and to quit playing with something that \nis working so wonderfully well.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side will listen to these remarks I \nhave been making. I know some of them know this is true, and the \nothers, who have not studied it, ought to study it. They should not \ncarve money out of a program that is as effective as is this one. It \nhas exceeded the expectations we had when we were negotiating the \nMedicare Modernization Act by far. It is one of the most successful \nFederal programs. Frankly, it has done an awful lot of good to bring \nhealth care to those throughout our country and all of those States \nwhere plans have proliferated because they work.\n  I hope everybody will vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4268\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to speak to amendment No. 4268. This \namendment would provide for a total of $200 million over the next 5 \nfiscal years for tribal justice and law enforcement. Specifically, this \namendment would do two things in a fiscally responsible way. First, it \nwould increase the BIA's public safety and justice account, which funds \ntribal law enforcement, tribal court systems, and tribal detention \ncenters by $25 million a year for the next 5 years. Second, it would \nincrease funding for U.S. attorneys to prosecute crimes in Indian \nCountry by $15 million a year for the next 5 years. The need for this \namendment on our Nation's reservations cannot be overstated, as the \nabsence of basic levels of public safety is reaching a crisis point.\n  The statistics are startling. Nationally, studies show that one of \nevery three Native American women will be raped in their lifetime. \nCrime rates on remote reservations are an average of 10 times higher \nthan the rest of the Nation. The Department of Justice has found that \nAmerican Indian women are 2\\1/2\\ times more likely to be raped or \nsexually assaulted than women throughout the rest of the country.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, homicide rates within reservations \nare almost 10 times higher than those found in the rest of South \nDakota. According to the BIA, Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has the second \nhighest rate of crime of all the reservations in the Nation.\n  In order to start to help improve public safety on our Nation's \nreservations, there needs to be a two-part solution. First, we have to \nensure there are adequate law enforcement personnel on the reservations \nto respond to, to investigate, and to deter crime--something that is \nnot currently happening. For example, again, my home State of South \nDakota, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which sits on the border of \nNorth and South Dakota and occupies over 2 million acres of land, \ncurrently has only 16 commissioned police officers. That works out to \nno more than three officers a shift for over 2 million acres of land.\n  To put that in perspective, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe land is \nmore than two times larger than the State of Rhode Island, which has \n200 sworn State troopers plus additional county, city, and Federal \nofficers. That means Rhode Island has 12 times as many State troopers \nas the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has law enforcement officers, to \npolice half the land.\n  Rhode Island also has 10 State trooper police dogs, meaning that at \nany given time, Rhode Island has more canine officers patrolling than \nStanding Rock Indian Reservation has human law enforcement officers. \nWhile there are population discrepancies between the Standing Rock \nSioux Tribe and Rhode Island, the differences between the two are still \nstartling. My amendment addresses this need to increase the number of \nlaw enforcement officers on reservations by increasing funding for the \nBIA's public safety and justice account.\n  Second, there has to be some assurance that those who have been \narrested, especially those arrested for violent crimes, are prosecuted \nto the fullest extent of the law. Over the past two decades, only 30 \npercent of tribal land crimes referred to U.S. attorneys were \nprosecuted, according to Justice Department data compiled by Syracuse \nUniversity. This compares with 56 percent of all other cases.\n  My amendment addresses this need with an increase in the BIA's Public \nSafety and Justice Account, which also funds tribal courts, and an \nincrease for U.S. attorneys to prosecute crimes in Indian country.\n  The bottom line is that violent crime has become a serious problem on \nour reservations, particularly on our reservations in South Dakota, and \nI am determined to help reduce it. This $20 million increase in \nspending in fiscal year 2009 is small, less than 4/1000 of 1 percent of \nthe total discretionary spending in fiscal year 2009 in this budget \nresolution, but it will have a big impact on the reservations that are \ntruly in need.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment so we can start \nrestoring basic public safety to our Nation's Indian reservations.\n\n\n                    METH HOT SPOTS BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to speak about an amendment that I \nfiled earlier this afternoon, amendment No. 4269.\n  This amendment, which would provide for a total of $99 million in \nCOPS meth hot spots funding for fiscal year 2009.\n  The underlying budget resolution assumes $70 million for this \nprogram, and my amendment simply provides the additional funds needed \nfor a total of $99 million, as authorized by the Combat Meth Act. This \nimportant program trains State and local law enforcement to investigate \nand lock up meth offenders.\n  In 2006, we passed the Combat Meth Act, which authorizes an \nadditional $99 million per year for 5 years under the COPS Meth Hot \nSpots Program. During the budget debate last year, I offered a similar \namendment that was accepted by unanimous consent.\n\n[[Page S1984]]\n\n  Like last year, my amendment this year would simply provide, in a \nfiscally responsible way, the authorized $99 million for fiscal year \n2009.\n  Meth abuse has become one of the most dangerous problems impacting \nsmall-town rural America and our Indian reservations.\n  As the Department of Justice's 2007 National Drug Assessment notes, \nMexican criminal groups have expanded direct distribution of \nmethamphetamine, targeting smaller communities across the Midwest as \nnew markets.\n  Young people, ages 12-14, who live in small towns, like those across \nSouth Dakota, are 104 percent more likely to use meth than those living \nin large cities.\n  Sadly, hundreds of young children are brought up in households every \nyear by parents who are hooked on meth. Studies show that children were \npresent in more than 20 percent of the meth labs seized.\n  In addition to the costs associated with investigating, locking up, \nand prosecuting meth offenders, there are significant environmental \nclean-up costs involved.\n  The chemicals used to make meth are toxic, and meth producers and \nusers often dump waste into our streams, rivers, fields, and sewage \nsystems. Cleaning up these sites requires specialized training and \ncosts an average of $2,000-$4,000 per site. My amendment would not only \nprovide much-needed funding for law enforcement expenses associated \nwith meth, but also for environmental clean-up to protect our lands and \nwater systems from the harmful effects of this toxic drug.\n  I strongly urge the adoption of this amendment, so we can continue to \ncrack down on the growing meth abuse problem in rural States like South \nDakota and other states across the country.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak, if I might, as well, to the \nbroader issue of the budget resolution. There has been a lot of debate \nabout it. We are in the 50 hours leading up to tomorrow when we have \nthe so-called vote-arama when many of the amendments that have been \nfiled will ultimately be voted on, but I want to make some observations \nabout this budget because I think it is important.\n  I think the American people derive from this an idea about where the \npolitical parties in Washington want to take the country, what their \npriorities are in this budgeting process. Of course this is now a $3 \ntrillion budget that we deal with every single year. The budget \nresolution is a statement of priorities. In many respects, because it \nis nonbinding, it doesn't have the force of law. Sometimes it seems \nthis whole exercise would appear at times, perhaps, to the watching \npublic, to be somewhat more symbolic than anything else. But I do think \nit is important in that it does set the direction, the tone, the \nagendas in Washington, DC. It is a statement of priorities, and it is a \nblueprint for how the two respective political parties in the Senate \nwould govern the country.\n  If you look at where we are in terms of the economy today, and you \nlook at where we have come from in the last 7 years, we did enact over \nthe past several years some historic tax reductions for all Americans. \nDespite a recession, terrorist attacks, corporate scandals, the \ncollapse of the Internet bubble, these tax cuts have resulted in 52 \nconsecutive months of job growth, the second longest period of job \ngrowth on record. Thanks to the progrowth tax policies that were put in \nplace by previous Congresses, unemployment remains relatively low and \nproductivity is higher than the previous three decades. Additionally, \nsignificant job growth followed the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Since 2003, \nnonfarm employment has increased by 8.3 million jobs, including 1.7 \nmillion new jobs last year alone.\n  There is a simple fact of fiscal policy: reducing taxes, reducing \nmarginal income tax rates and capital tax gains rates puts more money \nback into the economy, encourages investment, and creates jobs.\n  On the other hand, tax increases drag the economy down and discourage \njob creation.\n  Unfortunately, on account of high energy prices and falling home \nvalues, our economy faces several short- and long-term challenges. In \nthe fourth quarter of 2007 gross domestic product only increased by .6 \npercent. Payroll employment declined in January and February. Oil \ntraded for almost $110 per barrel this week. Subprime mortgage \nforeclosures are at an all-time high, and the dollar is at an all-time \nlow.\n  In response to these economic challenges, the budget resolution put \nforth by the majority in the Senate calls for a dangerous combination \nof larger Government bureaucracies and higher taxes. In total, the \nDemocratic budget includes a $1.2 trillion tax increase on over 116 \nmillion families and 27 million small businesses.\n  Under the Democratic budget, the reduced individual tax rates are set \nto expire within 20 months. As millions of families prepare their taxes \nahead of the April 15 deadline, I think it is important to point out \nthat this deadline will be even more painful in future years under the \nDemocrat budget resolution, if it is ultimately here adopted.\n  On January 1 of 2011, the 10-percent tax bracket would expire; the \n25-percent tax bracket would increase to 28 percent; the 28-percent tax \nbracket would go up to 31 percent; the 33-percent tax bracket would go \nup to 36 percent; and the 35-percent tax bracket would increase to 39.9 \npercent.\n  On top of the increased tax rates, the increased child tax credit \nwill expire. In other words, in the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, the per-\nchild tax credit was increased to $1,000 per child. Under this budget, \nif the tax cuts are allowed to expire, that would fall back down to \n$500. Families with children would see their tax burden increase \nsubstantially when that $1,000 tax credit is reduced to $500 after the \nyear 2010.\n  Additionally, the marriage penalty is reinstated and the 31 million \nfilers who report dividend income, and the 26 million filers who report \ncapital gains income, would see taxes on their investments go up as \nwell. That impacts, significantly, senior citizens. We have a lot of \nsenior citizens around the country who have investments that they live \non--dividend income, capitol gains income. So these particular tax \nincreases are going to strike disproportionately harshly on those \nsenior citizens across the country who depend on investment income.\n  Finally, the death tax is reinstated at pre-2001 levels. If you took \na look at the 2001 levels, it allows a $1 million exemption and a \nmaximum statutory level of taxation of 55 percent, which is one of the \nhighest death tax rates in the world.\n  Ironically, under the current law, in the year 2010, the death tax \nwould completely disappear, which has prompted a lot of people who do \nestate planning to suggest that, if somebody wants to be able to pass \non their earnings and their lifetime of assets tax free to the next \ngeneration, it would behoove them to decease or to pass away in the \nyear 2010. But the bad news is in 2011, if you are still around, the \ndeath tax kicks back in and it kicks in at enormously high levels: 55 \npercent maximum tax rate and a $1 million exemption. In a State such as \nmine, South Dakota, where you have a lot of farm and ranch families who \nare asset rich but cash poor, in many cases it causes them to liquidate \ntheir assets; in other words, to sell the farm in order to pay the IRS.\n  That is something that makes absolutely no sense. I hope we can avoid \nthat happening. There is going to be an amendment offered by some of my \ncolleagues that would reform the death tax and reform it in a way so \nthat in 2011 we don't go back to the old law, which is incredibly \nrestrictive in terms of the way it takes the money away from those who \nhave accumulated it and worked hard, including a lot of hard-working \nfarmers and ranchers in South Dakota, over the course of their lifetime \nputting away some of their investments and acquiring land and farm \nequipment and that sort of thing.\n  They want to pass it on to the next generation. The next generation \nwants to stay on the farm. But, unfortunately, in many cases, as I \nsaid, they have to sell their assets in order to pay the IRS. In total, \nthe average family is going to see their taxes increase by \napproximately $2,300 per year, which is enough to buy 8 months of \ngroceries for the average family or a year's worth of health care.\n  Over the past few years, there have been a lot of misconceptions \nabout the tax cuts that were enacted in 2001 and\n\n[[Page S1985]]\n\n2003. The first misconception is that the tax cuts are too expensive \nand cost the Federal Government too much in terms of lost revenue. If \nyou look at what has happened in terms of Federal receipts, Federal \nreceipts have dramatically increased since we enacted the 2001 and 2003 \ntax cuts. In fact, in 2000, the Federal Government raised $1.99 \ntrillion in revenue. In 2007, after those historic tax cuts had spurred \nincreased economic growth, the Federal Government collected an all-time \nrecord of $2.57 trillion. So, from the year 2000, where it was just a \nlittle under $2 trillion, to the year 2007, where $2.57 trillion was \ncollected, over a half trillion dollars additional revenue is now \ncoming into the Treasury on an annual basis as a result of the tax cuts \nthat were enacted in 2001 and 2003.\n  So for somehow to believe for a moment that the Federal Government \nhas been deprived of revenue as a result of tax rates being reduced \ndoes not at all jibe with the facts.\n  The first misconception, I would argue, is the one that is held \naround here and often used in debates around here, and is very \nmisguided because tax rates, when they were cut, actually led not to \nless Government revenue but to more Government revenue, and not only \nthat but dramatically more Government revenue.\n  The second misconception is tax cuts created an overly regressive tax \nstructure that only benefits the wealthy. But if you look at recent \ndata from the Congressional Budget Office, the effective Federal tax \nrate for middle-income households is the lowest it has been in the past \n25 years, thanks to the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.\n  For the bottom 20 percent of U.S. households, the total effective \nFederal tax rate fell by nearly a third from the year 2000 to the year \n2005.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, approximately 30 million tax returns \nhad no income tax liability in 2000. After enactment of the historic \ntax cuts, an additional 13 million returns had no income tax liability. \nSo now there are 43 million tax returns in this country where there is \nno income tax liability, as I said, an increase of 13 million returns \nfrom the year 2000.\n  Add that to the 15 million households and individuals who do not file \ntax returns at all, and you have 41 percent of the U.S. population \ncompletely outside the Federal tax system as a result of the tax cuts \nthat were enacted in 2001 and 2003.\n  Now, under the Democratic budget plan, millions of low-income \nAmericans are going to be put back on those tax rolls. My colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle will claim they are extending middle-class \ntax cuts by voting for the Baucus amendment.\n  I wish to make a couple of points about the Baucus amendment. First, \nwe heard this very same claim last year. This is the same song that we \nheard last year, that the Senate is going to pass an amendment that \naddresses some of these, or puts back or restores some of these tax \ncuts.\n  We passed an amendment on the budget resolution last year, a similar \nBaucus amendment, as part of the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution. \nBut we were falsely promised action to extend selected tax cuts as part \nof that budget process.\n  Here we are a year later, the same promises are being made, and the \nsame wall of tax increases is 1 year closer. Now, second, the Baucus \namendment excludes a whole lot of tax cuts that are absolutely critical \nto the well-being of the middle class. Even after the $320 billion \nBaucus amendment, if it is adopted on the budget resolution tomorrow, \nAmericans are still faced with one of the largest tax increases in \nAmerican history.\n  Now, those taxpayers who are following this year's budget process are \nprobably asking themselves: If the Democrats in Congress are going to \nraise taxes by $1.2 trillion, certainly they are going to bring \nstability and solvency to entitlement programs and reduce the Federal \ndebt.\n  Unfortunately, the answer to both those questions is no. The \nDemocratic budget does nothing to rein in out-of-control entitlement \nspending. Rather than enact meaningful reform, the Democratic budget \nresolution leaves our children and grandchildren with $66 trillion \nworth of unfunded Government liabilities.\n  The baby boom generation has already started to retire this year. And \nthe over-65 population will nearly double by the year 2035 to 75 \nmillion people. These demographics, coupled with increasing health care \ncosts, create a $34 trillion unfunded Medicare liability and a $4.7 \ntrillion Social Security liability over the next 75 years.\n  The spiraling cost of entitlement spending is the single greatest \nthreat to the long-term health of our economy, and under the Democratic \nbudget, entitlement spending grows by $488 billion over 5 years. If \nleft unchecked, entitlement spending will account for 70 percent of our \nFederal budget by the year 2017.\n  Under the Democratic budget resolution, the gross Federal debt climbs \nby $2 trillion by 2013. Every American child will owe an additional \n$27,000 to pay down the national debt on account of this budget. This \ndebt will create an economic drag on our Nation for generations to \ncome.\n  The bottom line, the budget resolution that will be voted on \ntomorrow, offered by the majority in the Senate, raises taxes. The \nlargest tax increase in American history we had was back in the 1990s, \nwhen taxes went up about $250 billion under the Clinton administration.\n  At that time, Senator Patrick Moynihan described it as the largest \ntax increase in American history. This will be four times that level of \ntax increase. It increases spending, discretionary spending, increases \nmandatory spending dramatically and does nothing to curb entitlement \nspending to reform entitlements or reduce our Federal debt.\n  In the coming days, Senators are going to have several opportunities \nto correct the shortfalls in this budget. There are going to be a \nnumber of amendments offered tomorrow. I encourage my colleagues to \ntake a good look at these amendments and take advantage of the \nopportunity they have to do what is right for the Federal budget and \nfor hard-working taxpayers across this country and to hopefully adopt \nsome amendments that will make this budget better.\n  But, in the end, I am afraid that in light of the fact that it is \ngoing to increase taxes by $1.2 trillion and increase spending and do \nnothing to reduce the Federal debt, this is a budget I do not think \nmany right-thinking people in the Senate are going to be able to vote \nfor.\n  I would close by noting that as you listen to the Presidential \ncampaign this year, it has been a great experience in democracy. You \nhave seen candidates running out there holding townhall meetings, \nlistening to constituents. It is a wonderful example I think of our \nDemocracy at work and in action.\n  But as typically happens during the course of Presidential campaigns, \nthere are lots of promises that get made on the campaign trial. And in \nmany cases, the other side of the story does not get told; that is, how \nare those programs going to be funded? How are they going to be paid \nfor?\n  That is the side of the story I hope that at some point in the \ncampaign we are going to hear, because if you add up all the new \nprograms that were gathered together into one Cabinet-level department, \nthese programs, posed by our colleague, the Senator from Illinois, you \ncould call it the Department of Unfunded Campaign Promises. There are \n188 new Federal programs that add up to $300 billion a year in new \nFederal spending--$300 billion a year. And that is only 111 programs \nadded up. The other programs they have not been able to score yet.\n\n  But of those they have been able to attach a cost to, $300 billion a \nyear in new spending. That would constitute the third largest Federal \ndepartment in our entire Federal Government, behind only the Department \nof Defense and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  That new department, consisting of 111 new programs, would have a \nlarger budget than the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the \nDepartment of Commerce, the Department of the Interior, the Department \nof State, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Labor, \nthe Department of Energy, and the Department of Justice combined.\n  To look at it another way, this new Department of Unfunded Campaign\n\n[[Page S1986]]\n\nPromises would cost more than 42 States' budgets combined. Not only do \nwe have a budget in front of us today that leads to higher taxes, more \nspending, more debt, we have a lot of obligations that are being \npromised out there on the campaign trail.\n  It seems to me at least that we ought to start tomorrow by defeating \nthis budget that takes us down the wrong path of more Government, \nhigher taxes, and does not do the right thing for the taxpayers of this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4171\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I am going to speak to two amendments that \nI have at the desk that I will be able to talk more about tomorrow. But \nI wished to describe them tonight.\n  First of all, amendment No. 4171 is an amendment that focuses on a \nproblem we see all around us. It seems we cannot go too long in a week \nwhen we do not pick up a newspaper that talks about the safety of the \nfood we eat. It has been an issue of concern for Americans and \ncertainly from people in my home State of Pennsylvania.\n  Over the past year, there have been a steady stream of news reports \non countless incidents of recalled or otherwise contaminated food \nproducts.\n  To mention a few: Spinach contaminated with E. coli; peanut butter \ncontaminated with salmonella; imported fish containing high levels of \nantibiotics; and, finally, culminating last month with the largest meat \nrecall in the history of the United States, 143 million pounds of \nground beef.\n  The safety of our food supply is an issue we can no longer afford to \nignore. My amendment would expand the deficit-neutral reserve fund to \nallow for legislation that enhances the protection and safety of the \nNation's food supply.\n  The funds of this legislation would allow for congressional action. \nIt would do the following: First of all, expand Federal food inspection \nfield forces; second, develop risk-based approaches to inspecting the \nfood supply; third, develop the infrastructure to ensure a coordinated \nFederal food safety approach; No. 4, we would enhance the Food and Drug \nAdministration's recall authority; and, finally, expand food-borne \nillness awareness and education programs.\n  This is a critically important issue, and I know the current \ncosponsors include Senator Grassley, who is on the floor with us \ntonight; Senators Durbin, Brown, Schumer, Lautenberg. So that is the \nfood safety amendment No. 4171. I would urge my colleagues to support \nthat amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4172\n\n  The second amendment is No. 4172, the Wounded Warriors Bonus Equity \nAct. I am proud to introduce this bipartisan amendment to the budget \nresolution calling for payment of bonuses to troops who have retired or \nseparated for combat-related injuries.\n  I wish to thank Senator Clinton and Senator Sessions for agreeing to \nbe original cosponsors on this amendment. The three of us introduced \nlegislation in December of last year in response to reports that \nwounded troops were asked by the Department of Defense to return their \nenlistment bonus. I will say that again. These were troops asked by the \nDepartment of Defense to return their enlistment bonuses after they \nretired or separated from the Armed Services due to combat-related \ninjuries.\n  These troops and tens of thousands of others across the country that \nwere injured in Iraq are struggling to support themselves and their \nfamilies. We owe them what we promised, and we must not drop our \ncommitment to our troops at the shoreline of the United States.\n  The Senate passed our bill, S. 2400, the Wounded Warriors Bonus \nEquity Act, last year by unanimous consent. But we have not reconciled \nour version with that of the House of Representatives which does not \nrequire retroactive payment of the bonus that has already been withheld \nor returned.\n  I wished to commend Congressman Jason Altmire from my home State of \nPennsylvania, in the Fourth District, who helped bring this problem to \nlight when one of our constituents faced the loss of his enlistment \nbonus.\n  I am hopeful that expanding the deficit-neutral reserve fund for \nveterans and wounded servicemembers will include legislation that will \nrequire the Department of Defense to return promised bonus payments and \nconduct an audit to identify any servicemembers who are owed payments.\n  This will pave the way for signing this legislation into law. We have \noften heard the words of Abraham Lincoln when he talked about those who \nperished in war, those who gave the last full measure of devotion.\n  He also spoke, in his Presidency, of those who have been injured in \nwar. He talked about those who have borne the battle and what we owe \nthem. Abraham Lincoln was right. We owe them much. The least we can say \nis we owe them, to fulfill the promise we made to them for those who \nhave indeed borne the battle.\n  I would urge all my colleagues to support this amendment as well, \namendment No. 4172, the Wounded Warriors Bonus Equity Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we all know, the Federal budget is a \nstatement of the Nation's priorities. I want to commend my good friend \nfrom North Dakota who chairs the Budget Committee for setting the right \npriorities for America in this budget resolution.\n  Our Nation is enduring profound changes as we adapt to the global \neconomy. It seems like every day there is more bad economic news. \nSavings are falling and debt is rising. Americans now collectively owe \nmore than $900 billion in credit card debt.\n  Foreclosures are skyrocketing: 200,000 families each month are at \nrisk of losing their homes. Bankruptcies soared by 40 percent last \nyear, and are expected to rise even more this year. Entire industries \nare disappearing, leaving workers and communities devastated in their \nwake. And unemployment is up and going higher.\n  And there is more bad news for America's working families. Now, for \nthe first time in 5 years, we have seen job losses for 2 months in a \nrow, a sure sign that the economy is headed for a recession. Employers \ncut 63,000 jobs in February, the worst job losses since March 2003. And \nit is only likely to get worse.\n  Economists foresee a significant unemployment problem for at least \nthe next 2 years. Goldman Sachs has predicted that the national \nunemployment rate will rise to 6.5 percent by the end of 2009. Many \nStates around the country are already struggling with high \nunemployment. Michigan's unemployment rate is 7.6 percent. South \nCarolina's is 6.6 percent. Ohio just hit the 6 percent mark as well.\n  And workers who lose their jobs are having more and more trouble \nfinding work. Today, roughly 18 percent of unemployed workers have been \nlooking for a job for more than 26 weeks, compared to only 11 percent \nbefore the last recession. That is a dramatically higher level of long-\nterm unemployment, and it is a deeply troubling sign.\n  These aren't just statistical trends or indicators. Every bad number \nreflects a real hardship in people's lives. For these workers and their \nfamilies, a recession isn't just part of the business cycle; it is a \nlife-altering event from which they may never recover.\n  With this kind of uncertain economic future, we need a budget that \nputs a priority on stimulating the economy and giving hardworking \nAmericans the support they need to weather the storm. If we want an \neconomic recovery that works--if we want real opportunity and \nsustainable growth--that effort must start and end with working \nfamilies.\n  This budget sets the right priorities to address these challenges. I \ncommend Senator Conrad for including room in the budget for a second \nstimulus package. This will allow us to take what Democrats know is the \nright path during a recession, putting working people's needs first. \nThat means extending unemployment insurance benefits for the long-term \nunemployed, increasing food stamp benefits, and providing State fiscal \nrelief.\n  This budget further aids those caught up in the economic downturn by \nsetting aside funds that can be used for unemployment insurance \nmodernization, a much needed reform to our social safety net. Many \nworkers who lose their jobs today are finding our unemployment \ninsurance system leaves them out because federal laws haven't changed \nsince the 1960s, even though the American workforce has changed\n\n[[Page S1987]]\n\ndramatically since then. In 2006, only one third of unemployed \nAmericans received unemployment benefits.\n  These workers have paid into the system for years and it is wrong to \nleave them out when they need help the most. This budget will help us \nto give States the resources and flexibility they need to serve working \nfamilies more effectively.\n  These are all important measures, but strengthening the safety net \nduring a crisis is not enough. We need to redouble our efforts to \nrestore economic opportunity for working families. This budget looks \nbeyond the short term. It makes a priority of investing in the \npreparation workers need to compete in the 21st century global economy. \nComprehensive education and job training programs are the keys to that \npreparation.\n  At times like this, we have turned to education to help strengthen \nthe Nation. We did so when developing and expanding the Nation in the \nearly 1800s, when transitioning World War II veterans back into \nsociety, when launching the war on poverty.\n  We have seen time and again that education is one of the best \ninvestments we can make in the Nation's economic strength. For every \ndollar invested in the GI bill, the Nation reaped $7 in return. \nResearch from the OECD shows that when we increase the average number \nof years of education by just 1 year, we can increase our GDP by 3 to 6 \npercent. For every $1 invested in high quality early preschool \nprograms, our society benefits from a $13 return.\n  The Nation's prosperity depends on our ability to prepare our \ncitizens to face a changing economy. But as other nations modernize \ntheir education system, America must also break free of the shackles of \na school system designed for the industrial age, not the information \nage.\n  We know the school model of centuries past doesn't cut it in today's \neconomy:\n  A single, isolated teacher lecturing to a class of 30 students \nreflects the production-line model of the Industrial Age. Today, our \nknowledge economy demands smaller classes with individualized \ninstruction and a focus on more advanced skills.\n  Fifty years ago, only one-third of mothers worked outside the home. \nToday, twice as many do, which means nearly 7 million children are left \nwithout adequate supervision after school.\n  High schools were designed in the last century with the goal of \ngraduating only 20 percent of students. A 16-year-old could drop out of \nschool, get a job, and support a family. Today, over 60 percent of jobs \nrequire not only a diploma, but postsecondary skills--either a college \neducation or advanced career and technical education. We need high \nschools graduating all students with college- and work-ready skills.\n  We wouldn't think of sending our astronauts to Mars in the same \nspaceship in which President Kennedy sent them to the Moon.\n  We wouldn't think of defending our troops with the armor they used in \nWorld War I.\n  Why do we teach our students using outdated schools?\n  This budget provides investments critical to ensuring that we have an \neducation system compatible with the 21st century knowledge economy.\n  The resolution increases funds for education programs by $6 billion.\n  It provides $3.5 billion for our public schools, the largest increase \nin funding for K-12 education since 2002.\n  This increase can put us on track to double title I funding in 5 \nyears.\n  With those funds, our schools can:\n  Hire 35,000 new teachers to reduce class sizes and provide students \nwith individualized attention; provide high quality professional \ndevelopment for 100,000 teachers to assist them in teaching 21st \ncentury skills; and enroll 1 million more children in high quality \nafterschool programs.\n  This is a real investment of new resources to help struggling \nschools. The funding for K-12 education will enable schools to \nimplement needed reforms to turn around. It will allow states, \ndistricts, and schools to improve middle and high schools, so that \nstudents will stay in school and graduate.\n  The budget resolution also provides $424 million for Head Start, \nwhich will provide more children with the services they need to ensure \nthey start school ready to learn.\n  It increases funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct by $340 million, so that students with disabilities have the \nsupport and opportunities they deserve.\n  It also provides needed increases in funds for higher education. Last \nyear, we passed a historic student aid bill and, with the Budget \nCommittee's efforts and leadership, we were able to chart a course to \nincrease the maximum Pell grant to $5,400 in 5 years. This budget \nresolution helps fulfill that promise by providing funds for a $4,800 \nmaximum Pell grant in fiscal year 2009.\n  This budget also includes $414 million more for job training \nprograms, which is greatly needed after years of cuts in job training \nprograms under this administration. This funding will allow 165,000 \nmore workers to retool their skills for 21st century jobs.\n  We know job training helps workers learn new skills, become better \nequipped for jobs in demand, and earn higher wages. As families across \nAmerica struggle to make ends meet, and watch as foreclosures increase, \njobs go oversees, and benefits vanish, job training can help provide \nreal security for workers.\n  The Senate budget resolution makes key investments in strengthening \nour economy and provides the building blocks for a prosperous future. \nIt supports good schools for our children, good jobs for workers, and a \nfair shot at the American dream. It puts the Nation on a path to \nreinventing our public schools and strengthening our education system \nso that we are competitive in today's knowledge economy.\n  Unlike the budget before us, the President's budget ignores the \ndemands of today's economy and the needs of our students, our teachers, \nand our schools.\n  In his message to Congress, the President said his budget was based \non ``clear priorities that will help us meet our Nation's most pressing \nneeds while addressing the long-term challenges ahead.''\n  But those priorities are not reflected in the numbers I see in the \nPresident's budget proposal for the Department of Education.\n  For too many years under a Republican Congress and administration, we \nhave seen a great contradiction between the administration's rhetoric \non education and their budgets.\n  They say that education is the cornerstone of our competitiveness in \nthe global economy, but then they underfund the No Child Left Behind \nAct by $14.7 billion this year alone--leaving 3 million children \nwithout needed services.\n  They say that education levels the playing field for disadvantaged \nstudents, but then they deny a million poor students the ability to \ncome to school ready to learn by flat funding Head Start.\n  They say that education is the key to America's future, but then they \nallow children to attend crumbling schools by blocking funding for \nschool construction.\n  They say that a good teacher can erase the harmful effects of \npoverty, but then they cut funding for teacher preparation and support.\n  They say that education is the gateway to the American dream, but \nthen, with 7,000 students dropping out of school each day, they cut a \n$1.3 billion program to provide career and technical education for at-\nrisk high school students.\n  They say that the good jobs of the future require a college \neducation, but then they cut campus-based grant and loan programs and \neliminate programs that ensure that low income, first generation \nstudents are prepared for and successful in college.\n  We must do better than this. The Nation, and the Nation's children, \ndeserve better than this.\n  It is time to stop making empty promises. It is time to act.\n  It is time for a new, bold commitment to investing in education, to \ngive teachers the support they need and the opportunity to go further \nin their careers, to support schools that need to turnaround, to help \nevery student reach graduation day, to open the gates to college for \nall students, regardless of family income.\n  When a student walks through the doors of a public school, they \nshould be opening the doors to opportunity, to\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\nhigher education, to a good job, to a better life.\n  The Senate budget resolution puts an end to the empty promises. By \nmaking education a priority, it takes bold action to address the \nmounting economic concerns and it is about time.\n  Likewise, this budget takes action to address the growing health \nconcerns that threaten the not only the health of our families, but \nalso our economic well-being. It rejects the irresponsible budget cuts \nfor NIH included within the administration's proposals, which would \nresult in NIH being funded at $1 billion less than is needed just to \nkeep pace with inflation. The budget resolution is a good basis for \nfurther strengthening of the NIH budget, and I look forward to working \nto see that NIH has the support it deserves.\n  Investment in NIH is essential not just for medical progress, but for \nour economic security too. The United States has a long tradition of \nbeing a global innovative leader but we can't take our leadership for \ngranted. Today, it's at risk. Thirty years ago, U.S. researchers \npublished 90 percent of all scientific literature on information \ntechnology. Today, it's less than half. Unless we invest in the life \nsciences, the story will soon be the same for biotechnology.\n  The budget also includes an important reserve fund for the millions \nof Americans suffering from mental illness whose insurance does not \ncover their treatment. Lack of equitable insurance coverage for mental \nillness is not only a civil rights issue, but it's also an economic \nissue with serious consequences. Recently, the National Institute of \nMental Health revealed that mental and addictive disorders cost our \ncountry more than $300 billion annually. This includes productivity \nlosses of $150 billion and $70 billion in healthcare costs. The reserve \nfund provided in this budget is a major step forward in end insurance \ndiscrimination and making our country more productive.\n  The budget before us today also makes a commitment to our elderly and \ndisabled citizens who are capable of living in their community, but are \ndenied the supports they need. With the proper support, these Americans \nare able to live and flourish in the community. But too often they have \nto give up the dignity of a job, a home, and a family so they can \nqualify for Medicaid, the only program that will support them. That is \nwhy we introduced the CLASS Act last summer, so citizens get the \nservices they need so they can remain in their community and lead a \nfull life. This budget includes a reserve fund to support the \ninfrastructure necessary to save Medicaid over the next decade and help \nall our citizens have a chance realize the American dream. It also will \nallow the parents and children of these citizens who have had to quit \ntheir jobs to care for a loved one to reenter the workforce.\n  I commend my colleagues on the Budget Committee, and all their staff, \nfor their hard work in recent months. The Senate budget resolution \nrepresents a strong commitment to American families across this country \nin this time of economic uncertainty, and I strongly urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am opposed to the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from South Carolina that would create a point of order \nagainst consideration of any legislation that contains an earmark.\n  Since the earliest days of our country's existence there has been \ntension between the executive and the legislative branches. Each has \nattempted continually to gain power at the expense of the other. The \nbalance of power has tended to ebb and flow over time. The instances \nwhere one branch gets absolute advantage over the other are rare. That \nis the fundamental genius of the system created by our Nation's \nFounding Fathers. It is a system that is unique because of the balance \nof power that exists between the Congress and the Chief Executive. We \nshould honor this unique relationship that has made our country the \nenvy of the world for stability, and fairness for our citizens.\n  The President has said that he believes earmarking has gotten out of \ncontrol, notwithstanding the many pieces of legislation containing \nearmarks that he has signed into law over the last 7 years. The \nPresident has further stated that he will now veto any fiscal year 2009 \nappropriations bill if the number and cost of earmarks isn't cut in \nhalf.\n  It is the President's right to veto bills. I don't deny that the \npractice of earmarking should be the subject of review and debate and I \ndon't deny the right of the President to express his views on the \nsubject and to use his veto pen if he feels that it is justified.\n  What I cannot understand is why the legislative branch would \nunilaterally relinquish a fundamental power granted to it in article I \nof the Constitution; the power of the purse.\n  This debate is not about the level of Federal spending, the size of \nthe deficit, or the national debt. Nothing in this amendment would \nchange the level of discretionary spending called for in the budget \nresolution. Nothing in this amendment issues reconciliation \ninstructions to committees that might begin to address the entitlement \ncrisis that faces our Nation. This debate instead is about who decides \nhow Federal dollars are spent, and where?\n  Proponents of this amendment apparently are content for Congress to \nprovide large sums of money to Federal agencies for general purposes, \neither to be distributed by a formula or by some sort of executive \nbranch allocation process. Congress's only input would be after the \nfact. I fundamentally disagree. Congress is well within its rights to \ntarget spending for purposes that the legislative branch concludes are \nin the public interest.\n  Senators and Members of Congress represent the several States and the \nAmerican people. While some funding formulas or agency-run processes \nmay have their rightful place in the allocation of Federal dollars, \nthere should be an opportunity for Congress to identify its own \npriorities, as the Constitution contemplates.\n  There have been cases where the power of the purse has been abused \nfor personal or political gain, just as other aspects of the \nlegislative process have been abused. That is an unfortunate truth. But \nit is also true that nearly all earmarked projects are put forth by \nMembers with honorable intentions. Nearly all earmarked projects match \nthe general purposes of the programs within which they are funded. The \nquestion is, who decides how the people's money is spent. I think it is \nthe people's representation in Congress.\n  I am aware that my own party's nominee for President, the Senator \nfrom Arizona, supports this amendment. I am also aware that Senator \nMcCain has stated that, if elected President, he would veto any bill \nthat includes an earmark. Even though I disagree with him on this \nissue, I understand he thinks the executive branch of government should \ndecide how taxpayers' money is spent.\n  It doesn't surprise me that the other Presidential candidates in this \nbody support this amendment. Any President would want the ability to \nallocate Federal funding as he or she sees fit.\n  Why would the Senate assume it would be preferable for the executive \nbranch to allocate funds based on the whims of an assistant secretary, \nor on the political pressures that can influence the White House or the \nOffice of Management and Budget? Do we have faith that executive branch \nagencies will not embarrass themselves with inappropriate grants for \nart exhibits, overpriced hammers for the Pentagon, or million dollar \nouthouses in our national parks? History tells us otherwise.\n  I think Congress should continue to hold the purse strings as the \nFounders of our great country contemplated. We should not shirk our \nduty to make spending decisions. If the President disapproves, he can \nveto the bill.\n  This amendment doesn't fix anything. It doesn't save any money. It \ndoesn't propose any reforms. And in spite of its supposed 1-year \nduration, the amendment will do nothing to mollify those who wish to \nput Congress permanently on the sidelines of the process of allocating \nFederal dollars.\n  This amendment will most assuredly do nothing to help Congress and \nthe next President of the United States address the budgetary \nchallenges facing our country in Medicare, Social Security, and tax \npolicy. We shouldn't be seduced into thinking that a `timeout' on \nCongressionally directed spending will somehow help us deal with those \nissues. What we should do instead is stay in the game, consider \nspending\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\nbills on a timely basis, and carefully scrutinize the spending in those \nbills. Then we need to engage the President on those proposals through \nestablished, constitutional processes and determine the collective will \nof the people as determined by all of their elected officials.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4233\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss my \namendment to codify the unborn child rule in the pending budget \nresolution, by modifying the SCHIP reserve fund.\n  This needs to be done, and it needs to be done during this budget \nyear.\n  I am not here to argue SCHIP. There is a SCHIP reserve fund already \nin the budget. I am merely seeking to ensure that since it looks like \nwe are going to pass this reserve fund, we make sure to address the \nunborn child as a patient.\n  We attempted to codify the unborn child rule during the SCHIP debate, \nbut unfortunately we were not successful. I am hopeful that we will be \nsuccessful on this attempt.\n  The unborn child rule is a regulation that, since 2002, has allowed \nStates to provide prenatal care to unborn children and their mothers. \nIt recognizes the basic fact that the child in the womb is a child.\n  When a pregnancy is involved there are at least two patients--mother \nand baby.\n  It only makes sense to cover the unborn child under a children's \nhealth program.\n  We have previously modified the SCHIP statute to allow States to \ncover ``pregnant women'' of any age.\n  My amendment would codify the principle of the rule, by amending the \nSCHIP reserve fund to codify the current unborn child rule to clarify \nthat a covered child includes ``the period from conception to birth.''\n  Many States' definition of coverage for a pregnant woman leads to the \nstrange legal fiction that the adult pregnant woman is a ``child.''\n  Surely it was not the intent of anyone who developed the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program to allow a loophole for States to \ndefine a woman as a child.\n  Surely we can agree that the child who receives health care in the \nwomb is a child receiving care along with his or her mother.\n  There are many conditions that can affect a mother's health during \npregnancy that are not related to her pregnancy.\n  Under current statute pregnant mother could not get coverage for any \ncondition that isn't related to her pregnancy. Without a codification \nof the unborn child rule, we cannot guarantee that these services \ncontinue.\n  Many medical advances, such as surgeries, have allowed for the unborn \nchild to be treated as a patient separate from the pregnant mother. \nThey should therefore be able receive coverage as a patient.\n  We should be allowing mothers to stay healthy, so that they will have \nhealthy babies.\n  This also leads to reduced costs associated with premature or low-\nbirth weight babies.\n  Eleven states are already using this option to provide such care \nthrough the State Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  If the intent of the Senate is to provide coverage for the pregnant \nwoman and her unborn child, then there should be no problem in \nsupporting my amendment.\n  We should ensure that pregnant women and their unborn child are both \ntreated as patients.\n  This is a matter of common sense.\n  Every obstetrician knows that in treating a pregnant woman he is \ntreating two patients, the mother and her unborn child.\n  Keeping this coverage in the name of the adult pregnant woman alone \nis bad for the integrity of a children's health program, bad for the \nchild, and even bad for some of the neediest of pregnant women.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 4234 and 4235\n\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, the resolution before us continues the \nerosion of fiscally responsible budget processes. I have offered four \namendments to this budget that will, I believe, increase economic \ndiscipline.\n  I joined the Budget Committee because I believed the best way to \nenforce fiscal responsibility and guarantee appropriate Federal \nspending was to have a rigid and meaningful budget. Fiscal discipline \nbegins in the planning--the budgeting--stage. This is where the choices \nare made, and the decisions are reached, that will ensure that the \nincome matches the spending and that taxpayers dollars are used wisely. \nBut the budget has been moving away from this. Our discipline has been \neroding.\n  We have seen increases in ``reserve fund'' shenanigans, we have seen \nthe use of reconciliation--a process originated to cut government \nspending for spending increases, and we have seen a mockery of the pay \ngo rules; there was $143 billion in pay-go violations last year.\n  I believe this Budget Committee should be committed to rigid budget \ndiscipline, not politically expedient gamesmanship.\n  One of my amendments is to fully budget for the expected costs of the \nwar. I know there will be those who say that they are just following \nthe President in allocating $70 billion in fiscal year 2009. But the \nbudget is a congressional document. Say what you want about the genesis \nof the ideas in this document, but let me repeat--it was written and \nprepared on the sixth floor of Dirksen, not in the White House.\n  We know the war is expected to cost $170 billion this year. Everyone \nknows this. We had testimony in committee supporting this number. And \nso we have an obligation to budget for that amount.\n  If we are going to pay for this war, fiscal discipline and legitimate \nbudgeting requirements demand that we include those costs. There is no \nlegitimate reason to fail to include the known estimates of the war \ninto our budget. Failure to do so is gimmickry, and devalues the budget \nexercise we are engaged in. Hiding the war costs from view, when every \nMember knows we will be spending, is ridiculous.\n  On another matter, this budget resolution has an increase in \n``reserve funds.'' There are 37 this year, up from 24 last year. They \ncontain up to $300 billion in spending that hangs over our treasury and \ntaxpayers as a threat. I have heard them referred to as harmless, but \nany device that serves to weaken the authority and legitimateness of \nour budget is not harmless.\n  Many feel that these reserve funds have become an over complicated \ntype of sense of the Senate, but I feel they weave weakness into what \nshould be a rigid and honest document. I have offered an amendment that \nwill prohibit time shifting tax receipts or spending levels to exploit \nthe reserve fund language. If these reserve funds and their spending \nassumptions are going to be included, we need to see that they are \nfully walled off and under strong restrictions that will prohibit them \nfrom being realized without proper spending reductions.\n  I have also offered an amendment to prohibit time shifts on a larger \nscale, not just in reserve funds but in the budget itself. Time-\nshifting incomes and spending to change where they impact the budget \ncycle produces no real economic effect, except allowing more spending \nby evading limits. This practice needs to end.\n  The last amendment I have offered will ensure the ability of the \nSecretary of HHS to combat waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid and \nSCHIP.\n  My amendment is very simple. It will make sure that the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services has continued authority to prevent fraud and \nprotect the integrity of the Medicaid Program and SCHIP and to reduce \ninappropriate spending under these programs.\n  This should be a very bipartisan amendment. Waste, fraud and abuse \nshould not consume even $1 of taxpayer's money.\n  The Secretary should have the ability to see that tax dollars are \nbeing spent appropriately.\n  As long as providers are acting appropriately my amendment would have \nno affect on them. Good actors in the Medicaid Program and SCHIP will \nfeel no impact by my amendment.\n  My amendment would guarantee the Secretary's ability to enforce any \nantifraud provisions of law in effect as of the date of enactment of \nthe budget with respect to the Medicaid Program or the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, and would allow the\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\nSecretary to develop new proposals during such period to eliminate \nfraud in such programs.\n  My amendment would not harm beneficiaries' access to health care \nunder such programs, and only states that the Secretary has the ability \nto seek out bad actors.\n  Combating waste, fraud, and abuse in any program should be a \nbipartisan issue. Combating waste, fraud, and abuse to ensure the \nintegrity of the Medicaid Program and SCHIP is a necessary objective to \nso that taxpayer dollars are being spent appropriately to provide \npatients with access to care.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendments, and help move the \nbudget back towards fiscal discipline, improving our financial \nstandards and accountability for taxpayer's dollars.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4232\n\n  Mr. President, my amendment will pay down the Federal debt and \neliminate government waste by reducing spending 5 percent on programs \nrated ineffective by the OMB Program Assessment Rating Tool.\n  Some of my colleagues may be unaware that the PART reviews were \nmandated under the Government Performance and Results Act, Public Law \nNo: 103-62. This law was written by Senator Roth of Delaware and \nsponsored by 20 of his then-colleagues, 10 of whom are still here.\n  I mention this only to make sure that my colleagues are aware of the \nfact that the PART Program was not invented whole cloth by the current \nadministration. OMB is under mandate from Congress to review and make \nbudget recommendations on all Federal programs. Let me read from the \npurposes of that act:\n  (1) improve the confidence of the American people in the capability \nof the Federal Government, by systematically holding Federal agencies \naccountable for achieving program results;\n  (2) initiate program performance reform with a series of pilot \nprojects in setting program goals, measuring program performance \nagainst those goals, and reporting publicly on their progress;\n  (3) improve Federal program effectiveness and public accountability \nby promoting a new focus on results, service quality, and customer \nsatisfaction;\n  (4) help Federal managers improve service delivery, by requiring that \nthey plan for meeting program objectives and by providing them with \ninformation about program results and service quality;\n  (5) improve congressional decisionmaking by providing more objective \ninformation on achieving statutory objectives, and on the relative \neffectiveness and efficiency of Federal programs and spending; and\n  (6) improve internal management of the Federal Government.\n  So, again, 15 years ago Congress demanded that the Office of \nManagement and Budget review Federal spending programs with a \nnonpartisan analysis to determine if taxpayers are receiving value for \ntheir tax dollars. The Clinton administration worked on this, and the \ncurrent administration developed their plan as well.\n  The current implementation of this is the Program Assessment Rating \nTool, or PART. You can go on line and see these reviews at \nwww.expectmore.gov.\n  I use this Web site with every meeting I have with Federal agencies, \nwith every appropriations hearing, every Federal appointee. I ask \nconstituents, when they come in to share their support for a certain \nprogram, to look at that program's PART review and hold the programs \naccountable for it.\n  A small percentage of programs receive an ``ineffective'' rating. \nPrograms receiving this rating are not using your tax dollars \neffectively. As they elaborate on the Web site, ``ineffective programs \nhave been unable to achieve results due to a lack of clarity regarding \nthe program's purpose or goals, poor management, or some other \nsignificant weakness.''\n  I hold no ill will towards any specific program, I just believe in \naccountability for Federal spending. Everyone agrees we have to start \nsomewhere, and the nonpartisan, agenda-free and mutually-conducted PART \nProgram seems to me to be the best place.\n  My amendment cuts 5 percent of the funding under this bill for \nprograms labeled ``ineffective'' under the OMB PART Program and uses \nthat funding to cut the deficit. This is about the amount that these \nprograms will see in increases under this budget. They won't face cuts, \nbut given the failure to pass a mutually conducted performance review \nwith OMB I don't think they should see an increase.\n  We are not ending any programs or zeroing out any agencies. All we \nare doing is taking 1 dollar in 20 under this budget from programs that \ncannot justify their effectiveness and using it to begin to address our \nover $9 trillion national debt.\n  I understand many people have fond thoughts for some of these \nprograms, but fond thoughts and good intentions do not equal good \ngovernment. This is the barest babystep forward for good government and \nfiscal responsibility.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment. I \nbelieve it is a commonsense amendment to a problem we need to address. \nWe wish to make sure our taxpayer dollars are being used in a way that \ncan be described as effective. That is the ideal situation.\n  Certainly for those programs that are classified as ``ineffective'' \nwe can at least question their budget. Even though they may have a \nmission statement drawn up that may be somewhat appealing, when OMB \ngets right down into the workings of the agency and finds nothing much \nis happening to accomplish the goals and objectives the Congress had in \nmind at the time it passed the legislation, how can we consider \nincreasing their budget?\n  I think this is a commonsense amendment that brings some fiscal \nsanity to the process. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for \nthe amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4247\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the importance of making \npermanent a progrowth tax cut passed and signed into law earlier this \ndecade.\n  I was proud to join my colleagues in passing and implementing \nlandmark tax legislation. Unfortunately, if Congress does not act soon \nto make this critical tax cut permanent, I believe that we will see the \nupcoming economic downtime be worse than it should be.\n  Small business expensing is a key component of the progrowth tax \nlegislation. It played a vital role in promoting economic growth and \nraising revenues.\n  As a former small business owner, I know and understand the hardships \nof running a small business. That is why I strongly supported and \ncontinue to support the small business expensing provisions of the Jobs \nand Growth Act of 2003. The small business expensing provisions in this \nbill increased the amount small businesses can expense from $25,000 to \n$100,000.\n  I have had occasion to discuss this small business expensing with \nformer Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan.\n  Small business expensing lowers the cost of capital for small \nbusinesses and helps them expand, which in turn helps the Nation's \neconomic growth. Encouraging new business purchasing has helped kick-\nstart certain sectors of the economy, created new jobs, and helped to \nincrease productivity.\n  Congress has increased the amount a small business can expense in the \nJobs and Growth Act of 2003, and just recently in the economic stimulus \npackage last month, but these increased expensing levels are set to \nexpire. Unless Congress acts to make these provisions permanent, \nexpensing levels will revert back to $25,000, with a phase-out cap of \n$200,000, in 2011.\n  Allowing small business owners to keep more of their hard-earned \nprofits will enable them to hire new employees and buy the technology \nand equipment needed to expand their business. By relieving the tax \nburden placed on small business owners, all Americans will benefit.\n  I call on my colleagues today to work together on implementing \nlegislation that would make permanent this pro-growth tax cut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4194\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of an \namendment that my friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln, \nand I have offered to the budget resolution, which would provide an \nadditional $50 million to the Veterans Benefits Administration, VBA, \nallowing our Nation to continue investing in the programs and resources \nnecessary so that\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\nour courageous veterans may receive the benefits that they have earned \nin a timely and efficient manner.\n  Every year, hundreds of thousands of America's finest look to the VBA \nto process their claims for disability compensation, pensions, and \nother entitlements due them as a result of their unselfish and \nsteadfast service to our Nation. However, according to a VBA Workload \nReport from February 16, 2008, the total number of pending compensation \nand pension claims once again increased to 663,319, up from 626,429 \nthis time last year and 517,574 from 2006.Additionally, the VA is \ncurrently projecting claims receipts to increase to approximately \n872,000 in fiscal year 2009 and cautions that ongoing hostilities in \nboth Iraq and Afghanistan may further burden the workload.\n  Furthermore, although the VA attempted to reduce the average number \nof days that claims were pending from a high of 182 days at the end of \nfiscal year 2001 to 111 days at the end of fiscal year 2003, the \naverage age of pending claims has crept back up to 132 days by the end \nof fiscal year 2007.\n  Despite this unfortunate trend, we must not discount the initial \nsteps that Congress has taken in order to alleviate many of the \nchallenges facing our Nation's veterans within the VBA system. The \nfirst crucial step over the past year was to improve the management of \nthe VBA, by providing welcome resources to boost the number of claims-\nprocessing staff, essential to curbing the backlog and improving the \ntimeliness of the claims process. In fact, at this time last year, \nSenator Lincoln and I introduced an amendment to the fiscal year 2008 \nBudget resolution to address staff and resource shortages at the VBA by \nproviding $64.5 million in order to hire an additional 600 disability \nclaims processors and $4.1 million to hire an additional 32 processors \nat the Board of Veterans Appeals, BVA, to expedite the adjudication \nprocess to acceptable levels.\n  Overall, the President's fiscal year 2009 budget request funds nearly \n11,000 full-time equivalent employees working on compensation and \npension claims, and represents an additional 2,600 positions, or 32 \npercent above fiscal year 2007.\n  Notwithstanding the recent actions that I have outlined and the VA's \nexpectation that productivity will expand in the long term, veterans \ncontinue to endure lengthy delays in order to receive their benefits \nfrom the VA--and this is simply unacceptable. Therefore, I believe it \nis vital for the VBA to maintain the resources necessary to seek and \nimplement fundamental reforms that will help bolster recent gains in \nmanpower in order to enhance both productivity and efficiency \nthroughout the disability claims process. That is why Senator Lincoln \nand I have introduced an amendment that will provide the VBA with an \nadditional $50 million in funding to initiate innovative pilot programs \nthat will decrease this unprecedented backlog of disability claims.\n  Given how integral disability payments are for veterans and their \nfamilies, especially in a lagging economy, the VA has an undeniable \nresponsibility to sustain an effective delivery system and look for \nsolutions that honor our veterans' service. The funding provided within \nthe Snowe-Lincoln amendment would allow the VBA to build upon recent \nefforts to streamline the claims process through such initiatives as \namplifying staff training, improving data collection, or streamlining \ndata transmission.\n  As we continue to debate this year's budget resolution, I applaud the \nSenate Committee on the Budget and its strong commitment to veterans, \nby providing $48.2 billion in discretionary funding within the budget \nresolution for fiscal year 2009, which is equal to $3.2 billion above \nthe President's request and $5.2 billion more from fiscal year 2008 \nbudget levels. Certainly, this increase in veterans' health care \nfunding is timely as Congress strives to address an ever-growing \ncontingency of new veterans, who will transition from active duty into \nthe VA system during the upcoming year, while an aging general veteran \npopulation continues its increased demand for acute medical and long-\nterm-care services.\n  It is profoundly imperative that we in Congress fulfill our \nobligation to America's best and bravest, whose selfless sacrifices on \nbehalf of us and the freedoms we cherish are immeasurable. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Snowe-Lincoln amendment, which will help the \nVBA take the additional steps towards realizing our nation's pledge to \ngive our veterans the compensation and benefits they have rightfully \nearned.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this amendment to S. Con. Res. 70 requests \nthe Senate to take action to stop the abuse, neglect, and exploitation \nof vulnerable individuals who reside in the Nation's 17,000 nursing \nhomes and receive services in thousands of other long-term care \nfacilities.\n  It proposes that the Senate reserve $160 million over 3 years in a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to pay for a nationwide expansion of a \nsuccessful background check pilot program enacted as part of the \nMedicare Modernization Act, MMA, of 2003. This seven-State pilot \nprogram has already prevented more than 7,200 people with records of \nsubstantiated abuse or a violent criminal record from working with and \npreying upon frail elders and individuals with disabilities.\n  The amendment's reserve fund would be triggered only if the Finance \nCommittee reported out legislation or submitted a conference report \nproviding for a nationwide expansion of the MMA pilot program. If this \noccurred, the reserve fund amount would be offset by the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Today, abuse, neglect, and exploitation of vulnerable individuals \nwithin long-term care facilities result in costly consequences or \nelderly or disabled victims, their families, and society as a whole. \nNumerous reports issued by GAO, the HHS Office of Inspector General, \nand State governments have recommended that comprehensive background \nchecks should be a routine part of preemployment screening for all \nworkers serving vulnerable populations, including frail elders and \nindividuals with disabilities.\n  A nationwide system of background checks for long-term care workers \nwould offer greater protection to seniors across the country in a wide \nvariety of settings s--including the home. The policy would decrease \nnot only physical abuse but also financial exploitation of vulnerable \nhome-dwelling seniors, and would produce significant crime prevention \nsavings.\n  The policy has broad-based support from outside groups, including the \nNational Association of State Attorneys General, the National \nAssociation of Medicaid Fraud Control Units, the Elder Justice \nCoalition, the nursing home industry, and eldercare advocates in States \nand communities across the country.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Budget Committee \nfor its efforts to fund a strong homeland defense, and to introduce an \namendment with my friend Senator Collins on one issue where we think \nadditional work is needed--funding to continue building the new Federal \nEmergency Management Agency.\n  First, I want to praise the Budget Committee for working within our \ndifficult budget environment to find adequate funding for critical \nhomeland security needs, especially support to our State and local \npartners in homeland security.\n  The President's fiscal year 2009 budget request for the Department of \nHomeland Security, DHS, includes some useful increases for targeted \nprograms, but comes up short overall. It is basically a steady State \nbudget with the glaring exception of homeland security grants, where \nthe administration has once again proposed aggressive and unwise cuts \nto core Federal grant programs that States, tribes, cities, and towns \nrely on to keep their citizens safe.\n  If the President's budget were enacted, it would mean a 48-percent \ndrop in overall grant funding--seriously limiting the ability of State \nand local officials to prevent, prepare for, and respond to acts of \nterrorism and natural disasters and to protect their communities the \nway they should be protected. The threats we face have not diminished \nover the years and neither should the funding to combat those threats.\n  Most dramatically, the fiscal year 2009 budget request cuts the State \nhomeland security grant program, SHSGP, from $950 million to $200 \nmillion--a whopping 79-percent reduction from fiscal year 2008. SHSGP \ngrants\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\nare basic preparedness grants to States, and the failure to fund them \nwould significantly undermine national preparedness efforts.\n  I am pleased that the budget resolution before us rejects those \nproposed cuts and funds SHSGP at its current level of $950 million, \nwhich also happens to be the level we authorized in the Implementing \nthe 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act of 2007, which for the first \ntime set forth statutory requirements for the grants' allocation and \nuse.\n  The budget resolution also rejects proposed cuts to other vital grant \nprograms including grants to firefighters, for emergency management, \nand for port and transit security. All of these important programs are \nrestored to fiscal year 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation, in the \npending budget resolution, and I thank the Budget Committee for that.\n  On the critical matter of interoperable communications, the Budget \nCommittee has done better still--increasing funding for the \ninteroperable emergency communications grant program, IECGP, from $50 \nmillion this year to $200 million in fiscal year 2009. State homeland \nsecurity directors recently identified the development of interoperable \ncommunications as their top priority, and it is a complex problem that \nwill be resolved only through strong--Federal leadership, coordination \nat all levels of government, and a substantial commitment of dedicated \nfunding. This grant program, which was authorized in the recent 9/11 \nAct, will help achieve this critical goal.\n  I also want to thank the Budget Committee for providing funds to \nbegin building a new DHS headquarters at the St. Elizabeths West \nCampus. We cannot expect DHS to succeed at its many challenging \nmissions without the fundamental management tools that are taken for \ngranted by much smaller organizations. Today, DHS is spread throughout \n70 buildings across the national capital region making communication, \ncoordination, and cooperation between DHS components a significant \nchallenge. A unified headquarters, which would bring together many of \nthe Department's components into a single facility and allow employees \nto work more efficiently and interactively. I believe it is a critical \ncornerstone of the efforts to improve management at the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n\n  I am concerned, however, that the budget resolution does not provide \nenough to continue reforms underway to strengthen and rebuild FEMA, \nwhich is why Senator Collins and I are offering this amendment today, \nto increase FEMA's operations, management and administration account by \n$141 million.\n  Following Hurricane Katrina, the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee conducted an extensive bipartisan investigation into \nthe failed response at all levels of government, especially and \nincluding FEMA's response. We found that FEMA was woefully unprepared--\nand in fact had never been prepared--to deal with a catastrophe on the \nmagnitude of Hurricane Katrina, lacking essential capabilities and \nresources. Our committee subsequently made significant recommendations \nto strengthen FEMA's capabilities and resources. Congress implemented \nmany of those recommendations in the Post-Katrina Emergency Management \nReform Act, which was intended to recreate FEMA into a stronger, more \nrobust agency that would, for the first time, be equipped to prepare \nfor and respond to a true catastrophe. The legislation also reunited \nthe agency's preparedness and response functions; strengthened FEMA's \nregional offices and emergency response teams; and fortified its \nemergency planning and preparedness responsibilities.\n  Last year, FEMA received a much needed funding increase, enabling it \nto take the essential first step in the long process of rebuilding. \nWhile the budget resolution would sustain FEMA operations at current \nlevels, it does not include the increases needed for it to continue \nstrengthening its core capabilities. Our amendment proposes an \nadditional $141 million to fully fund the Administration's requested \nincrease to pay for modernizing the agency's IT systems; strengthening \nand expanding key teams and other personnel that handle disaster \noperations, logistics and other vital capabilities; and converting \ncertain temporary disaster support employees to permanent staff, which \nshould help provide a more stable and professional workforce for this \nprogram. The cost of the amendment would be offset by reductions in a \ngovernment-wide, general account.\n  The President's request does not provide enough to strengthen these \ncore FEMA capabilities, and I would readily support a larger increase. \nBut at a minimum, we should all be able to agree on the \nadministration's proposed figure to correct the significant \ndeficiencies we witnessed during the response to Hurricane Katrina. \nTherefore, Senator Collins and I are offering this amendment to ensure \nthat FEMA continues its transformation into the agency envisioned by \nthe Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, which is an agency \nprepared to respond to the many potential catastrophes--from natural \ndisasters to manmade terrorists acts--that we face today. Without \nadditional funds, significant deficiencies exposed by Hurricane Katrina \nwill persist and FEMA simply will not be able to protect the American \npeople the way we want it to.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to \nimprove our homeland security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1992-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   BIRTHDAY TRIBUTE TO GENE SEGERBLOM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to extend the best \nwishes of the United States Senate to Genevieve ``Gene'' Segerblom on \nthe occasion of her 90th birthday.\n  Born, raised and educated in Nevada, Gene is one of our State's most \ntreasured citizens. She served the public as a nurturing teacher, a \nBoulder City councilwoman, and a State assemblywoman. Throughout her \ncareer, she has been a tireless leader in the fields of historic \npreservation, sustainable development, cultural affairs, and ethical \ngovernment practices.\n  Those familiar only with Gene's family tree might assume that a \npolitical career was her destiny. After all, she followed in the \nfootsteps of her mother, Hazel Bell Wines, and her grandfather, William \nJ. Bell, both of whom served in the State legislature. But anyone who \nknows Gene sees her not as a politician, but as a mother, wife and \nteacher who took her passion and wisdom into the realm of public \nservice.\n  A few of the things I treasure are paintings I own, painted by Gene's \nhusband Cliff. He was one of Nevada's all-time great painters. Cliff \nwas also a judge of quality, serving the people of Boulder City and \nother places where he was called upon to render justice.\n  Gene's son Tick Segerblom is now serving with distinction as a Nevada \nState assemblyman.\n  Gene Segerblom has enriched countless lives, including mine. Landra \nand I are proud to call her a friend, and I wish her health, happiness, \nand joy as she celebrates this milestone birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1992-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1992-S1993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would strengthen and add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the \nfloor to highlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our \ncountry.\n  On the morning of February 23, 2008, Melbourne Brunner and his \npartner were eating at the Floridian restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, FL, \nwhen they were verbally and physically assaulted. According to Brunner, \na man at the restaurant began calling the couple antigay slurs, \nthreatening to break their necks and kill them. After a few moments of \nsuffering the man's insults, Brunner and his partner decided to leave. \nWhen Brunner attempted to enter his car, the man came from behind him, \nblocked his path, and struck Brunner in the face, causing him to hit \nhis head on the pavement. The assailant then reportedly walked back to \nhis\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\ncar, covered up the license plate with his shirt so that his tags would \nnot be identified, and sped away. The owner of the Floridian restaurant \nis offering a $5,000 reward for any information leading to the capture \nof this suspect. Brunner was treated at a local hospital for severe \nbruising around his eyes.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal laws \nintended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. This legislation would \nbetter equip the Government to fulfill its most important obligation by \nprotecting new groups of people as well as better protecting citizens \nalready covered under deficient laws. I believe that by passing this \nlegislation and changing current law, we can change hearts and minds as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1993-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECIDIVISM REDUCTION AND SECOND CHANCE ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \npassing yesterday by unanimous consent the Recidivism Reduction and \nSecond Chance Act of 2007, which I introduced in March of last year. I \nam delighted that my colleagues, Senators Specter, Brownback, and \nLeahy, and I were able to bring Democrats and Republicans together to \nsupport this very important piece of legislation.\n  The bill aims to reduce the rate of recidivism by improving the \ntransition of offenders from prison back into the community. Preventing \nrecidivism is not only the right thing to do, it makes our communities \nsafer and it saves us money.\n  Today, we have over 2 million individuals in our Federal and State \nprisons and millions more in local jails. Our Federal and State prisons \nwill release nearly 650,000 of these offenders back into our \ncommunities this year. A staggering two-thirds of released State \nprisoners will be rearrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor within \n3 years of release.\n  It is not difficult to see why. These ex-offenders face a number of \ndifficult challenges upon release. The unemployment rate among former \ninmates is as high as 60 percent; 15 to 27 percent of prisoners expect \nto go to homeless shelters upon release; and 57 percent of Federal and \n70 percent of State inmates used drugs regularly before prison. This \naddiction and dependency often continues during incarceration.\n  Unless we address these problems, these individuals will commit \nhundreds of thousands of serious crimes after their release, and our \ncommunities will bear the human and economic cost. If we are going to \nreduce recidivism and crime, we simply have to make concerted, common-\nsense efforts now to help ex-offenders successfully reenter and \nreintegrate into their communities.\n  The Recidivism Reduction and Second Chance Act of 2007 confronts \nhead-on the dire situation of prisoners reentering our communities with \ninsufficient monitoring, little or no job skills, inadequate drug \ntreatment, insufficient housing, lack of basic physical and mental \nhealth services, and deficient basic life skills. Through commonsense \nand cost-effective measures, the bill offers a second chance for ex-\noffenders, and the children and families that depend on them, and it \nstrengthens our communities and ensures safe neighborhoods.\n  The Second Chance Act provides grants for the development and \nimplementation of comprehensive substance abuse treatment programs, \nacademic and vocational education programs, housing and job counseling \nprograms, and mentoring for offenders who are approaching release and \nwho have been released. To ensure accountability, the bill requires \ngrantees to establish performance goals and benchmarks and report the \nresults to Congress.\n  The bill authorizes $324 million over 2 years in competitive grant \nfunding. These funds represent an investment in our future and an \nacknowledgement of the problem we face. We must remember that the \naverage cost of incarcerating each prisoner exceeds $20,000 per year, \nwith expenditures on corrections alone having increased from $9 billion \nin 1982 to $60 billion in 2002. That is more than a 6-fold increase, \nand the costs keep going up.\n  A relatively modest investment in offender reentry efforts today is \nfar more cost-effective than the alternative--building more prisons for \nthese ex-offenders to return to if they can't reenter their communities \nand are convicted of further crimes. An ounce of prevention, as the \nsaying goes, is worth a pound of cure.\n  I am proud today to witness the passage of the Recidivism Reduction \nand Second Chance Act, a bill that will transform offender reentry \npolicy in this country. The safety of our neighbors, our children, and \nour communities depends on it. I urge the President to quickly sign \nthis bill into law.\n  I would particularly like to thank Nancy Libin on my staff, Lisa \nOwings on Senator Specter's staff, LaRochelle Young on Senator \nBrownback's staff, and Noah Bookbinder on Senator Leahy's staff, all of \nwhom worked tirelessly to get this bill passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1993-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1993-S1994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PASSAGE OF THE SECOND CHANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to comment on the \npassage of the Second Chance Act. I thank my colleagues Senators \nBrownback, Biden, and Leahy, who are original cosponsors of this bill, \nfor their tireless advocacy for this long-needed legislation and my \nother colleagues for their support of the bill, which passed the Senate \nby unanimous consent.\n  Each year, as many as 700,000 offenders will be released from prison \nor jail. Unfortunately, approximately two-thirds of those individuals \nwill be rearrested within 3 years of their release. The consequences of \nsuch high recidivism rates are disastrous for our Nation. Each year, \napproximately 1.5 million Americans become victims of violent crime. \nThe total pecuniary and non-pecuniary cost of crime has been estimated \nto be as much as $2 trillion annually--or 17 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. Much of this cost comes directly out of taxpayers' \npockets--the cost of keeping a prisoner in jail is as high as $30,000 \nper year. The cumulative cost to the Federal Government is \napproximately $60 billion annually. High crime and recidivism rates \nhave also proven cyclical in nature: with 2.3 million of offenders in \nprison and jail, nearly 2 million American children spend part of the \nyear without their parent--a factor known to put those children at risk \nof later committing crimes themselves.\n  The likelihood that a prisoner will leave prison or jail, return to \ntheir family and community, obtain a job, and lead a productive and \nlaw-abiding life increases dramatically with increasing levels of \neducation, job training, and substance abuse treatment. Yet, a few \nbasic statistics demonstrate just how ill-equipped the 650,000 \nprisoners who will return to our neighborhoods and communities are to \naccomplish these basic objectives. Seventy percent of ex-offenders \noperate at the lowest levels of literacy. The majority struggle with \ndrug and alcohol addiction--as many as 70 percent of prisoners were \nregular drug users prior to being convicted. Nearly 60 percent of ex-\noffenders will be unemployed a year after they are released from \nprison.\n  The Second Chance Act will help break this dangerous cycle of \nrecidivism. The bill will encourage realistic rehabilitation by \nproviding prisoners who seek to turn their lives around with the \neducation, literacy training, job training, employment assistance and \nsubstance abuse treatment they need to do so. The Second Chance Act \nwill also enhance the proven-effective prison mentoring programs \nthrough which church members and community members provide \nindividualized mentoring to prisoners who want to turn their lives \naround. The Second Chance Act draws on the experiences of many \ngovernmental, community, and non-profit organizations that are \noperating successful reentry programs around the country. For example, \nPennsylvania's Community Orientation and Reintegration project, the \nBoston Reentry Initiative, and the Kansas Reentry Program have \nshepherded the way toward achieving lasting reductions in recidivism \nrates through innovative approaches to job training and education, \nfamily reunification, and public safety.\n  The Second Chance Act that will be signed by the President represents \nthe tireless efforts of a tremendous bipartisan coalition from both \nhouses of Congress. I am particularly thankful for the leadership of \nSenator\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\nBrownback, Senator Biden, and Senator Leahy who have worked with me for \nyears to negotiate the bill's final language. As a result of these \nnegotiations, the grant programs in the bill are focused and \nstreamlined, and provide for the kind of accountability we need to \nensure that the programs operated under the bill meet their goal of \nachieving real reductions in recidivism rates. I am pleased that the \nbill has the support of over 200 organizations from both ends of the \nideological spectrum and is supported by the Department of Justice and \nthe Department of Labor.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of this important \nlegislation. The Second Chance Act takes an important step toward \nclosing the revolving doors of our prisons and keeping our \nneighborhoods and communities safe.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1994-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO POPE AIR FORCE BASE\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise before you today to express my \nsincere appreciation for the men and women of a C-130 Hercules crew out \nof Pope Air Force Base, NC.\n  MAJ Paul Pepe, 1LT Robert Davidson, 1LT Robert Gillis, Staff Sergeant \nAdam Monroy, Captain Kaly Godfrey, SSgt Kyle Anderson, SSgt Charles \nJones, and CPT Jessica Kehren were responsible for transporting me and \nthree of my congressional colleagues from Baghdad, Iraq, to Amman, \nJordan, the night of August 30, 2007.\n  Approximately 5 minutes into the flight, I looked out of my window \nand noticed flashes of light coming from the ground--our aircraft was \ntaking on surface-to-air rocket fire. The C-130 Hercules crew \nimmediately began taking evasive maneuvers to successfully defeat the \nthree rockets fired at the aircraft.\n  Throughout the incident, our crew remained calm and professional. I \ncould not have been prouder of the way they worked together to safely \navoid a very dangerous situation. Our warfighters face threats in Iraq \nand Afghanistan every day. While I know this type of danger was not new \nto them, the incident enhanced my already deep appreciation for the \ndanger they face on a daily basis.\n  For their actions, the crew was recently awarded the Air Mobility \nCommand's 2007 Field of Aeronautics and Astronautics Aviator Valor \nAward. The award is given for a conspicuous act of courage or valor \nperformed during aerial flight during either combat or noncombat. \nWithout question, the C-130 Hercules crew is most deserving of this \nhigh honor.\n  The training and extensive preparation that our crew undoubtedly went \nthrough at Pope Air Force Base has paid dividends. These men and women \nperformed a stellar job without showing even the slightest bit of \napprehension. I know my colleagues on the flight would agree; our \nmilitary is fortunate to have this crew serving our nation in such a \nfine manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1994-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMEMORATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF THE REV. DR. MARTIN \n                            LUTHER KING, JR.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish today to commemorate the 40th \nanniversary of the death of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. April 4, \n2008, marks the 40th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr., an iconic leader of the American civil rights \nmovement. In death, the legacy of Dr. King continues and so does his \ncall for tolerance, justice, and equality.\n  April 1968 was a tragic time for the King family and for our Nation. \nOur cities erupted as people were overcome by rage and horror at his \nassassination. We all suffered in the knowledge that someone who had \nbeen an inspiration to millions had been taken from us by an assassin's \nbullet.\n  It has been 40 years since his murder, but his legacy remains with us \nas we continue to pursue his vision of equality, fairness, and justice. \nToday, we are a nation of 300 million people; a nation in which one out \nof three Americans is a member of a minority group. His vision is just \nas important and inspirational today as it was 40 years ago.\n  We must never forget that our diversity is one of our greatest \nstrengths and one of our most important challenges. We must find a way \nto work and live together and to respect each other. Dr. King's legacy \nof social justice charted the path for us.

Mr. President, March is National Eye Donor Month. In fact, \nit's the 25th anniversary of that proud tradition.\n  Each March since 1983, the eye donor community has gathered to \ncelebrate the gift of sight, to honor past donors and their families, \nand to raise awareness about eye donation.\n  I want to thank those who have given this amazing gift and to \nencourage more Americans to become eye donors.\n  Eye donation is an incredible thing. Precious corneas harvested from \ndonated eyes can restore vision that's been lost to disease or injury \nor infection. Most of us take our vision for granted.\n  We read our books, watch our children grow, and find our loved ones \nin a crowded room--and don't give it a second thought. But what if you \nlost that ability, that gift of sight--or never had it at all. An \nestimated 11.4 million people have severe visual problems that are not \ncorrectable by glasses.\n  Eighty million people suffer from potentially blinding eye disease; \n1.1 million people are legally blind. But there is hope. Through the \nmiracle of transplantation, it is possible to restore sight.\n  Each year, 44,000 sight-restoring corneal transplants are performed.\n  Eye banks like the Central Ohio Lions Eye Bank change people's lives. \nShirley Jacobs knows this first hand. Shirley was living with Fuchs \ndystrophy, a genetic degenerative corneal disease. The disease robbed \nher of clear vision. It limited her independence and her ability to do \nher job. Then she received a corneal transplant at the Central Ohio \nLions Eye Bank. Her first words after the surgery were, ``This is a \nmiracle! I can see you, I can see you!''\n  That is amazing. But so many more people are waiting.\n  In Ohio alone, 1,600 people each year could have their sight restored \nthrough corneal transplants. But there aren't enough organs available. \nWe need to get the word out and reach people who would donate if given \nthe choice. We must raise public awareness of the need for eye donors \nand the ways to sign up.\n  I encourage my colleagues to work with their local eye banks and the \nEye Bank Association of America to promote the precious gift of eye \ndonation. I also encourage Americans to consider designating themselves \nas organ donors on their driver's licenses. It is the best way to make \nyour end-of-life wishes known and to give the gift of sight. I urge my \ncolleagues and fellow citizens to consider becoming an eye donor. \nThousands of people around the country are waiting for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1994-4", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1994-S1995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         PRESIDENT'S VETO OF THE INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, America is a great and good Nation that has \nbeen a beacon to the world on human rights. Nothing should be simpler \nthan for a President of the United States to stand up and say, clearly, \nthat this country does not engage in cruel and abusive interrogation \npractices such as waterboarding; that those practices are abhorrent and \nillegal. It saddens me greatly--but does not surprise me--that this \nPresident has, once again, refused to make that simple statement. By \nvetoing the intelligence authorization bill because of a provision that \nwould reemphasize that waterboarding\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\nand other forms of torture are illegal, he has added to the shameful \nlegacy of this administration.\n  Let me be clear. This provision should not have been necessary. \nWaterboarding and other forms of torture are already clearly illegal. \nWaterboarding has been recognized as torture for the last 500 years. \nPresident Teddy Roosevelt prosecuted American soldiers for \nwaterboarding more than 100 years ago. We prosecuted Japanese soldiers \nfor waterboarding Americans during World War II.\n  I supported this provision, despite the fact that there is no \nquestion that waterboarding is already illegal, because this \nadministration has chosen to flout the rule of law. They have admitted \nthey have engaged in waterboarding, otherwise known as water torture, \nand they refuse to say they will not do it again. The positions they \nhave taken publicly on this subject are so destructive to the core \nvalues of this Nation and our standing in the world that both Houses of \nthis Congress have chosen to emphasize, again, that our Government is \nnot permitted to use these shameful techniques. His veto, while another \nin a series of self-interested acts, does nothing to make waterboarding \nany less illegal and abhorrent.\n  Waterboarding is torture. It always has been torture. William Safire \nin a recent article in The New York Times Magazine traced the \nderivation of the term ``waterboarding.'' It was a chilling history, \nbut most disturbing was this recitation of how it was performed on our \nown servicemembers:\n\n       [I]n 1953, a U.S. fighter pilot told United Press that \n     North Korean captors gave him the `water treatment' in which \n     `they would bend my head back, put a towel over my face and \n     pour water over the towel. I could not breathe. . . . When I \n     would pass out, they would shake me and begin again.'\n\n  The greatest tragedy of the President's veto is that he has made it \nharder to protect Americans and our own servicemembers from this form \nof torture. This administration has so twisted America's role, law, and \nvalues that our own State Department and high-ranking officials in our \nDepartment of Defense, and even our Attorney General, are not permitted \nto say that the waterboarding of an American is illegal. Only our \nenemies can take comfort in the President's veto. It sacrifices \nAmerica's high moral ground and the force of international standards \nand says that high-ranking American officials agree with them that \nwaterboarding is a legal and a useful interrogation ``technique.'' It \nsends the signal that they are as free to use the ``technique'' as the \nBush administration was, if they determine it to be in their best \ninterest. That is how low we have sunk.\n  I confirmed in questioning the Director of the FBI just last week \nthat in its counterterrorism efforts, the FBI continues to follow \nproscriptions against coercive interrogations. Our top military lawyers \nand our generals and admirals also understand this issue. They have \nsaid consistently that waterboarding is torture and is illegal. They \nhave told us again and again at hearings and in letters that \nintelligence gathered through cruel techniques like waterboarding is \nnot reliable and that our use and endorsement of these techniques puts \nour brave men and women serving in the Armed Forces at risk. That is \nwhy they have so explicitly prohibited such techniques in their own \nArmy Field Manual, and it is an example that the rest of the Government \nand the rest of the country should follow.\n  Yet it is a provision that would have required compliance with the \nArmy Field Manual that caused the President to veto this bill. He said \nit would ``harm our national security.'' He could not be more wrong.\n  When the Senate was considering the nomination of the current \nAttorney General, I read in The Washington Post and heard from some \nMembers of this body that we could ignore the nominee's refusal to \nrecognize that waterboarding is illegal because he had assured us that \nhe would enforce a new law against waterboarding if Congress were to \npass one. I said then that we needed no such law because waterboarding \nwas already illegal. I said then that such an assurance was hollow and \ndangerous because this President would surely veto any such \nprohibition. Now he has.\n  This is about core American values, the things that make our country \ngreat. America does not torture. It should always stand against \ntorture. This veto is another sad moment for America. America is better \nthan this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1995-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1995-S1996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GLEN GOODALL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the advantages of growing up in \nMontpelier, VT, is that I still see friends of mine and my family when \nI am back home. Glen and Esther Goodall were dear friends of my \nparents, Howard and Alba Leahy, and it is always nice to catch up with \nthem, especially at the farmers' market in Montpelier in the summer.\n  Recently, Glen Goodall wrote a superb article for the Times Argus \nnewspaper, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord. In the article, he tells what happened when the USS President \nCoolidge struck antisubmarine mines and sank. Glen is one of those \nunsung heroes of World War II, and it is an honor to know him.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    From the Big Swim to Main Street\n\n\n               Veteran recounts fights in Pacific Theater\n\n       Sixty-six years ago, at the age of 23, I was headed for \n     Camp Blanding in Florida with the Vermont National Guard \n     172nd Infantry regiment of the 43rd Division. Our division \n     was inducted into federal service on Feb. 24, 1941. After 18 \n     months of training at Camp Blanding in Florida and Camp \n     Shelby in Mississippi, plus maneuvers in Louisiana and North \n     Carolina, we received orders to Fort Ord, Calif., where we \n     were to embark shortly for the Pacific Theater.\n       The 172nd Combat team set sail on the U.S.S. President \n     Coolidge. As we arrived at Espiritu Santo, an island of the \n     New Hebrides group, on Oct. 26, 1942, the Coolidge \n     accidentally struck and detonated friendly anti-submarine \n     mines and sank. About 95 percent of the men on ship swam the \n     800 to 1,000 yards to shore through heavy oil, as lifeboats \n     milled about to take others to shore. Brigadier Gen. Rose, \n     the island commander, simply stated: ``Without discipline of \n     a superior kind, the feat of abandoning a rapidly sinking \n     ship by some 4,000 men in less than an hour could never have \n     been accomplished. Coolness which forestalled panic, trust in \n     their leader, considering the safety of others, agility in \n     scrambling down nets and ropes, all revealed the quality of \n     their training and what soldiers call `what it takes'.''\n       After five months on Espiritu Santo, our supply ship from \n     the states arrived to re-equip the regiment with all the \n     supplies we lost when the Coolidge went down. We left then \n     for Guadalcanal for a mopping-up operation and jungle \n     training to help us for our drive toward the homeland of \n     Japan. Those orders arrived in May 1943 to invade the New \n     Georgia group of islands. We landed on Rendova Island, from \n     there to Munda, fighting along the Munda Trail to Arundel \n     along the Diamond Narrows.\n       On Aug. 2, 1943, Brigadier Gen. Leonard F. Wing of Rutland \n     became the commanding general of the 43rd Division. Because \n     of his red hair, he became known as ``Red Wing'' and his \n     division known as the famous Red Wing Victory Division.\n       We landed in Luzon on the Philippine Islands on Jan. 9, \n     1945. The battle lasted 175 days. During that time we lost \n     965 men, 2,988 wounded and 11 missing. In the rest area in \n     Luzon we trained to invade the homeland of Japan, and while \n     we were training the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and \n     Nagasaki on Aug. 7, 1945, and the Japanese surrendered. We \n     left for Japan as occupational troops and saw the horrific \n     devastation of the atomic bombs as well as the earlier fire \n     bombing of Tokyo and Yokohama.\n       Two weeks later, we were relieved and headed back to the \n     states, arriving on Oct. 6, 1945 where three years earlier we \n     had embarked for combat on Oct. 6, 1941. Peace at last had \n     cost us 1,561 killed, 6,049 wounded, a total of 7,610. A lot \n     of soldiers were returning to 3-year-old children they had \n     never seen.\n       I left for duty with the 172nd Infantry Regiment on Feb. \n     14, 1941 as a supply sergeant and ended my military career as \n     a warrant officer on Jan. 6, 1946. I returned to Vermont and \n     my wife on Oct. 6, 1945. I was in fairly good health but \n     continued to have malaria for a few years.\n       Major Gen. Wing was the only National Guard commander to \n     stay with the same division from the beginning to the end of \n     the war. The 43rd Infantry (Winged Victory) Division was the \n     only division privileged to participate in the South Pacific, \n     Southwest Pacific and the Philippines Campaign and continue \n     on to the Japanese homeland.\n       As I reflect back on my World War II memories it was always \n     meaningful to me to be a member of the Vermont 172nd Infantry \n     Regiment of the 43rd Division. I was born in Vermont and it \n     has been my home for 89\\1/2\\ years. Some of the other \n     Montpelier National Guard friends were Harry Seivwright, \n     Olisse Melada, Tom Guare, Francis Carey and Ernest Gibson, \n     who later became governor of Vermont. Some of these friends,\n\n[[Page S1996]]\n\n     Harry Seivwright and Tom Guare, went into the European \n     theater and left us after training. Ernest Gibson was wounded \n     on one of the islands we invaded in the Pacific.\n       My wife and new bride, Esther, anxiously waited three years \n     for my safe return, and we were writing and exchanging \n     letters daily. Our local post service was super and a \n     blessing when even on a Sunday afternoon a letter from the \n     Pacific would be delivered to her personally sometimes by the \n     Postmaster Ed Henry or our local carrier, Stan Fournier. \n     Esther worked for the war effort the first year I was away, \n     making her home with her sister in Connecticut. She worked \n     for an industry that made fine glassware but had converted to \n     making bomb site lenses for planes and she rode a victory \n     bike to work daily. The last two years she returned to \n     Montpelier and worked in the state Education Department and \n     after working hours rolled and knitted bandages, sold war \n     bonds, mixed the coloring in the margarine, grocery shopped \n     with meat coupons, continued her daily letter to me and \n     bonded with other Army wives and friends.\n       Vermont celebrated the victory of World War II in November \n     and the celebration and parade were held in Montpelier \n     marching down Main and State Street. Col. Jim Walsh of St. \n     Albans from my outfit and I were asked to lead the parade. \n     For Esther and me, the memories and the celebration of that \n     day are the fondest, most emotional, happiest and proudest \n     moments of our lives. War is a bittersweet experience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1996-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN AND GWEN HUNECK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, recently the Associated Press wrote a great \narticle about Stephen and Gwen Huneck and their Dog Mountain studio. I \nhave seen this article reprinted throughout the country.\n  If one goes into my office in Washington, my office in Vermont, my \nhome in Vermont, or my home here, one would see many pieces of \nStephen's artwork. Both Marcelle and I are great fans of his.\n  One of the pleasures of living in a small State like ours is that we \nhad the opportunity to get to know Stephen and Gwen and realize what \nreal human beings they are. They are among our valued friends, and I \nwant the Senate to have the opportunity to read this article as part of \nan insight into why we think so highly of them. I ask unanimous consent \nto have the article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            (By John Curran)\n\n       Degas had his ballerinas, Monet his water lilies. For \n     Stephen Huneck, inspiration comes on four legs--its teeth dug \n     into a stick, or tugging on a piece of rope, or playing on a \n     beach.\n       The eclectic Vermont folk artist, who started out whittling \n     wooden sculptures of dogs and now specializes in dog-themed \n     furniture, woodcut paintings and children's books, has carved \n     out a unique niche with his whimsical reproductions of \n     Labrador retrievers and other dogs.\n       And his Dog Mountain studio and dog chapel--on a \n     picturesque 175-acre hillside farm in rural northern \n     Vermont--have evolved into a kind of doggy Disneyland, \n     drawing animal lovers and their pets from all over, and some \n     to mourn.\n       To Huneck, dogs are more than man's best friend.\n       ``I really believe they're the great spirit's special gift \n     to mankind,'' said Huneck, 59. ``Dogs teach us more than we \n     teach them.''\n       But his first lessons were tough ones.\n       He was bitten by a German shepherd as a toddler, terrorized \n     by a St. Bernard on his newspaper route as a teenager and \n     left heartbroken once when his father bought a puppy for the \n     family--but took it back to the pound the next day.\n       ``Through it all, I just loved dogs,'' he said.\n       A longtime antique collector, the Sudbury, Mass. native \n     turned to art professionally in the early 1980s, using old-\n     fashioned chisels, saws and planes to hand carve his first \n     few canine creations. Much of the basswood, cherry, maple and \n     pine he works with comes from his farm.\n       His woodcuts--dogs with halos, dogs peaking out from under \n     bedcovers, dogs sniffing each other--brim with the \n     playfulness of a 6-week-old puppy. His sculptures and \n     furniture, meanwhile, range from his Angel Dog statues-- a \n     black lab with golden wings--to coffee tables with sculpted \n     dog likeness legs, from night tables with dog head handles to \n     rocking dogs.\n       Dog lovers fairly hound him for commissioned works. His \n     client list includes actress Sandra Bullock (a dog sculpture \n     wedding present for her husband), Dr. Phil McGraw of TV talk \n     show fame (a drawing of his dog) and U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, \n     whose Washington, D.C., office is decorated with Huneck art.\n       ``I think, to describe his work to someone who has never \n     seen it, you simply say `You have to see it, I can't describe \n     it to give it the credit it deserves,''' said R. Scudder \n     Smith, publisher of Antiques and The Arts Weekly, in Newtown, \n     Conn. ``It is too full of fun, imagination and talent to put \n     into words.''\n       His books, including ``Sally Goes to the Beach,'' ``Sally \n     Goes to the Farm'' and the new ``Sally Gets a Job,'' feature \n     woodcut prints accompanied by simple, pithy captions that \n     celebrate man's unique relationship with dogs.\n       ``Like a dog, he has no inhibitions,'' said Rob Hunter, \n     gallery manager for Frog Hollow Vermont State Craft Center. \n     ``He goes all over the place with his work. He has tapped \n     into that playfulness you get with a dog.''\n       The dog chapel grew out of a bit of inspiration after his \n     1994 hospitalization with Adult Respiratory Distress \n     Syndrome, which nearly killed him. When he came out of it, he \n     says, he had a vision.\n       ``I kept thinking what a great thing it could be, for \n     people not only to mourn the loss of a dog but to celebrate \n     nature and their relationships with their dogs,'' he said.\n       Using wood harvested from his own property, Huneck modeled \n     the one-room chapel after 19th-century Vermont churches, with \n     vaulted ceilings, stained glass windows and wooden pews.\n       Built at a cost of ``several hundred thousand dollars'' and \n     completed in 2000, it has stained glass windows with images \n     of dogs pieced into them.\n       The wooden pew-style benches in the 30-by-22 foot main room \n     have one-dimension dog likenesses at either end that are so \n     realistic, Huneck says, that live dogs sniff their bottoms.\n       Outside, a sign welcomes all: ``Welcome all creeds, all \n     breeds. No dogmas allowed.''\n       ``I wanted the dogs to know this is their place,'' he says.\n       It's also a place for their owners--many of them still \n     grieving over their loss, years later.\n       The walls are covered in handwritten remembrances and \n     photographs left by owners. It's no accident: Paper and \n     pencils are stocked on a door near the entrance, next to the \n     statue of Artie the angel dog, a black Labrador with golden \n     wings.\n       ``We came with Webster, to remember Boris,'' reads one. \n     ``He passed this week. He was a good dog and we will miss \n     him. Webster will miss him too. But our visit today will help \n     us all. Thanks. Cambridge, Mass.''\n       Another: ``Roxie: you are the dog of my heart. You taught \n     me so much about life and love. Always, N.''\n       Another: ``In memory of Rebel, our beautiful greyhound, who \n     died when I was giving birth to my daughter, Kyra.''\n       ``I got this idea that I wanted people to be able to put up \n     pictures of their dogs and put up a short paragraph about \n     their dogs and that they could share that with other people \n     and that it would always be there,'' said Huneck. ``To my \n     great surprise, the place is almost completely, totally full \n     of photographs.\n       ``It brings tears to your eyes, or you could start \n     laughing. It's just incredible insight,'' he said.\n       Weddings and civil union ceremonies have been held in it, \n     although whenever someone makes such a request, Huneck and \n     his wife, Gwen, explain that the chapel has to remain open \n     for others while the ceremony is being held.\n       The chapel, which is unheated and never closes, is busy and \n     full of life in summer and fall, but quiet, empty and solemn \n     on most winter days.\n       ``It's just so unique,'' said Jennifer Goodman, 29, of \n     Boston, who made the three-hour drive to it last month, \n     accompanied by her boyfriend and her 7-year-old basset hound, \n     Beans.\n       ``My friends were like `You're going to Vermont? Are you \n     going to go skiing?' I'm like, `No, we're going to a dog \n     mountain,' and no one quite understands it. We literally just \n     got here, checked into a hotel.''\n       Twice a year, Huneck and his wife throw outdoor barbecues--\n     with food for everyone, two legs or four.\n       ``When dogs pull up in here, they may never have been here \n     before, but it's like they saw the `Disneyland' sign. They \n     just get so excited, so happy,'' he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1996-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1996-S1997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TEMPLE EMANU-EL\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I would like to express my sorrow \nregarding the tragic death of one of Washington's finest young \nenvironmental advocates Shannon Harps on December 31, 2007. She was \nkilled by an unknown assailant as she was returning to her Capitol Hill \napartment in Seattle from the grocery store. Shannon's death is a \ntremendous loss to our community and the many issues to which she \ndevoted her life. I join with Shannon's family, friends, and colleagues \nin the Sierra Club in mourning the loss of this wonderful person and \nfine community organizer. Though her life was cut short, she was able \nto make a large impact on the quality of the Northwest environment.\n  Shannon came from her home State of Ohio to Seattle, WA, in February \n2004 to join the staff of the northwest office of the Sierra Club. This \nmove joined two of Shannon's strongest desires to work to protect our \nenvironment and to live in the Northwest where she could more \nvigorously pursue her strong love for the outdoors.\n  Shannon had a wonderful sense of humor and a style of working with \npeople that immediately put them at ease and made it easy for them to \njoin her in protecting our environment and quality of life. Shannon \nparticularly enjoyed working with high school and college students to \nhelp them develop their interests and talents in working to create a \nbetter world. While Shannon's work was directly focused on protecting \nour environment, from wilderness to global warming, her values were \ndeeply embedded in a strong sense of fairness and justice for all \npeople.\n  In the 4 years that Shannon lived in Washington State she helped to \nprotect some of our finest lands. Shannon worked with Sierra Club \nvolunteers and staff from the many groups to help move the Wild Sky \nWilderness proposal through the various steps of its arduous journey \nthrough the congressional process. She spent countless hours on the \nphone, in meetings, and on the trail helping to bring people together \nto advocate for protection of these spectacular wild lands. Shannon \nbelieved that people were better advocates if they had firsthand \nknowledge of the places they were advocating for. As part of this \nbelief she led countless hikes into some of Washington's wildest lands.\n  Shannon's was a natural leader in the State of Washington and worked \nwith colleagues around the country to help thwart the various efforts \nto open up America's Arctic Coastal Plain to oil and gas drilling. She \nwas a lead organizer in the successful effort in 2006 to pass the \nrenewable energy portfolio standard for Washington State. And, in the \nrecent 2 years, much of her work focused on building relationships with \nlocal officials and creating public support so they would endorse the \nmayor's Climate Protection Agreement.\n  In her all-too-short life, she made contributions that benefited our \ncommunity, State, and the world. She lived her life as an example of \nliving lightly on the planet and engaged the people and world around \nher with grace, humor, kindness, and respect. Everyone who worked with \nher admired her style, tenacity, and sense of purpose, along with her \nsparkling smile and laugh.\n  Shannon loved living and working in the Northwest. She reveled in the \noutdoors and nothing made her happier than to participate in a \ncompetitive run, or hike our high mountain trails. Her death is a loss \nfor us all. But her spirit still resides with all of those with whom \nshe worked and walked the trails, and those who continue the struggle \nto protect our lands and environment and create a more just and fair \nworld for us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1997-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARC HERSHMAN\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I honor Marc Hershman, a \nprofessor and former director of the University of Washington School of \nMarine Affairs and adjunct professor at the school of law, for his \nexceptional public service to our country. Since 1972, Professor \nHershman has been a valued leader, colleague, and mentor in the fields \nof marine policy, coastal zone management, marine ports and \ntransportation, and law.\n  Mr. President, it is my sad duty today to report that Professor \nHershman passed away on Monday, February 18. Today, I want to extend my \ncondolences to his entire family, including his wife Carol, his \ndaughter Carla, his son Jordan, and his sister Susan.\n  Professor Hershman led faculty and students engaged in teaching and \nresearch on integrated coastal zone management, ports and \ntransportation, living marine resource management, marine protected \nareas, impacts of climate change, and other ocean issues. He had more \nthan 30 years of experience in the study of ocean and coastal law and \npolicy. In 1972, he founded the Coastal Management Journal and served \nas its editor in chief. He served as president of The Coastal Society, \nwas a cofounder of the Marine Affairs and Policy Association, and was \nan active member of the nationwide Ocean Governance Study Group. He was \nthe founder and a board member of Odyssey Maritime Discovery Center on \nSeattle's central waterfront.\n  Over the years, Professor Hershman was the recipient of several \nawards in the marine policy field. As voted by his peers, he was the \nfirst to receive the biennial Orville T. Magoon Service Award, which \nrecognized his long-time Achievement Award and was twice presented with \nthe Distinguished Service Award from the Coastal Society. In 2001, at \nthe recommendation of U.S. House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, \nProfessor Hershman was selected by President George W. Bush to serve on \nthe U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy.\n  Recently, Professor Hershman was working on ocean policy in \nWashington State. He led 25 students in preparing ocean policy \nrecommendations to the Governor's Ocean Policy Working Group. In \ncollaboration with NOAA's Sea Grant Program and various State agencies, \nProfessor Hershman developed the groundwork for a marine policy \nfellowship program in the State government, to be called the Hershman \nFellowship.\n  I extend my condolences to Professor Hershman's family and friends. \nHis passing is a loss not only to his family and those who knew him but \nto academia and the entire field of marine policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1997-3", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1997-S1998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING KAREN HONTZ\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the outstanding \nservice Karen Hontz has provided to the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship in her capacity as a detailee from the \nSmall Business Administration, SBA. Karen came to the Senate last June \nand quickly established herself as an invaluable asset from her first \ndays on the job when the committee held a roundtable and subsequent \nmarkup on venture capital legislation. As Congress prepares to take a \nshort recess, Karen will begin her transition back to the SBA, as well \nas her 20th year of distinguished service to the Federal Government. \nThis will certainly be SBA Administrator Preston's gain and my and my \nstaff's loss. Thank you Administrator Preston for allowing us to work \nwith Karen over the last 9 months.\n  As I reflect on Karen's tenure, I will always remember how she far \nexceeded all expectations, working long hours to provide me with clear \nand succinct materials about critical issues facing America's small \nbusinesses. This was particularly impressive given the volume of \nactivity before the committee and the fact that Karen was new to the \nSenate. Indeed, since Karen came to Capitol Hill, the committee held \nseven oversight hearings on issues ranging from Government contracting, \nto women's business ownership and grant programs, to the SBA's budget. \nThe committee also held two markups, sending venture capital, \nentrepreneurial development, and contracting legislation to the Senate \nfloor. My staff and I could not have navigated these committee actions \nwithout Karen's sage counsel and invaluable insight gained from years \nof experience at the SBA.\n  Not only was Karen extremely helpful in assisting me with committee \nhearings and markups, but she also played an integral role in moving \nlegislation on the Senate floor, a rare feat for a new employee. For \nexample,\n\n[[Page S1998]]\n\nKaren, together with other members of my staff, successfully negotiated \nwith House and Senate committee, floor, and leadership staff with \nrespect to controversial provisions in the Military Reservist and \nVeteran Small Business Reauthorization and Opportunity Act of 2007, \nH.R. 4253, critical legislation that will expand business opportunities \nfor veterans and help reservists keep their businesses afloat during \nand after deployment. Karen was instrumental in helping the Senate to \nclear this bill by unanimous consent in late January before President \nBush signed it into law in mid-February. Karen was also pivotal in \nhelping to include a bipartisan and bicameral small business title to \nthe energy bill that was signed into law last December. In addition, \nKaren also helped the Disaster Response and Loan Improvement Act, S. \n163, to pass the Senate last August. It was her political savvy and \ninnovative thinking that helped produce a less costly bill that met \nboth the Senate's and the administration's objectives and was able to \ngarner the support of the entire Senate Chamber.\n  Finally, I would also be remiss in not pointing out that there are \noften concerns when an executive branch employee comes to the Senate \nfor a work assignment, as Congress and the administration sometimes \napproach issues from differing viewpoints. Karen carefully and \ngracefully fulfilled her fiduciary duties relating to confidential \ninformation received from the two branches of Government, which could \nnot be shared between those entities. She was also able to give fair \nand balanced advice, explaining in an unbiased manner both sides of an \nissue. In addition to Karen's in-depth knowledge of the SBA, she also \nprovided broader insight into executive branch operations, including \nthe Federal rulemaking and administrative processes, as well as the \nOffice of Management and Budget's role in the budget and appropriations \nprocess.\n  Karen has truly been a vital part of my team and has provided a \nunique viewpoint and voice that has truly broadened this committee's \ngrasp on the SBA and small business issues. Karen's extraordinary \nperformance has far exceeded my expectations, and she will be greatly \nmissed. I wish Karen and her husband Stephen all the best as she \nreturns to the SBA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1998-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING THOS. MOSER CABINETMAKERS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I congratulate Thos. Moser \nCabinetmakers, a family-oriented business from my home State of Maine \nthat continues to thrive after 36 years of producing extraordinary \nfurniture. With galleries open in nine locations, including one in \nSouth Korea and its newest in Los Angeles, Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers \nhas truly exceeded expectations while staying true to its Maine roots.\n  Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers' founder, Thomas Moser, began his \nprofessional career as a professor both throughout the United States as \nwell as in Saudi Arabia. Shortly after getting married in 1957, Mr. \nMoser and his wife began purchasing old furniture, refurbishing it, and \nthen reselling it to supplement their income. Realizing how \npassionately he enjoyed woodworking, Mr. Moser gave up teaching to \npursue the legacy that has now propelled his product into a household \nname. Working with his sons, Mr. Moser is dedicated to maintaining a \nfamily business for years to come and credits his success to his \npartnership with his wife.\n  What has always stood out about Thos. Moser is that the company \nadheres to a creed that stresses function over fashion, creating \nbeautiful works for everyday living. From dining tables and stools to \nbeds, benches, and rocking chairs, Thos. Moser's furniture belies a \nunique and timeless quality. The company's various collections and \npieces have frequently resulted from Mr. Moser's worldwide travels and \nexperiences. The inspiration of Danish furnituremaking provided the \nimpetus for the curved Astral Bench while the Eastward Stool pays \ntribute to the famed Japanese-American woodworker George Nakashima. Mr. \nMoser's furniture additionally celebrates places of natural beauty in \nMaine, from its largest peak, Mount Katahdin, to the island-laden \ncoastal town of Harpswell, to farm-draped New Gloucester, the placid \ntown where Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers got its start. One of the \ncompany's most admirable aspects is its warranty. Guaranteed for life, \nThos. Moser furniture is ensured to be replaced if it is ever found to \nbe faulty.\n  To continue constructing such superb furniture, and to stay \ncompetitive in the woodworking industry, Thos. Moser recently teamed up \nwith the Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership to incorporate the \nLean manufacturing program into its regular business practices. This \nprogram helps workers and management alike think in an innovative, \ngoal-oriented manner, and as a result, many employees at Thos. Moser \nhave taken up leadership positions they never would have attempted \notherwise. In all, 35 employees were trained through the program, but \nthe benefits were far-reaching.\n  Thos. Moser Cabinetmakers grew out of a passion for woodwork, and the \ncurrent operation has sacrificed none of that early fervor. The company \nis a strong example of Mainers' determined entrepreneurial spirit, and \nit shows no signs of letting up. I congratulate Thos. Moser \nCabinetmakers and its over 200 employees for their steadfast enthusiasm \nand committed work ethic, and wish them much continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S1998-2", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:46 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5492.

A bill to amend section 552(b)(3) of title 5, United States \nCode (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act) to \nprovide that statutory exemptions to the disclosure requirements of \nthat Act shall specifically cite to the provision of that Act \nauthorizing such exemptions, to ensure an open and deliberative process \nin Congress by providing for related legislative proposals to \nexplicitly state such required citations, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, as we approach the national \ncelebration of Sunshine Week 2008, I am pleased to join with Senator \nCornyn to introduce the OPEN FOIA Act of 2008, a concise and \nstraightforward bill to further strengthen the Freedom of Information \nAct, FOIA. This bill is the next step in the important work that \nSenator Cornyn and I have undertaken to reinvigorate and strengthen \nFOIA, and it follows the enactment late last year of the Leahy-Cornyn \nOPEN Government Act, a law which made the first major reforms to FOIA \nin more than a decade.\n  The OPEN FOIA Act simply requires that when Congress provides for a \nstatutory exemption to FOIA in new legislation, Congress must state its \nintention to do so explicitly and clearly in that bill. This \ncommonsense bill mirrors bipartisan legislation that unanimously passed \nthe Senate during the last Congress, S.1181. I hope that the Senate \nwill once again promptly and unanimously pass this good-government \nbill.\n  While no one can fairly question the need to keep certain government \ninformation secret to ensure the public good, excessive government \nsecrecy is a constant temptation and the enemy of a vibrant democracy. \nFor more than 4 decades, FOIA has served as perhaps the most important \nFederal law to ensure the public's right to know and to balance the \ngovernment's power with the need for government accountability.\n  FOIA contains a number of exemptions to its disclosure requirements \nfor national security, law enforcement, confidential business \ninformation, personal privacy and other circumstances. The FOIA \nexemption commonly known as the ``(b)(3) exemption,'' requires that \nGovernment records that are specifically exempted from FOIA by statute \nmay be withheld from the public. Of course, neither I nor Senator \nCornyn would quibble with the notion that some Government information \nis appropriately kept from public view. But in recent years we have \nwitnessed an alarming number of FOIA (b)(3) exemptions being offered in \nlegislation--often in very ambiguous terms--to the detriment of the \nAmerican people's right to know.\n  The bedrock principles of open government lead me to believe that \n(b)(3) statutory exemptions should be clear and unambiguous, and \nvigorously debated before they are enacted into law. Of course, \nsometimes this does happen. But more and more often, legislative \nexemptions to FOIA are buried within a few lines of very complex and \nlengthy bills, which are never debated openly and publicly before \nbecoming law. The consequence of this troubling practice is the erosion \nof the public's right to know and the shirking of Congress' duty to \nfully consider these exemptions.\n  Senator Cornyn and I both believe that Congress must be diligent in \nreviewing any new exemptions to FOIA, to prevent possible abuses and a \nsituation where the exceptions to disclosure under FOIA swallow this \nimportant disclosure rule. The OPEN FOIA Act will ensure openness and \nclarity about how we treat one of our most important open Government \nlaws. Our bill will also shine more light into the process of creating \nlegislative exemptions to FOIA--which is the best antidote to exemption \ncreep.\n  Democratic and Republican Senators alike have rightly supported and \nvoted for this bill in the past. As I have said many times before, open \nGovernment is not a Democratic issue, nor a Republican issue. It is an \nAmerican value and a virtue that all Americans can embrace. I urge all \nMembers to support this bipartisan good-government bill to strengthen \nthe public's right to know.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2746\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``OPEN FOIA Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SPECIFIC CITATIONS IN STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS.\n\n       Section 552(b) of title 5, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:\n       ``(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute \n     (other than section 552b of this title), if that statute--\n       ``(A)(i) requires that the matters be withheld from the \n     public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the \n     issue; or\n       ``(ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or \n     refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and\n       ``(B) if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN \n     FOIA Act of 2008, specifically cites to this paragraph.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 2748. A bill to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto publish physical activity guidelines for the general public, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, some time back, a principal of a school in \nAtlanta, GA, explained why his school had eliminated recess from its \nschool day, and why new elementary schools in Atlanta were being built \nwithout playgrounds: He told The New York Times: ``We are intent on \nimproving academic performance. You don't do that by having kids \nhanging on the monkey bars.''\n  Now, there is no reason to pick on Atlanta alone. Nationwide, only 8 \npercent of elementary schools provide daily physical education or its \nequivalent for all students.\n  We are building schools without playgrounds, subdivisions without \nsidewalks, roads without bicycle lanes. The average American spends \nmore than 4 hours each day sitting passively in front of the TV set--\nthat is equal to 2 months of nonstop TV-watching per year.\n  Then we are shocked, shocked to find that rates of overweight, \nobesity and diabetes are skyrocketing, and cardiovascular disease \nremains the No. 1 cause of death in our country. Among children, we \nhave what the Centers for Disease Control describes as an ``epidemic'' \nof obesity and juvenile diabetes.\n  The shame is that so much of this is entirely preventable. Americans \nare suffering from a range of diseases and conditions--obesity, heart \ndisease, diabetes, stress, and depression. All of these are largely \npreventable by changes in diet and lifestyle; specifically, by \nincreasing the amount of physical activity in our lives.\n  I am a firm believer that people want to stay healthy, and that \nGovernment can help out by giving Americans the tools they need to take \ncharge of their own health.\n  But, right now, individuals do not know how much physical activity \nthey should be getting daily. They don't have a target to shoot for.\n  That is why, today, I am joining with Senator Sam Brownback, \nCongressman Mark Udall, and Congressman Zach Wamp to introduce the \nPhysical Activities Guidelines for Americans Act of 2008.\n  Our bill would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to \nprepare and promote science-based physical activity guidelines for \nAmericans, similar to the dietary and nutritional guidelines, commonly \nknown as the Food Pyramid. Our bill also would require that the \nguidelines be updated every 5 years.\n  I believe that the Physical Activity Guidelines will assist many \nAmericans in living longer, healthier, and more active lives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2750. A bill to modify the requirements applicable to locatable \nminerals on public domain lands, consistent with the principles of \nself-initiation of mining claims, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will help address a troublesome byproduct of our Nation's mining \nhistory: abandoned mines.\n\n[[Page S2002]]\n\n  The 1872 Mining Law created national standards to regulate gold and \nsilver mining operations on Federal lands. Since then, hundreds of \nthousands of gold and silver mines have been abandoned.\n  There are roughly 500,000 abandoned mines across the U.S., and nearly \n47,000 abandoned mines in my home State of California.\n  According to the California Department of Conservation, all but two \nof California's 58 counties have abandoned mines; and close to 70 \npercent of California's abandoned mines are located in the ``Mother \nLode'' area in the Northern Sierra or San Bernardino, Inyo and Kern \nCounties in the southeastern part of the State.\n  Because the 1872 Mining Law is so outdated, we have been unable to \nadequately clean up and remediate these abandoned mines.\n  The need for action is great.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, is not intended to be a \ncomprehensive hardrock mining reform bill, but it is an important piece \nof the reform that is needed in hardrock mining.\n  The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act of 2008, will reform the 1872 \nMining Law by: establishing fees to support abandoned mine cleanup; \nestablishing a royalty payment system; and creating an Abandoned Mine \nCleanup Fund.\n  Unlike the coal industry, the metal mining industry does not pay to \nclean up its legacy of abandoned mines, making lack of funding the \nprimary obstacle to abandoned hardrock mine cleanup.\n  This legislation would help fund the cleanup of abandoned mines by \nplacing an Abandoned Mine Reclamation fee on all hardrock minerals, \nusing the underground coal industry fee program as a model.\n  Here is why--the condition of abandoned coal mines has greatly \nimproved since the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 \nestablished a fee to finance restoration of land abandoned or \ninadequately restored by coal mining companies.\n  This fund has been able to raise billions of dollars for coal mine \nreclamation--and I believe that a similar program could be part of the \nsolution to the hardrock abandoned mine cleanup.\n  This legislation also establishes a royalty on Hardrock Mining \nClaims.\n  Companies that mine for gold and silver on Federal lands are not \ncurrently required to pay any royalties to the Federal Government--even \nthough we are experiencing near record high gold prices, around $900 an \nounce.\n  These companies should be required to pay their fair share.\n  The Abandoned Mine Reclamation Act establishes an 8 percent royalty \non new mining operations located on Federal lands, and a 4 percent \nroyalty for existing operations.\n  These royalties are at the same level as the Hardrock Mining and \nReclamation Act, H.R. 2262, which was passed by the House late last \nyear.\n  The legislation I am introducing today also creates an Abandoned Mine \nFund.\n  In these times of budget deficits, it's clear that we will not be \nable to simply appropriate the funds necessary to clean up the hundreds \nof thousands of abandoned hard rock mines.\n\n  So, this legislation will create an abandoned mine cleanup fund to \nensure that we have a lasting source of funding for this critical \ncleanup effort.\n  Specifically, the fund will direct the royalties, as well as other \npayments collected from mining operations, and dedicate them to the \ncleanup of abandoned hardrock mines.\n  Now I would like to take a moment to talk more about why abandoned \nmines are so problematic.\n  First, members of the public are in danger of getting seriously hurt \nor killed by falling down old mine shafts.\n  In the past 2 years, eight accidents at abandoned mine sites were \nreported in California. These accidents resulted in four fatalities and \nseven others were injured and/or required rescuing.\n  But the even greater threat from abandoned mines comes from the \ndanger of groundwater pollution.\n  Environmental impact studies have shown that important watersheds are \nbeing polluted by high levels of mercury or increased sedimentation.\n  This in turn exposes people who drink this water to harmful minerals \nlike mercury, chromium and asbestos and the fish who swim in streams \nfed by these waters are likewise contaminated.\n  The Bureau of Land Management reports that abandoned mines have \ncontaminated 17 major watersheds in California, which supply water for \nmillions of people and provide habitat for important species like \nsalmon and other fish that are caught and consumed by the public.\n  So, the threat to public health is critical.\n  Mining has played in California's history. The discovery of gold at \nSutter Mill near Placerville, California in 1848 was a defining moment \nfor California and the U.S.\n  It is fair to say that without mining and the Gold Rush, California \nand the entire country would be a far different place than it is today.\n  The great history of mining in California, however, is tarnished by \nthe legacy of tens of thousands of abandoned mines. In particular, \nabandoned mine sites on Federal lands.\n  Let me illustrate a few examples of abandoned mine sites located on \nFederal land in California.\n  These sites are causing serious public safety and environmental \nproblems: Rand Historic Mining Complex located on BLM land in eastern \nKern County and northwestern San Bernardino County.\n  This area includes the Kelly Silver Mine and the Yellow Aster Gold \nMine near the communities of Johannesburg, Randsburg, and Red Mountain.\n  The problem is this: The sites contain extensive arsenic-bearing mine \nwaste and numerous open mine shafts that could cause safety hazards.\n  The Pond Gold Mine Site located in Placer County on BLM land.\n  This mine site consists of an extensive network of sluice tunnels and \na large waste rock pile.\n  Here's the problem: The Pond Mine has been determined to be a source \nof mercury to Pond Creek and the Middle Fork of the American River.\n  The Golinsky Mine located on Forest Service land located in Shasta \nCounty.\n  The Golinsky mine is an abandoned copper mine that is releasing acid \nmine drainage into Shasta Lake.\n  The responsible party has been identified, but has declared \nbankruptcy. This has forced the Forest Service to spend more than $2.2 \nmillion dollars investigating and mitigating the environmental problems \nwhile they try to recoup the costs.\n  There are numerous abandoned mine sites that may not yet have been \ndiscovered all across California.\n  One place where we expect the problem to grow is in Joshua Tree \nNational Park.\n  Joshua Tree has numerous former mine sites that contain a series of \nshafts near trails and roads. These mine shafts vary in size and the \ndepth ranges from 20 to 200 feet deep--and are extremely dangerous, \npotentially causing people to fall into them.\n  So, these abandoned mines are a serious problem throughout the State. \nWe need to take action soon to clean them up.\n  The problems caused by abandoned mines are not going away--and with \neach passing day, the health danger will continue to rise.\n  It is important to our children and grandchildren that we start the \nprocess of cleaning up the abandoned mines that were left to us. But we \ncannot do it without a substantial and reliable source of funding.\n  Here is the key: this legislation doesn't reinvent the wheel. It \nimplements solutions that have been working for a similar problem. It \nuses many of the ideas that have helped the coal industry to raise over \nseven billion dollars for abandoned mines.\n  It is time to expect the same from the hardrock mining industry.\n  Though this legislation is a significant step forward for the funding \nof abandoned mines, I know that there is much more mining reform to be \ndone.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that the 1872 \nMining Law is reformed--so that 21st Century mining regulations will be \napplied to 21st Century mining operations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2750\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Such reports may also include, but \n     not be limited to, pertinent technical and financial data \n     relating to the quantity, quality, composition volume, \n     weight, and assay of all minerals extracted from the mining \n     claim. Upon the request of any officer or employee duly \n     designated by the Secretary conducting an audit or \n     investigation pursuant to this section, the appropriate \n     records, reports, or information that may be required by this \n     section shall be made available for inspection and \n     duplication by such officer or employee. Failure by a claim \n     holder, operator, or other person referred to in the first \n     sentence to cooperate with such an audit, provide data \n     required by the Secretary, or grant access to information \n     may, at the discretion of the Secretary, result in \n     involuntary forfeiture of the claim.\n       (d) Audits.--The Secretary is authorized to conduct such \n     audits of all claim holders, operators, transporters, \n     purchasers, processors, or other persons directly or \n     indirectly involved in the production or sales of minerals \n     covered by this Act, as the Secretary deems necessary for the \n     purposes of ensuring compliance with the requirements of this \n     section. For purposes of performing such audits, the \n     Secretary shall, at reasonable times and upon request, have \n     access to, and may copy, all books, papers and other \n     documents that relate to compliance with any provision of \n     this section by any person.\n       (e) Cooperative Agreements.--(1) The Secretary is \n     authorized to enter into cooperative agreements with the \n     Secretary of Agriculture to share information concerning the \n     royalty management of locatable minerals, concentrates, or \n     products derived therefrom, to carry out inspection, \n     auditing, investigation, or enforcement (not including the \n     collection of royalties, civil or criminal penalties, or \n     other payments) activities under this section in cooperation \n     with the Secretary, and to carry out any other activity \n     described in this section.\n       (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection \n     (relating to trade secrets), and pursuant to a cooperative \n     agreement, the Secretary of Agriculture shall, upon request, \n     have access to all royalty accounting information in the \n     possession of the Secretary respecting the production, \n     removal, or sale of locatable minerals, concentrates, or \n     products derived therefrom from claims on lands open to \n     location under this Act.\n       (3) Trade secrets, proprietary, and other confidential \n     information protected from disclosure under section 552 of \n     title 5, United States Code, popularly known as the Freedom \n     of Information Act, shall be made available by the Secretary \n     to other Federal agencies as necessary to assure compliance \n     with this Act and other Federal laws. The Secretary, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, and other Federal officials \n     shall ensure that such information is provided protection in \n     accordance with the requirements of that section.\n       (f) Interest and Substantial Underreporting Assessments.--\n     (1) In the case of mining claims where royalty payments are \n     not received by the Secretary on the date that such payments \n     are due, the Secretary shall charge interest on such \n     underpayments at the same interest rate as the rate \n     applicable under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986. In the case of an underpayment, interest shall \n     be computed and charged only on the amount of the deficiency \n     and not on the total amount.\n       (2) If there is any underreporting of royalty owed on \n     production from a claim for any production month by any \n     person liable for royalty payments under this section, the \n     Secretary shall assess a penalty of not greater than 25 \n     percent of the amount of that underreporting.\n       (3) For the purposes of this subsection, the term \n     ``underreporting'' means the difference between the royalty \n     on the value of the production that should have been reported \n     and the royalty on the value of the production which was \n     reported, if the value that should have been reported is \n     greater than the value that was reported.\n       (4) The Secretary may waive or reduce the assessment \n     provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection if the person \n     liable for royalty payments under this section corrects the \n     underreporting before the date such person receives notice \n     from the Secretary that an underreporting may have occurred, \n     or before 90 days after the date of the enactment of this \n     section, whichever is later.\n       (5) The Secretary shall waive any portion of an assessment \n     under paragraph (2) of this subsection attributable to that \n     portion of the underreporting for which the person \n     responsible for paying the royalty demonstrates that--\n       (A) such person had written authorization from the \n     Secretary to report royalty on the value of the production on \n     basis on which it was reported;\n       (B) such person had substantial authority for reporting \n     royalty on the value of the production on the basis on which \n     it was reported;\n       (C) such person previously had notified the Secretary, in \n     such manner as the Secretary may by rule prescribe, of \n     relevant reasons or facts affecting the royalty treatment of \n     specific production which led to the underreporting; or\n       (D) such person meets any other exception which the \n     Secretary may, by rule, establish.\n       (6) All penalties collected under this subsection shall be \n     deposited in the Abandoned Mine Cleanup Fund established by \n     section 201(a).\n       (g) Delegation.--For the purposes of this section, the term \n     ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Interior acting \n     through the Director of the Minerals Management Service.\n       (h) Expanded Royalty Obligations.--Each person liable for \n     royalty payments under this section shall be jointly and \n     severally liable for royalty on all locatable minerals, \n     concentrates, or products derived therefrom lost or wasted \n     from a mining claim located under the general mining laws and \n     maintained in compliance with this Act when such loss or \n     waste is due to negligence on the part of any person or due \n     to the failure to comply with any rule, regulation, or order \n     issued under this section.\n       (i) Gross Income From Mining Defined.--For the purposes of \n     this section, for any locatable mineral, the term ``gross \n     income from mining'' has the same meaning as the term ``gross \n     income'' in section 613(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986.\n       (j) Effective Date.--The royalty under this section shall \n     take effect with respect to the production of locatable \n     minerals after the enactment of this Act, but any royalty \n     payments attributable to production during the first 12 \n     calendar months after the enactment of this Act shall be \n     payable at the expiration of such 12-month period.\n       (k) Failure To Comply With Royalty Requirements.--Any \n     person who fails to comply with the requirements of this \n     section or any regulation or order issued to implement this \n     section shall be liable for a civil penalty under section 109 \n     of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act (30 U.S.C. \n     1719) to\n\n[[Page S2005]]\n\n     the same extent as if the claim located under the general \n     mining laws and maintained in compliance with this Act were a \n     lease under that Act.\n\n     SEC. 102.

A bill to facilitate foreign investment by permanently \nreauthorizing the EB-5 regional center program, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \nstrengthen and make permanent the Regional Center pilot program at the \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, USCIS. l am pleased that \nSenator Specter has joined me in this effort, and I commend him for his \nrecognition of this program's importance. The Regional Center program \nhas had tremendous success in creating American jobs and infusing \ninvestment capital into many economically challenged areas across the \ncountry, and I urge all Senators to join us in building upon this \nsuccess.\n  The Regional Center pilot program was created in 1993 by the \nDepartments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act. In 1993, I worked to reauthorize the \nprogram for an additional five years as part of the Basic Pilot Program \nExtension and Expansion Act. The Regional Center pilot program is set \nto expire in September of 2008. Should Congress fail to act before \nthen, millions of dollars in capital and thousands of potential \nAmerican jobs will be forfeited. The legislation I introduce today \nwould make this pilot program permanent, and would make other important \nchanges to strengthen its solid foundation.\n  The Regional Center program allows a regional governmental agency or \nprivate enterprise within a State to apply for designation as a \nRegional Center through USCIS. This designation allows the enterprise \nto recruit foreign investors to a discrete project or projects, and \nprovides USCIS with an additional layer of screening against \nimmigration fraud. The process for a foreign citizen to gain legal \npermanent residence through the Regional Center program is a rigorous \none. Prior to applying to invest in a Regional Center, a foreign \ninvestor must pledge a minimum of $500,000 and independently apply for \nan EB-5 visa through USCIS, which solely determines the potential \ninvestor's eligibility for a visa. If approved, the investor is given a \n2-year conditional green card. At the end of the conditional period and \nin order to continue legal residence in the United States, the investor \nmust demonstrate that his or her investment created a minimum of 10 \njobs within the Regional Center, and that his or her investment was \nfully obligated to the targeted project.\n  This program's continuation promises a bright future for job creation \nand capital investment in participating communities. The Regional \nCenter program has resulted in millions of dollars of direct investment \nand the creation of thousands of jobs in the U.S. Moreover, foreign \ninvestment serves to attract additional domestic private sector \ncapital, further increasing the program's beneficial economic effects. \nThere are 17 Regional Centers across the country--and several more with \npending applications--which manage investments in a diverse range of \nprojects from energy production to resort development. Making this \nsuccessful program permanent will provide significant economic benefits \nto participating States at no cost to the taxpayer.\n\n  My home State of Vermont has benefited tremendously from this \nprogram, with foreign investments committed to local projects ranging \nin the millions of dollars. As a result of these ongoing developments, \nmany new jobs are being created for Vermont's residents. For example, \ntwo of Vermont's premier ski resorts are active participants in this \nprogram, and have been successful in attracting foreign investment to \nhelp make ambitious development projects a reality. In a rural State \nlike Vermont, which depends heavily on tourism and its natural \nresources, the Regional Center program has been instrumental in \nsupporting projects that take advantage of Vermont's natural beauty and \noutdoor recreation opportunities.\n  In addition to making the Regional Center program permanent, the bill \nalso makes a number of other improvements to ensure its efficiency and \nto accommodate expected expansion. The bill provides a premium \nprocessing option for potential investors, allowing expedited \nprocessing for an additional fee to USCIS, as well as concurrent \nprocessing of a potential investor's application for designation as an \nimmigrant investor and his or her adjustment of status application to \nobtain\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\nconditional permanent residency. Finally, the bill creates a $2,500 fee \nfor those domestic entities applying for Regional Center status, and \ndirects USCIS to re-invest this additional revenue back into the \nRegional Center program to allow the agency to accommodate future \ngrowth in the program.\n  Because the pilot program is set to expire in 2008, potential \ninvestors are feeling a chill stemming from uncertainty about the \nRegional Center Program's future. Permanently authorizing this program \nwill create certainty and predictability for potential investors \ninterested in the numerous projects currently in development across the \ncountry. This non-controversial program has enjoyed broad bipartisan \nsupport, and I strongly believe that we would do well to increase \nAmerican job creation and capital investment by matching American \ningenuity with the desire of those who seek not only to invest in the \nU.S., but who seek to share in our country's promise as eventual \ncitizens.\n  In a time of severe economic turbulence, and in an era where \nAmericans are witnessing the outsourcing of too many good jobs \noverseas, this bill builds upon a proven record of success and \nencourages investment and job creation in the States and local \ncommunities of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2751\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak on the State \nForeign Investment Improvement Act, which I am cosponsoring with \nSenator Leahy. This bill will make permanent the Immigrant Investor \nPilot Program, an innovative and successful program which has been in \nexistence for 15 years. Under this program, State and local \ngovernments, and private entities, are able to apply to the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Service for ``regional center'' status \nwhich enables them to attract the job-creating dollars of immigrant \ninvestor visa holders.\n  The immigrant investor visa--known as the EB-5 visa--was created in \n1990 and grants lawful permanent residency to individuals willing to \ninvest at least $1 million in an enterprise that directly employs at \nleast 10 legal workers in the United States. In certain rural or high-\nunemployment areas, however, the dollar amount is reduced to at least \n$500,000, though the job-creation requirements remain the same.\n  In 1992, to stimulate interest in these immigrant investor visas, \nCongress created the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program. By investing in \nthe designated ``regional centers'' instead of creating their own \nenterprises or partnerships, immigrant investors can meet the job-\ncreation requirements of their visas more easily, since they need only \nshow the indirect creation of 10 jobs through a ``regional center.'' \nOtherwise, an immigrant investor would have to show that his or her \ninvestment directly created the jobs.\n  The Immigrant Investor Pilot Program has proven to be an attractive \noption for potential immigrant investors, being chosen by an estimated \n75 percent to 80 percent of all immigrant investors since its \ninception. Indeed, in my home state of Pennsylvania, the two regional \ncenters--one in western Pennsylvania and one in Philadelphia--have \ngenerated millions of dollars in foreign investment. However, this \nprogram is set to expire at the end of the 2008 fiscal year.\n  The Immigrant Investor Pilot Program has thus become a vital \ncomponent of the immigrant investor visa, a category of visa whose \nbenefits are difficult to overstate. The Government Accountability \nOffice estimates that immigrant investors were responsible for over $1 \nbillion in job-creating investments between 1992 and mid-2004. These \ninvestments have aided enterprises as diverse as the growth of dairy \nand meat-packing industries in South Dakota and improvements to the \nshipyard in Philadelphia. However, the most important contribution of \nthe immigrant investor visa has been the creation of jobs within the \nUnited States. And in this aim, the immigrant investor visa has been \nvery successful, creating jobs in the thousands.\n  In addition to preserving the current successful status quo of the \nImmigrant Investor Pilot Program by making it permanent, this bill \nmakes minor improvements to the immigrant investor visa application \nprocedure. It establishes an application fee for entities seeking \ndesignation as a ``regional center'' under the Pilot Program, and it \nprovides premium processing fees for immigrant investor applications. \nBoth of these fees will enable the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nService to devote more resources to adjudicating these applications \nrapidly. Finally, this bill allows for concurrent filing of the \nimmigrant investor petition and application for adjustment to lawful \npermanent resident, thereby providing for a shorter processing time for \n``regional center'' applicants.\n  Last November, the Wall Street Journal stated that the immigrant \ninvestor visa is ``pumping millions of dollars from foreign investors \ninto dilapidated inner cities and employment-starved rural areas across \nthe U.S.'' At a time when Congress is weighing how it will address \neconomic instability, it would be unwise to neglect such an \neconomically beneficial program. Accordingly, I am pleased to co-\nsponsor this piece of legislation with Senator Leahy and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n[[Page S2008]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2752.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate an inspiring \nyoung man, Brian McCarthy. Brian is a student at Liberty High School in \nHillsboro, Oregon, and was this year's third place finalist in the \nprestigious Intel Science Talent Search. He was selected from over 1600 \nstudents and is the recipient of a $50,000 scholarship. The Science \nTalent Search is lauded as the ``junior Nobel Prize'' and America's \noldest and most prestigious research competition for high school \nseniors.\n  Brian's award winning chemistry project focused on solar cells. \nDuring his lab work, Brian synthesized extremely thin and fragile films \nof plant-like materials found in nature. What he discovered is a \npolymer that could potentially act as a less expensive option to \ntoday's silicon-based solar cell technology.\n  It is no surprise that Brian is first in his class of 293. However, \nhis interests and abilities span a wide gamut, including being a member \nof the varsity track and field team, volunteering with the community \nemergency response team, and studying aviation history.\n  Brian and his peers from the Science Talent Search are an inspiration \nand give me hope for the future of our country. Congratulations to the \nMcCarthy family. I can only imagine what heights this young Oregonian \nwill reach.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Warner, and \n        Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S.J. Res. 29. A joint resolution expressing Congressional support for \nthe goals and ideals of National Health Care Decisions Day; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is not easy talking to a family member \nor loved one about what kind of medical care you'd want or not want at \nthe end of your life. Yet every day family members are making medical \ncare decisions for seriously ill people who cannot speak for \nthemselves. Most family members with relatives who had executed advance \ndirectives find comfort in knowing that the hard decisions they may \nneed to make about end-of-life care will reflect the wishes of the ill \nrelative. End-of-life planning is a gift to the people who are \nimportant to you and to yourself.\n  Americans are talking a lot more about the topic of advance \ndirectives than they used to and are also doing something about it by \npreparing written advance directives. Advance directives come in two \nmain forms. The first is a ``health care power of attorney'' in which \nsomeone is designated to be your voice in health decisions if you can \nnot speak for yourself. The second is a ``living will'' which states \nwhat types of medical care you would want or not want at the end of \nlife. Most married people have had a conversation with a husband or \nwife about end of life medical care and most people have spoken with \none or both older parents about the topic. Research has found that \npeople who have had to make decisions about medical care at the end of \nlife for others are more likely to make end of life plans for \nthemselves. They have learned how important it is to make a plan. \nCongress helped to get the advance directives conversation going with \nthe Patient Self-Determination Act. This law directed Medicare-\nparticipating health care facilities to engage patient and staff in a \ndiscussion of end of life wishes. Since 1990 when the Patient Self-\nDetermination Act was passed, the percentage of Americans who have made \na living will has more than doubled from 12 percent to 29 percent.\n  Yet more conversation is needed. The National Health Care Decisions \nDay will help promote that conversation. National Health Care Decisions \nDay will be a 50-state annual event to increase knowledge and awareness \nof the importance of advance directives for all Americans. At this \nyear's annual event on April 16, 2008, a coordinated series of \nactivities across the U.S. will encourage Americans to discuss their \nwishes for end-of-life care and then fill out documents that reflect \nthose wishes. The National Heath Care Decisions Day is supported by \nmany of our distinguished local, state, and national health care \norganizations.\n  This joint Senate-House resolution: supports the goals and ideals of \nNational Health Care Decisions Day and the importance of advance care \nplanning, encourages health care, civic, educational, religious and \nother organizations to encourage individuals to use advance directives, \nand asks all Americans, including members of Congress, to prepare \nadvance directives for themselves. The Senate resolution is cosponsored \nby Senators Enzi, Wicker, Warner, and Whitehouse. A companion House \nresolution will be introduced by Congressman Phil Gingrey, M.D. I \nencourage my congressional colleagues to support this resolution. I \nalso ask you to begin or continue the dialogue about end-of-life issues \nwith family members and to complete written advance directives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 29\n\n       Whereas National Health Care Decisions Day is designed to \n     raise public awareness of the need to plan ahead for health \n     care decisions related to end-of-life care and medical \n     decision-making whenever patients are unable to speak for \n     themselves and to encourage the specific use of advance \n     directives to communicate these important decisions;\n       Whereas the Patient Self-Determination Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395cc(f) et seq.) guarantees patients the right to \n     information about their rights under State law regarding \n     accepting or refusing medical treatment;\n       Whereas it is estimated that only a minority of Americans \n     have executed advance directives, including those who are \n     terminally ill or living with life-threatening or life-\n     limiting illnesses;\n       Whereas advance directives offer individuals the \n     opportunity to discuss with loved ones in advance of a health \n     care crisis and decide what measures would be appropriate for \n     them when it comes to end-of-life care;\n       Whereas, the preparation of an advance directive would \n     advise family members, health care providers, and other \n     persons as to how an individual would want to be treated with \n     respect to health care;\n       Whereas, to avoid any legal or medical confusion due to the \n     emotions involved in end-of-life decisions, it is in the best \n     interest of all Americans that each person over the age of 18 \n     communicate his or her wishes by creating an advance \n     directive;\n       Whereas the Conditions of Participation in Medicare and \n     Medicaid, section 489.102 of title 42, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     resolution), require all participating facilities to provide \n     information to patients and the public on the topic of \n     advance directives;\n       Whereas the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has \n     recognized that the use of advance directives is tied to \n     quality health care and has included discussions of advance \n     directives in the criteria of the Physician Quality Reporting \n     Initiative;\n       Whereas establishing National Health Care Decisions Day \n     will encourage health care facilities and professionals as \n     well as chaplains, attorneys, and others to participate in a \n     collective, nationwide effort to provide clear, concise, and \n     consistent information to the public about health care \n     decision-making, particularly advance directives; and\n       Whereas as a result of National Health Care Decisions Day, \n     recognized on April 16, 2008, more Americans will have \n     conversations about their health care decisions, more \n     Americans will execute advance directives to make their \n     wishes known, and fewer families and health care providers \n     will have to struggle with making difficult health care \n     decisions in the absence of guidance from the patient: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Health Care \n     Decisions Day;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of advance care planning \n     for all adult Americans;\n       (3) encourages each person in the United States who is over \n     the age of 18 to prepare an advance directive to assist his \n     or her loved ones, health care providers, and others as they \n     honor his or her wishes;\n       (4) calls upon all members of Congress to execute such \n     documents and discussions for themselves; and\n       (5) encourages health care, civic, educational, religious, \n     and for- and non-profit organizations to encourage \n     individuals to prepare advance directives to ensure that \n     their wishes and rights with respect to health care are \n     protected.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S2009-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2009]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 480--RECOGNIZING THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE \n AFRICAN CONTINENT AND WELCOMING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AFRICOM, AND FOR \n                             OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Warner, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Hatch, Mrs. Dole, \nand Mr. Chambliss) submitted the following resolution;

Res. 480\n\n       Whereas the United States provides nearly $9 billion in \n     assistance to Africa each year, with programs ranging from \n     providing humanitarian relief to strengthening health and \n     education systems, breaking down trade barriers and promoting \n     economic development, combating corruption and other illicit \n     activities, and promoting critical democratic, judicial, and \n     human rights reforms;\n       Whereas the United States also provides significant \n     resources to promote security on the African continent, \n     particularly through programs such as the Global Peace \n     Operations Initiative (GPOI), the African Contingency \n     Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) program, the \n     Trans-Sahara Counter-Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP), Anti-\n     Terrorism Assistance (ATA), International Military Education \n     and Training (IMET) and Enhanced International Military and \n     Training (E-IMET) programs, Foreign Military Financing (FMF), \n     Contributions to International Peacekeeping (CIPA), \n     International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement programs, \n     and Non-Proliferation Anti-terrorism, Demining, and related \n     programs;\n       Whereas United States military and security assistance \n     programs in Africa represent approximately 3 percent of the \n     United States' total $9 billion aid and development package \n     for Africa;\n       Whereas in 2003, the Armed Forces of the United States were \n     instrumental in helping to bring stability to war-torn \n     Liberia;\n       Whereas roughly 2,000 members of the United States Armed \n     Forces currently are stationed at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti \n     as part of the Combined Joint Task Force--Horn of Africa \n     (CJTF-HOA) to promote regional stability and prevent conflict \n     in the region;\n       Whereas the African continent faces unique development and \n     security challenges requiring unique United States policy \n     approaches;\n       Whereas development and prosperity in Africa are \n     inextricably linked to peace and stability;\n       Whereas the Department of Defense historically has divided \n     Africa among three separate combatant commands: the U.S. \n     European Command, the U.S. Central Command and the U.S. \n     Pacific Command;\n       Whereas in February 2007, the President announced his \n     decision to create a unified command for Africa, the U.S. \n     Africa Command, or ``AFRICOM'', to provide a more holistic \n     approach toward United States military relations, programs, \n     and activities on the continent under a single headquarters \n     staff;\n       Whereas the stated purpose of AFRICOM is to ``promote U.S. \n     National Security objectives by working with African states \n     and regional organizations to help strengthen stability and \n     security,'' while simultaneously streamlining United States \n     security assistance programs and eliminating bureaucratic \n     divisions;\n       Whereas pursuant to that objective, AFRICOM will seek to \n     ``[build] partnership capacities, [conduct] theater security \n     cooperation, [build] important counter-terrorism skills and, \n     as appropriate, [support] U.S. Government agencies in \n     implementing other programs that promote regional \n     stability'';\n       Whereas unlike other commands, AFRICOM's structure will \n     include a military commander and a civilian deputy, and is \n     expected to include civilian personnel from a variety of \n     Federal departments and agencies, including staff detailed \n     from the Department of State and the United States Agency for \n     International Development (USAID) to contribute to the \n     command's planning and to ensure that its activities are \n     ``compatible and integrated'' with other United States \n     Government efforts;\n       Whereas AFRICOM is expected to support, not shape, United \n     States foreign policy in Africa;\n       Whereas AFRICOM serves as an important acknowledgment of \n     the strategic importance of the African continent, as well as \n     an opportunity to help African nations and regional \n     institutions build a safe and secure environment in which \n     they can prosper;\n       Whereas communicating the purposes of AFRICOM to African \n     governments and citizens is an important challenge;\n       Whereas AFRICOM was formally established in Stuttgart, \n     Germany, on October 1, 2007;

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING UNITED STATES HIV \n                   TREATMENT PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) it has been over 25 years since AIDS was first \n     recognized as an epidemic in the United States;\n       (2) since we first recognized AIDS, it has become the \n     greatest public health challenge of the last two decades;\n       (3) globally there have been more than 22,000,000 AIDS \n     related deaths, 500,000 in the United States alone;\n       (4) today in America, there are 1,000,000 individuals \n     living with HIV/AIDS, according to the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention;\n       (5) more African Americans, women, and individuals in rural \n     areas (especially in the South) are infected and dying from \n     HIV than ever before;\n       (6) according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, African Americans account for more AIDS \n     diagnoses, individuals estimated to be living with AIDS, and \n     HIV-related deaths than any other racial or ethnic group in \n     the United States;\n       (7) the percentage of AIDS diagnoses occurring among \n     African Americans has risen from 25 percent in 1985 to \n     approximately 50 percent in 2004 according to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention;\n       (8) according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, the rate of AIDS diagnoses for black adults and \n     adolescents was 10 times the rate for whites and nearly 3 \n     times the rate for Hispanics;\n       (9) the rate of AIDS diagnoses for black men was 8 times \n     the rate for white men according to the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention;\n       (10) early in the epidemic, HIV infection and AIDS were \n     diagnosed for relatively few women;\n       (11) today, the HIV/AIDS epidemic represents a growing and \n     persistent health threat to women in the United States, \n     especially young women and women of color, according to the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;\n       (12) according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, women accounted for 27 percent of new AIDS cases \n     in 2004;\n       (13) of these women newly diagnosed with AIDS, 67 percent \n     were African Americans and 15 percent were Latin;\n       (14) the only diseases causing more deaths of women were \n     cancer and heart disease, according to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention;\n       (15) according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention study, women were slightly less likely than men to \n     receive prescriptions for the most effective treatments for \n     HIV infection;\n       (16) an estimated 4,128 women with AIDS died, representing \n     25 percent of individuals with AIDS who died in the United \n     States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention;\n       (17) according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, women with AIDS made up an increasing part of the \n     epidemic;\n       (18) in 1992, women accounted for an estimated 14 percent \n     of adults and adolescents living with AIDS in the United \n     States;\n       (19) by the end of 2005, the proportion described in \n     paragraph (18) had grown to 23 percent;\n       (20) women of color are particularly at risk for AIDS, \n     according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;\n       (21) data from the 2005 census show that together, black \n     and Hispanic women represent 24 percent of all United States \n     women with AIDS;\n       (22) however, black and Hispanic women accounted for 82 \n     percent of the estimated total of AIDS diagnoses for women in \n     2005;\n       (23) the rate of AIDS diagnoses for black women was nearly \n     23 times the rate for white women, according to the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention;\n       (24) the HIV epidemic is moving to the South, with seven of \n     the States with the 10 highest AIDS case rates now located in \n     the South;\n       (25) in the Government Accountability Office's analysis of \n     the Ryan White formulas, the Office determined that counting \n     HIV cases would mean that Southern grantees would generally \n     have received more funding;\n       (26) the Kaiser Family Foundation recently reported that \n     the number of AIDS cases in the United States rose by 1 \n     percent between 2000 and 2001 and 9 percent in the South, \n     while AIDS cases fell by 8 percent in the Northeast;\n       (27) while only 36 percent of the United States population \n     lives in the South, 40 percent of all people living with AIDS \n     and 46 percent of new AIDS cases live in the Southern region;\n       (28) according to the Health Resources and Services \n     Administration, 531,000 individuals each year receive at \n     least one medical, health, or related support service from a \n     Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program provider;\n       (29) in recognition of the changing face of AIDS in the \n     United States, after deliberation for more a year, the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the \n     Senate reported out a bill to revamp the funding formulas for \n     the domestic care program (Ryan White) on December 6, 2006, \n     by a unanimous vote;\n       (30) the Senate passed the Ryan White revised funding \n     formula changes by unanimous consent on December 6, 2006, and \n     in doing so, the Senate reaffirmed that Federal resources for \n     HIV/AIDS should go to where the epidemic is today and will be \n     tomorrow, not where it was a decade ago;\n       (31) the House of Representatives passed the Ryan White \n     revised funding changes on December 9, 2006, unanimously;\n       (32) the President reaffirmed his commitment to providing \n     care for those with HIV when he signed the newly revised \n     funding formulas to Ryan White on December 19, 2006;\n       (33) the Senate reaffirmed its commitment to the Ryan White \n     funding formulas with an amendment to the Departments of \n     Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 2008 (H.R. 3043, 110th Congress) \n     on October 23, 2007;\n       (34) the Ryan White amendment referred to in paragraph (33) \n     was accepted by the Senate by a roll call vote of 65-28; and\n       (35) that amendment stated that ``[n]otwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, no funds shall be made available \n     under this Act to modify the HIV/AIDS funding formulas under \n     title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate acknowledges that the face of HIV is \n     changing and that funding formulas for care programs should \n     recognize the changing demographics of the disease \n     domestically;\n       (2) the Senate supports the Ryan White program, authorized \n     under title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act, and

Mr. President, I rise for two purposes: one, to speak \nabout an amendment that will come up tomorrow dealing with the \nalternative minimum tax and, on a second point, to speak against an \namendment that will be offered tomorrow on the H-1B program. First, I \nwill discuss the amendments I intend to pursue on the budget \nresolution.\n  The first is similar to the amendment I offered in committee markup. \nUnfortunately, the committee did not adopt the amendment. The amendment \nis very straightforward. The amendment would exempt from the pay-go \nrequirements an extension of relief from the alternative minimum tax. I \nwant to explain the term pay-go. It means if you are going to offer \nsomething that has less income coming in from taxes, you have to offset \nit someplace else. Pay-go is a rule that applies to both taxes as well \nas expenditures. It is pay as you go.\n  I want to make sure this doesn't apply to the AMT because, quite \nfrankly, it is silly to talk about offsetting revenue from middle-class \nAmericans from whom it was never intended to be collected in the first \nplace. And the alternative minimum tax, if we don't do something about \nit, has that negative impact. As everyone knows, if we do\n\n[[Page S2030]]\n\nnot act this year, about 25 million families, most of them middle-\nincome families, will be faced with an alternative minimum tax increase \nof over $2,000 per family. The alternative minimum tax, which was meant \nto hit high-income people, filthy rich people, it now could happen that \nmiddle-income people would pay an increase in taxes of more than $2,000 \nper family. We cannot let that happen. It is a result no one in \nCongress can defend.\n  The alternative minimum tax was meant to apply, as I have said so \nmany times, to a small group of high-income taxpayers who use tax \npreferences, legal ways of not paying taxes. There is nothing illegal \nabout it.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee has wisely recognized the \nreality and the importance of shielding these 25 million families from \nthe unintended reach of the alternative minimum tax. To that end, then, \nhis budget resolution has revenue room, about $62 billion worth, for an \nAMT hold harmless for the current year. Unfortunately, though the \nbudget revenue baseline is adjusted for the AMT for this year, action \non an AMT patch faces pay-go points of order unless offset. So my \namendment would clear away the hurdle for this year as well as for \nfuture years.\n  My amendment would ensure that delivering relief from the AMT would \ntrump an obsession with a tax increase notion of pay as you go. It is \nas simple as that.\n  My second amendment deals with fundamental tax reform. Everyone knows \nour tax system could be improved. The alternative minimum tax monster I \njust referred to is only one of the major reasons we need to undertake \ntax reform. Senator Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, has been very \narticulate on that point. So this is a bipartisan statement as well as \na partisan statement. If we undertake fundamental tax reform on a \nrevenue-neutral basis under the current revenue baseline, we could be \nbacking into a major tax increase on virtually every taxpayer.\n  In 2011, the bipartisan tax relief bills of 2001 and 2003 expire or \nto use the terminology in Congress, they sunset. If we allow current \nlaw to continue--in other words, current law so that you have tax \nincreases automatically without a vote of Congress--the tax burden on \nthe American people as a group could be up to 10 percent higher than it \nis today. That would be well into the future after 2010, until Congress \nwould reduce taxes. We should not have a tax increase without a vote of \nCongress, No. 1. But also we should keep taxes where they are now \nbecause it has been so good to the economy. You should not have a tax \nincrease on the American people. That is what is going to happen if we \ndon't make changes between now and the end of 2010.\n  Tax reform should not be a stealthy method, then, to raise taxes on \nthe American people. When I say ``raise taxes on the American people,'' \nlet me repeat, the biggest tax increase in the history of the country \nis going to happen without even a vote of Congress. The amendment from \nmy friend from Montana, the chairman of the Finance Committee, with \nwhom I have the privilege of working closely, makes the point that \ncurrent law levels of taxation set to spring into effect in 2011 are \nintolerable on both sides of the aisle. My amendment seeks the same \nassurances, though in a complete manner, if we hopefully enter into a \nreal legislative effort on fundamental tax reform.\n  Those are my remarks in regard to two amendments that are going to be \nvoted upon tomorrow.\n  Tomorrow my friend, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Senator Gregg, is going to offer an amendment or maybe has \noffered the amendment already to expand the H-1B visa program. I have \nnothing against the H-1B visa program. In fact, I value it as a legal \nchannel for U.S. companies to bring in workers they need. That is under \nthe assumption that we don't have workers in the United States to fill \nthose slots. But I have to say, increasing the H-1B visa cap, which is \nthe proposal, if we do that without reform, will only hurt U.S. \ntaxpayers and American workers. The solution to increasing our global \nposition in science and technology is, obviously, from the ground up, \ninvesting in American workers. We must strengthen educational \nopportunities for our American students, particularly in the areas of \nmath and science. Such an investment will help reduce the trend in \nwhich 60 percent of the students in our U.S. STEM doctoral programs are \nforeign born.\n\n  According to recent statistics released by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, foreign outsourcers top the list of companies bringing \nforeign workers to the United States under the H-1B program. In fact, \nit is this overwhelming--6 of the top 10 visa recipients in 2007 are \nbased in the country of India. Senator Durbin and I made the same point \nabout the visa approvals during debate in the year 2006. We found that \nthe top 9 foreign-based companies in 2006 used nearly 20,000 of the \ntotal availability of H-1B visas, and there is a cap on the number of \nH-1B visas. It seems to me that that 20,000 is close to a third of all. \nThey are used by nine foreign-based companies. You would think, of the \nthousands and thousands of companies we have in America, that you would \nnot have H-1Bs clustered to such a great extent around nine companies \nand nine foreign-based companies.\n  We heard today that Microsoft, in testimony before the House of \nRepresentatives, wants an unlimited supply of H-1B visas. However, that \ncompany's visa approvals declined in 2007 from 2006. In 2006, Microsoft \nwas approved for 3,117 H-1B visas. In 2007, it dropped from third to \nfifth place and only approved 959 visas compared to over 3,000 visas \nthe year before.\n  This very day, as I have indicated, Bill Gates said that Microsoft \nwas ``unable to obtain H-1B visas for one-third of the highly qualified \nforeign-born job candidates that it wanted to hire.''\n  It makes me question, then, why visa approvals decreased very \ndramatically for Microsoft, from 3,000 in 2006, down to 900 plus in \n2007. I think the statistics are very clear. Thousands of visas are \ngoing to foreign-based companies, leaving U.S. companies such as \nMicrosoft scrambling for qualified workers. How can one explain the \nfact that most H-1B visas are going to companies based outside the \nUnited States? Do you think that increasing the cap, then, increasing \nthe cap we have in current law, would actually benefit Microsoft and \nother companies? Answering these questions should lead one to the \nconclusion that the H-1B visa program is not working as originally \nintended. We need reform, even in conjunction with increasing the \nnumbers.\n  I am not opposed to increasing the numbers if they need to be \nincreased. But it won't do any good if we don't have reform, and not \njust the so-called reform, then, of increasing the visa supply, as \nproposed by the high-tech industry. Reforms are needed so that U.S. \nbusinesses, both large and small, can find, recruit, and hire the \nworkers they need.\n  One of the major reforms needed to protect American workers is to \nrequire employers to make good-faith efforts to recruit U.S. citizens \nbefore hiring an H-1B visa holder. Only a small group of employers have \nto make this good-faith effort. We need to require all users of the \nvisa program to first recruit Americans for these highly skilled, high-\npaying jobs, or at least attempt to find if American workers are \navailable, because Americans should come first.\n  Another reform needed is to increase the investigative power of the \nDepartment of Labor over this program. The program is full of bad \nactors. Companies are using ruthless tactics to undermine the system \nand to pay lower salaries and benefits to foreign workers. Current law \nis handicapping Federal officials from rooting out more fraud. We need \nto give them the power to audit and the power to investigate abuse.\n  In addition to those two major reforms, we need to increase \ntransparency for U.S. taxpayers to view job openings that are filled by \nH-1B visa workers. We should require employers to better advertise job \nopenings so American workers have a chance at the jobs before they are \ntaken by foreign workers.\n\n  If we do not make changes in the H-1B program, foreign outsourcers \nwill continue to import thousands of foreign workers to the detriment \nof U.S. businesses and opportunities for American workers to be hired \nfirst.\n  So I want my colleagues to know I cannot support an increase in the \nvisa\n\n[[Page S2031]]\n\nsupply without reform--and I mean real reform or drastic reform--to the \nprogram. I have suggested some of those reforms. Like I said, raising \nthe H-1B cap without reforms will only hurt American companies and \nAmerican workers. American workers should come first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my concerns with \nthe fiscal year 2009 budget resolution. This is a budget that says tax \nrevenue will go up by $1.2 trillion. Most of this is going to come by \neliminating tax relief, commonly known as the Bush tax cuts.\n  Let me be clear: The people of Wyoming do not believe eliminating the \nPresident's tax cuts and dramatically increasing Federal spending is \nthe right prescription for our economy. I would go so far as to say \nthis budget does exactly the opposite of what is needed. This budget \nwill send the wrong signal to small investors. The budget will send the \nwrong signal to ranchers. This budget will send the wrong signal to \nfarmers. This budget will send the wrong signal to small business \nowners all across Wyoming.\n  This budget sends a message the Federal Government is going to take \nmore from them. It will take more from them at a time when they \nbelieve--rightly so--that they have already been hit too hard. In fact, \n43 million American families with children will pay an additional \n$2,300 out of their pockets each year if these tax cuts are eliminated. \nTwenty-three hundred dollars is not a small amount of money--not a \nsmall amount at all to the working families of Casper or Cheyenne or \nRock Springs or Cody or Sundance. Twenty-three hundred dollars goes a \nlong way in Wyoming, a long way toward paying a year's tuition at the \nUniversity of Wyoming. Eliminating the tax cuts would cost 27 million \nsmall business owners $4,100 a year. Now, that is money that could be \nused for Christmas bonuses or well-deserved raises.\n  In Wyoming, we believe the best way to achieve economic progress is \nto have the Government get out of the way. That is the spirit that \npowers Wyoming.\n  In Wyoming, there is a monument to President Abraham Lincoln. It is \non Route I-80, between Cheyenne and Laramie, and there is a plaque on \nthe monument. The plaque says: ``It is time to think anew and act \nanew.'' That is what I believe is needed to reform the way Washington \nworks.\n  In Wyoming, where I served as a State senator, we had a budget \nsession every 2 years. It is another area where Wyoming gets it right \nand Washington gets it wrong. In Wyoming, it works so well that the \nbudget session lasts only 20 days. The Wyoming way is a much better way \nto deal with government spending.\n  In Wyoming, we actually balance our budget every year. The Wyoming \nway would free up Congress to work on things such as making Washington \nwork better for our country. The Wyoming way would make Washington work \non finding solutions to problems, rather than always reaching into \npeople's wallets and pocketbooks.\n  It is time for Washington to get its house in order. This means \nextending the President's tax cuts. This is the way to actually bring \nin more revenue to the Treasury. To get Washington's fiscal house in \norder also means addressing spending on entitlements. This budget not \nonly fails to do that, it actually makes matters worse. This budget \nallows entitlement spending to grow by $488 billion over 5 years. This \nis leveraging our children's future, young men and women of America, \nsuch as the pages who work in this very room. We are leveraging this on \ntheir future. Now, I do not wish to stifle the progress of future \ngenerations, such as these fine individuals, because of the mistakes of \nthis Congress. Let us get Government out of the way so we can unlock \nthe American entrepreneurial spirit. It is that spirit that made this \ncountry an economic leader in the first place.\n  I would also like to take a few moments to discuss three amendments \nthat have been filed. Two amendments have been filed by me, and the \nthird is an amendment filed by Senator Mike Enzi, my colleague from \nWyoming, and it is an amendment which I have cosponsored.\n  My first amendment relates to the issue of Federal mandates. This \namendment would provide $50 million to help States comply with \nregulations of the Endangered Species Act. It is my hope these funds \ncould be distributed to the cities, the counties, to ranchers, to small \nbusiness owners, all who have to comply with the ever-increasing, \nunfunded Federal mandates of the Endangered Species Act. The offset is \nprovided through an across-the-board budget cut through function 920.\n  A vast array of species can be found in my home State of Wyoming. \nAmong these are the sage-grouse, the grizzly bear, the pygmy rabbit, \nthe Preble's meadow jumping mouse, the white and black tail prairie \ndogs, the black-footed ferret, and the Canadian grey wolf. Many of \nthese species are in the process of either being listed or delisted \nunder the Endangered Species Act. But we have found there is one \nresource Wyoming doesn't have enough of, and that is Federal funds to \nprotect, to manage, and to recover these species as is required by \nFederal law.\n  Trust me when I say the people of Wyoming love our State's natural \nheritage. We believe we are in the best position to manage and protect \nour resources without the redtape and the regulations of the Federal \nGovernment. But that is not the reality we and other States face today. \nThe Federal Government often, as a result of Federal lawsuits, is \nplacing even additional new mandates on the States. As long as they \nare, the Federal Government has an obligation to provide funds with \nthose mandates.\n  I am pleased my good friend, Senator Enzi, is cosponsoring this \namendment with me, and I urge its adoption.\n  My second amendment would provide funding for salt cedar and Russian \nolive removal along America's rivers, streams, and tributaries. These \ntwo plants are nonnative, invasive species that are destroying riparian \necosystems across vast areas of the West. As the arid West continues to \nstruggle with ongoing drought, salt cedar and Russian olive are \ninvading the land and they are replacing native species all along the \nWest's watershed. Entire ecosystems are being dramatically altered. \nSalt cedar and Russian olive drain valuable water flow from rivers and \nfrom streams. It is estimated that one Russian olive tree can use 500 \ngallons of water a day, while some estimates place water use by a \nmature salt cedar plant at more than 200 gallons a day.\n  The Presiding Officer knows that one of the West's most important \nnatural resources--water--is under attack. Removal of these species to \nprotect our water is a monumental undertaking but one we can no longer \nafford to avoid. Private landowners, local and State officials, as well \nas Federal agencies have an interest in addressing the problem. Recent \npilot projects to eliminate these species on watersheds in eastern \nWyoming and western Nebraska have been underway for a few years. \nImprovements in waterflow and the overall ecosystem and the quality of \nthose areas have been dramatic. Success, however, can only be achieved \nif all interests in the watershed participate in eliminating these \nspecies.\n\n  My amendment is simple. Congress has already authorized a program to \nfight this battle. My amendment would direct money within that program \nto improve the ecosystem and waterflow along the Platte River. Wyoming \nis under a Federal decree to provide more acre feet of water from the \nPlatte River to help wildlife in Nebraska. By removing these invasive \nspecies that capture so much water from the river, we can help \nalleviate this Federal obligation on Wyoming's residents.\n  Water is a precious resource. It is time we begin reclaiming our \nwatersheds from the invasion of nonnatural species. I would encourage \nall Members of this body to support the amendment.\n  Finally, I wish to discuss a Federal budget issue about which I am \ndeeply\n\n[[Page S2032]]\n\npassionate, as are all the people across the State of Wyoming. The \nFederal Government should not be picking the pockets of States to \nbalance the Federal budget. I am not talking about Federal commitments \nto spending programs; I am talking about a Federal commitment to share \nrevenue; specifically, revenue generated from mineral resource \ndevelopment.\n  The Presiding Officer is very familiar with this. He knows, as do I, \nthat States with Federal mineral extraction benefit from economic \ndevelopment. He also knows these benefits are not generated without \nsignificant impacts to local infrastructure and to public services. \nThese revenues pay for vital State and local government services. \nRevenue sharing has traditionally been a clear 50-50 division. It is a \ndivision between the States and the Federal Government. In fact, \ncurrent Federal law prohibits Federal administrative deductions.\n  Apparently, that prohibition is not enough. In the fiscal year 2008 \nomnibus bill, Congress included a 1-year formula change, reducing the \namount paid to the States and increasing the amount flowing to the \nFederal Treasury. The lost revenue for the States came at the expense \nof funding for local schools, roads, water systems, and other basic \nservices provided by the States.\n  I am pleased to join my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Mike Enzi, in \ncosponsoring his budget amendment that addresses this Federal grab. I \nurge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join me in this as a \nmatter of principle. I have listened to speeches on this floor all week \nadvocating for increases for one program or for another. Senator Enzi's \namendment simply recognizes that States--not Washington--are capable \nand are well suited to make spending decisions.\n  State legislatures can provide, if they want to, more for education, \nhighways, and law enforcement. But they cannot make these decisions if \nthe Federal Government continues to withhold the State's share of these \nrevenues.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Enzi's \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/03/12/senate-section/article/S2032-1", "month": "03", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:15 A.M.
