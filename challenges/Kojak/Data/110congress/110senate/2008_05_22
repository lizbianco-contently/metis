Mr. President, following leader time, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. 2642, the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. There will be 2 hours of debate prior \nto a series of up to four rollcall votes in relation to motions to \nconcur in House amendments.\n  It is my understanding the 2-hour time is equally divided between the \nparties. Is that true?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the direction of Senator Byrd, Senator \nMurray will allocate the time on this side. I would further tell all \nSenators, because of the procedural glitch we had with the farm bill, \nwe have not totally worked out what we are going to do on the farm bill \nyet. I had a conversation with the Speaker. I have spoken to both \nParliamentarians--the House and Senate Parliamentarians. I think what \nwe are going to do, as the House has done--I think at this time it is \nour intention to override the veto of the President. He vetoed 14 of \nthe 15 sections of the farm bill. Through a clerical error, section 3 \nwas left out. As a result of that, section 3 will be sent to us from \nthe House later today, having been passed, and we will see if we can \npass that here later today. But we have a good legal precedent going \nback to a case, I understand, in 1892, when something like this \nhappened before. It is totally constitutional to do what we are \nplanning to do. So no one should be concerned about that.\n  Also, after we finish the work on the supplemental, we are going to \ngo to, hopefully, the farm bill and the budget and complete all that.\n  As all Senators know, for a number of personal reasons, not the least \nof which is the wedding of Senator Dan Inouye on Saturday in Los \nAngeles, and his best man is Senator Stevens, they are not going to be \nhere tomorrow. So as a result of that and other things, we are going to \ndo our very best to complete work on what we have today, and we should \nbe able to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4709-8", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the \nsupplemental bill, and on our side, the Senator from Maryland, Ms. \nMikulski, will be our first speaker.\n  I yield her 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Good morning, Mr. President.\n  Today I take the floor as the chairperson of the Subcommittee on \nCommerce, Justice, and Science of the Appropriations Committee.\n  We bring to the Senate for its consideration an element within the \ndomestic spending that I urge my colleagues to support. It provides \ncritical funding to protect America from threats abroad and those \nthreats here at home and to invest in America's future. There are those \nthat meet compelling human needs right here in the United States of \nAmerica. They also deal with the incompetency of the Bush \nadministration to truly estimate the cost of the war.\n  Today I am asking for support because in protecting America this \nsubcommittee adds funds to the FBI. We add $313 million for the \nDepartment of Justice, for both the FBI and DEA and the work they need \nto do in Afghanistan and in Iraq.\n  Once again, we have underestimated greatly the cost of this war. But \nwe are not going to neglect our duty. This subcommittee provides $23 \nmillion to the Drug Enforcement Agency to fight narcoterrorism in \nAfghanistan, to fight the poppy trade that funds terrorism. Athough the \ncost was underestimated, we are going to make sure we are going to do \nour duty to put those DEA agents next to the Afghan leadership to fight \nthis narcoterrorism.\n  Then, at the same time, we are going to have FBI agents in the war \nzone gathering intelligence on terrorists, dealing with IEDs and some \nof the forensic issues there, and we have provided money for them to be \nable to do this. Once again, they underestimated what it would take \nbecause there is very important work the FBI needs to do so our \nmilitary is freed up in fighting the war. We fight the war against \nthose who are trying to kill us with IEDs.\n  But while we are doing that, and we are trying to keep Afghanistan \nand Iraq safe, we added to this bill money for people here at home. \nWhat we did was we added $50 million to the U.S. Marshals' funds to \ncatch fugitive sex offenders who threaten the safety of our children \nand our communities--$50 million more, which was authorized under the \nAdam Walsh legislation, the bill to be able to fund the Marshals \nService to go after those sexual offenders for we know who they are, we \nknow what they have done, and we know they are loose in our society. It \nis the Marshals Service that has both the authority and the know-how to \ndo that. If we want to make the streets safe abroad, I certainly want \nto protect the children of the United States of America against these \nsexual predators.\n  Then, we also added, at the request of over 55 Senators, on a \nbipartisan basis, $490 million for Byrne formula grants for State and \nlocal police. We know there is a spike in violent crime all over the \nUnited States of America. The best way to fight violent crime is to \nmake sure our local law enforcement has the tools they need to do their \njob. Therefore, we want the streets of Boston and Baltimore and \nTuscaloosa to be as safe as we are fighting to make the streets safe in \nAfghanistan.\n  We are also working to deal with disaster recovery. In some States \nthere are fishery disasters, such as in the gulf region, in New \nEngland, and the Pacific Northwest with its salmon constraints. We have \nadded money to deal with the fisheries disaster. We also added a \nparticular item for Byrne grants for the gulf region to address and \ndeal with violent crime.\n  We are trying to deal with the fact that our own American citizens \nare facing disasters that so adversely affect either public safety or \ntheir very livelihoods.\n  Then, last but not at all least, we clean up the administration's \nmess. The census is on the verge of a boondoggle. There has been a \ntechnical meltdown in their ability to do the census. The so-called \nhandheld devices that were going to be used to do the census in a new \nand data-driven way have not worked out. Who knows? The Secretary of \nCommerce is investigating it. But I am telling you now, it is going to \ncost $2 billion to fix it--$2 billion as in ``Barb,'' not $2 million as \nin ``Mikulski.'' So we are going to clean up the mess of the \nadministration. In this supplemental, we put a downpayment of $210 \nmillion so we meet our constitutional responsibility to do this. I \nregret that the incompetency--the failure to stand sentry on taking the \ncensus, when they had 10 years to get ready for it, is indeed \nfrustrating.\n  Then we come to another issue on prisons. Because of the inadequate \nbudget request from the President, we are facing a violent undercurrent \nin prisons and terrible understaffing. We add the money, though the \nadministration would not request it through its OMB. But all of the \npeople who work at Justice who deal with this say this is a dire \nemergency, not to protect the prison but to protect the prison workers \nfrom dealing with this.\n  Then, also, what we did add was money for science, particularly for \nthe space program, because when Columbia went down, they took the money \nfor return-to-flight from other agencies. This returns it so we can \nkeep our NASA on track.\n  That is what the CJS Subcommittee did, and I think we have done a \ngood job. We tried to act to meet the needs in fighting the global war \nagainst terrorism. We dealt with the incompetency of underestimating \nthe cost to these agencies because of the war. We are dealing with the \nincompetencies of either poor budget requests or the census boondoggle.\n  I think we have done a good job. I am asking my colleagues to support \nthis legislation because if you want to protect our streets--if we need \nto help our people with their own disasters, and meet our \nconstitutional responsibilities--you want to vote for my part from my \nsubcommittee.\n  The other part that is in this bill, which will come at a later time, \nis that for which in the full Appropriations markup I offered an \namendment to extend current law on something called H-2B. That is a \nseasonal guest worker program that has helped coastal States with being \nable to hire people, as well as the hospitality industry.\n\n  My amendment was a very simple amendment. All it did was extend \ncurrent law that expired September 30. There was no new law. We broke \nno new ground. We created no new legislative framework. We created no \nnew rights or privileges. It did three things. It lifted--it \nessentially gave a waiver on the cap of 66,000 people who currently \ncome in.\n  What does all this mean in plain English? It means we were doing \nthree things: first, protecting American borders; second, protecting \nAmerican jobs; and third, rewarding the people who go by the rules. We \nprotected American borders because we had a system that worked. People \ncame, they worked, they went back home. Second, it protected American \njobs because it was seasonal employment in industries that, in my \nState, particularly in the seafood industry, keeps businesses going \nthat have been around for over 100 years. Then it rewarded the good \nguys, those people who are American employers who want to go by the \nrules--did not want to hire illegal aliens. But now we are going to \npoke them in the eye. It also rewarded the Latinos who came from \nMexico--and I met with the madras down in my own State who often come \nfrom the same villages every year and return home.\n  Well, my amendment extended law. I know that my colleague--there will \nbe a colleague who will raise the point of order today, and my \namendment will\n\n[[Page S4711]]\n\ngo down because it is not germane. I just wish to say this: It might \nnot be germane, but it is relevant. Maybe it is not technically \ngermane, but it is relevant because we are doing legislation to deal \nwith the supplemental on compelling needs that our people face. That is \nwhy I want to get the sexual predators off the street.\n  I asked for 3 additional minutes. I am about to lose thousands of \njobs because of this point of order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am not going to speak long.\n  The handwriting is on the wall, but the handwriting essentially says \nthis: If you go by the rules, you are going to lose out.\n  The Senator has the right to offer his point of order, but I am just \ntelling my colleagues this: We are losing this battle on the seasonal \nguest worker program, not because of law but because of ideology, both \nfrom the extreme right and because of the left. So when my amendment \nfalls, it is not about Barbara Mikulski's amendment falling. When that \namendment falls, we will hear thousands of jobs falling where we \nactually had an immigration program that worked and rewarded people who \nwent by the rules. That is it.\n  So that is the way it is going to be today. I look forward to the \nvotes. I wish to congratulate the Senator for the way she has organized \nthis bill and Senator Byrd for the great job he did.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, but I am pretty worked up today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Maryland \nfor her passion on behalf of all Americans but particularly those whom \nshe represents in Maryland. She has done an amazing job, and I commend \nher for that. I hope all of our colleagues listened to her words about \nwhat is in this bill because it is extremely important.\n  This first amendment we will be voting on today--we are going to have \nsome pretty important decisions when we vote shortly because the bill \nwe are debating does more than provide billions of dollars to fund our \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. What this amendment does is provide \nmoney for emergencies right here at home in America, including funding \nto respond to natural disasters and our weakened economy.\n  Now, as we debate this bill, we are facing a choice: Will we support \nthe domestic funding to help keep our communities strong at home or are \nwe going to simply ignore their needs as we send billions of dollars to \nIraq and Afghanistan alone?\n  President Bush has made his position pretty clear. He said that the \nonly emergencies worth funding in this bill are the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. He said he is going to veto any legislation that includes \none penny over his request of $183.8 billion for the wars.\n  But people across this country are hurting. Workers are facing \nunemployment. Our veterans are having to fight their own Government for \nthe services they earned, and communities from Maine to New Hampshire \nto my home State of Washington are struggling to recover from \ndevastating storms.\n  The domestic funding in this amendment would keep jobs here at home, \nrepair badly damaged roads, care for our veterans, and help our rural \ncommunities. I think the President's veto threat shows exactly how out \nof touch he is with the needs of our American people.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, \nHousing and Urban Development, one of the provisions in this bill that \nI am most concerned about is highway and bridge reconstruction. Now, it \nis not that President Bush isn't concerned about highway construction. \nThis administration actually requested millions of dollars in emergency \nfunding for highway construction in this bill. The problem is, I tell \nmy colleagues, that President Bush's concern is for highways in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. In fact, those are the only requests for roads and \nbridge repairs by the President in this supplemental.\n  Meanwhile, the Federal Highway Administration is currently sitting on \na backlog of applications totaling over half a billion dollars for \nroads and bridges that have been destroyed by natural disasters right \nhere at home in America. They are still struggling in Louisiana to \nrebuild roads that were damaged during Hurricane Katrina and the heavy \nrains of 2006. Texas needs help to rebuild after Hurricane Rita and \nfloods over the last 2 years. Large sections of roads in Maine and New \nHampshire were destroyed in floods last spring. In Oregon and in my \nhome State of Washington, we are still fighting to recover from \ndevastating floods that were caused by storms of last December.\n  Let me give my colleagues an idea of what I am talking about. This \nphoto shows us roadwork that is being done in Afghanistan. Now, in this \nsupplemental appropriations bill, the President requested more than \n$725 million for construction, repair, and restoration of roads and \nbridges in Iraq and Afghanistan. The money the President is requesting \nincludes over $300 million for the Commander's Emergency Response \nProgram for road projects in Iraq and Afghanistan; $50 million for \nAfghanistan's Bamiyan-Dowshi Road, as well as another $275 million for \nother roads in Afghanistan. He is also asking for another $100 million \nin military construction projects for road projects in Bagram, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere. My concern is that the President wants to \nfund these roads overseas, and yet he is ignoring that 21 States right \nhere are waiting--waiting--for emergency help with roads and bridges \nthat are eligible for Federal aid--roads in Louisiana, Maine, \nMinnesota, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, and Washington.\n  Let's be clear. We are not talking just about fixing potholes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a table which displays all of the \nStates that are waiting for emergency relief printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             EMERGENCY RELIEF PROGRAM FUND REQUESTS, APRIL 30, 2008\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                      Formal          Pending      Subtotal  by\n                 State                            Event              requests        requests          State\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama...............................

Mr. President, in several of those 21 States that are \nwaiting for funds, officially declared natural disasters wiped-out \nroads and bridges, completely creating obvious safety hazards but also \ncutting off some of our rural communities and disrupting families and \ncommerce. Here is a picture that gives us an idea of the scope of the \nproblem we face in my home State alone. Sections of roads such as this \none in Gifford-Pinchot National Forest were completely destroyed in \nrecent floods.\n  If the Federal Government doesn't provide help, these States are \ngoing to have to either wait to fix these roads or pay for these \nemergency repairs by diverting money from their annual highway funds \nand delaying or cancelling critically needed projects. At a time when \nwe know our economy is slipping and gas prices are at an alltime high, \nour States can't afford to do this. A State such as Oklahoma would have \nto spend almost 7 percent of its entire annual highway program to help \nrepair roads that were destroyed during recently declared disasters.\n  Mr. President, 2007 was an unusually hard year for Oklahoma. The \nproblems that were caused by storms last year were compounded by more \nstorms this past April. As a result, the backlog of highway repairs now \nwaiting for the Federal aid emergency relief program totals $33.5 \nmillion. That money is contained in the amendment we will be voting on \nthis morning.\n  So, as I said, my home State of Washington was hit by devastating \nfloods last December. Communities from southwest Washington in Whatcom \nCounty on the Canadian border are struggling to recover, and they \ndesperately need and deserve help from our Federal Government.\n  The bottom line is that while I understand the problems that \ninadequate roads pose to our military and the people in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, we also have urgent needs right here at home for the same \nkinds of repairs, and we have a responsibility to address those \nemergencies. The longer we wait, the longer the list of roads waiting \nfor repairs becomes. And those damaged roads hold up our commerce, they \nkeep people from getting to work, and they keep goods from getting to \nmarket. That is going to continue to hurt our already strained economy.\n  Just yesterday, Governor Gregoire in my home State declared an \nemergency when a highway in Spokane was completely washed out in heavy \nrains and snowmelts. Our Transportation Department says those repairs \nwill cost $1 million, and it is going to take several days to reopen a \nsingle lane of that traffic.\n  When our citizens pay their taxes, they except their money will go to \nkeep the roads and bridges in their own communities safe and reliable. \nI think President Bush is profoundly out of touch if he believes our \ntaxpayers would rather spend their money on new roads overseas than on \ndamaged roads in their own communities.\n  So I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle pay close \nattention to what is in this emergency relief amendment and that they \nvote to take care of their own constituents at home while we continue \nto fund these wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, earlier this week I spoke about the need \nto act expeditiously to consider the supplemental appropriations bill \nto fund ongoing operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the global war on \nterrorism. I don't know that I could add any more persuasive reasons \nwhy we must approve the President's request for supplemental \nappropriations.\n  In a hearing earlier this week before our Appropriations \nsubcommittee, Secretary of Defense Gates testified that the military \npersonnel account that pays our soldiers and the operations and \nmaintenance accounts which fund readiness, training, and the salaries \nof civilian employees across the Defense Department will run dry over \nthe next few weeks. Secretary Gates can forestall this depletion of \nfunds for a short period of time, but if he does so, it will disrupt \nongoing programs that are critical to our operations in theater and to \nour national defense generally.\n  Delay in providing funds for our troops has already disrupted \noperations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Admiral Mullin, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee also about a recent visit he had with soldiers on the \nfront lines. Those soldiers told Admiral Mullin that they were unable \nto allocate additional funds from the Commander's Emergency Response \nProgram because essentially all the money had been allocated for the \nquarter. We are two-thirds of the way through the fiscal year, and yet \nCongress has provided less than one-third of the funds requested for \nthis emergency response program.\n  Secretary Gates characterizes this initiative as:\n\n       The single most effective program to enable commanders to \n     address local populations' needs and get potential insurgents \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan off the streets and into jobs.\n\n  I will not repeat my statement from earlier this week on the urgent \nneed to move this process forward, but it is clear that when Congress \nfinally began to act, it did so using convoluted procedures designed to \nshut out individual Members in the Senate and in the other body. Yet, \nthis morning, it remains highly uncertain whether an adequate and \nsignable supplemental funding bill will be sent to the President before \nMemorial Day. There are rumors--conversations--about a short-term, 1-\nmonth supplemental being drafted by the majority.\n  Mr. President, that is really not what we need. It is one thing to \nextend the aviation bill or the farm bill or other programs for short \nperiods of time while Congress completes its work on long-term \nlegislation, but to begin stringing out our military and our diplomatic \ncorps on a month-by-month\n\n[[Page S4713]]\n\nbasis during a period of military conflict is a dereliction of our \nduties.\n  I worry that the Congress is becoming an impediment to the efficiency \nand the capability of our Government, and to our Department of Defense \nin particular. We are not acting to protect the security of our troops \nwho are putting themselves in harm's way and embarking on dangerous \nmissions or providing for others whom we are trying to train to prepare \nto take over the responsibilities for national security. We need to get \ntogether now.\n  The time for dragging our feet is long past. We need to find a common \nground so that we can provide our men and women in the field with the \nnecessary resources and the support that is necessary to conduct \nsuccessfully the mission assigned to them by our United States \nGovernment. We need to do this without any further delay. I urge my \ncolleagues to do it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nsupplemental bill that was put together by many Members, actually, on \nboth sides of the aisle, who believe that, yes, we should expedite \nfunding for our troops in the field, but also there are emergencies \nright here at home, as eloquently described earlier this morning in the \nremarks of the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Washington \nState.\n  I would like to add some words to their arguments. First of all, I \nrealize there is an emergency and a war and conflict going on in Iraq \nand international incidents around the world that deserve the attention \nand support of this body. But there are also emergencies right here at \nhome and imminent and ongoing threats.\n  This chart basically says it all. It is a frightening chart to me, a \ndepressing chart, but it is reality. The reality is, since 1955 through \n2005, this is the track of hurricanes that have hit the United States. \nSome of these are category 1, some are category 2, but dozens of them \nare categories 4 and 5. This track is Hurricane Katrina in yellow and \nHurricane Rita in blue, which devastated large parts of Louisiana and \nMississippi, even going into Alabama and Texas--flooding thousands of \nhomes and killing 2,000 people plus along the gulf coast. The \npredictions are that these kinds of storms are going to get more \nfrequent and worse.\n  There is nothing we can do to prevent hurricanes. This is Mother \nNature. We have just seen it explode in China and in Burma. It is \nfrightening to a civilized society. We get in strong buildings like \nthis and think that nothing can hurt us; surely no water could reach us \nor wind destroy us. Then Mother Nature appears in a very violent way \nsometimes and reminds us how vulnerable we all are.\n  In the United States, we just don't cry about these things and wring \nour hands. We do something. We, the States, local and Federal \nGovernments appropriate funding to build the right kind of levees and \ndams, and we provide the right paradigm or framework for insurance \nbecause that is the way we protect ourselves. Hopefully, we have \ninfrastructure that will not fail when the pressure comes; and then \ninsurance, if it does come, to help people who have lost so much get \nback on their feet. That is all we can do. It would be good if we would \ndo that.\n  But if we vote against this bill today, we are not taking the \nnecessary steps to get that done. Again, this is a depressing chart to \nme. I don't like to see it, but I put this up in my office to remind \nmyself that this is not just about Katrina and Rita, which we will be \nmarking the anniversary of on August 29--3 years--and then September \n24, 3 years for Rita, two of the most destructive storms to hit the \nUnited States. I remind myself that New York is in danger, New Jersey \nis in danger, and South Carolina and North Carolina are in danger. And \nFlorida, in 2005, had the worst storm season of the century, according \nto the Senator from Florida.\n  Briefly, referring to this chart, this is the area that went \nunderwater in New Orleans, this region--New Orleans and Jefferson and \nSt. Bernard. Some say: Why don't you all just relocate? That would be a \nvery expensive proposition, and impossible, for any number of reasons. \nOne, about 1 million people live in the metropolitan area; two, the \nmouth of the Mississippi River is something that the people of \nMississippi and Louisiana most certainly think is an important asset to \nthe country--so important that Thomas Jefferson, when he was President, \nleveraged the entire Federal Treasury to purchase it. We put all of our \ndefenses along the river to defend it. You cannot close this river. The \npeople who work on the river and contribute to the assets of the \ncountry cannot go live in Arkansas or north Texas or north Mississippi. \nThey need to live close to the coast for all of the important energy \nthat comes.\n  The city is no longer underwater. The water is long gone, but the \ntears are still there and the pain is still there and the frightening \npart is still there because the start of the hurricane season is just \nright around the corner, June 1. We have reports in the paper today \nthat there is some leakage in the same canal that breached and \ndestroyed over 10,000 homes--or more, actually--in the Lakeview area, \nwhich is a solid middle-class area.\n  This is a picture from the Times-Picayune today. In this bill, there \nis about $7 billion for levees, to finish the construction of levees \nthat broke--Federal levees that should have held and didn't. We are in \na mad dash to get these levees and this infrastructure rebuilt \nstrongly, correctly, and safely so people can begin to rebuild this \ncity higher, yes, and stronger, yes. But no one living in the middle of \na city or urban area should have to go to bed at night and wonder when \nthey wake up if they will be in 8 feet of water or 12 feet.\n  This is the 17th Street Canal, and you have seen this many times in \npictures. That is what is in this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote \nyes on the supplemental.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I can only yield 30 more seconds. Other \nSenators wish to speak.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We have hurricane levees in this bill. We also have \nhousing vouchers. The risks have increased substantially in the region. \nAfter the storm, we lost 250,000 dwellings in Louisiana and thousands \nin Mississippi. We have a homeless population that has doubled. There \nare housing vouchers in the bill for the homeless, for the very low \nincome, and for the disabled. After storms like these, that population \nis gravely threatened.\n  I will come back later and finish my remarks. This is important to \nthe people of the gulf coast. I thank the Senator for the time allowed \nthis morning. I urge my colleagues, in supporting the war funding in \nIraq, please let's remember the emergency still going on at home.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining Republican time be allocated as follows: Senator Graham for \nup to 20 minutes to engage in a colloquy with Senators Burr, Kyl, and \nCornyn; Senator Vitter for 5 minutes; Senator Brownback for 5 minutes; \nand that the remainder of the time, if anything, be allocated by \nSenator McConnell, or his designee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Chair lays before the Senate the \nPresident's veto message on H.R. 2419, which the clerk will read, and \nwhich will be spread in full upon the Journal.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Veto message on H.R. 2419, a bill to provide for the \n     continuation of Agricultural programs through fiscal year \n     2012, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, so that there is no misunderstanding, I \nask unanimous consent that the veto message on H.R. 2419, the Food \nSecurity Act, be considered as having been read, that it be printed in \nthe Record, and spread in full upon the Journal, and held at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The President's message is as follows:\n\nTo the House of Representatives:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 2419, the ``Food, \nConservation, and Energy Act of 2008.''\n\n[[Page S4714]]\n\n  For a year and a half, I have consistently asked that the Congress \npass a good farm bill that I can sign. Regrettably, the Congress has \nfailed to do so. At a time of high food prices and record farm income, \nthis bill lacks program reform and fiscal discipline. It continues \nsubsidies for the wealthy and increases farm bill spending by more than \n$20 billion, while using budget gimmicks to hide much of the increase. \nIt is inconsistent with our objectives in international trade \nnegotiations, which include securing greater market access for American \nfarmers and ranchers. It would needlessly expand the size and scope of \ngovernment. Americans sent us to Washington to achieve results and be \ngood stewards of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars. This bill violates \nthat fundamental commitment.\n  In January 2007, my Administration put forward a fiscally responsible \nfarm bill proposal that would improve the safety net for farmers and \nmove current programs toward more market-oriented policies. The bill \nbefore me today fails to achieve these important goals.\n  At a time when net farm income is projected to increase by more than \n$28 billion in 1 year, the American taxpayer should not be forced to \nsubsidize that group of farmers who have adjusted gross incomes of up \nto $1.5 million. When commodity prices are at record highs, it is \nirresponsible to increase government subsidy rates for 15 crops, \nsubsidize additional crops, and provide payments that further distort \nmarkets. Instead of better targeting farm programs, this bill \neliminates the existing payment limit on marketing loan subsidies.\n  Now is also not the time to create a new uncapped revenue guarantee \nthat could cost billions of dollars more than advertised. This is on \ntop of a farm bill that is anticipated to cost more than $600 billion \nover 10 years. In addition, this bill would force many businesses to \nprepay their taxes in order to finance the additional spending.\n  This legislation is also filled with earmarks and other ill-\nconsidered provisions. Most notably, H.R. 2419 provides: $175 million \nto address water issues for desert lakes; $250 million for a 400,000-\nacre land purchase from a private owner; funding and authority for the \nnoncompetitive sale of National Forest land to a ski resort; and $382 \nmillion earmarked for a specific watershed. These earmarks, and the \nexpansion of Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements, have no \nplace in the farm bill. Rural and urban Americans alike are frustrated \nwith excessive government spending and the funneling of taxpayer funds \nfor pet projects. This bill will only add to that frustration.\n  The bill also contains a wide range of other objectionable \nprovisions, including one that restricts our ability to redirect food \naid dollars for emergency use at a time of great need globally. The \nbill does not include the requested authority to buy food in the \ndeveloping world to save lives. Additionally, provisions in the bill \nraise serious constitutional concerns. For all the reasons outlined \nabove, I must veto H.R. 2419, and I urge the Congress to extend current \nlaw for a year or more.\n  I veto this bill fully aware that it is rare for a stand-alone farm \nbill not to receive the President's signature, but my action today is \nnot without precedent. In 1956, President Eisenhower stood firmly on \nprinciple, citing high crop subsidies and too much government control \nof farm programs among the reasons for his veto. President Eisenhower \nwrote in his veto message, ``Bad as some provisions of this bill are, I \nwould have signed it if in total it could be interpreted as sound and \ngood for farmers and the nation.'' For similar reasons, I am vetoing \nthe bill before me today.\n                                                      George W.

Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, the Senate has a real opportunity today \nto do right by our newest veterans who have served us well in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  When our troops came home at the end of World War II, our Nation made \na choice to make college a reality for millions of them. Nearly 8 \nmillion veterans--half of all who served in that war--took advantage of \nthe Montgomery GI bill. They had their college education paid for. Our \ncountry made a decision to invest in our warriors' future as they \nreturned from the battlefield. As a result, the ``greatest generation'' \nproduced broad-based growth and prosperity.\n  Today, we are great at sending our troops off to war, but we are \ncoming up short in providing the benefits their service has earned. \nThat is shortsighted and wrong.\n  A very small percentage of Americans actually serve in our Armed \nForces, the military, on Active Duty, Reserves, and National Guard. It \ntotals less than 3 million people in a country of 300 million.\n  So far, 1.6 million troops have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tens \nof thousands more of our troops will rotate through in the coming \nmonths. These men and women and their families are the ones who have \nborne the sacrifice of 15-month deployments, multiple tours of combat \nzones, injuries, and the loss of far too many of their battle buddies.\n  It is right that the Senate give back to them by giving them a GI \nbill that meets today's needs. It is time to treat doing right by our \nveterans as a true cost of war. These folks all joined the service \nbecause they love their country, they want to serve, and they want to \nbe a part of all the great work our military does. It is hardly \nglamorous, but it is critical to our Nation.\n  A GI bill that provides our troops the full cost of a college \neducation is a vital recruiting tool, and it helps us give back to the \npeople who are serving our country.\n  Today, nearly one-third of all Active-Duty servicemembers who signed \nup for the GI bill never use the benefit. There are many good reasons, \nbut one of the main reasons is that the current GI bill doesn't provide \nenough benefit to meet the needs of today's veterans.\n  Madam President, today's GI bill is woefully inadequate. It only \nprovides about $9,000 in costs for an academic year of college. When \nyou factor in tuition, room, board, books, and other living expenses, \nthat is only about 70 percent of the actual cost of attending a \nuniversity such as the University of Montana. It is only a drop in the \nbucket for a private school.\n  The Webb amendment that we have before us today fully covers the cost \nof any instate public school's tuition and fees, and it creates a \nmatching program to help create incentive for private schools to do the \nright thing and pay for a veteran's education. It will stay this way \nfor a generation. This legislation is tied to the cost of public \neducation so the benefit to our veterans will keep pace with the annual \nrise in tuition and fees, which have averaged about 6 percent over the \nlast decade.\n\n  Another thing that makes this amendment so important is that for the \nfirst time it brings the National Guard and reservists more access to \nthe GI bill. Right now, few guardsmen and reservists can get the full \nbenefit. Given how much we have relied on the Guard in Iraq, I think \nthat is wrong.\n  Let me also say we know the vast majority of servicemen sign up for \nthe GI bill, but that has a cost. When you first receive a paycheck \nfrom the military, you have to decide whether to spend $100 a month for \nthe first year on buying into the GI bill benefit. That is a total cost \nof $1,200. Now, $100 may not seem much to some folks in Washington, DC, \nbut I guarantee you that to an airman just out of basic and on his or \nher first tour at a base such as Malmstrom Air Force Base, that $100 is \na big deal. The Webb GI bill gets rid of that fee, and it is about time \nwe did so.\n  Finally, I wish to address one of the complaints about the Webb bill. \nSome have said the Webb bill will hurt retention, especially in the \nmid-career officer corps. This is simply untrue. A commissioned officer \nwould have to serve 8 or 9 years before being fully eligible for the \nnew enhanced GI benefit. It is not the GI bill that causes mid-career \nfolks to leave the military. It is 15-month deployments, multiple \ntours, and stop-loss involuntary deployment extensions, the so-called \nback-door draft.\n\n[[Page S4715]]\n\n  So I hope we can get this done today. This bill will cost about $2 \nbillion a year, and that is a little less than we spend in Iraq in 1 \nweek.\n  Keep in mind that, over a lifetime, the average individual who goes \nto college earns more than $500,000 more than someone who does not. \nThis is the right thing to do for our troops, but it is also a good \ninvestment in our country's future, especially at a time when the \neconomy is sputtering, wages are stagnant, and jobs are being lost. So \nI call on this body to stand by our Nation's warriors and to pass a \n21st century GI bill. It is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I wish to be recognized for 6 minutes \nbecause we are going to split the time with my colleagues. Would the \nChair let me know when 5 minutes has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, three quick points.\n  The procedure being employed is bad for the country, it is bad for \nthe Senate, and my Republican colleague, Senator Cochran from \nMississippi, expressed himself very well. If we give in to this, pack \nand go home. We don't deserve to be here.\n  Now, I have a proposal, I say to my good friend, Senator Tester. I \nhave a proposal that does two things. It helps those who leave the \nmilitary get a better GI benefit. He is right; we need to increase the \nmoney we give to people who leave the service to go to college. But the \nWebb bill, unfortunately, according to CBO, hurts retention. The \nbenefits of $52, $53 billion are all driven to the people who would \nleave, and the consequence of that is we are going to hurt retention, \naccording to CBO, by 16 percent.\n  Our approach, Senators McCain, Burr, and many of us here, is to do \ntwo things: Increase the benefit for those who leave but entice people \nto stay and reward those who will make a career out of the military. \nThe backbone of the military, I say to Senator Tester, is the career \nNCOs, and we have a proposal that if they will stay in for 6 years, \nthey can transfer half their benefits to their family members, to their \nspouse or to their child. If they will stay to the 12-year point, they \ncan transfer 100 percent of their GI benefits to their spouse or their \nchild.\n  That would reward people for staying in and making a career. They can \nget their retirement pay and have money to send their kids to college. \nIt rewards people to stay in the military and make a career of the \nmilitary at a time we need a career force because we don't draft people \nanymore.\n  This is not World War II, this is not Vietnam, this is a global \nstruggle being fought by a few, and we need to do two things: Reward \nthose who serve and decide to go back into civilian life, and tell \nthose families and military members who will stay on for a career, God \nbless you, we are going to treat you differently than we have ever \ntreated you before. We are going to give you a benefit you have never \nhad before. You are not only going to be able to retire, but you are \ngoing to be able to send your kids to college without using a dime of \nyour retirement pay.\n  But under this procedure, we can't even talk about this. To my \nRepublican colleagues who denied me a chance to put up my idea, shame \non you. I have never done that to you all. Now, if there is some \nproject in this bill that means that much to you that you are going to \nthrow the rest of us over, we don't need to be here.\n  As to the war and the funding, Senator Reid said on April 20, 2007:\n\n       This war is lost. The surge has not accomplished anything, \n     as indicated by the extreme violence in Iraq yesterday.\n\n  April 20, 2007. April 13, 2007:\n\n       Reid said he plans to continue an aggressive path for early \n     withdrawal from Iraq and does not particularly care if the \n     Republicans are trying to paint that position as a lack of \n     support for U.S. forces. Why? Because we are going to pick up \n     Senate seats as a result of this war.\n\n  Schumer, April 25, 2007:\n\n       The war in Iraq is a lead weight attached to their ankles, \n     Schumer warned, predicting that congressional Democrats will \n     pick up additional Republican votes for Democratic \n     initiatives as the 2008 elections approach. We will break \n     them, because they are looking extinction in the eye, Schumer \n     declared, making no attempt to hide his glee.\n\n  Come down to the floor today and stand by those statements. It is not \nabout the Republicans winning or losing seats, it is about this Nation \nbeing able to be safer. It is about winning in Iraq, not being a \nstakeholder in our defeat. It has never been about the next election to \nme, it has been about standing behind moderate forces in Iraq that will \nfight al-Qaida. Well over a year later, we have evidence now from the \nsurge, with better security, that Muslims in Iraq have taken up arms, \nstood by us, and are giving al-Qaida a punishing blow. Reconciliation, \npolitical economic reconciliation in Iraq is beginning to bear fruit \nbecause of better security and Iranian desires to dominate that \ncountry, to kill Americans, and split Iraq. They are losing. We are \nkilling special groups from Iran by the droves.\n  So I hope this President, President Bush, will veto this bill, if \nthat is what it will take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Senator Webb said he is going to test President Bush's concerns for \nthe troops to see if he will sign the Webb bill. To President Bush: Do \nnot sign this bill. It will hurt retention.\n  We can all come together to help those who serve and leave the \nmilitary and give them a benefit better than they have today because \nthey deserve it, but we should be working together for the common good \nto retain a career force that is going to fight this war and the war of \nthe future.\n  The people who put the Webb bill together had no idea what they were \ndoing when it came to retention. They didn't even think about \nretention. Senator Obama said: Yes, if people leave, you will get some \nmore. The heart and soul of any military is that career NCO officer, \nand we need to retain them, tell them their service is valuable, and \nhelp them stay around. We need to help those who leave, but, for God's \nsake, reward those who stay.\n  So this is a defining moment for the Senate, for the Republicans, and \nfor this war. I can tell you that if we will leave the generals alone \nand support our troops, they will win this war.\n  To my Republican colleagues, if we will stand firm for a fair \nprocedure and a sensible solution to the veterans' problems, we will \nget rewarded in the next election, not punished. If we give in to this, \nwe don't deserve to be here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I also would request to be notified at the \nend of 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify.\n  Mr. BURR. To my colleagues: What we have today is a choice between \nsomething and nothing. I am not sure that is fair for our veterans. I \nam not sure it is fair for the American people. Procedurally, what the \nleadership has decided to do is to give us one choice. When you have \none choice, it is not a choice, it is a mandate. The choice they have \ngiven us today as Republicans, quite honestly, and as a Senate, is \neither support what they have prescribed to us or vote against it.\n  The President has already said: I am going to veto this bill because, \nfrom a policy standpoint, it does not embrace what is in the best long-\nterm interest of this country and of our security. I think the American \npeople understand that.\n  Procedurally, the only tool we have is to say we are not going to \nvote for it or we are going to stand with the President and uphold his \nveto and bring the majority back to the table to present a process that \nallows us to debate the differences between the two competing views. I \nbelieve it is worth it when we talk about the education of our \nveterans.\n  I believe there are parts of the Webb bill that are very well done, \nand there are parts of the Graham bill that are extremely beneficial to \nour soldiers. We will never get that opportunity unless enough people \nin this body are willing to stand up and say this process absolutely \nstinks and we are not going to stand for it.\n  The politics of it Senator Graham pointed out very well. There are \nsome who believe the politics of the next election trump whether this \nbill is right or whether the process is fair. I don't believe politics \nshould play a part\n\n[[Page S4716]]\n\nin this. I only wish those who have expressed such concern about this \neducation benefit would help me fix K-through-12 education, where last \nyear 70 percent of the high school students in this country graduated \non time, and 30 percent of our kids do not have the tools to be asked \nto interview for a job. But we are more passionate about making sure we \ndon't even create a choice on education for our veterans. They have no \nvoice in this. This dictates what their benefit is going to be in the \nfuture. I think we have a right to come down and debate the merits of \ntwo proposals but not under the structure we have been given today.\n  The politics of this have gotten ugly. This week an ad was run that \nshowed a veteran who had been injured in battle, a service-connected \ninjury, and it said unless you support the Webb bill, there is no \neducation benefit for this injured vet. Well, let me say today that is \na lie. It is factually challenged. Any servicemember who has a service-\nconnected injury has 100 percent coverage for their education benefit \ntoday without us doing one thing. It is called the Vocational \nRehabilitation Program within the Veterans Administration. It covers \ntheir tuition, public and private, Harvard or North Carolina at Chapel \nHill. It doesn't matter if it is a State or private school. It covers \ntheir room, their board, and their tuition. It will even pay for \nsomebody to work with them on their resume enhancements, on interview \ntechniques.\n  Every person with a service-connected disability is covered under \nvocational rehab. To suggest in an ad that they are left behind if the \nWebb bill is not passed is absolutely the most disingenuous thing I \nhave ever seen.\n  From a policy standpoint, do our veterans deserve the ability to \ndetermine whether the GI benefit they have qualified for is, in fact, \ntransferable to a child? Well, what we are saying today is no. No, you \ndon't have a right to do that. That is our benefit. We dictate in \nlegislation how you use it. We are not going to have a debate on \nwhether transferability, whether a servicemember who qualifies for an \neducation benefit should have the right. Their decision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BURR. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Should it be their decision to decide whether a spouse or family \nmember, who has sacrificed so much, is going to be the recipient of a \nbenefit or whether they are going to let it expire because they have \nthe education they need? Well, not having the debate, we are not going \nto have an option to sell to our colleagues, to sell to veterans, to \nsell to the American people why veterans deserve more than what the \nWebb bill offers. We have only valued it on dollars, not on benefit.\n  From a policy standpoint, this creates a tremendous inequity between \nStates because the benefit is actually determined by where a veteran \nactually chooses to go to school, not by where they live or where they \ncame from.\n  It is not equal for every veteran. Some will get more, some will get \nless, and the unintended consequences are that States will look at that \nsubsidized higher education today and say: Why should we subsidize it \nin the future, we get cheated when the Government pays us.\n  We know who will pay for that: All the kids who go to school. All the \nkids in the future who are not connected to the military, when they go \nin to make their tuition payment, are going to be the ones who pay the \nbrunt of this situation.\n  There is only one way to stop this, and that is to make sure we \nuphold the President's veto. We are not going to defeat the legislation \nto move forward, but we have to uphold the President's veto if, in \nfact, we want to bring this legislation back to the Senate floor, have \na real debate about the differences in the legislation, a real debate \nabout what is important to our veterans, a real debate on what affects \nretention, a real debate on what provides the security we need in this \ncountry in an all-volunteer Army.\n  I am convinced that our colleagues understand the importance \nprocedurally of making sure this comes back to the Senate in a fashion \nthat we can actually have a real debate about creating a choice between \nsomething and something versus the setup today, which is something and \nnothing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from North \nCarolina and the Senator from South Carolina for their leadership, but \nI also wish to congratulate Senator Webb, the Senator from Virginia. I \ndo believe that all of these Senators, and those of us who join them, \nare operating with the best of intentions, and that is how do we \nmodernize the GI bill that helped provide my father an education after \nhe left the Air Force after World War II? How do we modernize the GI \nbill and provide the maximum benefit we can but also make sure it \nprovides for benefits to military families by allowing for \ntransferability to spouses and children under some circumstances? And, \nI would think, fundamentally to our national security, how do we \npreserve and protect the All-Volunteer military force?\n  I know it is not his intention, but Senator Webb's bill actually \nwould encourage people not to reenlist by providing a perverse \nincentive to leave early in order to obtain the benefits they would \nreceive after 3 years of service. We need to make sure we encourage \ncontinuation of service, retention in the military in the best \ninterests of our All-Volunteer military force.\n  To me, it is ironic--I remember the Senator from Virginia had an \namendment where we would restrict the amount of time a servicemember \ncould be deployed and then provide for a minimum time they had to be \nback home before they could be deployed again. Again, it was a noble \naspiration that he had but, unfortunately, because our forces were \nspread too thin because we had allowed the end force, the end strength \nof our military to degrade over time, we had to, as a matter of our \nnational security and success in our current efforts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, ask these servicemembers to return to service without an \nadequate dwell time.\n  Perversely, I think the Senator's bill, by encouraging early exit \nfrom the military and hurting retention, according to the CBO, by some \n16-percent, would actually be at cross-purposes with the very proposal \nhe advanced earlier about allowing our military more time at home \nbecause it would reduce the number of people in our All-Volunteer \nmilitary and make it necessary that they be deployed more often and at \ngreater sacrifice.\n  I do believe we ought to reward those who continue to serve. We ought \nto reward the families by allowing transferability of the benefit upon \ncontinued service to spouses and children.\n  I can tell my colleagues, speaking to groups in Texas this last \nweekend, that one feature was something they very much appreciated. We \nought to do everything we can to strengthen and nurture our All-\nVolunteer military force and not to cause a 16-percent decline in \nretention rates.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Arizona on the floor. I yield \nto him for a question.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Texas will yield \nfor two questions I have.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I absolutely agree with the Senator from \nTexas that we have to get to a point where we can debate and vote on \nalternatives to assist our veterans. It is very distressing to me to \nhear there are TV ads running against the Senator from Texas and \nagainst my colleague from Arizona that call into question your \ncommitment and his commitment to the veterans of our country.\n  I am informed that one of the ads says:\n\n       Senator Cornyn is fighting tooth and nail against giving \n     adequate benefits to our troops and veterans, using it as a \n     wedge in partisan politics.\n\n  Is the Senator aware that language is being used in an ad against the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am aware of the ad. I have to say to the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, it is not the first time I have \nseen a phony ad on television. Of course, as he suggests, there is no \nbasis for it.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I may just say, the Senator from Texas, as \nyou just heard and as we all know, has been\n\n[[Page S4717]]\n\nspeaking on the floor of the Senate and in meetings we have been having \nabout this issue. He has been working very hard to find the best way to \nsupport our veterans with their educational benefits. I want that \ncrystal clear on the record.\n  Secondly, is the Senator aware that there is also an ad--my \nunderstanding is it says that ``Senator McCain, as the leader of the \nRepublican Party, must send a signal to his colleagues in the Senate \nthat now is not the time to play politics by forcing Senators to choose \nbetween his bill and the Webb-Hagel measure.''\n  It seems to me that statement is exactly right, that we should not be \nforced to choose between one or the other, but procedurally, the way \nthe bill comes before us, we have two choices: to vote for or against \nWebb; whereas if the President were to veto this bill, there is an \nopportunity to negotiate between the two different approaches, both of \nwhich have some merit, and get the best of all worlds.\n  Will the Senator from Texas comment about the process by which we \nmight actually get the best bill to assist our veterans with GI \neducational benefits?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is exactly right. \nWe need to have a fair debate and fair opportunity for a vote on these \ncompeting proposals, both of which I say, again, were borne out of the \nbest of intentions, and that is providing educational benefits for our \nmilitary servicemembers and their families.\n  But I have to add that calling into question Senator McCain's \ncommitment to veterans is laughable. It would be laughable if it wasn't \nso pathetic. No one serving in the Congress and few serving anywhere in \nthe United States have given more to support our military \nservicemembers, both active and retired, and, obviously, Senator McCain \nhimself is a war hero. To me, that is the kind of phony ad that I think \ncauses most people simply to dismiss it because there is just no basis \nfor it.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona that this procedure, whereby we \nare asked to vote on what started out to be an emergency funding bill \nto support our troops in harm's way in Afghanistan and Iraq, has now \nbeen larded up with a bunch of pet projects and other spending which \nhave nothing to do with supporting our troops in harm's way.\n  Congress, by engaging in this sort of conduct, is actually slowing \ndown delivery of the money to the troops who need it. We have been told \nby the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Veterans' \nAdministration--particularly the Secretary of Defense--that unless we \nact----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the colloquy has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Unless we act promptly, we are going to find out our \ntroops are not going to get their paychecks, and the services that are \navailable for our military families are going to be denied unless \nCongress acts. So why would we engage in this kind of delay?\n  Finally, the Graham-Burr bill does provide for the full cost of a 4-\nyear public school education in my State of Texas, which costs roughly \n$55,000 a year. This bill provides $58,000 a year worth of benefits and \nadded to items such as the Hazlewood Act, which allows tuition \nforgiveness, is a good benefit and one certainly deserved by the \nveterans who take advantage of their GI benefits in my home State, and \nI am proud to support them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing four Senators be our next speakers, rotating back and forth \nwith the other side: Senator Harkin for 4 minutes, Senator Kohl for 3 \nminutes, Senator Lincoln for 4 minutes, and Senator Clinton for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me state the obvious. The \nadministration's position, and what I hear from the other side of the \naisle, is a blank check for Iraq but not a dime for urgent domestic \npriorities. I can tell you that is a nonstarter with the American \npeople. We have more to do here internally for America than just \nborrowing money from China and sending it to Iraq.\n  I have worked to add to this bill urgently needed funding for an \narray of domestic needs, including health care, extended unemployment \ninsurance, and grants to fight crime in neighborhoods across America.\n  We have added emergency funding for the Byrne Grant Program to \nprovide critical funding to local law enforcement, and this funding is \ncrucial. Unless we restore the Byrne funding for fiscal year 2008, \nlocal law enforcement operations will be severely cut back--set back, \neven--if we provide the funds in 2009.\n  In my State of Iowa, over half of all the drug task forces will be \nforced to shut down unless these cuts are restored. Mr. President, 15 \nout of 21 regional drug task forces will be eliminated. That is just my \nState. Think about your State. It is going to devastate our law \nenforcement activities to fight drugs and crime. Law enforcement has \nmade it clear that once these programs are stopped, they are very hard \nto start again. It is hard to hire back trained and experienced law \nenforcement, hard to restart a wiretap, for example, to reconnect with \nlost witnesses. So the Byrne Grant Program is absolutely essential. But \nthere are other things we need to do.\n  There is $400 million for NIH in this bill. Much of that is for \ncancer research. We are making great strides, but in the last few \nyears, we have not kept up with medical inflation, and therefore the \namount of dollars we have for cancer research is being eroded.\n  We have $1 billion in this bill for LIHEAP, the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program. Mr. President, 15.5 million households are \nat least 30 days overdue in meeting their heating costs. We know how \nhigh costs are going, and now we have the summer months coming on, and \nin the South particularly, where they are going to need air-\nconditioning, we need this money for our low-income and our elderly \npeople.\n  We extend unemployment compensation by 13 weeks. We know the best \nstimulus of all is to help those who are unemployed, to get them the \nmoney, to get them through a rough patch so they can get back to work.\n  We also defer the implementation of seven Medicaid and Medicare \namendments. These are supported by the National Governors Association. \nIf we do not defer the implementation of these amendments, it is going \nto have a profoundly bad effect on health care in all of our States, \nand many of these regulations go into effect in June and July of this \nyear unless we put a stop to them.\n  These are all the provisions that are in the domestic package.\n  Again, we have $100 billion in this bill for Iraq and Afghanistan. \nWhat about America? What about using this bill to stimulate our \neconomy, extend assistance to the unemployed, fight crime, create jobs, \nand invest in medical research? It is not just Iraq and Afghanistan, it \nis also America. That is what this first domestic package is about, and \nI urge all Senators to vote to adopt this amendment to the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the pending amendment includes several \nprovisions within my jurisdiction as chairman of the Agriculture \nSubcommittee. Under the current unanimous consent agreement, these \nprovisions will be stripped from the bill if we fail to get 60 votes. \nSo I want my colleagues to know exactly what they are voting against if \nthey oppose this amendment.\n  The amendment includes $180 million to help American communities and \nfamilies in most States recover from recent natural disasters, \nincluding floods and tornadoes. Already this year, we witnessed a new \nrecord of tornado touchdowns, and flooding in the South, Midwest, \nPacific Northwest, and other parts of the country has been devastating. \nIf these funds are dropped from the bill, then we are asking for even \ngreater destruction when other storm events strike later this year.\n  The amendment also includes $275 million for the Food and Drug \nAdministration. I know this is important to the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, and I suspect it is also a priority for\n\n[[Page S4718]]\n\nother Members as well. The FDA needs to get its house in order on food \nand drug safety, and these funds are targeted to do just that. FDA \nCommissioner Von Eschenbach called me himself to stress the need for \nthis funding.\n  Finally, I wish to talk about food aid. For Pub. L. 480, this \namendment provides an additional $500 million over the President's \nrequest in the current fiscal year. These additional resources will \ncompensate for skyrocketing food and transportation costs that no one \nin the administration seems to be acknowledging.\n  I have written two letters in recent weeks, one to the President of \nthe United States and another to the Secretary of State, urging them to \nsupport these additional resources. I am still waiting for a response. \nI am troubled by their silence.\n  I ask unanimous consent these two letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 2008.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Although the food aid proposal you \n     unveiled last week is a welcome signal of our Nation's \n     commitment to hungry people across the globe, I feel obliged \n     to respectfully disagree with the specifics and make several \n     observations.\n       While your proposal calls for an additional $395 million \n     for Public Law 480 food assistance, none of this additional \n     assistance would become available until the beginning of the \n     next fiscal year. Sadly, I don't believe the crisis of \n     escalating food and transportation costs can be held at bay \n     that long and I fail to see how these additional resources \n     help anyone right now. I would welcome an explanation from \n     your administration.\n       As Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee with jurisdiction \n     over P.L. 480, I believe we need more timely action. I intend \n     to include enhanced P.L. 480 funding in the upcoming \n     supplemental appropriations bill so that additional resources \n     will be available for the current fiscal year. I realize this \n     may be at odds with your oft-stated pledge to veto any \n     supplemental which exceeds $108 billion. While I do not wish \n     to invite unnecessary controversy over such an important \n     topic. I think we have a moral obligation to act quickly. The \n     poorest of the poor across the globe cannot wait nearly half \n     a year for us to make good on this pledge.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Herb Kohl,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2008.\n     Hon. Condoleezza Rice,\n     U.S. Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Secretary: News that our government has reached \n     agreement with North Korea to provide food aid for the coming \n     year is a welcome development.\n       U.S. food aid is tremendously important in many corners of \n     the globe, and as chairman of the Senate Appropriations \n     Subcommittee with jurisdiction over PL-480 food assistance I \n     welcome the opportunity to collaborate in this area. Recent \n     food shortages and price increases have sparked unrest and \n     instability in a variety of places. I believe it's critical \n     that we maintain robust capacity to respond with U.S. food \n     aid.\n       With those thoughts in mind, I recently sent the attached \n     letter to the President regarding supplemental funding for \n     PL-480. As you know, the $770 million in food aid announced \n     with much fanfare earlier this month would do little to \n     provide immediate new resources for this key program. \n     Consequently, I insisted that the Supplemental Appropriations \n     Bill approved yesterday by the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee include an additional $500 million for PL-480 in \n     fiscal year 2008. I hope you will agree that this is a \n     necessary and appropriate course of action and that you will \n     encourage the Administration to endorse this revised funding \n     level.\n       Our moral obligation to ease human suffering and our \n     strategic interest in promoting stability could not be more \n     closely aligned where food aid is concerned. Please join me \n     in pushing for these additional resources and convey to the \n     President how his oft-stated threat to veto any supplemental \n     which exceeds his request runs counter to this worthy \n     objective.\n           Sincerely\n                                                        Herb Kohl,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Public Law 48 provides our Nation's response \nto hunger and malnutrition around the globe. By all accounts we are \nfacing a serious crisis in the months ahead. UNICEF estimates that 6 \nmillion Ethiopian children under the age of 5 are at risk of \nmalnutrition and that more than 120,000 have only about a month to \nlive--that is a chilling and disturbing thought; 120,000 children in \nEthiopia have only a month to live--and we know this tide is coming. \nOur moral responsibility, I believe, is clear.\n  There are other critical situations around the globe. The Secretary \nGeneral of the United Nations is in Burma today, surveying the crisis \nat hand. These additional resources are needed now and not just for \nplaces that are making headlines.\n  Each of the provisions I described--the flood recovery money, the \nfood and drug safety money, the food aid money--cover legitimate needs \nthat deserve to be addressed. They are not pork, they are not \nexcessive, they are rational responses to critical problems. If we fail \nto address them in this bill, we have done a disservice to the public.\n  I urge my colleagues to weigh these items carefully as they consider \ntheir support for the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nsupport as well to the supplemental appropriations bill before the \nSenate today. I commend Chairman Byrd and all the hard-working members \nof the Appropriations Committee for the good work they have done. It \nreflects many diverse needs at home and abroad at such a critical time \nin our Nation's history.\n  A proposal we will be voting on this morning--as we enter the sixth \nyear of this war in Iraq and Afghanistan--will provide the necessary \nresources for our brave troops to continue their task and finish the \njob. It also makes clear to the Iraqi people our support for this war \ncan no longer be open-ended. It sets practical and realistic goals for \nbeginning the phased deployment of U.S. troops in Iraq. When our troops \nbegin returning home and transition back to civilian life in their \ncommunities, we appropriately recognize their service in this bill by \nproviding benefits that better reflect the sacrifices they have made \nfor each one of us.\n  I appreciate the leadership exhibited by Senators Webb and Hagel, \nLautenberg and Warner, to keep the drumbeat alive and make this a \npriority. They have served our country honorably in past conflicts, and \nthey understand that educating our Nation's soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines is a cost of war.\n  One provision included in the GI bill will ensure that our citizen \nsoldiers, our National Guard and Reserve serving multiple deployments \nabroad, will accrue additional education benefits similar to those \nActive-Duty troops receive when they are deployed.\n  I have fought for this equity because guardsmen and reservists who \nserve multiple tours of duty do not receive one extra penny of \neducational benefits for their added service because benefits are based \non the single longest deployment. Passage of this bill will make that \nchange, and it will make it possible for those Guard and Reserve to \naccrue their educational benefits.\n  Another important piece of this bill is the domestic investment it \nmakes. There are dollars for VA polytrauma centers, rural schools, and \nlaw enforcement that need immediate attention. It also includes funding \nunder the Adam Walsh Act to track and prosecute sex offenders and those \nwho would do harm to our children.\n  In addition, this bill provides vital resources to help in recovery \nefforts from all kinds of disasters, from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \nand other natural disasters such as the string of tornadoes and \nflooding that hit my State earlier this year. Arkansas has suffered a \nseries of natural disasters this year unlike any I have seen in my \nlifetime. It has left 60 of our 75 counties in our State in need of \nFederal disaster assistance. Wave after wave of storms has rocked the \nresidents of Arkansas and left many of them shocked by the disaster. It \nstarted on February 5, when a band of tornadoes created a path of \ndestruction that stretched across 12 counties in Arkansas, killing 13 \npeople and injuring 133--the deadliest storm in nearly 10 years.\n  A little more than a month later, heavy storms hit Arkansas once \nagain, this time bringing rain, floods, and devastation that we have \nnot seen the likes of in 90 years. Thirty-five Arkansas counties were \ndeclared disaster areas from that storm.\n  Again, on April 3, another set of tornadoes hit central Arkansas. \nAlthough not as deadly as the February tornadoes, four twisters touched \ndown in a five-county area, including some of the\n\n[[Page S4719]]\n\ncounties suffering already from the floods. In addition, two more \nrounds of tornados hit the State earlier this month, bringing the total \nto 60 counties affected by these storms this year.\n  This is evidence of the disaster upon disaster that hit our State. As \nwe look at the opportunities we have before us with supplementals, this \nis what we use to address those kinds of devastation.\n  I ask my colleagues to please support this part of the bill. These \nresources will help our State and other States in many other \ninitiatives we truly need in our country.\n  The citizens of Arkansas and in our communities all across this \nNation have suffered much at the hands of Mother Nature. We are asking \nour colleagues to work with us to ensure that the things we could not \npredict, the things we could not prepare for, could be taken care of \nfor those brave Americans in our great State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nYork is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I certainly add my support to the very \npassionate appeal of my friend from Arkansas on behalf of that \nwonderful State. I remember very well all the difficult storms and \nfloods that too frequently impact Arkansas. I hope our colleagues will \nsupport the request for disaster assistance.\n  I rise to support strongly the GI bill that has been proposed in the \nSenate. I thank Senator Webb for his hard work on this bipartisan \nlegislation, as well as Senator Lautenberg, Senator Warner, and Senator \nHagel--each one a veteran who understands, deeply and personally, the \nimportance of honoring the service and sacrifice of our men and women \nin uniform.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. It is in the spirit \nof the original GI bill of rights to provide every American who has \nserved honorably since September 11, 2001, on Active Duty, with real \nhelp to go to college, to earn a degree, to end his or her military \nservice with a new beginning in civilian life.\n  After 36 months of Active-Duty service, a veteran's tuition and fees \nfor any in-State public college would be fully covered. We provide a \nstipend for books and supplies and a housing allowance based on actual \nhousing costs in the area. The benefit would apply fully to members of \nthe National Guard and Reserve who have served on Active Duty, and all \nActive-Duty servicemembers would be entitled to a portion of the \nbenefit based on the length of their Active-Duty service.\n  This is not a half measure or an empty gesture. This is a full and \nfair benefit to serve the men and women who serve us, and that is why \nthis is such a key vote.\n  We often hear wonderful rhetoric in this Chamber in support of our \ntroops and our veterans, but the real test is not the speeches we \ndeliver but whether we deliver on the speeches.\n  There are some who oppose this benefit, arguing that our men and \nwomen in uniform have not earned it, that it is too generous. I could \nnot disagree more strongly. This is a question of values and \npriorities. Each one of us will answer that question with our votes \ntoday. Let's strengthen our military by improving benefits, not \nrestricting them.\n  There are those opposing this important legislation who have offered \na half measure instead, designed to provide the administration with \npolitical cover instead of a benefit to our veterans. That is not \nleadership and it is not right. It is time we match our words with our \nactions. After all the speeches are done and the cameras are gone, what \nmatters is whether we act to support our troops and our veterans--\nbefore, during, and long after deployment.\n  I have proposed my own GI bill of rights to build on this legislation \nwith opportunities to secure a home mortgage, to start a small business \nor expand it with an affordable loan. As a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I am proud to support our troops and veterans, \nimproving health care for the National Guard and reservists, providing \nour servicemembers with the equipment and supplies they need to improve \ntreatment and care at our military and veterans hospitals.\n  The original GI bill was proposed 2\\1/2\\ years after the attack on \nPearl Harbor and, more than a year before the war ended, President \nRoosevelt signed that bill into law. Eight million veterans \nparticipated, improving their skills or education. At the peak in 1947, \nveterans accounted for nearly half of all college admissions. That is \nthe way we should be honoring the service of those who served us. This \nis our moment to provide each and every new veteran the opportunity to \nrealize their version of the American dream--the dream they have spent \ntheir lives trying to defend.\n  It is time we started acting as Americans again. We are all in this \ntogether. Let's send this legislation to the President and let's serve \nthe men and women who served us.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Senator from \nLouisiana has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of that portion \nof the emergency funding bill we will be voting on in about 35 minutes. \nThe reason I do so is because it is absolutely essential to deliver the \nhelp the President has committed--that the Nation has committed--to our \ncontinuing recovery in Louisiana.\n  First, let me begin by thanking all my colleagues and, perhaps even \nmore importantly, the American people, the American taxpayer, for an \nunprecedented outpouring of support for our recovery. True, Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita, a devastating one-two punch, were unprecedented \ndisasters, the biggest natural disasters--particularly when put \ntogether--that the country has ever faced. Still, it is very \nsignificant, very important to acknowledge that the American people \nhave also stepped to the plate and made an unprecedented response. The \npeople of Louisiana are deeply grateful.\n  The provisions in this bill are an essential part of that commitment \nand that response. Very soon after Hurricane Katrina, I sat in Jackson \nSquare, in the middle of the French Quarter, and heard the President \ndeliver his live address to the Nation from Jackson Square, right in \nfront of St. Louis Cathedral. It was a strange, eerie night because New \nOrleans had not yet recovered, in significant ways, from the storm. It \nwas only a few weeks since Hurricane Katrina. The whole French Quarter \nwas dark--no electricity. The only light, lighting a small portion of \nthat part of the world, was from light trucks sent in so the President \ncould speak from that historic point to the American people.\n  The President made a clear and a firm commitment to the full recovery \nof our region. I thanked him for that. I thank him for that today.\n  A big part of that commitment, of course, was strong, meaningful \nhurricane and flood protection for southeast Louisiana, building at a \nminimum a 100-year level of protection and building it quickly enough \nto sustain a storm that you might expect to see only once every 100 \nyears.\n  Again, I thank the President for that commitment. I thank the \nAmerican people for that commitment. But this funding in this bill \npassed now is absolutely essential to keep that commitment.\n  The Corps of Engineers itself says, if they do not have this money by \nOctober 1, they will slip from their schedule and that rebuilding and \nthat level of protection for southeast Louisiana will not be here in \nthe promised timeframe for the hurricane season of 2011. We cannot \nallow that schedule to slip. We cannot allow that solemn commitment of \nthe President not to be fulfilled in a real and a timely manner. That \nis why these funds in this emergency funding bill are so essential.\n  I know many of my friends who have fiscal concerns, as I do in \ngeneral have concerns about this bill. I would simply say with regard \nto these funds for our recovery, the President has asked for 95 percent \nof these moneys. The President himself has asked that those moneys be \nemergency spending. So this is hardly some Christmas tree on which we \nare trying to put ornaments for needs that are not there, that the \nPresident has not requested. At least 95 percent of this recovery \npackage is what the President himself has explicitly requested and even \nrequested be made emergency funding.\n  Let's follow through on that solemn commitment of the President, of \nthe Congress, of the American people, and let's be sure to do it in a \ntimely way so this enormously important protection\n\n[[Page S4720]]\n\nsystem is built in time for the hurricane season of 2011. This is very \nimportant to our recovery.\n  Besides levees and hurricane protection, it also addresses, in a \nsmall but important way, hospital needs, criminal justice needs, \nrelocating businesses from the MRGO so that hurricane highway can \nfinally be closed and we do not have a repeat of the devastation it \nhelped cause in eastern New Orleans and St. Bernard Parish. Again, this \nis our opportunity to do this this year in a timely way.\n\n  I respectfully again thank all of my colleagues for their support in \nour recovery and ask them to support this essential step in meeting the \nPresident's commitment, meeting these needs in a timely way.\n  I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher leadership and especially to Senator Byrd from West Virginia, the \nChairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  What we are considering on the floor of the Senate is not normal \nbusiness, this is emergency spending. President Bush has come to \nCongress and said: We have an emergency in Iraq. Set aside whatever you \nare doing and deal with this emergency. He said: I am not going to pay \nfor this. It is such an emergency, we are going to add it to the debt \nof America--not the first time President Bush has come to us and asked \nfor that. In the 5 years plus of this ongoing war, President Bush has \nnow asked us for $660 billion to be spent on the war in Iraq and the \nreconstruction of that country, $660 billion this administration says \nis such an emergency that we do not pay for it, we are going to spend \nit, put it on the debt of America and leave it to our kids and \ngrandchildren.\n  Well, some of us believe that, first, Iraq has a responsibility to \npay its own bills; this country has a surplus. Iraq, with all of its \noil, has a surplus of almost $30 billion. Why in the world are we \ntaking billions of dollars out of our Treasury, the hard-earned \npaychecks of American families at a moment when we are facing a \nrecession to send over and rebuild Iraq?\n  Why would not the Iraqis spend their own money from their own oil \nfirst? That is going to be part of this in a later amendment. But to \nput it in perspective, this President says no. He wants $180 billion \nfor the war in Iraq. We met in the Appropriations Committee, on a \nbipartisan basis. We said, as important as the war in Iraq may be to \nthe Bush administration, we believe a strong America begins at home.\n  If there is an emergency in Iraq, there is an emergency in America, \nand we need to address that emergency. No. 1, we include in this \namendment the Webb GI bill. You know what happens when a Nation goes to \nwar, when America invades a country as we did in Iraq? I can tell you. \nWe love our soldiers when we send them to war. Our hearts go out to \nthem and their families. We honor them while they are serving in that \nwar, some unfortunately losing their lives and some coming back \ninjured. We honor them with our speeches and all of our attention.\n  Senator Webb, with this GI bill asks the basic question: Will you \nhonor these soldiers when they come home? Will you make sure they have \nthe education they need to go on with their lives or will they join the \nranks of the unemployed after serving our country?\n  We know a GI bill works. It worked after World War II. Millions of \nreturning veterans, women and men, had an opportunity to go to college, \nand America enjoyed the greatest prosperity in our modern history \nbecause we put an investment in people in our future.\n  Jim Webb, with this bipartisan amendment, does exactly the same \nthing. I tell my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, do not \ntell me how much you love the soldiers if you will not stand behind \nthem when they come home. Do not tell me how much you honor our \nmilitary if you will not honor them and their families by giving them a \nchance at a quality education.\n  Voting ``no'' on this GI bill will be remembered across America not \nonly by soldiers but by many others. And that is not all. In this bill \nthere is $437 million for VA polytrauma centers. Do you know why we \nneed them? Because of traumatic brain injuries, post-traumatic stress \ndisorders, amputations. Our VA was not ready for this, all of these \nthousands of returning veterans with all of their problems. We put the \nmoney in to rebuild the VA so they can respond and help those veterans.\n  It also provides money for our communities and towns. In the city of \nChicago, which I am proud to represent, we have had a painful year of \ngang violence. Over 20 schoolchildren have been killed outside of \nChicago public schools by gang warfare.\n  We put money in this bill, $490 million, to give to police forces \naround America to fight the drug gangs, to fight the violence, to bring \npeace to our neighborhoods. I want peace in Baghdad, but I want peace \nin Chicago as well. We can spend some money on America if we can find \n$180 billion to spend in Iraq.\n  We also provide money for the Americans who are out of work. We are \nfacing a recession. We have millions of Americans who cannot find a \njob. This bill provides them an extension of unemployment insurance so \nthey can keep their families together. Is there a higher priority? Is \nthere a higher family value?\n  Let me also tell you, this bill provides assistance which is \nessential for health care for the poorest people in America; families \nwho are struggling to get by, many of them going to work with no health \ninsurance whatsoever. This bill provides assistance through Medicaid \nand Medicare. So if you believe a strong America begins at home, if you \nbelieve we have to honor our soldiers not only when they are at war but \nwhen they return, there is only one vote that can be cast. It is a \n``yes'' vote for the pending amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I speak today to lend my support to S. 22, \nthe Post 9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. S. 22 \nestablishes a new GI bill for our servicemembers who have served after \n9/11 and represents a comprehensive readjustment benefit for our brave \nmen and women, one they richly deserve, just as members of an earlier \ngeneration benefited from a GI bill following World War II, with a huge \ngain for our Nation from the more educated work force and leaders that \nresulted.\n  Senators Webb, Hagel, and Warner have talked at length about the \nvirtues, and need, for this landmark legislation. I want to speak today \non the impact on retention, the transferability provisions recently \nadded, and recruiting.\n  Much has been said about the effect on retention this legislation may \nhave. Some are afraid servicemembers may leave the military in \nunacceptable numbers in order to take advantage of these benefits.\n  Our need to focus on retention is clear. The military we have today \nis vastly different from the military we had in 1945. Since 1973 we \nhave enjoyed the benefits of the All-Volunteer Force. Rather than \ndrafting servicemembers, we encourage them to join. Over the past 35 \nyears of the All-Volunteer Force, we have seen military basic pay rise \nsignificantly. As an employer, the military departments are competing \nwith the private sector. This has led to a system of increasing \nbenefits, bonuses, special and incentive pays. In analyzing the impact \nof S. 22 on retention and recruiting costs, the CBO recently estimated \nthat the Department would have to spend $6.7 billion over the next 5 \nyears in additional retention bonuses to maintain retention at current \nlevels, to a large extent offset by a $5.6 billion savings in \nrecruitment bonuses and other recruitment costs.\n  The challenge then is to provide a comprehensive reform of \nreadjustment educational benefits while ensuring the continued \nviability of the All-Volunteer Force. These are and must be the twin \ngoals of any legislation. I think this legislation achieves these \ngoals.\n  This legislation retains and supplements retention incentives. In the \nfirst place, S. 22 retains the system of ``kickers'' in additional \nincentives that exists under the current GI bill. Under this program, \nthe services may provide up to an additional $950 per month of \neducational benefit to retain personnel with critical military skills \nor to retain any individual in a critical unit. For someone who \nqualifies for the full\n\n[[Page S4721]]\n\n36 months of educational benefits, that comes out to an additional \n$34,000, a significant retention incentive. Moreover, under this \nprogram, servicemembers who serve for at least 5 consecutive years on \nActive Duty may receive an additional $300 per month of educational \nbenefit. Over 36 months, that comes to over $10,000. That is also a \nsignificant retention incentive.\n  Our bill goes further in terms of retention. S. 22 has been amended \nto add a pilot program to provide transferability of education \nbenefits. The CBO cost estimate I mentioned earlier did not consider \nthis additional retention tool.\n  I have long been a supporter of the transferability of GI bill \nbenefits. There is an old maxim in the military that while you recruit \nthe servicemember, you retain the family. These transferability \nprovisions provide additional incentive for servicemembers to stay on \nActive Duty by tying continued service to varying levels of \ntransferability of the benefit to immediate family members, with 100 \npercent transferability coming after the servicemember has served 10 \nyears. Ten years is an important milestone. Once a service member hits \nmidcareer, the military retirement benefit, an extremely generous \nbenefit that is collectible immediately upon hitting 20 years of \nservice, becomes the strongest retention incentive. Getting \nservicemembers to midcareer is critical, and this transferability \nprovision will help do that.\n\n  Not only does transferability help to address the retention issue, it \nis the right thing to do. This war has been fought not just by our \nbrave servicemembers but by their families as well. Children may have \nmissed one or both parents for as much as 4 years out of the past 5 or \n6. That is a steep toll to pay. But by providing transferability, we \ncan help ensure a quality education for a spouse or child of a \nservicemember who has served so bravely since\n9/11. I believe it makes this bill stronger and addresses a concern \nthat has been raised against its provisions.\n  This legislation should actually incentivize recruiting. What better \npromise can we make to a recruit or his parents than the promise that \nwe will provide a more fully funded college education after fulfillment \nof the Active Duty commitment? Many in this body have raised the issue \nof recruiting--whether the Army in particular is granting too many \nwaivers in order to meet recruiting goals. This legislation will help \nsignificantly in this regard. You have to recruit people before you can \nretain them, and this legislation will help recruiting, I believe \nsignificantly, over time. Recruiting young men and women into the \nmilitary is more than half the battle; I have faith the services can \nretain the servicemembers they need, and Congress stands ready to \nprovide additional authority if necessary.\n  Regarding recruiting, I want to make another point that I do not \nbelieve has been raised, and that is on the subject of the \n``influencers.'' As many in this body know, support for military \nservice among the influencers, including coaches, teachers, and school \ncounselors, of the 17- and 18-year-olds who are our prime recruiting-\nage demographic, is critically important. Aside from the immediate \nbenefits of this legislation, my hope is that over time military \nservice becomes in the minds of these influencers synonymous with a \nfree, quality college education. After you serve us, we will serve you. \nWe will pay for your college education.\n  What better way to influence the influencers than this? As we know, \nthe costs of education continue to soar. In these difficult economic \ntimes, paying for a college education is at the top of many parents' \nlist of worries, a list that is already too long. We have read the \nstories of returning veterans having to work at night so that they can \nattend school during the day--even with their current GI bill benefits. \nI believe this bill will go a long way to increasing the support for \nmilitary service among that critical segment of society, the people who \ninfluence our youth's choice of career.\n  Finally, this readjustment benefit is an investment in our future as \na nation. Indeed, seven members of this body were educated on the post-\nWorld War II GI bill. As an editorial from last week's LA Times \nobserved:\n\n       College is the essential ticket to upward mobility, and who \n     more deserves a chance at that than the young men and women \n     who volunteered for military service in wartime? The post-\n     World War II experience shows that educating them is good \n     public policy. . . . First, it would boost military morale \n     and the quality of recruits--even though the military worries \n     that it could hurt retention. Second, the investment in \n     education is likely to pay for itself many times over as \n     veterans join the workforce at higher pay rates.\n\n  The brave men and women of our Armed Forces today will produce many \nfuture leaders of this Nation, and we owe them and their families this \ncomprehensive readjustment educational benefit.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this landmark legislation, and I urge my \nSenate colleagues to pass it expeditiously. We must do everything \npossible to assist our servicemembers, and their families, in the \ntransition back into civilian life, to provide the tools that allow \nthem to thrive and prosper in their postservice lives, and to become \nthe next generation of leaders that this Nation needs them to be.\n  I thank Senator Webb for his dogged pursuit of this legislation from \nhis very first days in office. It will help our servicemembers and \ntheir families for generations to come.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Virginia and I have \nworked together closely on his proposal for a new GI bill since he \nintroduced it in January 2007. I was delighted to be able to join him \nas a cosponsor of S. 22. I deeply appreciate his very strong--and very \npersonal--commitment to it.\n  Now it is time to give those young service members who are stepping \nforward voluntarily--putting themselves in harm's way--an opportunity \nfor quality educational assistance. We must make good on our promise of \nan education in return for serving honorably in our military. Mr. \nPresident, the time has come for a new GI bill for the 21st century. I \nbelieve that it should be promptly signed into law.\n  Sadly, despite the fact that it has passed this body by a veto-proof \nmajority, President Bush, who sent our troops into war and is again \nrequesting billions of dollars to pay for it, has threatened to veto \nthis measure.\n  Today, I extend my personal pledge to Senator Webb and all who \nsupport a revitalized GI bill. If bill is vetoed and Congress fails to \noverride the veto, I will bring Senator Webb's New GI bill before the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee during our markup next month and urge that \nthe Committee favorably report it to the Senate. It is time to give \nthose young service members, stepping forward voluntarily and putting \nthemselves in harm's way, an opportunity for quality educational \nassistance. We must make good on our promise of an education in return \nfor serving honorably in our military. I am committed to seeing this \nlegislation become law.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, Medicare and Medicaid cost the American \ntaxpayers a combined $770 billion in 2007; Medicare costing $432 \nbillion and Medicaid $338 billion. In 2007, the Federal Government's \nshare of Medicaid expenditures was $190 billion and is expected to be \n$402 billion by 2017.\n  Medicare expenditures alone account for 3.2 percent of GDP. Over the \nnext 75 years these expenditures are expected to explode to almost 11 \npercent of GDP. Every American household's share of Medicare's unfunded \nobligation is like a $320,000 IOU.\n  The Medicaid Program, because of the promise of a generous Federal \nmatch of State Medicaid dollars, has given States heavy incentive to \nincrease their State Medicaid spending. Medicaid spending now accounts \nfor 26.3 percent of state budgets, up from just 6.7 percent in 1970. In \nsome States, as much as half of all new revenues will go to Medicaid in \nthe coming years.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about bi-partisan commissions on \nentitlement reform come out of the Budget Committee, but the least that \nwe can do is to stop blatant fraud and abuse in the mean time. \nEliminating waste, fraud, and abuse is a baby step in addressing \nentitlements. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, has \nworked over the last 5 or so years to curb waste, fraud, and abuse. \nThey have done work on a State-specific basis and also by promulgating \ndetailed regulations so that States have the clarity they need. Over \nthe years, Medicaid has proven to be a program susceptible to fraud, \nwaste, and abuse. Many States have pushed the limits of what should be \nallowed to maximize the Federal dollars sent to them.\n\n[[Page S4722]]\n\n  The Government Accountability Office, GAO, put Medicaid on its ``high \nrisk'' report a few years back because of questionable financing and \nthe lack of accountability.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The GAO and other federal inspectors have copiously \n     documented these ``creative financing schemes'' going back to \n     the Clinton Administration. New York deposited its proceeds \n     in a Medicaid account, recycling federal dollars to decrease \n     its overall contribution. So did Michigan. States like \n     Wisconsin and Pennsylvania fattened their political \n     priorities. Oregon funded K-12 education during a budget \n     shortfall.\n\n  According to the Wall Street Journal:\n       The right word for this is fraud. A corporation caught in \n     this kind of self-dealing--faking payments to extract \n     billions, then laundering the money--would be indicted. In \n     fact, a new industry of contingency-fee consultants has \n     sprung up to help states find and exploit the ``ambiguities'' \n     in Medicaid's regulatory wasteland. All the feds can do is \n     notice loopholes when they get too expensive and close them, \n     whereupon the cycle starts over. No one really knows how much \n     the state grifters have already grabbed, though the \n     Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Administration \n     remedies would save $17.8 billion over five years and $42.2 \n     billion over 10. We realize this is considered a mere \n     gratuity in Washington, but Medicaid's money laundering is \n     further evidence that Congress isn't serious about spending \n     discipline.\n\n  Examples of fraud in the Medicaid Program are plentiful. One dentist \nbilled medicaid 991 procedures in a single day. According to the New \nYork Times, a former State investigator of Medicaid abuse estimated \nthat as much as 40 percent $18 billion of New York's Medicaid budget \nwas inappropriate. New York spent $300 million of its Medicaid money on \ntransportation.\n  In 2005, Congressional testimony showed that 34 States hired \ncontingency-fee consultants to game Federal Medicaid payments.\n  Medicaid regulations by CMS are efforts to provide clear guidance in \ncritical areas where there have been well-documented problems and \nresult from years of work on the part of CMS and myriad reports by the \nGAO and the Office of the Inspector General, OIG, at the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS.\n  When CMS doesn't know how a State is billing for a service and States \ndon't have clear guidance for how they should, neither Medicaid \nbeneficiaries nor the taxpayers are well served. The Medicaid \nregulations fix that problem.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, the regulations \nwould save the Medicaid Program $17.8 billion over 5 years and $42.2 \nbillion over 10 years by eliminating wasteful and fraudulent Federal \npayments to the program.\n  The Federal Government will spend $1.2 trillion over the next 5 years \non Medicaid, so the regulations save only about 1 percent of Federal \nspending on Medicaid. If Congress is afraid of taking on these very \nmodest changes to Medicaid, does it really have the will to take on the \nspecial interests that is necessary to truly address entitlement \nreform?\n  The very purpose of these regulations is to build accountability into \nthe Medicaid Program that is long overdue. The proposed delay is a \nbudgetary gimmick to avoid paying for the real costs of delaying the \nMedicaid regulations.\n  CBO estimates that delaying the rules until April 1, 2009 would cost \n$1.65 billion. However, if the rules were withdrawn or permanently \ndelayed--as it is likely they would be under the next administration--\nthe CBO estimates a 5-year year cost of $17.8 billion and a 10-year \ncost of $42.2 billion. Even if the regulations should be delayed, a war \nsupplemental is the wrong place to include Medicaid policy changes. The \nwar supplemental is given expedited consideration procedures because \nfunding our troops is an urgent matter. The Medicaid regulations have \nbeen considered for years, and Congress has already put one 6-month \ndelay on them. This isn't a new or urgent issue that justifies \ninclusion in a war supplemental.\n  If ensuring that America's safety net programs are adequately funded \nis such an important issue, it deserves the full debate and \nconsideration of the Senate. Burying a flat-out moratorium of Medicaid \nregulations on a war supplemental appropriations bill isn't being \nhonest with the American people. Congressional leaders put a moratorium \non the Medicaid regulations last year and are poised to do so again. If \nCongress truly opposes the regulations, then it should repeal them \ninstead of pretending to ``study them'' a little longer. However, \nCongress is avoiding that kind of honesty because it will cost ten \ntimes the amount of a moratorium.\n  Instead of blaming the Bush administration, Congress needs to decide \nfor itself how it will address waste, fraud, and abuse in the Medicaid \nProgram. The Bush Administration has taken its turn and taken a stand \nto protect the integrity of one of our largest entitlement programs. \nNow it is Congress's turn.\n  This is no longer about the Bush administration. This is now about \nCongress. Congress needs to decide whether or not it will ignore years \nof GAO and HHS OIG reports. Congress needs to decide whether it will \nlisten to their State Medicaid directors and Governors or whether it \nwill safeguard taxpayer dollars.\n  States have had their turn and demonstrated that they will take \nadvantage of loopholes, ambiguities, and lack of clarity. Congress is \nthe one ultimately responsible for these programs. Congress is elected \nto set policy and fund priorities.\n  By imposing another moratorium, Congress is failing to live up to its \nresponsibilities. Congress is running away from them. Congress has \nclosed its eyes and ears to the abuses that have been going on. By \nstopping the regulations from going into effect, Congress is simply \ngiving more sugar to a diabetic. It may feel good for a moment, but it \nis not good in the long run. Congress doesn't really need another year \nto deal with these issues. These abuses have been going on for a long \ntime. The GAO and the OIG have been issuing audits and reports on the \nabuses for years.\n\n  Problems with the regulations themselves warrant a conversation not a \nmoratorium. There have been very few substantive policy disagreements \nwith the administration's regulations. The Finance Committee hasn't \nengaged the administration on specific problems with the regulations. \nThere have been no hearings over the last 6-month delay. The only \n``hearing'' that has occurred is the parade of Governors and providers \npleading to not turn off the funding.\n  The rule to impose a cost limit on government providers--CMS-2258--is \ncommonsense and good government. The cost rule saves $9 billion over \nfive years and $22 billion over 10 years by ending creative State \nfinancing schemes. First, it requires that providers, like hospitals \nand nursing homes and physicians, receive and retain the total \ncomputable amount of their Medicaid payments for the services they \nprovided. Why would Congress object to that? It seems simple that if \nyou provided a service, you should get to keep the money.\n  During the 1990s, States figured out creative ways to pass off their \nobligations to providers. That was wrong and unfair. Each time Congress \nstopped one financing practice, a new financing scheme popped up.\n  In 1991, Congress cracked down on loopholes in provider taxes. States \nopened up new loopholes. In 1997, Congress cracked down on abuses in \nthe disproportionate share hospital, DSH, payments program. In 2000, it \ntried to stop the abuses in upper payment limits, though it failed to \nclose them completely.\n  In 2003, the Bush administration put new emphasis on ending these \nschemes through the State plan amendment review process. This strategy \nproved to be effective and many States ended their ``recycling'' \narrangements. But some States complained to Congress.\n  In July 2004, Senator Baucus wrote the Administrator of CMS:\n\n       As you know, and as I indicated to you in those \n     conversations, I feel strongly that any new CMS policy on \n     intergovernmental transfers (IGTs) must be implemented in a \n     manner that is transparent, that is applied equally to all \n     states, and that responsibly takes into account the \n     potentially serious financial consequences of eliminating a \n     source of state funding on which some states have a \n     longstanding reliance. Based on my understanding of current \n     law and practice, with respect to IGTs, and on my interest in \n     promoting public confidence in government decision-making \n     judgment that a rulemaking or legislative process is \n     warranted in these circumstances. Accordingly, I urge you to \n     develop rules or a legislative proposal as soon as possible \n     on this issue.\n\n\n[[Page S4723]]\n\n\n  The current chairman of the Finance Committee requested Medicaid \nregulations nearly 4 years ago. The administration has responded to \nthat request by promulgating regulations. As soon as the regulations \nleft the desk of the CMS Administrator, Congress blocked them from \ngoing into effect LAST year. What has Congress done since then in the \nway of hearings or conversations with CMS? Nothing. What is Congress \ndoing now? Trying to delay them again.\n  Chairman Baucus is right about treating States equally; Congress \nneeds to let CMS do so. It is ironic that hospitals are telling Members \nto stop the Medicaid rules. The policy of the cost rule is that \nproviders should get to keep the full amount of Medicaid reimbursement \npaid for the services they deliver. Why should hospitals or other types \nof providers be forced to send part of their payment for services back \nto the State or local government? It is not their responsibility to \nfund the State's share of the cost of Medicaid. That is the \nresponsibility of the State and local governments.\n  Another major part of the cost rule seeks to limit government \nproviders to cost. This has been a recommendation of GAO dating back to \n1994. Under this provision, government providers would receive 100 \npercent of their costs for delivering services to a Medicaid recipient. \nBut they would be limited to cost, they simply could not charge a \n``profit'' to the Federal taxpayers.\n\n  A government entity shouldn't bill the taxpayer for more than the \ncost of delivering a service. That is nothing more than Medicaid \nsubsidizing non-Medicaid activities. If State and local officials \ndecide not to fund a program, that doesn't mean the Federal taxpayer \nshould pick up the tab.\n  Congress may have heard pressure from their States about how the cost \nrule will ``shred the safety net.'' If Congress really cared about \nhospitals, shouldn't Congress be supporting the policy that they get \npaid in full? When this type of policy was put in place in California, \nrevenues to hospitals increased by 12 percent.\n  If Congress really cared about providers, there are other tax-relief \npolicies that would be helpful to them. Provider taxes on hospitals, \nnursing homes, and others totaled $12 billion in 2007.\n  The estimated savings for the cost rule for 2008 and part of 2009 is \nabout $770 million. If you accept the argument that all providers in \nthe entire country will ``lose'' $770 million if the cost rule goes \ninto effect, consider that the hospitals in New York alone paid $2 \nbillion in provider taxes. The hospitals in Illinois paid $747 million \nin provider taxes. If Congress really cared about them, what about a \nlittle tax relief instead?\n  The real story is that States are using creative ``provider taxes'' \nto forego paying their share of the Medicaid Program. A few years back, \nCongress gave a special deal to Illinois supposedly to support the Cook \nCounty Hospital system worth about $350 million per year. The hospital \nis forfeiting more than $300 million in order to generate supplemental \npayments back to the State for this.\n  If you add provider taxes and what Cook County Hospital is \nforfeiting, it totals a billion dollars per year impact on Hospitals in \nIllinois. Instead of addressing that blatant example of taxpayer money \nabuse, these rules are an easier target.\n  Senator Baucus is right that the States should be treated equally. \nThe Senate should instruct the Finance Committee to identify all of the \nspecial treatment situations and report legislation to get rid of them.\n  The school-based administrative costs and transportation rule--CMS-\n2287--ensures that Medicaid money goes for medical care--not school \nbuses. First, those individuals and groups who have been scaring \nparents of a child with a disability that this rule will end their \nchild's treatment need to hear the truth about what this rule does. \nSchools are required to provide such services and if a child is on \nMedicaid, Medicaid will continue to pay for medically necessary \nservices. This rule ensures that Medicaid pays only for medical and \nmedically necessary services. Medicaid administrative claiming among \nschools varies widely among States. There are many States that do not \nbill Medicaid for administrative activities at all. Much of the funding \nis concentrated in a small group of States.\n  Abuses in administrative claiming have been well documented. Comments \non the rule confirm that schools are simply using Medicaid as a source \nof revenue to support activities that are related to education, not \nhealth care.\n  Medicaid reimbursement has been used for a wide variety of unrelated \npurposes such as instructional materials and equipment or to fund staff \npositions. Schools use funds to attend workshops and purchase \neducational technology and materials, even to support after school \nactivities, arts and music programs.\n  There is no problem with those types of programs, but there is a \nproblem when Medicaid is paying for them. If citizens at the local \nlevel decline to raise their property taxes for education, that doesn't \nmean that Federal taxpayers should have to pick up the tab. If State \nlegislators increase funding for transportation rather than education, \nMedicaid shouldn't be the means of easing the impact of their decision.\n  Allowing schools access to open-ended funding of Medicaid with \nvirtually no accountability will erode the decision making process of \nevery school board, State legislature as well as the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  Another rule--(CMS-2279) would stop the use of Medicaid dollars--\nintended for low-income people--going to fund training for doctors.\n  There is no question that training the next generation of physicians \nin this country is important. However, it should be paid for out in the \nopen. There needs to be accountability as to where the dollars go and \nfor whom they are used.\n  Under Medicaid's graduate medical education, GME, funding, there is \nno obligation on the part of physicians who are trained with Medicaid \ndollars to serve Medicaid patients once the physicians graduate. In \ncontrast both the military and the public health service corps require \ntime commitments as repayments for help with medical school.\n  There is no authority in the Medicaid statute to pay for GME. It is \nnot there. Congress and CMS don't even know the exact fiscal impact of \nthis rule because states are not required to report expenditures as \nGME.\n  If Congress wants to fund a training program for doctors serving poor \npeople, it should be done out in the open with real program \naccountability.\n  I understand concerns that CMS shouldn't just abruptly end the \nMedicaid GME program without a transition plan in place, but at the \nsame time the Administration is right in questioning how this money is \nspent. If we are going to fund residency training, we should do it \nright and out in the open.\n  The Targeted Case Management--CMS-2237--rule targets scarce Medicaid \ndollars. In the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Congress appropriately \nacted to end state abuses. The rule promulgated by CMS is designed to \nbe person-centered, comprehensive, and demand accountability.\n  CMS has been accused of overstepping its authority because it is \napplying the criteria across the board however case management is \ndelivered. In other words, states cannot get around the rules by hiding \nunder administrative claiming rather than actual services. And that \napplies to home and community based service waivers as well as State \nplan amendments. So the complaint is really this--CMS did not leave any \nloopholes open.\n  There are generally three provisions that have drawn the most \ncomplaints about this rule. First, there is a complaint about charging \nMedicaid only for a single case manager. The message of this \nrequirement is simple and sensible--if you are the case manager for a \nperson with mental illness, you should be capable and qualified to deal \nwith all sorts of issues like housing and employment as well as health \ncare needs. Why should Medicaid pay for four or five different case \nmanagers? Case management by qualified professionals should lead to \nbetter outcomes for the individual and lower costs in the long run. If \none case manager is too few, then let the Finance Committee figure out \nif it should be two or three or four. We don't need a 1-year moratorium \nto figure that out. This provision does not take effect for another \nyear--without\n\n[[Page S4724]]\n\nthe moratorium--so there is no immediate impact on states. They have \nplenty of time to come into compliance.\n  The second complaint is based on another accountability provision--\nbilling in 15-minute increments. This will help ensure that rates are \nappropriately set and that there is an audit trail. If 15 minutes isn't \nappropriate, then we can change the time allotment. We don't need an \nall-out moratorium on the rule to figure that out.\n  The third common complaint is about limiting the period of time for \nwhich case managers can bill for transitioning an individual from an \ninstitution into the community. The rule provides that the transition \nperiod is the last 60 days of an institutional stay that is 180 days or \nlonger. If 60 days is too short, then let us have the Finance Committee \ntell us what the right number is.\n  The targeted case management rule was published December 4, 2007, \nnearly 6 months ago. That certainly is plenty of time for the committee \nto tell us how these three policies in this rule should be different. \nDelaying and delaying through a series of moratoriums only succeeds in \nthrowing taxpayer dollars out the window.\n  This rule is intended to fix another example of how States had \nincentives to transfer their obligations to the Medicaid Program's \nfunding stream. States used Medicaid case management to fund their \nfoster care systems, juvenile justice programs, and adult protective \nservices.\n  The State of Washington had used Medicaid to fund non-Medicaid \nactivities. The State legislature has now done the right thing and \nappropriated $17 million to replace the reduced Medicaid funding after \nthe TCM regulation was published. If the State legislators in \nWashington can live up to their obligations, why should we not expect \nthat of the other States?\n  Medicaid has become well known as the budget filler for States. If \nfunding was short, find someway to call it Medicaid and State costs \nwill be cut at least in half.\n  This is a dangerous path. If Medicaid keeps picking up the tab for \nschools or foster care or the correctional system, then we are simply \ninviting even larger raids on the Federal Treasury in the future.\n  A provision that will prevent health coverage for low-income children \ndoesn't belong in a bill to provide funding for American troops. Hidden \nin a bill intended to provide funding for our troops at war is an \nunrelated provision that would have the effect of denying health care \nto low-income children. The provision would impose a moratorium on a \nCMS directive which requires that States cover low- income children \nbefore expanding their State Children's Health Insurance Programs SCHIP \nto higher income levels. This commonsense initiative, implemented in an \nAugust 17 letter from CMS to State health officials, ensures that \nchildren's health resources are targeted towards those children and \nfamilies who need help the most. The result of the moratorium will be \nthat States will be able to ignore the needs of low-income children and \ninstead direct resources to families with higher incomes who are more \nlikely to have existing health insurance coverage.\n  SCHIP should focus on low-income children first. SCHIP was designed \nto cover low-income children between 100-200 percent FPL. Even though \nstudies have shown that a significant number of children below these \nincome levels remain uninsured, States have tried to expand coverage to \nhigher income levels without first taking steps to make sure that they \nhave covered as many low-income children as possible. Health coverage \nof low-income children must remain the number one goal of SCHIP.\n  The CMS August 17 letter implemented reasonable steps to ensure that \nStates focus on low-income children before expanding their program. The \nletter explains the steps that States must take to ensure that their \nSCHIP programs cover low-income children before expanding to higher \nincome levels. The letter only applies to those States that wish to \nexpand their SCHIP programs above 250 percent of the federal poverty \nlevel (FPL). CBO reported that fewer than 20 states offer coverage \nabove this income threshold. Additional, on May 7 CMS issued a letter \nclarifying the August 17 letter and specifying that current enrollees \nwould not be impacted and that the agency would work with States to \nshow they are meeting the requirements.\n  CBO showed that covering families at higher income levels is an \ninefficient use of taxpayer dollars. The CBO has repeatedly stated its \nviews that expanding SCHIP to families at higher income levels will \nresult in a ``crowd-out'' rate of up to 50 percent. That is, for every \n100 children who gain coverage as a result of SCHIP, there is a \ncorresponding reduction in private coverage of up to 50 children. The \nCBO estimates that 77 percent of children living in families with \nincomes between 200 and 300 percent of the FPL have private coverage, \nas do 89 percent of children in families with incomes between 300 and \n400 percent of FPL.\n  It is wrong to take away seniors' choices in hospitals, and it is \nwrong to do that on a war supplemental so it can't be debated out in \nthe open. Americans enjoy the highest per capita GDP among large \nnations mainly because we have the highest rate of productivity gains. \nThe hospital sector sorely needs productivity-enhancing innovations \nlike specialty hospitals.\n  U.S. health care costs are the world's highest at 16 percent of GDP, \ncreating major problems for Americans and their employers. For example, \nGeneral Motors' financial woes are exacerbated by $1,500 of health care \ncosts per car, which exceeds their cost of steel.\n  Hospitals are the largest component of our health care costs, \naccounting for over one-third of our $2.2 trillion health care system. \nThey are also the major reason for the growth in costs. According to a \nrecent article in Forbes Magazine, 1 in 200 patients who spend a night \nor more in a hospital will die from medical error. The same article \ncontinues:\n\n       1 in 16 will pick up an infection. Deaths from preventable \n     hospital infections each year exceed 100,000, more than those \n     from AIDS, breast cancer and auto accidents combined.\n\n  Specialty hospitals have consistently offered high-quality health \ncare with high-quality outcomes. Risk-adjusted 30-day mortality rates \nwere significantly lower for specialty hospitals than for community \nhospitals, according to a 2006 Health Affairs article.\n  There are 200 specialty hospitals in the U.S. out of the 6,000 \nhospitals overall, often delivering better, safer services at lower \ncosts.\n  According to a recent University of Iowa study, Medicare patients who \nreceive hip or knee replacement at specialty orthopedic hospitals have \na 40 percent lower risk of complications after surgery--(bleeding, \ninfections, or death) compared to Medicare patients at general \nhospitals. A 2006 study funded by Medicare found that patients of all \ntypes are four times as likely to die in a full-service hospital after \northopedic surgery as they would after the same procedure in a \nspecialty hospital.\n  McBride Clinic in Oklahoma City is Oklahoma's best hospital for \noverall orthopedic services, according to the Tenth Annual HealthGrades \nHospital Quality in America Study released last month. McBride has 5-\nstar ratings in joint replacement, total knee replacement, hip fracture \nrepair, spine surgery, and back and neck surgery. The hospital received \nHealthGrades' 2008 Orthopedic Surgery Excellence Award, and is the only \nOklahoma hospital among the top five percent in the Nation for overall \northopedic services.\n  When it comes to specialization, the question is not whether to \nspecialize, but rather how to do it. Everyone agrees that the health \ncare system should provide focused, integrated care--especially for the \nvictims of chronic diseases and disability who account for 80 percent \nof costs. For example, Duke Medical Center tried an integrated, \nsupportive program for congestive heart failure. The approach resulted \nin better patient outcomes, increased patient compliance with their \ndoctors' recommendations, and a 32 percent drop in costs per patient. \nHospital admissions and lengths of stay dropped and visits to \ncardiologists increased nearly sixfold.\n  Some contend that physicians who invest in specialty hospitals have a \nconflict of interest that may lead to overutilization. But a recent \nstudy published in Health Affairs found that most physicians refer \npatients to specialty hospitals for reasons totally unrelated to \nprofits.\n  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, has also found no \nevidence that overall utilization rates in communities with specialty \nhospitals rise more rapidly than the\n\n[[Page S4725]]\n\nutilization rates in other communities. MedPAC and the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, have found no evidence that \nphysicians who have an ownership interest in a specialty hospital \ninappropriately refer patients to that hospital or have increased \nutilization.\n  The connection between corporate ownership and performance is a \nbulwark of our economy. Adam Smith argued in 1776:\n\n       The directors of . . . [joint-stock] companies, . . . being \n     the managers rather of other people's money than of their \n     own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over \n     it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in \n     a private copartnery frequently watch over their own. \n     Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail . . \n     .\n\n  One CEO of an orthopedic surgery practice said:\n\n       Orthopedists . . . in a hospital . . . work in the same \n     operating room [as] general surgery and obstetrics. \n     Orthopedics is nuts-and-bolts equipment intensive. It drives \n     them crazy to have a staff that's not familiar with a tray of \n     multi-size screws and nuts and bolts.\n\n  Some object to specialty hospitals by arguing that they only select \nthe most profitable cases in their area and leave the other hospitals \nwith less profitable services--burn units, trauma centers, et cetera. \nMedPAC has recommended changing the payments for all acute care \nhospitals to reduce the incentives in the overall inpatient payment \nsystem that some believe fueled the growth of specialty hospitals. \nBased on those MedPAC recommendations, CMS has just implemented major \nIn-patient Prospective Payment System reforms.\n  There is also an abundance of evidence that community hospitals are \nmaking record profits. A recent news article reported:\n\n       Profits for U.S. general acute-care hospitals hit a record \n     high of $35.2 billion in 2006--a one-year jump of more than \n     20%--on net revenue of $587.1 billion for a margin of 6%.\n\n  We should resist efforts to bind our health care system in regulatory \nstraightjackets. Both the hospitals' and economy's problems could be \nsolved if we allow the market, rather than insurance bureaucrats, to \nset prices.\n  If the Members of the Senate really believe that specialty hospitals \nare harmful, then there shouldn't be earmarks protecting the specialty \nhospitals in home States of certain members of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  According to a recent Congressional Quarterly, CQ, article, during \nthe committee process, four Democrats on the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee made language changes to the underlying ban on new growth of \nphysician-owned hospitals that happen to protect the specialty \nhospitals that are located in their home States.\n  According to CQ:\n\n       A spokesman for [one Appropriations Member] confirmed that \n     [that Member] had sought the changes, to protect a physician-\n     owned hospital in [their state]: Wenatchee Valley Medical \n     Center. A loosening of the grandfather clause will allow the \n     Wenatchee's physician-owners to maintain their 100 percent \n     stake in the hospital, as opposed to being forced to sell \n     part of it.\n\n  According to CQ, spokesmen for [two other Appropriations members] \nconfirmed their Senators' roles in getting the language changes.\n  One Senator's spokesman claimed:\n\n       We were concerned that forced divestiture would cripple the \n     marketplace.\n\n  In Michigan, the home State of another appropriator, physician-owned \nAurora BayCare Medical Center would benefit from the looser rules \npassed by the Appropriations Committee.\n  If Congress really believes specialty hospitals are harmful, why are \nthey not harmful in the home States of four appropriators?\n  The Congressional Budget Office needs to get its story straight on \nthe budgetary impact of killing specialty hospitals.\n  Congress has heard from the hospital association groups about the \npotential cost savings from eliminating the potential for new specialty \nhospitals. That argument is untenable when the Congressional Budget \nOffice can't even get their story right on the budget impact. If 3 \nyears ago, eliminating specialty hospitals barely saved anything how \ncan it save billions of dollars today?\n  During the drafting of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the Senate \nreconciliation bill contained a similar provision to curtail specialty \nhospitals. At that time, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, \nprojected less than minimal savings to the Medicare Program resulting \nfrom that provision.\n  Subsequently, CBO scored a similar provision in the Children's Health \nand Medicare Protection Act of 2007. This time they changed their story \nand projected Medicare savings of $700 million over 5 years and $2.9 \nbillion over 10 years, with the bulk of the projected savings \nattributed to the assumption that Medicare spends more for outpatient \nservices for patients treated in physician-owned hospitals.\n  In December of 2007, CBO changed its story again and attributed the \nsavings from restricting specialty hospitals to a presumed shift of \nservices to ambulatory surgical centers, admitting that the use of \nfewer outpatient services accounts for only a small portion of the \nestimated savings.\n  This bill has troops fighting to keep birth control prices low for \nIvy League students and profits high for Planned Parenthood clinics and \ndrug companies.\n  Congressional leaders are using the war supplemental appropriations \nbill to expand preferential governmental drug pricing policies to \nuniversity based clinics and more Planned Parenthood clinics than \ncurrently allowed under the Medicaid statute and regulations.\n  To have their products available in the Medicaid Program, drug \nmanufacturers must pay rebates to the Federal Government and States. \nThe rebates are calculated as the difference between the manufacturer's \naverage price and the ``best price''--lowest--at which their drugs are \nsold.\n  A tiny provision tucked away in a war supplemental will allow drug \nmanufacturers to avoid counting these deeply discounted drugs sold to \ncertain types of clinics when calculating how much they will owe the \nMedicaid Program in rebates, thereby protecting their profits. If the \nprovision becomes law, the clinics could receive cheaper drugs--like \nRU-486 and birth control--from manufacturers which they can sell to \ntheir customers at a higher price, thereby making a profit.\n  Manufacturers previously offered high volume clinics the discounts as \na marketing tool to attract long-term loyal customers so long as they \ncould avoid the Medicaid rebate. Taxpayers were in effect subsidizing \nthese clinics by forfeiting Medicaid rebates. In the Deficit Reduction \nAct of 2005, DRA, Congress limited the types of health care clinics \nthat can benefit from this special arrangement, providing the \npreferential treatment only to certain safety net clinics. Not \nconvinced by arguments that college campus health clinics are serving \n``vulnerable populations,'' the Bush administration refused to add them \nand additional Planned Parenthood clinics to the list of providers \ndesignated by Congress.\n  The Deficit Reduction Act didn't prevent drug manufacturers from \nselling their products at lower acquisition costs to any health clinic \nregardless of the DRA. They would not, however, be able to avoid \ncounting those discounts when paying States and the Federal Government \ntheir respective Medicaid rebates. Auditors in California found two \nPlanned Parenthoods had overbilled the Medicaid Program in excess of $5 \nmillion based on the difference between their customary fees and \nacquisition costs. This suggests that restoring these subsidies \nnationwide is likely worth hundreds of millions of dollars over just a \nfew years.\n  The current congressional leadership's usual approach towards drug \ncompanies is to get higher rebates from them. However, that's not the \ncase when it comes to forfeiting rebates for the Medicaid Program in \norder to make certain frat boys and sorority sisters get cheap drugs--\nincluding birth control--and the clinics that provide them get bigger \nprofits.\n  Instead of debating the merits of such a policy change in the open, \nthe leaders in Congress are using funding for our troops to slip this \nthrough.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of the \namendment to the supplemental that focuses on our domestic priorities, \nwhich is the first amendment we will be voting on this morning. I \nencourage my colleagues to vote in support of this important package.\n  While President Bush is fixated on trying to get his next check for \nthe Iraq war, we on the Senate Appropriations Committee under the \nleadership\n\n[[Page S4726]]\n\nof Chairman Byrd have brought to the floor important priorities for \nAmericans here at home.\n  As our economy continues to struggle, more and more Americans find \nthemselves without work and having trouble paying their bills. In \nApril, the unemployment rate in New Jersey was 5 percent. That is up \nfrom 4.8 percent in March of this year and 4.3 percent in April of \n2007. Not only are more people out of work, but they are staying \nunemployed for longer periods of time as they search for new jobs. \nThese unemployed Americans are facing the prospect of losing their \nhomes and fighting to afford the rising costs of food, gasoline, and \nhealth care. They need our help, which is why in this amendment we \nextend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks in all States and an \nadditional 13 weeks in States with the highest unemployment rates. This \nis the right thing to do, and we must do it now.\n  This amendment also includes a provision that I successfully offered \nin the Senate Appropriations Committee markup last week to delay a Bush \nadministration policy that threatens the health care of hundreds of \nthousands of children across the country, including 10,000 in New \nJersey. Last year, I supported and the Senate passed, an expansion of \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program that would have provided health \ninsurance for an additional 4 million children nationwide. President \nBush irresponsibly vetoed that bill twice--and then made matters worse \nby issuing a new policy that will actually take away health care from \nchildren who have it today. This is not only misguided--both the \nGovernment Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service \nfound that it violated Federal law. During these tough economic times, \nthe last thing we should be doing is taking away health care from our \nchildren. My provision in this amendment would delay this policy until \nApril 1, 2009.\n  As our veterans return home from overseas, we must show our gratitude \nfor their service by improving educational benefits to help them afford \nto go to college. Our veterans are finding that the current G.I. bill \nhas simply not kept up with the rising costs of college, and they are \nforced to either forego college entirely or face mounting debt to get a \ndegree. The amendment now on the floor includes a provision based on \nthe Webb-Hagel-Lautenberg-Warner legislation which closes the gap \nbetween the current G.I. bill and the costs of college by paying for \ntuition, books and housing at the most expensive public institution in \nthe veteran's State. This update of the G.I. bill deserves our strong \nsupport.\n  The domestic package before us also includes $10 million to conduct \noversight of American taxpayer dollars spent in Afghanistan. Our work \nin Afghanistan is critical to our national security and our fight \nagainst terrorism. But right now, we know too little about how billions \nof U.S. dollars in reconstruction and assistance funding are spent in \nAfghanistan and whether there is any waste, fraud, and abuse of these \nfunds. In January of this year, President Bush signed into law my \nlegislation to establish a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan \nReconstruction, SIGAR, to root out waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer \nmoney in Afghanistan. The SIGAR funding we would provide today would \nbring us one step closer to better oversight and accountability, and to \nthe beginning of SIGAR's work to uncover information about any \ncorruption and mismanagement of U.S. assistance to Afghanistan.\n  Finally, we must help our States and local communities recover from \nand prepare for natural disasters, including floods. This amendment \nincludes more than $8 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers to \naddress the damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and other \nrecent natural disasters. We have had our eyes opened to the massive \ndevastation that can occur when we neglect our Nation's flood control \ninfrastructure. In addition to gulf coast recovery, I am pleased that \nthis amendment will also provide funding for emergency infrastructure \nneeds in other areas, including my home State of New Jersey.\n  The Senate has an opportunity with this vote to honor our \nresponsibility to our returning veterans and all those who are \nstruggling in our country today. I implore my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle to join us in supporting this critical amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to address the impasse--the \ncompletely avoidable impasse--that we face with regard to the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations bill, which, if I'm not mistaken, is \nintended to provide much-needed funds and resources for our troops \nserving in Iraq and Afghanistan. You'll have to pardon my confusion \nbecause, looking over the substance of the bill in front of us, it is \ndifficult to determine exactly what purpose it is meant to serve.\n  There has been in this and in virtually every recent election year a \nsensitivity among those on the other side of the aisle whenever anyone \nquestions their support for our Nation's military and their commitment \nto national security. Indeed, it seems that any time these issues are \nmentioned, whether it is by the President, those of us in Congress, or \nby candidates running for office, Republicans are accused of \n``questioning their patriotism'' or engaging in the ``politics of \nfear.''\n  Certainly, I don't believe that we should question the patriotism of \nthose in the Senate majority. I believe that every one of them loves \ntheir country and that there is no one in this chamber who does not \nhonor and respect our nation's military. However, while the majority's \npatriotism should not be subject to question, their judgment on these \nissues is fair game.\n  Frankly, after the recent FISA debacle and now the absurd course \nbeing taken on this emergency supplemental, I believe that the \nDemocrats in Congress have given all of us reason to question their \njudgment.\n  As I stated, the purpose of this bill is to provide much-needed \nfunding for our troops in harms way. However, it appears that the \nDemocrats see this--not as an opportunity to support our military, but \nas a vehicle for unrelated, nonemergency funding for a number of their \npet programs. In this time when the American people are clamoring for \nmore fiscal discipline in Congress, the majority has decided to tack \nonto a war supplemental billions of dollars in domestic spending, none \nof which was requested by the President and all of which is unrelated \nto supporting the troops.\n  For example, the bill includes $1.2 billion for a science initiative, \n$1 billion for government-funded energy assistance, nearly half a \nbillion each for transportation projects and wildfires, and $200 \nmillion for the U.S. census--an event that has taken place every 10 \nyears since 1790. They have also added more than $60 billion in \nmandatory spending relating to unemployment insurance extensions--in a \ntime of very low unemployment, no less--and veterans education \nbenefits.\n  Now, I am sure that many of these are worthwhile endeavors deserving \nof the Senate's time and attention. However, they can and should all be \ndebated separately and should not be tied to funding for the troops.\n  Given these efforts to add such a large number of unrelated and \nnonemergency provisions, is it really unreasonable for the American \npeople to conclude that supporting the troops is not the majority's \nhighest priority?\n  Certainly, they'll want all of us to believe otherwise. In fact, I am \nfairly sure that there is a Democrat somewhere watching me give this \nspeech preparing a response that accuses me of practicing the \n``politics of fear.''\n  But when Members of the Senate majority flatly refuse to provide \nresources for the troops without unrelated spending, what other \nconclusion is there for the rest of us to draw?\n  It gets worse. I wish that the added funding was the worst thing \nabout this bill. Unfortunately, it is the least of our worries.\n  In addition to the nonemergency spending, the Democrats have once \nagain attempted to use a bill that funds our troops as an opportunity \nto play armchair quarterback with the conduct of the war.\n  The majority knows that the inclusion of this provision guarantees \nthat the President will veto the bill. One also has to assume that they \nknow that they do not have the votes to override such a veto. Yet, once \nagain, we are about to send to the President a bill that conditions our \nsupport for the troops on his agreement to supplant the judgment of his \nmilitary commanders with the political whims of the Senate majority.\n\n[[Page S4727]]\n\n  This comes at a time when even the most strident opponents of the war \nhave begun to acknowledge our military's successes on the ground in \nIraq. Even worse, it comes at a time when our men and women in uniform \nare in desperate need of additional funding.\n  As we have heard, on May 5, Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, indicated that it was essential that funds be \napproved before the Memorial Day recess, which begins in less than 2 \ndays. In his words, the military will ``stop paying soldiers on June 15 \n'' meaning that they have ``precious little flexibility'' with respect \nto the funds.\n  The majority leader, in his own words, believes that not finishing \nthe bill before the recess is ``no big deal.'' Indeed, he admits that \nsending the bill in its current form to the President guarantees that \nwe will go to recess without having funded the troops. Instead of \nheeding the warnings of our military leaders, the majority would \napparently rather subject emergency military funds to yet another \npartisan debate and even more election-year political wrangling.\n  I understand that many in the majority have come to oppose this war. \nI, for one, do not oppose an honest, straightforward debate about our \npolicies in Iraq and the war on terror. However, that is simply not \nwhat is going on here today. This is not a serious debate about our \nfuture in Iraq; it is a needless political maneuver aimed at appeasing \nthe more radical elements of the Democrats' political base.\n  Once again, I can't help but wonder about the majority party's \npriorities when its members purposefully and dangerously delay funding \nfor our troops in order to make a political statement. As I stated, I \nwill not question their patriotism, but I will continue to question \ntheir judgment. Given what has been displayed here, I believe the \nAmerican people will as well.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \nSenator Webb and Senator Hagel's new GI bill.\n  Mr. President, one of the smartest things Congress has ever done is \npass the GI bill for World War II veterans.\n  Several of the Members of the Senate--including me--would not be here \nif it were not for the GI bill.\n  I went to the Ohio State University on a Navy ROTC scholarship, and \nwhen I got out, I went to graduate school at the University of Delaware \non the GI bill.\n  As you know, the authors of this new veterans benefit proposal and \ntwo of my fellow Vietnam veterans--Senators Webb and Hagel--were also \nable to use the GI bill to help transition back into society after \nfighting in the jungles of Vietnam.\n  I share their belief that we need to reexamine the current GI bill \nwith an eye toward Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.\n  To that end, Senators Webb and Hagel have worked tirelessly to try to \nprovide the men and women of the Armed Forces who have served since\n9/11 with the education benefits they deserve.\n  These two Senators have created a bill that represents the best hope \nof increasing veterans' education benefits. They should be commended \nfor their hard work and their commitment to our troops.\n  Let me be clear: I support their proposal, and I would be proud to \npass an emergency supplemental with this proposal included.\n  However, how we pass this bill will be very important.\n  This emergency supplemental provides these veterans education \nbenefits at about $50 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Like the rest of this bill, there is no offset and no way to pay for \nthese benefits.\n  Our colleagues in the House, however, did something quite different \nand, in my view, a lot better.\n  When the House passed this same veterans education benefit, they also \nincluded a way to pay for it.\n  They created a nominal tax increase of .47 percent on individuals \nmaking over $500,000 or couples making over $1 million.\n  By offsetting this increase in veterans' benefits, the House sent a \nclear message to the country and to the troops. That message was that \nwe will honor the members of the Armed Forces by giving them the \nbenefits they rightfully earned, but we are going to do this in a \nfiscally responsible way; we are not going to do this by going deeper \ninto the red; we will exercise a little discipline; we will tighten our \nbelts; and we are going meet our troops' sacrifice with a sacrifice of \nour own.\n  In this time of war and economic hardship, I believe the Senate needs \nto send a similar message to our troops: We will sacrifice here at home \nto give you what you deserve, because you sacrificed abroad to protect \nthe United States.\n  That is why I have offered an amendment to this bill that provides \nthe same offset as the House bill.\n  In order to pay for the new GI bill, my amendment calls for a small \nsacrifice: a nominal tax increase--less than one-half of 1 percent--on \nindividuals making over $500,000 or couples making over $1 million.\n  One of the principles that I have always tried to follow is, if it is \nworth doing, it is paying for.\n  I doubt any of my colleagues would argue that providing veterans with \na new GI bill is not worth doing. So then, I ask my colleagues, why is \ntrying to pay for this benefit not worth doing?\n  I realize my amendment is not the most popular idea. We in the Senate \nlike to talk a good game about the need to rein in Government spending, \nreduce the deficit, and to adhere to pay-as-you-go principles. But we \nare not so good at walking the walk.\n  I also know that several of my colleagues have argued that when this \nbill passes, we will have spent nearly $600 billion in Iraq and none of \nthat has been paid for. Why shouldn't we, then, try to find an offset \nfor $50 billion in education benefits for our veterans?\n  I understand that sentiment. I am a veteran. I benefited from the GI \nprogram. And I, too, am not happy about our situation in Iraq.\n  I have complained for years that our spending in Iraq lacks \naccountability and that we have done little to nothing to make Iraq pay \nits fair share.\n  Again, I want to unequivocally state that I will vote to pass this \nnew GI bill--offset or not--because our troops deserve this benefit.\n  However, I just feel strongly that before we pass a new entitlement, \nwe should at least make an attempt to pay for it, that we in the Senate \nshould be willing, as the House has done, to put our money where our \nmouth is, to step up to the plate, and say this is worth doing and it \nis worth paying for.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are in the sixth year of the war in \nIraq, and the costs to our troops, our security, and our country rise \nby the day. With the current course still not working, I have no choice \nbut to vote against amendments 4817 and 4818 to the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct of 2008. It is clear that these measures continue to give President \nBush a blank check to continue his chosen policy, despite the constant \nwarnings of military experts who tell us that there is no military \nsolution to Iraq's civil war and that political compromise in Iraq will \nnot occur absent meaningful deadlines for the transition of our mission \nand the redeployment of U.S. troops.\n  I believe this was an occasion where Congress had the responsibility \nto force the President to change a policy that is broken. Not to \ncaution, warn, or cajole--not to give a blank check and hope for the \nbest--but to force a change in a policy that is making us weaker, not \nstronger.\n  Make no mistake--on the core issue of changing our deployment in \nIraq, these amendments are deficient, and that is why I must oppose \nthem. However, they contain provisions many of us have supported time \nand again.\n  Particularly, the first amendment has many important provisions that \nI support, including mandating dwell time between deployments for our \ntroops, a prohibition on permanent bases in Iraq, and the requirement \nthat any long-term security agreements with Iraq be subject to approval \nby the Senate. But because the language with respect to Iraq--setting a \nnonbinding goal of completing the transition of the mission by June of \n2009--is not strong enough, I cannot support the amendment.\n  I also oppose the second amendment, which provides billions and \nbillions more in funding for the war without\n\n[[Page S4728]]\n\nany policy corrections at all. This is tantamount to giving the \nPresident another blank check to continue with an Iraq war policy that \nI strongly believe is making America less safe. There is no requirement \nto transition the mission and no deadline to leverage political \nprogress. And there is no relief for a military stretched to the \nbreaking point. That approach will not resolve the sectarian divisions \nthat have fed this civil war, it will not bring long-term stability to \nIraq, and it will not protect our national security interests around \nthe world.\n  All of us--and I would underscore, all of us--are incredibly grateful \nfor the remarkable sacrifices our troops have made in Iraq. They have \ndone whatever we have asked of them, and they have served brilliantly. \nThe question before us now is whether we have a strategy that is worthy \nof their sacrifice.\n  We can all agree that there is no purely military solution to the \nproblems in Iraq. All of our military commanders, including General \nPetraeus, as well as Secretary Gates and Secretary Rice, have told us \nas much. And when the President announced his escalation to the \nAmerican public last January, he said the purpose was to create \n``breathing room'' for national reconciliation to move forward.\n  Over a year later, it is clear that this escalation did not \naccomplish its primary goal of fostering sustainable political \nprogress. General Petraeus himself recently said that ``no one'' in the \nU.S. or Iraqi Governments ``feels that there has been sufficient \nprogress by any means in the area of national reconciliation.''\n  I don't believe that it is too much to ask of Iraqis to make tough \ncompromises when over 4,000 of our troops have given their lives to \nprovide them that opportunity. In fact, I think the only strategy that \nhonors the tremendous sacrifice of our troops is one that pushes the \nIraqis to solve their own problems. And by General Petraeus's own \naccount, the current strategy is not accomplishing that.\n  By my count, we are now entering the fifth war in Iraq. The first was \nagainst Saddam Hussein and his supposed weapons of mass destruction. \nThen came the insurgency that Dick Cheney told us nearly 2 years ago \nwas in its last throes. There was the fight against al-Qaida terrorists \nwhom, the administration said, it was better to fight over there than \nhere. There was a Sunni-Shia civil war that exploded after the Samara \nmosque bombing. As we saw in Basra, there may be a nascent intra-Shia \ncivil war in southern Iraq. And nobody should be surprised if we see a \nsixth war between Iraqi Kurds and Arabs over Kirkuk.\n  We are also on at least our fifth ``strategy'' for Iraq. First there \nwas ``Shock and Awe,'' which was supposed to begin a peaceful \ntransition to democracy in Iraq. Then there were ``search and destroy'' \nmissions designed to fight the growing insurgency. There was the era of \n``As they stand up, we'll stand down,'' focused on transitioning \nresponsibility to Iraqi security forces. That was followed by the \n``National Strategy for Victory'' and the introduction of the ``Clear, \nHold and Build'' approach. And last year, we had the ``New Way \nForward,'' with the troop escalation that was supposed to provide \nbreathing room for the Iraqis to make political progress.\n  What we have never had is a strategy that brought about genuine \npolitical reconciliation or that made Iraqis stand up for Iraq or that \nallowed us to meet our strategic objectives and bring our troops home. \nWhat we have never seen is an exit strategy.\n  In fact, at the beginning of the war in 2003, we had about 150,000 \nU.S. troops in Iraq. Today, there are still about 150,000 U.S. troops \non the ground. After more than 5 years, after more than 4,000 U.S. \nlives lost, after more than $500 billion dollars spent, we are \nbasically right back where we started from--with no end in sight.\n  And we know that after the escalation ends in July the plan is to \nkeep some 140,000 troops in Iraq--slightly more than the levels of \nearly 2007, when the violence was out of control and political \nreconciliation was non-existent.\n  So it looks like the sixth strategy is basically to repeat what \ndidn't work the first time and hope for a different result. And we keep \nhearing that approach justified with the twisted logic that because we \ncannot afford to fail in Iraq, we must continue with a strategy that \nhas failed to achieve our primary goals.\n  We clearly need a new approach that fundamentally changes the \ndynamic, and I continue to believe that Iraqis will not make the tough \npolitical compromises necessary to stabilize the country while they can \ndepend on the security blanket provided by the indefinite presence of \nlarge numbers of U.S. troops.\n  One thing we know is that the costs of continuing down this path are \nextraordinary. Over $12 billion per month and over 900 soldiers dead \nsince the surge began. And while we are bogged down in Iraq, we \ncontinue to neglect the most pressing threats to our nation's security.\n  Let's be clear: The war in Iraq is not making us safer--it is making \nus less safe. Iran has been empowered in the region and emboldened to \ndefy the international community in pursuit of its nuclear program. \nHezbollah and Hamas are stronger than ever. Our military is stretched \nto the breaking point. Our intelligence agencies have told us Iraq is a \n``cause celebre'' for al-Qaida that helps ``to energize the broader \nSunni extremist community, raise resources and to recruit and \nindoctrinate operatives, including for homeland attacks.'' So it is no \nsurprise that terrorist incidents outside Iraq and Afghanistan have \nrisen dramatically since the war began and are now at historic highs.\n  And we know where the real threats lie: Our top national security \nofficials keep warning us that the next attack is likely to come from \nthe Afghanistan-Pakistan border--not Iraq. Meanwhile Afghanistan slides \nbackwards, in part because--as Admiral Mullen has acknowledged--with so \nmany troops tied down in Iraq, we simply don't have the manpower \navailable to give our military commanders the troops they need.\n  Every day we fail to change course we play further into the hands of \nour enemies. We need a fundamentally new approach to our Nation's \nsecurity in the region and around the world--and that starts with a new \nstrategy that in Iraq. The events of the last year have shown once \nagain a basic truth: Iraqis will not resolve their differences and \nstand up for Iraq while they can depend on the security blanket \nprovided by the indefinite presence of large numbers of U.S. troops.\n  As we redeploy, we need to engage diplomatically with Iraq's \nneighbors in a way that creates a new security structure for the \nregion. And we must responsibly redeploy from Iraq so we can refocus \nour efforts on fighting al-Qaida around the world--especially on the \nreal front line in the war on terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted for the non-Iraq portion of the \nsupplemental because it included a number of provisions I support, such \nas Senator Webb's GI bill, an extension of unemployment insurance, \nfunding for LIHEAP and Byrne grants, and a number of important Africa-\nrelated provisions. The Webb GI bill represents one of the best ways \nthat the Federal Government can support members of our Armed Forces who \nmight not otherwise have the opportunity to obtain a higher education. \nExpanding educational benefits is the least we can do for the men and \nwomen in uniform who have been asked to do so much for our country.\n  However, I am disappointed that the Senate was prevented from voting \non the fiscally responsible House version of the GI bill. We should not \nbe piling up more debt for future generations to repay, and I will work \nto try to make sure that the cost of this benefit is paid for. The \nSenate should not get into the habit of using nonoffset emergency \nsupplemental bills to bypass the regular appropriations process. Just \nbecause the President refuses to pay for the cost of the war in Iraq \ndoesn't mean we should follow his path of fiscal irresponsibility.\n  I am deeply disappointed that neither the House nor the Senate \nversion of the supplemental contains language that would end the Iraq \nwar. In fact, both bills--particularly the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee bill--are actually weaker in this respect than the first \nsupplemental we passed just over a year ago. Democrats took power of \nCongress last year pledging to work to bring an end to the war. While \nwe have made significant progress in other\n\n[[Page S4729]]\n\nareas, we are actually moving backward, not forward, when it comes to \nIraq.\n  What do I mean that the current supplemental is weaker than the one \nwe passed a year ago? The new House supplemental requires redeployment \nof troops from Iraq to begin in 30 days, with a goal of completion \nwithin 18 months, or approximately the end of 2009. The supplemental we \nsent to the President a year ago set a goal of completing redeployment \nno later than the end of March 2008, or around 11 months from passage \nof the bill. So we have gone from an 11-month goal to an 18-month goal.\n  And the exceptions have become even broader, meaning that even more \nU.S. troops could be allowed to remain in Iraq. In the new version, the \nadministration is no longer limited to conducting targeted missions \nagainst ``members of al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations with \nglobal reach.'' Now, it can leave troops in Iraq to go after any \n``terrorist organizations'' in that country. Going after al-Qaeda and \nits affiliates makes sense because they represent a direct threat to \nthe United States. Leaving U.S. troops in Iraq to launch missions \nagainst any organization that the administration labels ``terrorist,'' \nregardless of whether they pose a threat to our country, doesn't make \nsense. It is just a continuation of the current administration's \nmuddled, misguided approach, which focuses so much of our resources on \none country while largely ignoring the threat posed by al-Qaida around \nthe world.\n  In addition, the House language allows U.S. troops to not just \nconduct training and equipping of Iraqi troops but also to provide \n``logistical and intelligence support,'' which wasn't in last year's \nsupplemental. That could mean our troops would still be fighting on the \nfront lines, embedded with Iraqi forces, or providing air power, as we \nsaw during the recent clashes in Basra. If you are looking to keep tens \nof thousands of U.S. troops in Iraq indefinitely, then you won't have a \nproblem with this new language. If, however, you want to bring our \ninvolvement in this war to a close, then you can and should be troubled \nby these big loopholes in the House bill.\n  The House bill may be bad in this respect, but the Senate bill that \nwe actually voted on and passed is far worse. It doesn't have any \nloopholes--it doesn't need them because it doesn't do anything. It \nsimply expresses the sense of Congress that the mission in Iraq should \nbe transitioned to a few limited purposes by June 2009. That is it--\nnonbinding language that may make a few Members feel better about \nthemselves but that won't do a thing to bring the war to a close.\n  To make matters worse, the Senate bill includes a provision requiring \na report on transitioning the U.S. mission in Iraq but leaving 40,000 \ntroops in Iraq at the end of the transition. Based on existing \nestimates, it would likely cost $40 billion a year to maintain such a \npresence in Iraq. We should be promptly redeploying our troops, not \nstudying the option of transitioning to an open-ended, significant \nmilitary presence in Iraq.\n  Both the supplemental bills, and the process by which we are \nconsidering them, seem devised to maximize our political comfort, \nrather than put pressure on the White House to end a disastrous war. \nThis shouldn't be about allowing ourselves to cast votes that make us \nfeel better and look good.\n  Now I realize, like my colleagues, that we have limited options to \ntry to end the war before the next President and the next Congress take \noffice. But that doesn't mean we can simply ignore Iraq or write off \nthe next 10 months. More brave Americans will die in Iraq over the next \n10 months, and our national security will continue to suffer while we \nfocus on Iraq to the exclusion of so much else, including the global \nthreat posed by al-Qaida. We have a responsibility to our constituents \nand to the American people, who have been demanding an end to the war \nfor far, far too long, only to have that call go unheeded.\n  At a minimum, we should be voting on an amendment I filed to safely \nredeploy our troops by setting a date after which funding for the war \nwill be ended. The Senate has voted on such an amendment several times, \noffered by myself and the majority leader. I am under no illusions \nabout whether such an amendment would pass. But Members of Congress \nshould have to put themselves on the record as to whether they are \nserious about wanting to end the war. That may make some of them, even \nmembers of my party, a little uncomfortable. But making tough \ndecisions, casting tough votes, standing on principle--that is what our \nconstituents expect of us.\n  As all of this weren't bad enough, this so-called supplemental \nspending bill doesn't just include Iraq spending for the current fiscal \nyear. It also includes tens of billions of dollars to keep the war \ngoing in the next fiscal year. That means we can spare ourselves the \ninconvenience of taking up another Iraq spending bill this Congress. \nThat may make us all feel better, but it is another way of showing that \nwe aren't serious about putting pressure on the President to bring the \nwar to a close.\n  Instead of negotiating backroom deals, instead of trying to devise \nprocedures and votes that minimize our discomfort, instead of acting \nlike we are against the war without following through, instead of all \nthat pretense and posturing, let's act like a legislative body and do \nsome actual legislating. Let's have debates, and amendments, and votes. \nLet's do this in the open, on the record. That way our constituents \nwill see whether we really are committed to ending the war, to fiscal \nresponsibility, and to the other principles and goals that matter to \nthe folks back home but that seem to have been forgotten here.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I wish to point out to my colleagues what \nwe will not be funding if this amendment fails. First and foremost, we \nwill not be funding critical military construction projects for our \ntroops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. These are emergency \ninfrastructure requirements that our men and women in uniform have \nrequested--projects that will contribute to their safety and security \nand that are crucial for them to be able to perform the mission with \nwhich they have been tasked.\n  We will not be funding construction of critically needed VA \npolytrauma rehabilitation centers. These are cutting-edge centers for \nthe treatment of Active Duty and separated Iraq and Afghanistan war \nveterans suffering from the signature injuries of those wars: traumatic \nbrain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, hearing loss, \namputations, fractures, burns, visual impairment, and spinal cord \ninjury. It is hard to think of anything more important than providing \nthe best possible care to our wounded soldiers.\n  We will also be leaving a $787-million shortfall in the BRAC account, \nmeaning that important construction at our bases here at home will be \ndelayed, and the 2011 deadline for completing BRAC may become \nimpossible to meet.\n  We will be delaying emergency renovation and replacement of barracks \nfor our soldiers returning from war. Many of us were appalled at the \ndeplorable conditions at Fort Bragg, which is why this bill provides \n$200 million to rebuild the ``worst of the worst'' of the Army's \nbarracks. If we fail to pass this amendment, we will be leaving our \nsoldiers to continue to live in unacceptable conditions.\n  We will not be funding childcare centers for our military families. \nChildcare is a serious quality of life issue for the families who bear \nthe brunt of war, and this bill would accelerate funding for 31 of the \nhighest priority child development centers--funding for which the \nPresident himself has signaled support.\n  In short, this bill provides critical funding for some of the highest \npriorities of our Nation, including our military forces. All of my \ncolleagues should be very aware of what they are voting against if they \nvote against this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to object to \nthe inclusion of provisions that are clearly in the jurisdiction of the \nFinance Committee in an emergency supplemental appropriations bill to \nfund the war.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill seeks to place a moratorium on \nseven Medicaid regulations until the next administration.\n  It also prevents implementation of a CMS policy to ensure States \ncover poor kids before expanding their SCHIP programs.\n\n[[Page S4730]]\n\n  I know some people have concerns with the CMS policies.\n  Let me be clear: I am not here to argue the regulations are perfect. \nI have issues with some of them I would like to see addressed.\n  However, the regulations do address areas where there are real \nproblems in Medicaid.\n  Medicaid is a Federal-State partnership that provides a crucial \nhealth care safety net for some very vulnerable populations . . . low-\nincome seniors, the disabled, pregnant women, and children. They depend \non Medicaid, and it does generally serve them well.\n  Medicaid is also a program with a checkered history of financial \nchallenges.\n  Medicaid has a history of States abusively pushing the limits of what \nshould be allowed to maximize Federal dollars sent to them.\n  And while sometimes States have clearly pushed the envelope, at other \ntimes, States have struggled to understand what is and is not allowable \nin Medicaid.\n  So after years of work by CMS, numerous reports by GAO and the \nInspector General at HHS, and frequent Congressional hearings, CMS \nissued regulations to try to clarify the rules in some very problematic \npayments areas of Medicaid.\n  I will start with the public provider regulation.\n  We know that in the past, many States used to recycle Federal health \ncare dollars they paid to their hospitals to use for any number of \npurposes beyond health care.\n  It was an embarrassing scam that several administrations tried to \nlimit.\n  For years, the Medicaid Program was plagued by financial \ngamesmanship. States used so-called intergovernmental transfers or \nIGTs, to create scams that milk taxpayers out of millions--even \nbillions--of dollars.\n  Here is an example: a State bills the Federal Government for a $100 \nhospital charge. The hospital gets the $100 payment and then the State \nwould require the hospital to give $25 of it back to the State. In my \nview, that is a scam.\n  What happens to the $25? In the days before Congress and CMS cracked \ndown on the behavior, the money could go to roads or stadium \nconstruction.\n  That is right. Medicaid IGT scams paid for roads and stadiums instead \nof health care for the poor.\n  In 1991, 1997 and again in 2000, Congress took specific action to \nlimit the States' ability to use payment schemes to avoid paying the \nState share of Medicaid.\n  CMS has continued their work since then.\n  Over the past 4 years, CMS has been working with States to try to \nlimit these scams.\n  I will note these efforts have not been without their controversy. \nStates have been very concerned about exactly what the new standards \nare.\n  Senator Baucus and I wrote the GAO and asked them to look into what \nCMS has been up to in trying to limit the way States make these \npayments.\n  We were concerned that there was not enough transparency in what CMS \nwas doing.\n  And CMS did publish a rule for all to see. It is out there in the \nopen.\n  The core goal of the rule is to limit provider reimbursement to \nactual cost.\n  I know some people consider this a radical idea, but I just don't \nunderstand why anyone thinks it is a good idea to have hospitals paid \nmore than cost so they can be a part of these scams that rob the \ntaxpayer to fund State pork.\n  Restricting payments to cost is not exactly a new idea. In 1994, GAO \nrecommended that payments to government providers be limited to cost. \nThis is a fundamental issue for program integrity.\n  What did GAO find in their 1994 report that led them to this \nconclusion?\n  The State of Michigan used these questionable transfers to reduce \ntheir share of the Medicaid Program from 68 percent, which is what it \nshould have been, to 56 percent.\n  The GAO found evidence that in October 1993, the State of Michigan \nmade a $489 million payment to the University of Michigan. Within \nhours, the entire $489 million was returned to the State.\n  The report found that in fiscal year 1993, Michigan, Tennessee, and \nTexas were able to obtain $800 billion in Federal matching funds \nwithout putting up the State Share.\n  Congress and CMS have spent the last 17 years combating that \nbehavior.\n  Last year, the emergency supplemental included a provision to delay \nimplementation of the public provider rule for 2 years.\n  Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and the delay was reduced to 1 \nyear.\n  But I wish to read what I said at the time. This is from remarks I \nmade on March 28, 2007:\n\n       If some people think CMS has gone too far, then we should \n     review their actions in the Finance Committee. We should call \n     CMS in, make them testify, and ask the tough questions to \n     which we need answers. If we think there are things we should \n     have done differently, then we should legislate. That is the \n     way it ought to be done.\n\n  That is the right way to operate. We should have dealt with it in the \nFinance Committee.\n  We should have tackled the issues here that are extremely complex. \nThey deserve thorough consideration so we can insure we are taking \nappropriate action.\n  But a year has passed with no action and instead we are here with \nthis amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill. No hearings \nhave been held. No testimony submitted. Nothing.\n  Making the CMS regulation go away opens the door for a return to the \nwasteful, inappropriate spending of the past.\n  Intergovernmental transfers can have a legitimate role, but it is \ncritical that States have a clear, correct understanding of what is a \nlegitimate transfer and what is not.\n  If the regulation goes away, those lines will still not be adequately \ndefined.\n  Why should we care if the lines are not adequately defined? Let me \nread from the National Conference of State Legislatures Web site: \n``IGTs can enhance a State's Federal match and thus bring additional \nfunds to the State in two main ways. First, States can use county funds \ninstead of State funds to generate a Federal match to support services \nprovided by counties. Second, States can use IGTs to help it claim \nadditional Federal funds based on upper payment limits. Under this \nmodel, a State can make payments to eligible public facilities using \nthe rate Medicare pays for the same service, a rate that may exceed the \nState's standard Medicaid reimbursement rate. If it chooses to do so, a \nState then could use a portion of the new revenues generated--a share \nof the portion that remains after the standard Medicaid rate is paid \nfor other goods or services.''\n  States speak openly about these payment schemes to maximize Federal \ndollars flowing to the States.\n  It is absolutely the worst thing we could do for the Medicaid Program \nto leave States without clear guidance on these types of payments.\n  We cannot simply walk away from this subject.\n  Now I would like to turn to the CMS regulation on graduate medical \neducation. I personally think Medicaid should pay an appropriate share \nof graduate medical education or GME.\n  But I would like to see us put that in statute rather than return to \nthe current customary practice because I do not think the taxpayers are \nwell served by the way Medicaid GME operates today.\n  If we simply make the regulation go away, what are the rules for \nStates to follow?\n  There are five different methods States use in billing CMS, 11 States \ndon't separate IME from GME, and CMS cannot say how much they are \npaying States for GME.\n  Let me quote from a CRS memo I submitted for the Record during the \nbudget debate a few months ago: ``States are not required to report GME \npayments separately from other payments made for inpatient and \noutpatient hospital services when claiming Federal matching payments \nunder Medicaid. For the Medicaid GME proposed rule published in the May \n23, 2007 Federal Register, CMS used an earlier version of the AAMC \nsurvey data as a base for its savings estimate and made adjustments for \ninflation and expected State behavioral changes, for example.''\n  To make their cost estimate for the regulation, CMS relied on a \nreport from the American Association of Medical Colleges to determine \nhow much they are paying for GME in Medicaid.\n\n[[Page S4731]]\n\nThat is because the States do not provide CMS with data on how much \nthey pay in GME.\n  That is simply unacceptable.\n  You can disagree with the decision to cut off GME, but simply leaving \nthe current disorderly and undefined structure in place is not good \npublic policy.\n  Now let me turn to the regulations governing school-based \ntransportation and school-based administration.\n  Is it legitimate for Medicaid to pay for transportation in certain \ncases I think the answer to that is yes.\n  I do think it is legitimate for Medicaid to pay for transportation to \na school if a child is receiving Medicaid services at school.\n  That said, we should have rules in place that make it clear that \nMedicaid does not pay for buses generally.\n  We should have rules in place that make it clear that schools can \nonly bill Medicaid if a child actually goes to school and receives a \nservice on the day they bill Medicaid for the service.\n  You can also argue that the school-based transportation and \nadministrative claiming regulation went too far by completely \nprohibiting transportation, but if making this regulation go away \nallows States to bill Medicaid for school buses and for transportation \non days when a child is not in school, we still have a problem.\n  It is also critical that Medicaid pay only for Medicaid services.\n  We all openly acknowledge the Federal government does not pay its \nfair share of IDEA.\n  Quoting from the CRS memo: ``States, school districts, interest \ngroups, and parents of children with disabilities often argue that the \nFederal government is not living up to its obligation to `fully fund' \nPart B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--IDEA, P.L. \n108-446--the grants-to-States program.''\n  We can also acknowledge that just because IDEA funding is inadequate, \nStates will try to take advantage of Medicaid to make ends meet.\n  Again quoting from the CRS memo: ``It is generally assumed that such \ntransportation is predominantly provided to Medicaid/IDEA children.''\n  If a child is required to be in school under IDEA and receives a \nMedicaid service while in school, is the transportation of that child \n100 percent Medicaid's responsibility?\n  We should define clear lines so that States know what is and is not \nMedicaid's responsibility.\n  Now I would like to turn to the rehabilitation services regulation.\n  I certainly would argue that Medicaid paying for rehabilitation \nservices is good for beneficiaries. We want Medicaid to help \nbeneficiaries get better.\n  But States must have a common understanding of what the word \n``rehabilitation'' means in the Medicaid Program.\n  Again quoting from the CRS memo: ``Rehabilitation services can be \ndifficult to describe because the rehabilitation benefit is so broad \nthat it has been described as a catchall.''\n  Also, States need clear guidance on when they should bill Medicaid or \nanother program.\n  Again quoting from the CRS memo: ``There is limited formal guidance \nfor states in Medicaid statutes and regulations on how to determine \nwhen medically necessary services should be billed as rehabilitation \nservices.''\n  You can say the CMS regulation went too far, but that doesn't mean \nthere isn't a problem out there.\n  As CRS notes, billing for rehabilitation services between 1999 and \n2005 grew by 77.7 percent. I am far from convinced that all of that \ngrowth in spending was absolutely legitimate.\n  Finally turning to the case management regulation, I first want to \npoint out the issues relating to case management are a little different \nthan issues associated with some of the other Medicaid regulations I \nhave discussed so far.\n  The provision in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005--DRA--relating to \ncase management received a full review in the Finance Committee, along \nwith Senate floor consideration and conference debate prior to \nenactment of the DRA. This regulation relates to a recently enacted \nstatutory provision.\n  There is reason to believe that States have been using case \nmanagement to supplement State spending. Some believe that States are \nshifting some of their child welfare costs to the Medicaid Program \nthrough creative uses of case management.\n  Concern about the inappropriate billing to Medicaid for child welfare \nservices extends back to the Clinton administration.\n  There are some who would disallow most child welfare case management \nclaims from reimbursement from Medicaid. This goes further than I would \nsupport. Getting these children the proper services requires thoughtful \nreview, planning and management, and I believe that Medicaid has an \nappropriate role in supporting these activities.\n  On the other hand, driving a child in foster care to a court \nappearance and billing the caseworker's time to Medicaid is not an \nactivity that should be billed to Medicaid.\n  Certainly, the regulations are not perfect. The degree that CMS has \ngone to in specifying how case management should operate conflicts with \nthe efficient operation of the benefit in certain respects.\n  But again let me quote from the CRS memo:\n\n       Although there may be a number of issues related to \n     claiming FFP for Medicaid addressed in these sources, at \n     least two issues have been sources of confusion, \n     misunderstanding, and dispute. One issue where there has been \n     misunderstanding is non-duplication of payments. Another area \n     where there has been some disagreement is over the direct \n     delivery of services by other programs where Medicaid is then \n     charged for the direct services provided by the other \n     program.\n\n  When CMS tried to come up with rules to increase accountability in \ncase management, they had good reason to be trying to provide clarity \nand specificity for States.\n  Surely the answer is not to tell States they are on their own to \ninterpret the case management provision in the DRA.\n  As CRS notes, billing for case management services between 1999 and \n2005 grew by 105.7 percent. With spending growing that fast, we must \nmake absolutely certain States understand how they should be billing \nCMS.\n  During the Appropriations Committee markup, a provision was added to \ndelay implementation of an August 17, 2007, State Health Officials \nletter regarding the SCHIP program.\n\n  Simply put, the idea behind the policy is that States should have to \nshow they are covering their poorest kids before they can expand to \ncover kids with higher incomes.\n  No matter how many technical issues people might have with the \nability of CMS to implement the policy, I find it mind boggling that \nanyone would argue with the idea of covering poor kids first.\n  Poorer kids are generally sicker and in need of care. It is \nreasonable public policy to require States that want to cover higher \nincome children to first demonstrate that they are doing a good job \ncovering poor kids.\n  It is just common sense.\n  Earlier this month the administration issued further clarification on \nthe August 17 directive. The purpose of this additional State Health \nOfficial letter is to respond to some of the concerns that have been \nraised by States looking to accommodate the August 17 directive.\n  Rather than work with the administration to find solutions--even \nafter the administration made an effort to clarify the policy--this \nbill simply makes the policy go away.\n  This bill provides for $1.3 billion in savings to address the various \npolicy provisions in the Finance Committee's jurisdiction.\n  I actually support the provisions that save money in this bill.\n  I have been working on the provision related to physician-owned \nhospitals for years.\n  But it is wrong to move it in this bill, and as much as I do support \nthat provision, I must object to its inclusion here as well.\n  The provisions in this bill are scored by CBO as spending $1.7 \nbillion. It is $1.7 billion because the regulations are delayed only \nuntil the end of March of next year.\n  I know supporters hope that the next administration will pull back \nand undo the regulations completely.\n  What would it cost if we tried to completely prevent these \nregulations from ever taking effect?\n  Not $1.7 billion that is for sure.\n  It would actually cost the taxpayers $17.8 billion over 5 years and \n$42.2 billion over 10 years.\n\n[[Page S4732]]\n\n  It is an absolute farce for anyone to argue that all of those dollars \nare being appropriately spent and that Congress ought to just walk away \nfrom these issues.\n  Instead of just making the regulations go away, the Finance Committee \nand the Energy and Commerce Committee should sit down with the \nadministration and fix the problems with the regulations and address \nreal problems in Medicaid.\n  That is what we should be doing for the taxpayers.\n  Secretary Leavitt states that the most pressing of regulations will \nnot go into effect on May 25 as many have feared.\n  He has offered to sit down with us and work on these issues.\n  There is no cause for us to act today to block the implementation of \nthese regulations while an offer to talk is on the table.\n  After the President vetoes this bill, I encourage my colleagues to \ndrop these provisions and sit down with the administration to find real \nsolutions.\n  Separately, I want to voice my concern over the inclusion of an \nauthorization relating to imports of uranium from the Russian \nFederation.\n  The Finance Committee has not had an opportunity to examine this \ncomplex legislation and evaluate how it relates to our bilateral \nagreement with Russia concerning the disposition of highly enriched \nuranium extracted from nuclear weapons, and its potential impact on our \nbilateral agreement to suspend the antidumping investigation on uranium \nfrom the Russian Federation.\n  The Finance Committee is the committee of jurisdiction over \ninternational trade in the Senate, and circumvention of that \njurisdiction has in the past led to significant trade disputes. I am \ndisappointed that the Finance Committee was not fully engaged on this \nmatter.\n  We were deprived of an opportunity to contribute expertise and \nprovide input so that any potential consequences under our trade laws \ncould be mitigated.\n  Perhaps my concern will prove unfounded in this case. But \nnevertheless, this manner of legislating does not serve our best \ninterests and should be avoided in the future.\n  In conclusion, I oppose provisions that are the jurisdiction of the \nFinance Committee being considered in this bill.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a very \nimportant provision to New Orleans in the supplemental and to thank the \nSenate Appropriations Committee members for their strong and continued \nsupport for Louisiana during the long and difficult posthurricane \nrecovery process.\n  Included in the emergency supplemental bill before the Senate is $70 \nmillion for emergency funding for 3,000 rental subsidies, which will \nprovide permanent supportive housing in Louisiana for its most at-risk \nresidents. These are the individuals who normal housing assistance \nprograms are most likely to fail or miss, or who are unable to take \nadvantage of available assistance without extra support. They are the \nhomeless, the elderly in need of additional outside care or \nsupervision, and individuals with severe disabilities. For them, \npermanent supportive housing can mean the difference between being \nexposed to the streets or having a secure, stable home environment.\n  The permanent supportive housing funding is the final piece of a \nthree-prong initiative in Louisiana to address the post-storm needs of \nits most at-risk population. Louisiana has already dedicated \nsignificant resources toward this project: Louisiana's Road Home \nrecovery plan will provide the necessary supportive services funding \nfor the first 5 years of the initiative and some capital funding and \nthe State has already invested in 800 to 1,000 permanent supportive \nhousing units through existing affordable housing programs. All that \nremains now before this initiative can become a successful reality is \nthe rental subsidy funding, which would provide Louisiana with the \n2,000 project-based voucher and 1,000 shelter plus care units that will \nfinally bring the services and housing to the people that need it most.\n  However, without the $70 million in rental subsidy funding included \nin the supplemental, this important initiative will fail. This is an \nissue that transcends politics and party affiliation. It enjoys the \nbipartisan support of myself and Senator Landrieu, as well as the \nsupport of the Appropriations HUD subcommittee chair and ranking \nmember, Senators Murray and Bond, and the committee leadership. The \nLouisiana House congressional delegation supports the funding and wrote \nthe House appropriators to advocate for it. In fact, Louisiana's new \nGovernor, Governor Jindal, signed that letter as a Congressman and has \nsince written the House and Senate leadership last month urging its \nadoption.\n  As of the latest count last year, the homeless population in New \nOrleans had almost doubled to approximately 12,000 persons compared to \nthe period prior to the storm. This is an opportunity to bring the most \ndisadvantaged and at-need home. I urge Congress take this critical step \nof providing the necessary housing funding for this important Louisiana \nrecovery initiative. And, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nfunding in negotiations with the House of Representatives to ensure its \ninclusion in the final funding package.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, simply put, I cannot vote for another \n$165 billion to give President Bush a blank check and fund the \ncontinuation of the war in Iraq, without condition, for over another \nyear.\n  This is a difficult decision and not one I take lightly. But I \nbelieve that the time has come for Congress to exercise the power of \nthe purse and bring this war to a conclusion.\n  I am a strong supporter of our troops in the field. They have done a \ntremendous job under difficult circumstances. They weren't greeted as \nliberators as Vice President Cheney said they would be.\n  Instead, they found themselves targets in an internecine battle, \nwhose roots go back hundreds of years. They found themselves in the \ncrossfire between Sunni insurgents and Shia extremists. They've done \neverything asked of them, with the courage and dedication that we \nexpect from our service men and women.\n  But President Bush has never provided an exit strategy for Iraq. He \nhas never laid out a plan for bringing our troops home.\n  So, here we are more than 5 years after this war began. More than \n4,000 troops killed. Tens of thousands injured. And no end in sight. \n$525 billion spent all designated as emergency spending and none of \nwhich is paid for simply added to our Nation's growing debt.\n  This is the first major war that has not been paid for, but instead \nhas relied time and time again on emergency supplemental funds outside \nof the Federal budget.\n  I, along with many of my colleagues in the Senate, have voted again \nand again for a change of course to transition the mission. But the \nminority has obstructed the vote or President Bush has vetoed the bill \neach time we have tried.\n  So the power of the purse is the only tool we have to change the Iraq \nwar. And it is time to bring this war to a conclusion after 5 long \nyears.\n  The $165 billion supplemental funds the war for 1 year and 1 month, \nor until July 2009. This is all funded on the debt. I simply cannot \nagree to do it.\n  It would have been one thing if the supplemental had been to fund the \nwar for an additional 6 months. But it is not. This means that the next \nadministration essentially need not make any move or change until July \n2009. This is simply not acceptable to me.\n  To me, it is a big mistake to have a supplemental this big because it \nsimply means ``business as usual.'' And I don't believe we can be \n``business as usual.''\n  On Tuesday, I questioned Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on the \nfunding for this war. I told Secretary Gates that it is unclear to me \nwhy the passage of a $165 billion 2009 bridge fund is urgent at this \ntime, particularly given that funding needs for next year are very much \nup in the air.\n  I told him that it is my understanding that if DOD transfers funding \nto the Army to meet its personnel and operational expenses, the Army \ncould stretch its current funding quite far. And I asked how long the \nArmy and Marine Corps could operate without the '09 bridge fund.\n\n[[Page S4733]]\n\n  The Secretary said:\n\n       ``The notion of having to borrow from the base budget in \n     '09 to pay war costs . . . we probably could make it work for \n     a number of months.'' And ``can we technically get thought \n     some part of fiscal year 2009 without a supplemental? \n     Probably so.''\n\n  So the other question that I have been grappling with is why should \nwe provide 13 months of funding now? Where is the urgency to fund this \nwar through July 2009? That is over a year away. It is simply not \nnecessary to appropriate $165 billion for the Iraq war in a single day. \nThis is almost twice the size of any previous supplemental the Senate \nhas considered to date.\n  President Bush won't listen to the wishes of the majority of Congress \nand the American people. He has shown a complete unwillingness to \nevolve in the face of compelling evidence of the need for change.\n  After the fall elections, a new President will offer new ideas and \npolicies, and at the top of the list should be a new plan for Iraq.\n  Congress should not, during this time of transition and great \nopportunity to seize the moment and change our war policy, allow the \nwar to linger unaddressed for up to 7 months of the new administration.\n  Congress should not relinquish its constitutional right and \nobligation to use the power of the purse to require the next President \nto present a plan for Iraq one that includes the funding he or she will \nneed to put that plan in motion.\n  So now, we are faced with another choice: Do we provide $100 billion \nthrough the end of this year and an additional $66 billion to take us \nthrough July 2009? Do we give the next President a pass and affirm that \nhe or she does not have to change the mission or plan an exit strategy \nuntil the middle of next year?\n  I cannot support this.\n  Passing a year-long supplemental is an abandonment of the power of \nthe purse, the greatest power that the Congress has. I believe that the \ntime has come for the Senate to assert its will, and another year and a \nmonth of funding for this war is not the answer.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today in support of \nthe domestic spending amendment to the fiscal year 2008 Military \nConstruction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies bill, which is the \nunderlying vehicle for fiscal year 2008 supplemental funding.\n  These appropriations include funding for programs vital for our \nNation's welfare. With my long record of support for these programs, I \ncould hardly reject supporting them now especially in the face of \nsupporting significant additional funding for national defense. There \nmust be some semblance of balance on military and domestic spending.\n  This legislation includes emergency unemployment compensation, UC, \nbenefits for individuals who have exhausted all regular unemployment \nbenefits after May 1, 2006. The UC program, funded by both Federal and \nState payroll taxes, pays benefits to covered workers who become \ninvoluntarily unemployed for economic reasons and meet State-\nestablished eligibility rules. These emergency UC benefits will provide \na 13-week extension of unemployment benefits for those Americans in \nneed of help.\n  Although America's economic growth has been positive during each of \nthe past 25 quarters, between January and March 2008, payroll \nemployment fell by some 160,000 and the unemployment rate rose to 5.1 \npercent in March of this year. Inflation has accelerated with the \nconsumer price index rising to 3.9 percent for the 12 months ending in \nApril 2008 compared with 2.5 percent during 2006 and 3.4 percent in \n2005. With the increased costs of food and energy and loss of jobs in \nthe United States, we need to offer assistance to those employees who \nhave lost their jobs in order for them to provide for their families \nuntil they can find another job. I have consistently supported efforts \nto extend UC benefits to help our fellow Americans through difficult \ntimes. The Senate failed to extend UC benefits during consideration of \nthe economic stimulus bill on February 6, 2008, despite my support. \nTherefore, I support this amendment recognizing the need to capitalize \non the opportunity it provides for a much needed economic boost to \nthose hard-working Americans hit hardest by the recent economic \ndownturn.\n  Additionally, I support this amendment as it includes a much needed \nupdate to the GI bill of rights, which has not been revised for over 20 \nyears. I joined 57 of my colleagues in sponsoring legislation that \nwould provide a 4-year public university education for anyone who has \nserved on active duty for at least 36 months since Sept. 11, 2001. This \nlegislation would provide for this generation what the post-WWII GI \nbill provided for veterans of that global conflict. The current \nproposal is supported by the current chairmen of the Armed Services \nCommittee and Veterans' Affairs Committee, as well as by a former \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  This reform is a real necessity. Regrettably we do not take care of \nour veterans as we should. We find that men and women are coming back \nnow from Iraq and Afghanistan and the wonders of modern medicine have \nbeen able to keep people alive, but they have very serious \ndisabilities. Many need a lot of counseling, have a lot of psychiatric \nproblems and a lot of brain damage. Some young men and women coming \nback in their early twenties will require decades of care. General \nColin Powell recently said, ``For someone coming back after serving in \nIraq or Afghanistan for two or three or four tours of duty, they need \nto catch up quickly, and we need to help them.''\n  For those veterans ready to return to school, it is vital that they \nnot be hindered with financial impediments to accessing higher \neducation. It is a very sound economic approach to provide this \neducation. The post-WWII program has been paid off many times over by \nproducing men and women who have been very productive and paid more \ntaxes. According to a recent editorial by Tom Ridge and Bob Kerrey, \n``for every tax dollar spent on the World War II GI bill, our country \nreceived $7 in tax remittances from veterans whose careers benefitted \nfrom enhanced education.'' I agree with General Powell's statement \nthat, ``America got that money back in spades.'' I think this is \nsomething we ought to do, most fundamentally to treat the veterans \nproperly, but also for the future of the country. We would be well \nserved by another generation of very well educated men and women; they \ndeserve it, and it would help the country a great deal in the long run.\n  This amendment before the Senate contains $400 million for the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH. These additional funds are critical \nin catalyzing scientific discoveries that will lead to a better \nunderstanding in preventing and treating the disorders that afflict \nmen, women, and children in our society. I was very disappointed in the \nsmall increase NIH received in fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2009, I \nam asking for an increase of several billion dollars.\n  This amendment contains an additional $26 million for Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, to respond to outbreaks of \ncommunicable diseases related to the re-use of syringes in outpatient \nclinics. Funds would be used for research, education and outreach \nactivities.\n  Further, I have consistently supported efforts to increase funding \nfor the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, as the \nranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services and Education. This amendment provides an \nadditional $1 billion for fiscal year 2008 for this critical program. \nWith the cost of energy continually increasing, it is essential that \nthose on fixed incomes have assistance in making their home heating and \ncooling payments. This additional funding will bring the total level \nfor fiscal year 2008 closer to the goal of the fully authorized level \nof $5 billion.\n  Paying heating and cooling bills for low-income households throughout \nthis Nation has always been a struggle, but never more so than today \nwith the soaring energy costs. The inability to pay for heating or \nhaving to make decisions to forgo other needs such as food and medicine \npose health and safety hazards--especially to the elderly, the disabled \nand children. This winter, Americans, on average, spent $977 to heat \ntheir homes which is 10 percent higher than last winter. Nationwide \naverage oil heating bills are expected to be 22 percent higher than in \nthe previous year. I support this amendment\n\n[[Page S4734]]\n\nwhich will go a long way towards addressing the serious plight of those \nindividuals facing a critical need for assistance during this energy \ncrisis.\n  This amendment will also provide a moratorium on several Medicaid \nregulations. These Medicaid Programs are critical to providing \nhealthcare to low-income individuals in Pennsylvania.\n  The moratorium prevents the elimination of school-based \nadministrative and transportation programs and case management services \nfor individuals with multiple health and social complications. This \namendment will provide access for beneficiaries to rehabilitation \nservices. Further, the moratorium would continue the payments to \nhospitals for graduate medical education funding, allowing Pennsylvania \nhospitals to train the physicians of tomorrow. These programs provide \nan important health safety net for disadvantaged children, seniors and \nparents that must be preserved.\n  This amendment would restore access to nominal drug pricing for \nselected health centers specifically those clinics based at colleges \nand universities whose primary purpose is to provide family planning \nservices to students of that institution.\n  The domestic amendment also contains provisions that will decrease \nFederal spending. This includes the expansion of a demonstration \nproject that verifies the assets held by Medicaid applicants. It saves \nfederal dollars by preventing noneligible people from receiving \nMedicaid benefits inappropriately.\n  Additionally, this amendment would impose a 1-year moratorium on the \nAugust 17, 2007, directive by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices. This directive changed Federal policy by prohibiting coverage \nof uninsured children under SCHIP if their family income is above 250 \npercent of the Federal poverty level or $42,400. This is of particular \nimportance in Pennsylvania where the SCHIP program covers children in \nfamilies up to 300 percent of the poverty level or $63,600.\n  For these reasons that I have outlined above--an extension of \nunemployment insurance benefits, enhanced benefits for our nation's \nveterans, and additional funding for LIHEAP, FDA, CDC and NIH where \ninsufficient funding has been provided--I support the domestic spending \namendment to the supplemental bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about a number \nof important provisions in this domestic funding amendment. I am \ndelighted that this amendment passed the Senate by an overwhelming vote \nof 75-22, and I hope the House will pass it swiftly and overwhelmingly \nas well.\n  There are many provisions in this amendment that will meet many \nimportant needs we are facing as a country, but I would like to mention \na few that are of particular note. First, the bill contains a total of \n$15 million to help reduce drug-related violence in the border region \nby aggressively stepping up efforts to prevent weapons from being \nsmuggled into Mexico to arm drug cartels. Of this money, $5 million \nwould be allocated for ATF to provide assistance to Mexican authorities \nin investigating weapons trafficking cases and $10 million would be set \naside for ATF to enhance Project Gunrunner Teams in the southwest \nborder States.\n  This funding is based on S. 2867, the Southwest Border Violence \nReduction Act, which I recently introduced with Senator Hutchison. This \nmeasure is also cosponsored by Senators Feinstein, Kyl, Durbin, and \nDomenici.\n  According to ATF, about 90 percent of the firearms recovered in \nMexico come from the United States. These weapons are used by drug \ngangs to forcefully maintain control over trafficking routes and \ngreatly undermine the ability of Mexico to fight drug traffickers. \nThese violent groups use smuggled weapons to assassinate military and \npolice officials, murder rival members of drug organizations, and kill \ncivilians. In the Mexican state of Chihuahua, which shares a border \nwith New Mexico, there have been over 200 killings since the beginning \nof 2008, an increase of about 100 percent over the previous year.\n  Violence perpetrated by international drug trafficking organizations \nimpacts the well-being and safety of communities on both sides of the \nUnited States-Mexico border. I am pleased that additional resources are \nbeing allocated to target weapons trafficking networks and enhance \ninternational cooperation in investigating these cases.\n  The second provision I would like to discuss relates to assistance we \nare providing to local law enforcement situated along the southern \nborder. The bill includes $90 million for a competitive grant program \nwithin DOJ to help local law enforcement along the southern border and \nother agencies located in areas impacted by drug trafficking. As the \nsponsor of the Border Law Enforcement Relief Act, I have been pressing \nfor Congress to help border law enforcement agencies with the costs \nthey incur in addressing criminal activity in the border region. I \nstrongly believe this funding is greatly needed and I am glad the \nCongress is giving this issue the attention it deserves.\n  This bill also takes an important step forward in advancing our \neconomic security by increasing funding for math and science education \nprograms by $50 million. In America Competes, this Congress recognized \nthat in order to ensure an educated and skilled workforce, we needed to \nstrengthen math and science education. Accordingly, we significantly \nexpanded math and science education programs at the National Science \nFoundation. I am particularly pleased to see an increase of $20 million \nin the Robert Noyce Scholarship program, which recruits and prepares \ntalented students and professionals to become math and science \nteachers. The bill also contains an additional $24 million to support \ngraduate study in STEM fields.\n  Further, earlier this year Senators Domenici, Alexander, Dorgan, \nCorker, Feinstein, Kennedy, Schumer and I wrote a letter to the \nAppropriations Committee requesting $250 million for the Department of \nEnergy's Office of Science. This bill allocates some $900 million for \nagencies performing science, including $100 million for the DOE's \nOffice of Science. In addition, it provides $400 million for the \nNational Institutes of Health to keep its budget up with inflation and \n$200 million for NASA and their space flight mission. I am grateful to \nthe committee for recognizing the importance of science and taking it \ninto account in this supplemental appropriations bill.\n  In light of the ``silent tsunami'' of the food crisis in the \ndeveloping world, I am pleased that the Senate version of the \nsupplemental provides for approximately $1.2 billion in funding for \nfood aid through fiscal year 2009. I am also pleased that USAID will \nreportedly announce a $45 million package in food aid for Haiti, of \nwhich $25 million will be distributed via the World Food Programme, at \na press conference tomorrow morning.\n  However, I believe that more needs to be done for Haiti. According to \nHaitian President Rene Preval, Haiti needs $60 million in U.S. food aid \nassistance to avert famines over the next 6 months. Accordingly, I call \nupon USAID to allocate at least $60 million of the $1.2 billion food \naid appropriation to Haiti.\n  Haiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, where \napproximately 76 percent of Haiti's population subsists on under $2 per \nday and 55 percent on under $1 per day. One in five Haitian children is \nmalnourished. We must address these challenges, partly for reasons of \npreserving stability in the Caribbean, and partly to provide an \nalternative to emigrating to the United States, but mostly because it \nis the right thing to do.\n  I am also pleased that the supplemental provides for $100 million of \nassistance for Central America, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic to \nsupport the Merida Initiative in those regions and countries. In \nparticular, I am pleased that the Senate version of the supplemental \nset aside $5 million of this money to combat drug trafficking and for \nanticorruption and rule of law activities in Haiti. This amount doubled \nthe $2.5 million called for in the House version.\n  Last year, when the Drug Enforcement Agency stationed two helicopters \nin Haiti on a temporary basis, the level of cocaine shipments \ntransiting the country by air and sea declined significantly. This \ndecline resulted in lower levels of corruption in Haiti and less \ncocaine reaching the United States. I hope that today's $5 million in \nfunding for Haiti will replicate these successes,\n\n[[Page S4735]]\n\nand I call upon the DEA to use a portion of these funds to increase \ninterdiction capability in Haiti by placing helicopters there on a more \nsustained basis.\n  Finally, I would also like to voice my strong support for provisions \nwithin this legislation to block attempts by the Bush administration to \nreduce health care access for low-income children, seniors, and others. \nIn the last year and a half the Bush administration has aggressively \nattempted to shrink the Federal Medicaid program by reducing the \nability of States to provide Medicaid coverage to their most vulnerable \npopulations. These actions have been taken under the ruse of ``fraud \nand abuse'' reforms but we should be clear about what they really are, \nan attempt to reduce Federal expenses on the backs of poor Americans. \nAt a time when we are spending approximately $12 billion a month on the \nwar, that is about $5,000 a second, and at a time when so many \nAmericans are facing economic hardship and will be depending on low-\nincome programs, it is unconscionable that the Bush administration is \nattacking the poorest among us--all in a weak attempt at appearing \nfiscally responsible.\n  These programs are critical to many low-income patients and safety-\nnet providers in my home State of New Mexico and across the Nation. For \nexample, the most significant of the administration's proposals would \ndevastate New Mexico's Sole Community Provider Fund, which plays a \ncritical role in ensuring New Mexicans in rural areas of the State have \naccess to life-saving hospital services and funds programs for \nuninsured New Mexicans. It also would cause the University of New \nMexico Hospital and other New Mexico institutions to lose millions of \ndollars for the care they provide to our low-income residents. It is \nimportant to note this is not a partisan issue. I have worked for the \nlast year and a half to block this specific proposal including \nintroducing legislation with Senator Dole, S. 2460. Seventy-four \nmembers of the Senate, Democrats and Republicans alike, have gone on \nrecord opposing this Bush proposal. We were successful in blocking it \nlast year and I am very pleased that we are acting to block it for an \nadditional year.\n  Sadly, the Bush administration's proposals don't end there. The White \nHouse also would undermine the ability of schools to help enroll \nchildren in Medicaid and coordinate their health care services. The \nadministration would also cut rehabilitation services provided to \npeople with disabilities, especially those with mental illness and \nintellectual disabilities; cut case management services for the \nelderly, children in foster care and people with disabilities; reduce \nspecialized medical transportation services for children; and severely \nlimit Medicaid payments for outpatient hospital services. Finally, the \nadministration also is attempting to severely limit States' abilities \nto expand enrollment of children in the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program or SCHIP.\n  Taken together the Bush administration's efforts would cost my State \napproximately $180 million this year in Federal low-income support and \nmuch more in subsequent years. The Nation's Governors oppose the Bush \nadministrations efforts, as do State Medicaid directors, State \nlegislators, and the National Association of Counties. More than 2,000 \nnational and local groups--such as the American Hospital Association, \nthe American Federation of Teachers, and the March of Dimes--also \noppose these efforts. They know the devastating effect these rules \nwould have on local communities, their hospitals, and vulnerable \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today we are voting on funding our troops \non the front lines. We can disagree about whether we should be in Iraq \nat all and we can disagree with the President's failed policies, but as \nlong as Americans are in harm's way, we need to give them the best \npossible protection this country has. To me, that is a sacred \nobligation. In terms of protection, there are a lot of reasons to vote \nfor this funding--it provides $2 billion to fight deadly improvised \nexplosive devices, it funds 25 C-130s to replace planes worn out by \nnonstop use moving people and supplies around the war zone, it gives \nmore assets to families, it funds much needed military health care, and \nit provides $1.7 billion for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles. \nThat is a good thing.\n  Now in our fifth year of the Iraq war and the seventh year of the war \nin Afghanistan, it often seems that good news is hard to come by. But \nsometimes good things do happen here on the Senate floor. Sometimes we \nare able to profoundly improve the odds for American men and women \nfighting in those wars. For my colleagues, I would like to review one \ngood story.\n  For me, this story begins in the summer of 2006 on one of my trips to \nIraq. A Marine commander in Fallujah showed me a new vehicle they were \nusing called a Buffalo. He told me that these Buffalos were saving \nlives and that they needed more of them. I was impressed. This Buffalo \nwas a huge vehicle with a large claw arm, high off the ground, with a \nv-shaped undercarriage. I found out later that it was the largest of a \ngroup of vehicles called Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, or \nMRAPs.\n  So, when the next wartime funding bill came to the Senate, I looked \ninto what was going on with these MRAPs. The most important thing that \nI found out was that military experts were starting to say that MRAPs \ncould reduce casualties from improvised explosive devices, those \nroadside bombs also called IEDs, by two-thirds. At that time, 70 \npercent of all the casualties suffered by Americans were caused by \nIEDs. So even if MRAPs only worked half as well as the military \nclaimed, they would have a tremendous effect reducing deaths and \ninjuries.\n  In a March 1, 2007, memo to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Conway, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, emphasized \nthe importance of the MRAPs, saying, ``The MRAP vehicle has a \ndramatically better record of preventing fatal and serious injuries \nfrom attacks by improvised explosive devices. Multi-National Force--\nWest estimates that the use of the MRAP could reduce the casualties in \nvehicles due to IED attack by as much as 70 percent.'' He ended by \nsaying, ``Getting the MRAP into the Al Anbar Province is my number one \nunfilled warfighting requirement at this time.'' Later that month, in \ntestimony to Congress, General Conway told us that the likelihood for \nsurvival in Iraq was four to five times greater in an MRAP.\n  Two weeks after that memo was written, then Chief of Staff of the \nArmy, General Schoomaker told the Committee on Appropriations of the \nfunding shortfalls for MRAP procurement. I will be honest here. I was \ngenuinely surprised. It was clear to me that this vehicle was essential \nand needed to be fielded as quickly as possible. I could not understand \nwhy funding was not already in the supplemental.\n  I looked into it and found out that in fiscal year 2006 and in the \nbridge fund for fiscal year 2007, there was a total of $1.354 million \nfor MRAPs, but much more was needed because this was a new vehicle. \nOnly one company was making MRAPs then, and the military was only \nordering small amounts of them.\n  In February 2007 the military ordered and received 10 MRAPs. That is \nit. It became clear to me that we needed to do more to push this \nprocess.\n  The Marine Corps was running the program for all of the services. \nThey told me that one issue was that the requirements in the field had \nchanged dramatically--it started with a request for 185 in May of 2006, \nthen another 1,000 were requested in July, the total went to 4,060 in \nNovember and to 6,728 in early February of 2007. By March, the total \nneed was thought to be 7,774 MRAPs for all four services. The plan at \nthe time was to spend $8.4 billion to build those 7,774 MRAPs--$2.3 \nbillion in fiscal year 2007 and $6.1 billion in fiscal year 2008. The \nadministration, however, had not asked for $2.3 billion. Despite this, \nmy colleagues on the Appropriations Committee put $2.5 billion in their \nbill because they saw the need.\n  The Marine Corps believed that even that plan was not aggressive \nenough and that production could be accelerated if more funding was \nmoved to fiscal year 2007. So I asked my colleagues to join me in \nadding another $1.5 billion to the wartime funding bill to produce and \nfield 2,500 more MRAPs by December of 2007. I felt very strongly that \nwe had to accelerate things. Some of you may remember that I came to \nthe Senate floor in a tuxedo, to explain\n\n[[Page S4736]]\n\nhow vital the funding was the night before the vote.\n  On March 29, 2007, we spoke as one. The vote was 98 to 0 to add the \n$1.5 billion and give the MRAP program a total of $4 billion. This \nSenate should be congratulated for that decision.\n  We stood up and said, ``We can do better.'' We also made clear our \nagreement with General Conway, who called this effort ``a moral \nimperative.''\n  I know that some had doubts. They were concerned that the vehicles \nhad not been adequately tested and that producers simply could not \nexpand production lines quickly enough. But in the end we all agreed \nthat we had to take a chance on American industry because our kids' \nlives were at stake.\n  When the bill went into conference, some of our colleagues in the \nHouse had not yet realized how critical this was and what a difference \nearly funding could make to the production schedule. So, the total in \nthe final bill sent to the President in late May was reduced to $3.055 \nbillion. The additional funds were important, but equally important was \nthe interest that the debate sparked in the press.\n  Secretary Gates has said that he first heard about the MRAP program \nafter reading a USA Today article. After which, on May 2, he made the \nMRAP program the Pentagon's top acquisition priority. On June 1, he \ngave the program a DX rating, giving it priority for the acquisition of \ncritical items like steel and tires that multiple military programs \nneed. He also established the MRAP Task Force to work on any issues \nthat might delay MRAP production.\n  Despite Secretary Gates's clear understanding of the need for MRAPs, \nthe fiscal year 2008 wartime funding request from the administration \nwas only for $441 million. Four point one billion was needed just to \nproduce the 7,774 MRAPs. So, on May 17, I formally asked the Armed \nServices Committee and the Appropriations Committee to provide the $4.1 \nbillion needed. Again, to my colleagues' credit, 17 others joined those \nrequests and both Committees responded with the $4.1 billion needed in \nthe bills they presented to the Senate.\n  At almost the same time, we began to hear that the requirements in \nIraq had grown again. GEN Raymond Odierno, commander of Multi-National \nForces--Iraq, indicated that he wanted to replace all of the Army \nhumvees in Iraq with MRAPS. That would mean the Army alone would need \nclose to 17,700 MRAPs. The plan that we had been trying to fund \nincluded only 2,500 MRAPs for the Army. That now appeared to be 15,200 \ntoo few.\n  Given that MRAPs cost approximately $1 million per vehicle, that also \nmeant that at least $15.2 billion more would be needed. We were now \nlooking at a total price tag of over $23 billion for MRAPs, making the \nMRAP program the third most expensive in the entire defense budget.\n  It was clear to me, and to many colleagues here, that more needed to \nbe done. Despite Secretary Gates's commitment to expedite production, \nthere still seemed to be a lack of urgency in the administration and \nplenty of people were still saying that more MRAPs simply could not be \nproduced quickly. So on May 23 I called on the President to personally \nengage so that the Nation could meet the needs of our men and women \nunder fire.\n  I am sorry to say that we did not see the President engage. To this \nday, we must wonder how much faster we could have moved if he had.\n  Instead, in early July, the Army finally said publicly that they \nneeded approximately 17,700 total MRAPs. The Joint Requirement \nOversight Council, however, did not immediately approve that change. \nSo, Congress was once again left knowing that the needs in Iraq were \ngrowing but not having a clear number or plan to meet the needs.\n  In speeches I made last year, I talked about some of the tensions \nwithin the military that slowed down the MRAP program, so I won't go \ninto those details today. For now I will only quote Secretary Gates's \nanalysis from May 13 of this year: ``In fact, the expense of the \nvehicles . . . may have been seen as competing with the funding for \nfuture weapons programs with strong constituencies inside and outside \nthe Pentagon.''\n  Despite the frustration of not having a clear plan, some things were \ngoing well. The funding we had added to the supplemental combined with \nthe hard work of the MRAP Task Force and MRAP program management team \nwas making a difference. The Pentagon saw clear increases in production \ncapacity and was ready to try to move faster. I told you that in \nFebruary 10 MRAPs had been produced. In July, that number was up to \n161--an amazing increase but clearly nothing close to the level needed \nto meet the requirement. The Pentagon asked Congress to approve moving \n$1.165 billion from other military programs to the MRAP program to try \nto keep growing the production. Congress agreed.\n  In July, I introduced an amendment to the Defense authorization bill \nto provide all of the funding that would be needed to get the Army \n17,700 MRAPs and to deal with increased costs for the original 7,774 \nMRAPs that the committees had funded. I was also concerned that we were \nnot moving fast enough to provide protection from explosively formed \npenetrators, EFPs, so I included funds for that work as well. The total \namendment was for $25 billion, which included $23.6 billion for 15,200 \nMRAPs, $1 billion for cost increases, and $400 million for additional \nEFP protection. My goal at the time was very simple: to make absolutely \nclear to the Pentagon and to MRAP producers that Congress would provide \nall of the funding needed for MRAPs, up front and without delay, so \nthat we could get these lifesaving vehicles to the front lines as \nquickly as possible.\n  That bill got delayed, but in the end, there was unanimous approval \non September 27 for my amendment adding $23.6 billion to purchase \n15,200 more MRAPs. The final bill, passed by the Senate on October 1, \nalso raised the basic amount from $4.1 billion to $5.783 billion to \naddress the increased costs for the 7,774 MRAPs already planned.\n  Three weeks later, October 23, the administration finally came to \nCongress and asked for $11 billion for 7,274 additional MRAPs for the \nArmy. This officially made 15,374 the total request for all services \nand was approximately 8,000 MRAPs less than the Army appeared to need. \nHowever, at that time, Army leaders were telling us that they believed \nit was important to get MRAPs into the field and see how well they \nworked before committing to the much larger number. Concerned about \nthis, I went to the floor again when it was time to debate the Defense \nappropriations bill. Mr. President, $11.6 billion was included for \nMRAPs, and Senator Inouye promised on the Senate floor to closely \nmonitor the Army needs and he personally guaranteed that if those \nadditional vehicles were needed, they would be funded.\n  By this time, production was truly ramping up. In October, 453 MRAPs \nwere produced. By November we were up to 842, and by December we were \nat 1,189 MRAPs. That means we got a total of 3,355 MRAPs produced in \n2007 even though in February, industry could only make 10 per month. In \nthe span of 18 months, this program went from trying to meet a \nrequirement for 185 MRAPs to meeting the requirement for 15,374 MRAPs. \nThis Senate stepped up and said we will meet the need. We provided over \n$22.4 billion to give industry the ability to ramp up their production \nability.\n  When I argued in March that we could deliver close to 8,000 MRAPs to \nIraq by February of 2008, some said it was impossible. We came close. \nFive thousand seven hundred and twelve MRAPs had been produced by the \nend of February.\n  As of this week, just under 8,300 MRAPs have been produced. More \nimportant, 4,664 are fielded and in the hands of front line forces in \nIraq and 456 are fielded in Afghanistan. The rest are on the way, and \nwe are producing well over 1,000 per month.\n  Let me go back to where we started. Something profoundly good \nhappened on this Senate floor last year. Last year, we made it clear \nthat we would provide the best possible protection to our troops. We \nrecognized that this was a matter of honor and a matter of life and \ndeath. The results have been phenomenal.\n  Secretary Gates said last Tuesday, ``MRAPs have performed. There have \nbeen 150-plus attacks so far on MRAPs and all but six soldiers have \nsurvived. The casualty rate is one-third that of a humvee, less than \nhalf that of an\n\n[[Page S4737]]\n\nAbrams tank. These vehicles are saving lives.''\n  MG Rick Lynch, commander of Multi-National Division--Central, which \noperates south of Baghdad, told USA Today just over a month ago, ``The \nMRAPs, in addition to increasing the survivability of our soldiers from \nunderbelly attacks, also have improved force protection for EFP attacks \nas well. So I've had EFPs hit my MRAPs and the soldiers inside, in \ngeneral terms, are OK.'' He also pointed out that he had lost 140 \nsoldiers, many in up-armored HMMWVs or Bradleys hit by IEDs and said, \n``Those same kind of attacks against MRAPs allow my soldiers to \nsurvive. I'm convinced of that.''\n  And soldiers know it. On April 4, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution \nquoted SSG Jamie Linen of the 3rd Infantry Division talking about using \nMRAPs in the Baghdad area. He said, ``It is the one vehicle that gives \nus the confidence to go out there. Nothing is invincible here. You got \ntanks with three feet of armor getting blown up. But the MRAPs give us \na sense of security.''\n  MRAPs have not only saved hundreds of lives, they have also saved \nlimbs. The additional protection MRAPs provide usually means that \ninjuries are less severe and complicated. That means more soldiers, \nairmen, sailors, and marines coming home and able to return to the \nlives they left behind. There is really no price too high to get this \nresult, so again, I want to congratulate this Senate. What we did last \nyear to support the MRAP program was not all that had to be done--the \nprogram managers and producers also had to do their part--but it was \nessential, and today, every day, it is literally saving American lives. \nWhat we did today continues that effort.\n  We have no higher obligation than to give those fighting for us the \nbest possible protection. It is a sacred duty. Today and last year, \nwith the MRAP, we fulfilled that duty, and I congratulate my \ncolleagues.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before us today is a supplemental \nappropriations bill that would provide vital funding for the men and \nwomen fighting valiantly on our behalf abroad. Yet instead of acting on \nthe needs of our military in an expeditious and efficient manner, we \nfind ourselves considering a bloated bill, loaded down with extraneous \nprovisions unrelated to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nSadly, this has become an unfortunate and reoccurring trend in recent \nyears.\n  Congress has an obligation to provide our servicemen and women with \nthe resources they need to fulfill their mission. Yet we have, once \nagain, chosen to abrogate our duties and use this bill as a vehicle to \nfund various domestic projects that were not requested by the \nPresident, nor are they authorized, and have not been handled through \nthe appropriate legislative process.\n  The President has already stated his intention to veto this measure \nif it arrives at his desk in its current form. Rather than \ndemonstrating true bipartisanship and working together to produce a \nbill that meets the needs of our military and one that has the \npotential of becoming law, the Senate intends to pass a bill will be \npassed that is sure to be met swiftly by the President's veto pen, \nunnecessarily prolonging the delay in funding our troops.\n  Let us not underestimate the necessity of providing this funding to \nour military promptly and the consequences of delaying such payment. In \na recent letter to Congress, Under Secretary of Defense Gordon England \nstated in no uncertain terms that if this funding is not provided, \n``the Army will run out of Military Personnel funds by mid-June and \nOperation and Maintenance (O) funds by early July.'' In order to deal \nwith these depleted accounts, the Department of Defense--DoD--would be \nrequired to borrow funds from other service branch accounts, hampering \nongoing DoD activities around the globe. Under Secretary England goes \non to state in his letter that by late July, the entire Department will \nhave ``exhausted all avenues of funding and will be unable to make \npayroll for both military and civilian personnel .  .  . including \nthose engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan.'' Let us understand what this \nmeans. If this appropriations measure is not enacted in a timely \nmanner, thousands upon thousands of men and women in uniform will stop \nreceiving a paycheck and our ability to conduct operations throughout \nthe world will be severely restricted.\n  When we should be working together to produce a clean bill that \nprovides our servicemen and women with the vital resources they need to \nfulfill their duties, we have instead reverted to the same old \nWashington habit of loading spending bills with billions of dollars \ngoing to unrequested, non-emergency projects. Examples include: $75 \nmillion not requested by the administration for expenses related to \neconomic impacts associated with commercial fishery failures, fishery \nresource disasters, and regulation on commercial fishing industries. \nThis comes after Congress appropriated $128 million in 2005 for \ncommercial fishery failures, $170 million in 2007 and included an \nadditional $170 million in the Farm bill. Since 2005, Congress has \nprovided almost $300 million for commercial fisheries disasters not \nincluding the $75 million in this supplemental and the proposed $170 \nmillion from the Farm bill. Additionally, questions remain by some \ncommercial fishermen if this funding can be used to offset high gas \nprices which may be considered a disaster. The disaster here is that \nthe American public isn't receiving any assistance on high gas prices.\n\n  Other examples are: $10 million not requested by the administration \nfor Educational and Cultural Exchange programs; $75 million not \nrequested by the administration for rehabilitation and restoration of \nFederal lands; more than $451 million not requested by the \nadministration for emergency highway projects for disasters that \noccurred as far back as Fiscal Year 2005; $210 million not requested by \nthe administration for the decennial census and $3.6 billion for 15 Air \nForce C-17 cargo aircraft. We have looked to the administration to \ninform Congressional budgetary decisions and the Department of Defense \nhas been quite clear regarding the purchase of more of these cargo \naircraft--they do not want them, because there is no military \n``requirement'' for them and buying more C-17s is contrary to the \nPentagon's current budget plan. DOD Secretary Gates, the DOD Deputy \nSecretary, and the Department's top acquisition official have all \nstated that additional C-17s were not necessary. Yet the Air Force \ncontinues to appeal to the parochial interests of Members of Congress, \nand once again the taxpayers find themselves on the wrong end of a bad \ndecision. I am troubled by the Air Force's apparent disregard for \nproper acquisition policy, practice and procedure and seeming eagerness \nto further contractors' interests. As evidence of this, the Department \nof Defense Inspector General has an open investigation regarding how \nsenior Air Force officials may have inappropriately solicited new \norders for C-17s contrary to the orders of the President and the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  While I do not doubt the importance some may see in the various \nprovisions included in the underlying bill, I strongly disagree with \ntheir inclusion in a war supplemental funding bill. Instead of \nattempting to hijack this vital legislation, the authors of these \nextraneous provisions should pursue their objectives through the normal \nlegislative process and as part of appropriate authorizing and spending \nvehicles.\n  I also want to express my concerns about the authorizing legislation \nincluded in this emergency supplemental regarding veterans' educations \nbenefits, commonly referred to as the Webb bill. There have been a lot \nof misrepresentations made about my position on this issue--not only on \nthe Senate floor by the majority leader, who has alleged that I think \nthe Webb bill is ``too generous,'' which is absolutely false, but most \nrecently in an ad by VoteVets.org, which offers a complete \nmisrepresentation of the facts and is a disservice to our Nation's \nveterans. I will once again attempt to set the record straight.\n  I believe America has an obligation to provide unwavering support to \nour veterans, active duty servicemembers, Guard and Reserves. Men and \nwomen who have served their country deserve the best education benefits \nwe are able to give them, and they deserve to receive them as quickly \nas possible and in a manner that not only promotes recruitment efforts, \nbut also promotes retention of servicemembers. I would\n\n[[Page S4738]]\n\nthink we could have near unanimous support for such legislation and I \nam confident that we will reach that point in the days ahead. But \nadding a $52 billion mandatory spending program to this war funding \nbill without any opportunity for amendments to improve the measure is \nnot the way to move legislation nor will it expedite reaching an \nagreement in an efficient manner. Our vets deserve better than this.\n  On numerous occasions I have commended Senators Webb, Hagel and \nWarner for their work to bring this issue to the forefront of the \nSenate's attention. Their effort has been for a worthy cause, but that \ndoes not make it a perfect bill, nor should it be considered the only \napproach that best meets the education needs of veterans and \nservicemembers. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nif their bill is passed, it will harm retention rates by nearly 20 \npercent. That is the last thing we need when our Nation is fighting the \nwar on terror on two fronts.\n  Senators Graham, Burr and I, along with 19 others, have a different \napproach, one that builds on the existing Montgomery GI Bill to ensure \nrapid implementation of increased benefits. And, unlike S. 22, we think \na revitalized program should focus on the entire spectrum of military \nmembers who make up the All Volunteer Force, from the newest recruit to \nthe career NCOs, officers, reservists and National Guardsmen, to \nveterans who have completed their service and retirees, as well as the \nfamilies of all of these individuals.\n  We need to take action to encourage continued service in the military \nand we can do that by granting a higher education benefit for longer \nservice. And, we need to provide a meaningful, unquestionable \ntransferability feature to allow the serviceman and woman to have the \noption of transferring education benefits to their children and \nspouses. S. 22, unfortunately, does not allow transferability. As a \nmatter of fact, 2 days ago, Senators Webb and Warner agreed that \ntransferability is a serious matter that merited change. What they \nproposed, however, does not go far enough and would only provide for a \n2-year pilot program. Their efforts underscore the need for debate and \nfurther discussion on this important issue. But I applaud them for \nacknowledging the Congress needs to take a proactive stance and allow \ntransferability of earned education benefits to a spouse or children.\n  We cannot allow this important issue to be hijacked by the anti-war \ncrusade funded by groups like MoveOn.org and VetsVote.org who are \nrunning ads saying that that I do not ``respect their service.'' The \naccusation is wrong, they know that it is, and they should be ashamed \nof what they are doing to all veterans and servicemembers. I respect \nevery man and woman who have been or are currently in uniform.\n  It is my hope that the proponents of the pending veteran's education \nbenefits measures can join together to ensure that Congress enacts \nmeaningful legislation that the President will sign and as soon as \npossible. Such legislation should address the reality of the All \nVolunteer Force and ensure that we pass a bill that does not induce \nservicemen and women to leave the military; but instead bolsters \nretention so that the services may retain quality servicemen and women. \nIt must be easily understood and implemented and responsive to the \nneeds not only of veterans, but also of those who are serving in the \nactive duty forces, the Guard and Reserve, and their families. Their \nexemplary service to our nation, and the sacrifice of their families, \ndeserves no less.\n  As we move forward with consideration of this supplemental \nappropriations legislation, we must remember to whom we owe our \nallegiance--the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines fighting bravely \non our behalf abroad. These brave Americans need this appropriation to \ncarry out their vital work, and we should have provided it to them \nmonths ago. The Congress, which authorized the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, has an obligation to give our troops everything they need \nto prevail in their missions. Unfortunately, it seems we have failed to \nlive up to this obligation today, instead producing a bill fraught with \nwasteful spending more attuned to political interests instead of the \ninterests of our military men and women.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we are here today--after more than 5 \nyears, 4,000 American lives lost, 30,000 wounded, and nearly $600 \nbillion spent--to discuss funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I have always believed invading Iraq was a mistake. I voted against \ngranting our President that authority in 2002. I have opposed, from the \nbeginning the way this administration carried out that effort once \nbegun. Last year, when the 2007 emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill came before the Senate, I, along with a majority of my colleagues, \npassed a bill that would have brought our troops home. The President \nchose to veto that bill. If he had signed it, most of our troops would \nbe home today.\n  Instead, we now have more troops in Iraq than we did more than 5 \nyears ago when President Bush declared our mission accomplished. The \ngrave costs of his aimless strategy continue to plague us both at home \nand abroad.\n  Former President John F. Kennedy said, ``To govern is to choose.'' \nPresident Bush has repeatedly chosen to pursue his war in Iraq, despite \nits costs to our nation. After voters sent an overwhelming message that \nthey wanted a different direction, President Bush charged full steam \nahead. In his ``New Way Forward'' speech on January 10, 2007, President \nBush announced his decision to place more troops in Iraq.\n  But even the President recognized, and I quote, ``A successful \nstrategy for Iraq goes beyond military operations. Ordinary Iraqi \ncitizens must see that military operations are accompanied by visible \nimprovements in their neighborhoods and communities. So America will \nhold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced.'' \n``America's commitment,'' he said, ``is not open-ended.''\n  As General Petraeus stated in a March Washington Post interview, ``no \none'' in the U.S. and Iraqi Governments ``feels that there has been \nsufficient progress by any means in the area of national \nreconciliation,'' or in the provision of basic public services. And, in \nfact, only 3 of the 18 benchmarks the Iraqi Government and our \nGovernment agreed were important have been fully accomplished.\n  President Bush, however, has not held the Iraqi Government \naccountable for its failures as he promised. Instead, he has asked for \nover $170 billion to stay the present course: arming opposing militias, \nmeddling in intra-Shi'a violence, and tinkering around the edges of the \ngrowing refugee crisis. The President wants money for his war, but says \nhe will veto any conditions on those funds or any additional funds this \nCongress offers for the other urgent needs that face our Nation's \ntroops, our Nation's families, and our Nation's economy.\n  To govern is to choose. I believe it is past time for a more \ncomprehensive strategy in Iraq under which our current, unsustainable \nmilitary presence evolves into a longer term diplomatic role. I believe \nit is past time to hold President Bush to his promise that American \nsupport to the Iraqi Government is not open ended.\n  So I will vote against providing any additional funds for this war \nuntil we have a new mission for our Armed Forces. I will also vote \nagainst a provision that merely suggests a new mission for United \nStates forces in Iraq. The time for suggestions, pleas, and protests \nhas passed. The President has demonstrated that these fall on deaf \nears.\n  Because our troops remain mired in an Iraqi civil war, we as a nation \nremain distracted from efforts to combat terrorists and extremists in \nAfghanistan and Pakistan where they pose the greatest threat. We have \nstretched our military too thin. We have pushed our troops too far. \nBeyond the priceless cost in life and limb, the nearly $600 billion and \ncounting we have spent in Iraq has kept us from rebuilding the gulf \ncoast, improving our infrastructure, fixing our schools, and providing \nquality health care for all.\n  So far, Maryland has paid over $10 billion for the war in Iraq. With \njust that share of the cost of the war we could have:\n  Provided over 2 million people with health care;\n  Powered over 9 million homes with energy from renewable sources;\n  Put over 200,000 new public safety officers on the street;\n\n[[Page S4739]]\n\n  Given over 1 million students scholarships to university; or\n  Allowed over 1 million children a brighter beginning in Head Start.\n  To govern is to choose. I am proud to vote for provisions, above and \nbeyond the President's request, that will provide additional funds for \nbarracks improvements, restore $1.2 billion in BRAC military \nconstruction funding, and provide nearly $440 million to construct \nworld class VA polytrauma centers.\n  I am especially pleased to vote to provide veterans returning from \nIraq and Afghanistan with a new level of educational benefits that will \ncover the full costs of an education at a State institution. President \nBush and some of my colleagues say the benefit is too generous. But \nthis country provided our troops a similar opportunity after World War \nII. That investment created a generation of great leaders and an \neconomic boom that transformed our country.\n  A new GI bill allows a new generation of brave men and women to \nfulfill their dreams and adjust to civilian life. That is an \nopportunity we owe veterans who this administration has asked to serve \nextended and repeated combat tours. A new GI bill is also a wise \ninvestment; it allows our economy to fully benefit from these veterans' \ntalent, leadership, and experience.\n  I believe that the Iraqi refugee crisis, international disasters in \nChina and Myanmar as well as an international food crisis require bold \naction by our government. I am proud to support significant additional \naid to Jordan who has accepted hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees, \nas well as disaster assistance and global food aid above and beyond the \nPresident's request.\n  We have an obligation to respond to the growing economic crisis and \nthe needs it has created for American families. People are losing their \nhomes and their jobs, and along with those jobs, their health care. \nSince March 2007, the number of unemployed has increased by 1.1 million \nworkers. I find it unbelievable that the President would threaten to \nveto emergency assistance for Americans in crisis.\n  So I am happy that this Senate has ignored the President's veto \nthreats and I support provisions that extend unemployment benefits by \n13 weeks for all the nation's workers and by an additional 13 weeks in \nthose States with the highest unemployment rates. Extending \nunemployment benefits helps families. That is critically important. But \nit will also help our economy. Economists estimate that every dollar \nspent on benefits leads to $1.64 in economic growth.\n  The bill extends a freeze on seven Medicaid rules issued by the \nadministration that would have put a tremendous burden on State and \nlocal budgets already under pressure and affected access to services \nfor Marylanders and Americans all around the country. This bill also \nmakes critical investments in our infrastructure including roads, dams, \nand levees; increases energy assistance by $1 billion to low-income \nAmericans facing skyrocketing fuel prices; and provides commercial \nfishery disaster assistance that could help Maryland's watermen.\n  These are only a few of the critical investments this bill makes in \nour Nation. With this emergency supplemental legislation, we chose to \naddress many of the most pressing issues of our time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, 64 years ago, President Franklin Roosevelt \nsigned legislation that would change the course of American history and \ngreatly enrich the lives of millions of our country's finest minds and \nbravest souls. That day, President Roosevelt said that the bill ``Gives \nemphatic notice to the men and women in our Armed Forces that the \nAmerican people do not intend to let them down.''\n  Since 1944, nearly 8 million veterans have benefitted from the GI \nbill. Nearly 8 million men and women, home from war, provided with the \nopportunity to advance their education, get better jobs, and afford a \nbrighter future for themselves and their families. Among them, seven \nnow serve in the United States Senate: Dan Akaka graduated from the \nUniversity of Hawaii, Chuck Hagel graduated from the University of \nNebraska at Omaha, Dan Inouye graduated from the University of Hawaii \nand George Washington Law School, Frank Lautenberg graduated from \nColumbia University, Ted Stevens graduated from UCLA and Harvard Law \nSchool, John Warner graduated from Washington and Lee and the \nUniversity of Virginia Law School, and Jim Webb, a Naval Academy \nalumnus, graduated from Georgetown Law School.\n  There is no doubt that if you ask any of these seven distinguished \nAmericans, they would tell you that along with hard work, the GI bill \nwas a major reason for their success.\n  The 8 million veterans on the GI bill became an army of prosperity \nhere at home. They became doctors, teachers, scientists, architects, \nand, like the seven I mentioned, public servants. They saved lives, \nbuilt cities, enriched young minds and expanded the opportunities \navailable to a new generation of Americans.\n  Every dollar invested in the GI bill by the Government returns $7 to \nour economy--and the returns on our cultural prosperity are impossible \nto calculate.\n  In his time, President Roosevelt promised to never let our troops \ndown. Now it is our time to do the same. The new GI bill, sponsored by \nSenator Webb and cosponsored by nearly 60 Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, does just that. It increases educational benefits to \nall members of the military who have served on active duty since \nSeptember 11, including reservists and National Guard and it covers \ncollege expenses to match the full cost of an in-state public school, \nplus books and a monthly stipend for housing. This is a bipartisan \naccomplishment we can all be proud to support.\n  A small minority of voices in the Bush administration oppose it on \nthe faulty logic that it would decrease retention rates. On the \ncontrary, there is every reason to believe that it would increase \nrecruitment rates.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this crucial bipartisan bill--\nsupported by those among us who have served and understand the military \nbest.\n  Democrats are committed to honoring our troops in deeds and not just \nwords. This call should be a cause for all of us. Passing this new GI \nbill will send that message loud and clear.\n  Once this GI bill reaches the President's desk, I urge him to do the \nright thing for our troops and veterans by quickly signing it into law.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Democratic side has 8 minutes \n45 seconds remaining; the Republican side has 27\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining time on our side be reserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we had understood that there was a \nSenator or two on our side who wanted to be recognized before we go to \na vote on this issue. But pending their arrival, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Mississippi yield me 4 minutes off the bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield the distinguished Senator 4 minutes \noff the time allotted to the Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. I rise to speak about one specific element of the next \nfour votes which has been come to be known as the Webb GI bill; a \nsincere attempt and a positive effort to try address to the issue of \nupdating the GI benefits.\n  I regret that that bill is being brought up in isolation and is not \nbeing juxtaposed with the Graham-Burr-McCain bill which also does the \nsame thing, only does it in a much better way. I strongly support the \nGraham-Burr approach, which does not undermine retention while \nexpanding benefits, the GI benefits to veterans.\n  The problem with the Webb bill, as the Secretary of Defense has said, \nand\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\nsenior leadership in the military have said, is the bill will undermine \nour ability to retain personnel in the military. That has also been the \nconclusion of CRS. The reason is because it has such a high incentive \nfor people to leave the military after their first tour of duty in the \nmilitary in order to take advantage of the educational benefits.\n  The Graham bill, on the other hand, takes a different approach. It \ngives even more generous benefits, in many ways, especially to the \nfamilies of GIs, people serving in the military, but at the same time \nit increases those benefits with the more years you serve.\n  So the benefits go from $1,500 after 3 years of service, up to $2,000 \nafter 12 years of service, and the ability to take those benefits and \ngive them to your children or to your spouse is also authorized in the \nGraham bill, which does not occur in the Webb bill.\n  That seems to me to be proper approach here. We do not want to \nundermine retention as we address the issue of improving benefits for \npeople who serve in the military for us. This does not seem to me to be \nrocket science. It seems to me we should be able to get these two bills \ntogether, merge them in a way that produces this sort of a positive \nresponse where we significantly expand the benefit to people who have \nserved us, for the ability to get educational benefits after they leave \nthe service but at the same time do it in a way that does not undermine \nthe capacity of the military to retain quality people.\n  When the Secretary of Defense says this is going to cost us quality \npeople, he is talking about national defense. These are the folks who \nhave been trained to have the skills, who are extraordinary \nprofessionals whom we want to encourage to stay in the military. We do \nnot want to create a system where we actually encourage them to leave \nthe military.\n  The Graham-Burr bill takes the approach of encouraging these folks to \nstay in the military and allow the benefits to accrue and grow so they \ncan use them or their family members can use them. Thus, I think that \nis a much more positive and appropriate approach. So setting up the \nWebb bill as a freestanding vote without any amendments--that is the \nstructure we have got here on the floor, no amendments to the Webb \nbill; it hasn't gone through committee, it has not gone through regular \norder, it is being brought to the floor to make a political statement--\nbasically is not constructive to getting the best product and the best \nbenefits for our GIs, and also the best bill to make sure we have the \nstrong and vibrant military in order to defend ourselves and have a \nstrong national defense.\n  Regrettably I have to vote against the Webb bill until we can get it \nin a posture where it addresses the issue of retention, where it \naddresses the issues raised by the Secretary of Defense, raised by the \nmilitary leaders who work for the Defense Department, and raised by our \nown congressional study groups. Hopefully we can step back from this \nissue and do it right and do it in a cooperative way that will actually \naccomplish the goals which we all want, which is to significantly \nextend and expand benefits for education to people who serve us in the \nmilitary, and at the same time encourage retention, at the same time \nallow these benefits to be passed down to the children of the persons \nserving us if that is their choice.\n  I wanted to make that point clear prior to this vote. I appreciate \nthe courtesy of the Senator from Mississippi.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Mississippi any time I have. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that 5 minutes be allocated to \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and that \nthe time be added to the base time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The President pro tempore is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee met for 3\\1/2\\ hours and reported responsible legislation \nthat supports the troops, sets a goal for reducing the scope of the \nmission in Iraq, honors our veterans, and helps Americans to cope with \na sagging economy.\n  The bill includes $10 billion of domestic funding not requested by \nthe President, less than what the President spends in Iraq in 1 month. \nYet the President has threatened to veto the bill if it is one thin \ndime--one thin dime--over his, the President's--your President, my \nPresident, our President--request. He wants this Congress to approve \nanother $5.6 billion--that is $5.60 for every minute since Jesus Christ \nwas born--to rebuild Iraq. Yes, he wants this Congress to approve \nanother $5.6 billion to rebuild Iraq, despite the fact that Iraq has \nhuge--I mean huge--surpluses from excess oil revenues. He wants funding \nfor Mexico. He wants funding for Central America. But the President \nsays he will veto the bill if we add funding for bridges in Birmingham \nor for help with the high cost of energy bills in Maine or to fight \ncrime in U.S. towns and cities or to aid Katrina victims.\n  Just yesterday the Director of the Office of Management and Budget \nrepeated the silly assertion that by taking care of America, we hold \nfunding for the troops hostage. This is pure--I am sorry to say, \nsomething like horse manure--nonsense. Our legislation includes funds \nthat the President did not request for health care for our troops, for \nGuard and Reserve equipment, for building and repairing barracks, and \nfor training the Afghans to fight for their own security.\n  In the amendment on which we are about to vote, we honor those who \nhave served America by increasing educational benefits for our \nveterans. We extend unemployment benefits by another 13 weeks. We honor \npromises made to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. We roll back \nMedicaid regulations that our Nation's Governors believe disrupt health \ncoverage for our most vulnerable citizens. We respond to dramatic \nincreases in food prices by increasing funding for the Global Food Aid \nProgram. We also provide humanitarian relief to disaster victims in \nChina, Bangladesh, and in Burma.\n  This amendment includes provisions that have broad bipartisan \nsupport, such as funding for Byrne grants and the Rural Schools \nProgram, which runs out of money on June 30, 2008. In the last 18 \nmonths, the President has designated 62 disaster grants for floods in \n32 States. Yet the President has not requested funding to repair \nlevees, leaving our citizens in Arkansas, Missouri, Louisiana, and \nother States vulnerable to more flooding. We fund those repairs.\n  This is responsible legislation that supports our troops, honors our \nveterans, and helps our citizens to cope with a troubled economy. I \nurge adoption of the pending amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on behalf of all of our colleagues, I \nthank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his work on this \nappropriations bill and for taking into account all of the important \nneeds across this country in presenting this amendment. I thank him for \nhis words today as well.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes, and the Senator from Mississippi has 19 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, at the end of the Second World War, this \ncountry thanked a generation of returning heroes for their service by \ngiving them the chance to attend college on the GI bill. Stanley \nDunham, my grandfather, was one of the young men who got that chance. \nMore than half a century later, we face the largest homecoming since \nthen, at a time when the costs of college have never been higher.\n  Senator Webb, a former marine himself, along with the leaders of both \nparties, have introduced a 21st century GI bill that would give this \ngeneration of returning heroes the same chance at an affordable college \neducation that we gave the ``greatest generation.''\n  We have asked so much of our brave young men and women. We have sent \nthem on tour after tour of duty to Iraq and Afghanistan. They have \nrisked their lives and left their families and\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\nserved this country brilliantly. It is our moral duty as Americans to \nserve them as well as they have served us. This GI bill is an important \nway to do that.\n  I know there are some who have argued that this will have an impact \non retention rates. I firmly believe--and I think it has been argued \neloquently on this side--that in the long term, this will strengthen \nour military and improve the number of people who are interested in \nvolunteering to serve.\n  I respect Senator John McCain's service to our country. He is one of \nthose heroes of which I speak. But I cannot understand why he would \nline up behind the President in his opposition to this GI bill. I can't \nbelieve why he believes it is too generous to our veterans. I could not \ndisagree with him and the President more on this issue.\n  There are many issues that lend themselves to partisan posturing, but \ngiving our veterans the chance to go to college should not be one of \nthem. I am proud that so many Democrats and Republicans have come \ntogether to support this bill. I would also note that the first GI bill \nwas not just good for the veterans and their families, but it was good \nfor the entire country. It helped to build our middle class. Whenever \nwe invest in the best and the brightest, all of us end up benefiting, \nall of us end up prospering.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to give those who have defended America \nthe chance to achieve their dream. I commend Senator Webb and the many \nveteran service organizations that have worked so tirelessly on this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Illinois for his \nstatement. I appreciate that he mentioned his grandfather and others \nwho were helped by the GI bill of rights. There are so many people I \nknow in Vermont who were able to get an education because of that bill.\n  I also commend the Senator from Washington State. As always, she \ncarries out Herculean tasks on this floor and does it in the best \ntradition of the Senate.\n  I thank Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran for their work on this \nsupplemental bill.\n  The Appropriations Committee has a long tradition of bipartisanship, \nand the two leaders, the Republican leader and the Democratic leader, \nhave always demonstrated that, just as I have tried in the Foreign \nOperations subcommittee, working with Senator Gregg and his staff. We \nworked closely together to make difficult choices, including finding \nfunds for urgent humanitarian needs that the President's budget \noverlooked.\n  For the first time, we require the Government of Iraq, which has an \noil surplus--with oil selling for over $120 a barrel--to match U.S. \nfunds dollar for dollar. It is time for Iraq to pay a larger share of \nits own reconstruction. This requirement, included by Senator Gregg and \nmyself, would lessen the burden on American taxpayers.\n  We provide $450 million to Mexico and Central America, to help our \nneighbors to the south combat the drug cartels. This is the first down \npayment on a multi-year program. I spoke in this chamber at greater \nlength about the Merida Initiative yesterday.\n  We have significantly increased funding for refugees, including Iraqi \nrefugees. I thank Senator Gregg for helping us provide $650 million for \nassistance for Jordan, and I thank Senator Edward Kennedy for the money \nincluded for Iraqi refugees. Thanks to Senators Biden and Lugar, the \nbill includes essential authority to enable the administration to help \ndismantle North Korea's nuclear facilities.\n  As other Senators have mentioned, this bill also provides funds for \ncritical domestic needs, from repairing decaying infrastructure in \nAmerica to disaster relief for American victims of floods, tornadoes, \nand other disasters. We are helping to rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan, \nbut we are also providing funds to help the American people the \nPresident's budget left out. I wish the President had considered these \nneeds in his supplemental request. He wants to fix roads in \nAfghanistan, but we also need to fix roads in America. He wants to \nrepair infrastructure in Iraq, but we need to repair infrastructure in \nAmerica. My State and the States of every Senator are waiting for help \nfrom the Federal Government. Working together, both parties, we have \naddressed important national security interests, but we have also \naddressed the urgent needs of the American people at home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss my vote against the \nprevious amendment which both appropriated $165 billion to continue the \ntragic and misguided war in Iraq, and also included a number of \nprovisions relating to our policies regarding Iraq. I favor many of the \npolicy provisions contained in the amendment, such as requirements that \nthe Iraqi government share in some of the costs of the war and a \nprohibition against the establishment of permanent military bases in \nIraq. I commend my Democratic colleagues in the Appropriations \nCommittee, including my good friend and distinguished colleague from \nRhode Island, Jack Reed, for their work on these laudable provisions. I \nalso strongly support the provision that requires our intelligence \nagencies to give access to detainees to the International Committee of \nthe Red Cross. I have worked closely with my colleagues on the \nIntelligence Committee on this important provision, which is designed \nto end secret detentions.\n  While I fully supported some of the policy provisions in the \namendment, I could not vote to fund this war in the absence of a firm \nand enforceable timeline for withdrawal. Unfortunately, it appears that \nthe Republican minority remains intent on filibustering any attempts to \nmandate a rapid and responsible redeployment of our troops from Iraq. \nI, along with thousands of Rhode Islanders who have contacted me on \nthis critical issue, oppose spending $4,000 per second on a war that \nhas diminished our national security and damaged our standing in the \nworld. I am hopeful that, under a new President, we can work together \nto bring an end to this war.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4818\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am going to ask for consent, in a few \nminutes, to have the override of the farm bill occur at 2 o'clock \ntoday. Senator Gregg will have 15 minutes, Senator Chambliss and \nSenator Harkin will have 15 minutes divided between them, a total of 30 \nminutes. That debate will take place before 2 o'clock, and at 2 o'clock \nwe will vote.\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\n  I also inform all Members we still don't have particulars resolved on \nthe budget. There are a number of alternatives. We can't do anything on \nit until we get the legislation from the House. They are going to take \nthat up sometime this afternoon. As I said, the alternatives are, when \nit gets here we run out--I think there was at least a gentleman's \nagreement, although not on the record, that the 4 hours we used \nyesterday would run against the 10 hours, so we would have 6 hours to \ncomplete that today. We would vote sometime this evening on that. That \nis one alternative.\n  The other alternative is to consider all talking over with. I am sure \nwe need to hear more on the budget, but that would be one alternative. \nWe could come back after the recess at a time--when a vote is this \nclose I think I need authority to determine when the vote would take \nplace, but we would have 15 minutes of debate on that, and then we \nwould vote on the budget. So that is what we are working on. We do not \nhave it done yet.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the majority leader would yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the Senator suggesting we do the farm bill around \n2?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I say to my distinguished colleague, counterpart, we \nwould complete the debate on that and that debate would be 15 minutes \nwith Senator Gregg, 15 minutes divided between Senators Harkin and \nChambliss, a total of 30 minutes. We would do that in the next hour and \n10 minutes and then vote at 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That would be the last vote prior to--\n  Mr. REID. That, I say to my friend, we don't have resolved yet. We \nhave to work out the time on the budget. I think, even though it is \nearly Thursday and we are used to working late on Thursday and most all \nday Friday, we could make an exception and try to get out somewhat \nearly on Thursday. But we have to work that out with you folks, as to \nhow we would do the time. We could ask for a show of hands, asking if \nwe want to finish, if we should have the vote tonight. I don't think \nthe show of hands would be helpful to what I wish to accomplish. So we \nare going to try to do the second alternative, use all the time; when \nwe come back, we will have a time certain--not a time certain but \nfairly certain--and we will try to have it on Monday or Tuesday when we \nget back, to have a vote on passage of the budget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, when the Senate \nconsiders the conference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 70, the \nbudget resolution--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Can we have order in the Chamber, please. The \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the veto message on H.R. 2419.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Veto message to accompany H.R. 2419, entitled an Act to \n     provide for the continuation of agricultural programs through \n     fiscal year 2012, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: I understand under the agreement, \nwe each have 7\\1/2\\ minutes; that Senator Gregg has 15 minutes; and the \ntwo leaders have reserved 15 minutes each?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again for Senators and those staff who are \nwatching, now we are on the override of the veto of the farm bill \nconference report we passed here last week.\n  To remind everyone, that bill, as you know, passed here \noverwhelmingly 81 to 15, a remarkable margin for a farm bill. It was \nwidely supported on both sides of the aisle and by regions of the \ncountry, so we were very pleased with that outcome and that vote.\n  Of course it had passed the House with 318 votes; so again a very \nstrong vote on the bill. It went to the President. We were hoping that \nmaybe he would not veto it, but the President did exercise his \nconstitutional right and he vetoed the bill.\n  The farm bill came back to the House yesterday and the House overrode \nthe veto 316 to 108. So basically what we have before us is exactly \nwhat we voted on last week and approved with 81 votes but for one \nthing: The farm bill is missing a title.\n  Let me try to be as succinct as I can in this. What happened is when \nthe enrolling clerk on the House side enrolled the bill and sent it to \nthe President, the clerk did not put in title III, which includes the \nseveral Department of Agriculture trade programs and food assistance \nprograms for foreign countries, mainly the P.L. 480, Food for Peace \nProgram, the delivery of which goes through USAID, and other programs. \nSo the President vetoed the enrolled bill which is missing that title. \nWell, I know Senator Chambliss and I and others have had numerous phone \ncalls and conversations with Parliamentarians and others to figure this \nout. The enrolled bill is properly attested to and fully effective and \nvalid as to all of the provisions it contains. We will have to enact \ntitle III in another legislative measure. Again, I remind everyone, its \nomission was inadvertent. It was an innocent mistake; maybe \ninexcusable, but nevertheless an innocent mistake that title III was \ndropped out.\n  But for that title III, everything else in this bill is exactly what \nwe approved with 81 votes. So I am here to ask Members to vote to \noverride the President's veto and to make this bill the law of the land \nin accordance with the overwhelming wishes of both the Senate and the \nHouse.\n  This bill is a good bill, as I said earlier. It responds to needs all \nover this country, from farmers and small towns and rural areas to \nAmericans in urban areas. The largest part of the bill is nutrition and \nfood assistance. Over two-thirds of the total spending in this bill \ngoes to nutrition. This bill does more to strengthen Federal food \nassistance than any bill we have passed since George Herbert Walker \nBush was the President.\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\n  This bill does a lot for food assistance for low-income people. \nBasically all the added money above the budget baseline that we put \ninto this bill goes for nutrition. We increase the food supplies to \nfood banks. Our Nation's food banks are getting hit pretty hard. We put \n$1.2 billion into supplying them with more food. I might add, one of \nthe reasons we must enact this bill in a hurry is because food banks \nare hurting. As soon as this bill becomes law with this override, $50 \nmillion will get out immediately to our food pantries and food banks \nacross the country.\n  We also in this bill, as you know, provided more money to help \ngrowers of specialty crops, fruits and vegetables, than we ever have \nbefore. We include in this legislation a higher level of funding than \nin any previous farm bill for helping farmers and ranchers in \nconserving our natural resources, saving soil, cleaning up our water \nand our streams, protecting wildlife habitat.\n  Look at it this way: Of the combined total spending in this bill on \ncommodity and conservation programs, 41 percent of that total is \ndevoted to conservation. That is slightly more than double the highest \npercentage share for conservation in any previous farm bill.\n  The rural development title helps rural communities through a number \nof new initiatives, including a stronger broadband program, and by \ndevoting mandatory funding for water and wastewater systems to fund \nsome of the tremendous backlog of qualified applications that are on \nhold.\n  We have in this bill several important initiatives and improvements \nin programs to help beginning farmers. We improve the farm income \nprotection system in various ways, including for dairy farmers, yet \nattain budget savings in the title of the bill covering commodity \nprograms. We have a new option in here, a new reform, called the \nAverage Crop Revenue Election, or ACRE, Program. This is going to be \nvery significant for farmers to be able to choose whether to stay under \nthe current farm program or do they go to the new program of income \nprotection based on revenue.\n  I read the editorial in the Washington Post this morning and, of \ncourse, they have never editorially, as far as I know, ever supported a \nfarm bill, at least in my time here. I have to take exception to one \nthing they said in the editorial this morning. They are talking about \nthe ACRE Program, claiming how it will be some kind of boondoggle for \nfarmers. They say here:\n\n       [It] means farmers would get paid if prices fall back to \n     the historical and, for farmers, perfectly profitable norms.\n\n  If the prices that our Nation's farmers receive for their grain and \nother commodities fall back to what the Washington Post calls \n``historical norms,'' we will have tremendous economic hardship in the \ncountryside. Here is why I say that: What the Post is missing is that \nfrom 2002 to 2009, the production costs for farmers have skyrocketed. \nThe gasoline prices we are paying at the pump, farmers have got to pay \neven more for the diesel fuel for their tractors, for their combines. \nFor example, fertilizer costs for producing corn are up 141 percent in \n7 years. From 2002 to 2009, the cost of production for corn is up 22 \npercent; soybeans up 28 percent; wheat up 28 percent.\n  Now, if prices, God forbid, should fall to the levels they were \nbefore 2002, farmers will be wiped out all over this country. We will \nhave bankruptcies and families forced out of farming on a huge scale.\n  That is why we have the ACRE Program to reflect the new realities, \nthe new realities of what farmers have to pay for their fertilizer, \ntheir fuel, their equipment, their land. All of these expenses have \ngone up tremendously. We need a program that helps farmers deal with \nthose higher costs and potential volatility in market prices for \ncommodities, and that is why we put this new program in. It is a \nreform. It is one of the features of this bill that I believe will help \nfamily farms survive in America. So, again, this is a good, solid bill, \nthe same bill we voted on last week minus title III, which we will \nenact later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, as my chairman said, I think everything \nthat could be said about this bill has been said. We were on the floor \noff and on for a couple of weeks, and we, at the end of the day, after \na lot of controversial votes and whatnot, achieved a milestone in the \nSenate for farm bills; that is, we had 81 Members of the Senate who \nvoted in favor of this bill. It is not a perfect bill, but it is a very \ngood bill for any number of reasons.\n  In the commodity title, we are spending significantly less money on \nour so-called subsidy program. I refer to it as an investment by the \nGovernment in agriculture, because that is exactly what it is. We are \nnot guaranteeing farmers any kind of income. In fact, under the way \nthis bill is written, the prices being what they are at the farm gate \ntoday, very little, if any, in the way of payments is going to be going \nfrom Washington to farmers. That is the way it ought to be. That is the \nway farmers want it. They would rather get the stream of income from \nthe marketplace. Certainly that is the way we, as policymakers, want to \nsee it happen. That is what will happen.\n  We have made significant changes in the payment limit provision. We \nhave AGIs in this bill now that have never been thought of before. \nNobody ever thought we would achieve the number we did from an AGI \nstandpoint. But it is real reform. It is going to work.\n  We are also eliminating the three-entity rule. Again, if you had told \nanybody in this distinguished Senate 3 years ago that we would be \neliminating the three-entity rule in the farm bill, you would have \ngotten blank stares. Nobody ever thought that would happen, but we were \nwilling to make those kinds of reforms.\n  In the conservation title, we have expanded a number of programs, but \nwe have done something significant in the conservation title. For the \nfirst time ever we are applying payment limits to the conservation \ntitle. So the so-called millionaires that have been beneficiaries of \nthe conservation title in years past are no longer going to be able to \nparticipate in that program, and they should not.\n  I am pretty excited about the energy title. In my part of the world, \nwe do not grow corn with the abundance that the Midwest part of the \ncountry does. Therefore, we are a little bit handicapped when it comes \nto the construction and manufacturing facilities to produce ethanol. \nBecause out of the 201 ethanol-producing facilities that are in place \nor will be in place over the next 18 months, all but 2 of them are \nresourced with corn. The two that are not resourced with corn happen to \nbe resourced with cellulosic products. One of them is in my State.\n  I am very proud of the fact that we are going to have a facility in \nSoperton, GA, that is under construction right now by Range Fuels that \nis going to produce ethanol from pine trees, because I will match our \nability to grow a pine tree with anybody else in the country. It is a \nresource that is not going to increase the cost of food, which is an \nunintended consequence of the use of corn for the production of \nethanol.\n  The title I am just as excited about is the nutrition title. We are \nseeing an expansion of the nutrition title again like none of us ever \nimagined we would see in this farm bill. Most people across America \nthink because of what they read in the Washington Post and the Wall \nStreet Journal and the Atlanta Constitution that farm bills are \nstrictly payments to farmers when, in fact, about 11 percent of the \noutlays in this bill go to the commodity title which goes to farmers.\n  About 73 percent of the outlays in this bill go to the nutrition \ntitle to provide for the food stamp program, to provide for the school \nlunch program, to provide for payments to our food banks. All of those \nprograms are designed to feed people who are hungry and needy in this \ncountry. We are the most abundant country in the world from an \nagricultural standpoint. We have the ability to feed people inside of \nAmerica as well as outside of America, and we have an obligation to do \nthat. In the nutrition title, that is exactly what we are going to be \ndoing.\n  This is a bill that has been talked about an awful lot. And, again, \nit is not a perfect bill. There are some provisions in it that I wish \nwere not in it. But it is a massive piece of legislation, as is every \nfarm bill, and we have to reach compromise to be able to get a bill of \nthat massive size passed by the House and by the Senate.\n\n[[Page S4745]]\n\n  We did accommodate the White House. We negotiated very diligently \nwith the White House. We moved a long way in the direction of the White \nHouse. They did not get everything they wanted, and we did not get \neverything we wanted. At the end of the day, we passed it with a big \nvote. And the White House, unfortunately, decided we did not move far \nenough for them. Obviously that caused the President's veto to the \nbill. At the end of the day here today, we are going to have at least \n14 of the 15 titles hopefully passed into law.\n  I do not know what happened to the one title. They tell us that a \nclerk on the House side failed to include 33 pages of title III in the \nbill that was transmitted from the House to the White House.\n  Those things happen. Now it is up to us to figure out the best way to \nefficiently and in an expeditious manner fix the problem and move ahead \nto allow farmers and ranchers to have some certainty as they move into \nthe planting season of 2008.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand I have 15 minutes under the \nprior order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are here to vote on the override of some \nportion of the farm bill which the President has vetoed. First, there \nis the great irony that the bill we are voting on isn't the bill that \npassed the Senate or the House. It is some element of that bill, other \nparts of the bill having not made it to the President. That sort of \nbecomes an allegory for this entire exercise. This is a bill that \nreally doesn't do the job it should, is incomplete in the sense that it \nfails the American taxpayer and consumer, and is misguided in that it \nspends a great deal of money, perverting the marketplace relative to \nthe production of agricultural products. But we are here because of \nwhat was a bureaucratic snafu, I presume.\n  We all know the President's veto is going to be overridden, but the \nPresident was right to veto this bill. He was absolutely right. I said \nearlier--I know my colleagues take this in the sense of irony with \nwhich I make it, not in any personal way--this bill truly is a product \nof commissar politics, of the old approach that we saw years ago in \ncountries that thought that they could have a top-down management of \ntheir farm production system.\n  I said in my earlier talk, where did all the economists who worked in \nthe Soviet Union go, all those folks who sat behind desks and thought \nabout 5-year plans and how to disconnect supply from demand and how to \nset arbitrary prices which caused the Soviet Union, a nation which was \none of the great producers of agricultural products, to become \nbasically a net importer of product? Where did all those economists go \nwhen the Soviet Union failed? It appears they moved to the Midwest and \nthe South and developed our farm programs.\n  These programs have no relationship to the market or setting prices \nfor commodities, which are basically totally out of tune with the \nmarket. They have no relationship to market forces. As a result, the \nAmerican consumer ends up with a much higher bill and the short end of \nthe stick.\n  Take sugar alone. Sugar prices in this bill are at least twice the \nworld price for sugar. So the American consumer ends up getting hit for \na much higher cost for any product that uses sugar. And just about any \nfood commodity of any complexity uses sugar.\n  In addition, you have the huge effort to subsidize ethanol, which has \ndriven up dramatically the price of corn and has the effect of \nbasically creating an international incident in the area of food \navailability. We are hearing from numerous countries around the world \nthat are finding they have shortages of other commodities because the \nAmerican subsidization of ethanol has perverted the marketplace \nrelative to the production of corn. That certainly is inappropriate. So \nthe policy of this bill is not only an attack on the American consumer, \nit is basically bad policy for the world population just trying to make \nit through and avoid hunger.\n  In addition, this bill sets up all sorts of new programs, programs \nwhich make no sense on their face but which are in here because they \nhave somebody who is protecting their initiatives, their ideas, their \npurposes. We have a new program for asparagus, a new program for \nchickpeas, an initiative for a National Sheep and Goat Industry \nImprovement Center, a new program that creates a stress management \nnetwork for farmers. Then, according to the Washington Post--and I was \nnot aware of this--there is the potential for a $16 billion boondoggle \nfor agricultural products because of the new way that prices are set \nand payments are made, setting prices at their present high level, \nsetting subsidy rates at their present high level under this new \nprogram called ACRE.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the editorial of \ntoday's Washington Post which does a much better job than I of \nexplaining how outrageous this new subsidy is and how much it will cost \nthe American consumer, $16 billion.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 22, 2008]\n\n   Pasture of Plenty: You Thought You Knew How Bad the Farm Bill Was\n\n       ``Life is like a box of chocolates,'' Forrest Gump's mother \n     used to say. ``You never know what you're going to get.'' The \n     same could be said of federal agricultural legislation. \n     Arcane and often irrational, its subsidy provision can be \n     difficult to understand and, sometimes, even difficult to \n     identify. Even after Congress passed a subsidy-riddled 673-\n     page farm bill last week, with a price tag conservatively set \n     at $289 billion, it was not entirely clear just how big a \n     burden lawmakers had imposed on taxpayers. Now, however, the \n     fine print is coming into focus, and--surprise!--the bill \n     could authorize up to $16 billion more in crop subsidies than \n     previously projected, according to the Agriculture \n     Department.\n       The culprit is a new program called Average Crop Revenue \n     Election, or ACRE for short. ACRE gives farmers an \n     alternative to direct payments, which come regardless of how \n     much money they make, and other subsidies. Starting in 2009, \n     farmers can choose to trade in some of their traditional \n     subsidies in return for a government promise to make up 90 \n     percent of the difference between what they actually made \n     from farming and their usual income. In principle, this \n     provides farmers a federal safety net only in those years \n     when prices or yields fall drastically--that is, when they \n     really need one. Congress added the optional ACRE program to \n     the bill as a sop to reformers who, sensibly, wanted to \n     replace the current subsidy system with a simpler insurance-\n     style program. Such a wholesale change would, indeed, have \n     been a real reform. But since the farm bill continued direct \n     payments and other old-style subsidies, no one expected huge \n     numbers of farmers to volunteer for the new ACRE deal.\n       Then farmers got a look at the bill's formula for \n     determining benefits under ACRE. It pegs the subsidies to \n     current, record-high prices for grain, meaning farmers would \n     get paid if prices fall back to their historical and, for \n     farmers, perfectly profitable norms. A program that started \n     out as streamlined insurance policy against extraordinary \n     hardship has mutated into a possible guarantee of \n     extraordinary prosperity. Small wonder that, as The Post's \n     Dan Morgan reports, a farming blog is urging farmers to sign \n     up for ACRE, which it describes as ``lucrative beyond \n     expectations.''\n       The farm bill's defenders insist that a budgetary disaster \n     will not come to pass, because grain prices will not come \n     down much during the five years the bill will be in effect. \n     ``The program does not look excessively expensive for the \n     lifetime of the farm bill,'' said Rep. Robert W. Goodlatte \n     (Va.), the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture \n     Committee. In other words, even if they don't have to pay \n     extra for ACRE, Americans will have to pay higher food \n     prices--so they may as well get used to it. None of the \n     legislators who rushed to override President Bush's veto of \n     the bill yesterday will have the decency to blush the next \n     time they pontificate about fiscal responsibility. But we can \n     only wonder what other expensive surprise still lurk within \n     this profoundly wasteful legislation.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. This bill has a lot of substantive problems. It probably \nwill aggravate food consumption for nations around the world, their \nability to produce product, and certainly dramatically increase the \ncost of product in the United States. It perverts the marketplace so a \nproduct that might be produced more efficiently would not be produced \nmore efficiently. It spends a heck of a lot of money, $289 billion.\n  As we have seen, once again, it uses all sorts of budget gimmicks--\nwhen it was originally passed, and it will have to be replaced, or \nparts of it will because of the bureaucratic snafu--to get around the \nrules of the Senate and the\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\nHouse, for that matter, in the area of trying to discipline spending. \nThere is $18 billion worth of budget gimmicks in this bill.\n  Then we just had a new budget avoidance exercise when the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee declared that the new baseline under a new \nbudget--this bill would have violated the original baseline, as was in \nthat new budget--will now be adjusted so this bill would not violate \nthat baseline--another exercise, unfortunately, in gaming the pay-go \nrules. The budget chairman has a right to do that, but it cannot be \ndenied that is an effort to try to get around pay-go rules, as they \nshould be applied under the budget we will be passing the week after \nnext. So there is 18 billion dollars' worth of budget gimmicks in this \nbill; the worst, of course, the changing of years and the assumption \nthat some program, which we know is going to continue, will terminate \nat an arbitrary date so that you can spend the money up to that date \nand claim there is no budget failure and, then, later on, adjust it, \nput the program back in place, and avoid the budget pay-go rules--\nreally inappropriate, to say the least, in the way this has been \nhandled.\n  It is, of course, a bill that comes to the floor every 4 or 5 years. \nBut the problem is, every 4 or 5 years the American consumer gets \nbasically hit beside the head by this bill. Last time I spoke, I said \nthey get hit beside the head with a lamb chop and they end up with a \nblack eye the next day. As a result, I thought I would just stay away \nfrom that statement. But the fact is, the American consumer isn't doing \nvery well under this bill. The American taxpayer is doing worse.\n  There is a claim that there is reform in this bill which is fairly \nspecious on its face, considering all the new programs added to the \nbill, such as asparagus. One of the reforms they claim is that they are \nnot going to pay farmers who have high incomes outrageous subsidies. \nToday you can get $2.5 million theoretically.\n  Well, unfortunately, the way the bill is structured, they say that, \nbut that is not the way it works. Under this bill, a person with \n$500,000 of nonfarm income and $750,000 of farm income can still get \nthe subsidy. If they are married, their spouse can have $500,000 of \nnonfarm income and $750,000 of farm income, so they end up basically \nwith approximately the same amount of subsidy. Yet it is alleged this \nis some sort of major reform. It is not reform. It is simply an attempt \nto obfuscate the fact that these subsidies go to extremely wealthy \npeople on products that should compete in the marketplace for a price \nand should not be subsidized in the manner in which this bill \nsubsidizes.\n  Obviously, we are going to lose this vote because the way the farm \nbill is put together--and the American people should know this--one \ncommodity goes to the next commodity and says: We will vote for your \ncommodity, even though it is in my State and not in yours, as long as \nyou will vote for my commodity which is in my State but not in yours. \nYou go around the country and you pick up commodities. That is why \nasparagus has appeared here. Somebody in an asparagus district said: If \nyou will cover asparagus and give us a new subsidy, you will get my \nvote for all the other subsidies in this bill.\n  That is the way it works. It is called log rolling. That is the \nhistorical term that comes out of the 1800s. But it is not the way to \nlegislate. Certainly, it isn't a healthy way to legislate. It certainly \ntakes the concept of using the market completely out of the exercise of \ndeveloping a farm bill.\n  This farm bill runs counter to all the concepts of a free market \nsociety from which this country has benefited so dramatically and which \nwe believe to be true and effective ways to produce product and control \ncosts and to make product more cost-effective for the people who use \nit. Adam Smith was right; Karl Marx was wrong. Under this bill, one \nwould think Karl Marx was right and Adam Smith was wrong. This is top \ndown, let's manage the economy, let's set arbitrary prices that have no \nrelationship to production, supply, or demand in place of going to a \nmarket where you use supply and demand to determine what will be \nproduced.\n  I suppose if Patrick Henry were around today, his famous statement \nwould have to be modified. He would have to say: Give me asparagus or \ngive me death. That is what this bill has come down to.\n  We either get these farm subsidies and get the consumer rolled and \nthe taxpayer rolled or we don't get anything around here.\n  As a practical matter, I, obviously, know I will lose this vote. The \nPresident knew he was going to lose this vote when he vetoed the bill. \nBut he was absolutely right in doing so. It was the appropriate \ndecision. It was the fiscally responsible decision. It was also a good \ndecision from the standpoint of not only domestic policy but \ninternational policy, where we are seeing strains on production of \ncommodities for the purposes of feeding people.\n  I regret we are going down this path one more time. We have been down \nit a few times in the past. But the simple fact is, the forces that \nsupport, for example, the sugar subsidy are too strong to be able to \ngive the taxpayers a break.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Displays of approval or disapproval are not \nappropriate from the galleries.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand the leader on this side has \n15 minutes reserved; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield whatever time the Senator from North Dakota \ndesires from the leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could the Chair alert me after I have consumed 10 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be notified.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we ought to get straight world agriculture \neconomics. The Senator from New Hampshire, for whom I have high regard, \nhas been a consistent opponent of a national agriculture policy, one \nthat has produced for our country the lowest priced food in world \nhistory, measured by a share of our national income. Not only do we \nhave the lowest cost food in the history of the world as a share of our \nincome, we also have the safest supply, the most stable supply, the \nmost abundant supply. Something is working. Beyond that, he does not \ndeal with world agriculture as it is.\n  Our major competitors are the Europeans. We have about equal shares \nof the world market. But here is what they do to support their \nproducers versus what we do to support ours. They are spending $134 \nbillion to support their producers while we spend $43 billion. That is \nmore than a 3-to-1 ratio.\n\n  What happens if you pull the rug out from under our producers? Mass \nbankruptcy. It is one thing to ask our producers to go up and compete \nagainst the French farmer and the German farmer. They are happy to do \nthat. It is quite another issue to compete against the French \nGovernment and the German Government as well. That is not a fair fight. \nThat is why it is essential we have a farm policy in this country.\n  Now, my colleague on the other side said a whole series of things \nabout the cost of this bill, the scoring of this bill, that are not so. \nThis administration has said this bill costs $20 billion more than the \nbaseline. No, it does not. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice--that is independent, that is nonpartisan, that is \nprofessional--this bill costs $10 billion above the baseline. End of \nstory. What the administration is talking about and what the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is talking about are fictional numbers based on \nmade-up scorekeeping that the administration has never applied to its \nown legislation or budgets.\n  Under Congressional Budget Office scoring, our farm bill spends $10 \nbillion baseline over the budget window. That is not my number; that is \nthe number from CBO, which is nonpartisan, professional, and \nindependent.\n  The $10 billion is offset with $10 billion in outlay reductions from \nCustoms user fees. Every penny of new spending is paid for.\n  On the tax side, we are paying for agriculture tax relief with \nagriculture tax reforms, such as a reduction in the ethanol credit and \nSchedule F reforms to limit the use of farming losses to\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\nshelter off-farm income. There is no tax increase.\n  The administration argues the farm bill contains timing shifts. That \nis true. But that is also true of almost all major legislation dealing \nwith revenues or mandatory spending. That is what we do to true up the \nnumbers between the timeframes where various budget requirements are \nimposed. The simple fact is, when you do major reform such as we are \ndoing in this bill, you change programs, you change payment schedules. \nThat is precisely what one would expect. These changes have real-world \nconsequences for farmers. They are making crop insurance payments \nearlier, for example, under this bill, and getting farm program \npayments later. That has a real-world cost.\n  The administration has repeatedly used timing shifts, itself, in \nlegislation it has proposed. In fact, the timing shifts in this bill \npale in comparison to the cost of sunsetting the tax cuts which the \nPresident had in his tax packages repeatedly.\n  Now, in terms of where the money goes, 66 percent of the money in \nthis bill goes for nutrition--two-thirds. Nine percent goes for \nconservation. Only 14 percent--actually, less than 14 percent--goes for \nthe so-called commodities. That is a dramatic reduction from the last \nfarm bill. In the last farm bill, three-quarters of 1 percent of the \nFederal budget went to support commodities. In this bill, it is one-\nquarter of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget going to support \nfarmers and ranchers. That is a dramatic change.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire mocked the reform elements in the \nbill. They are not to be mocked. They are very real. We have a dramatic \nreduction in the adjusted gross income limits that will apply in order \nto qualify for farm program payments. One example: Nonfarm income used \nto be a $2.5 million limit. It is reduced to $500,000 in this bill.\n  We require direct attribution in this bill. That means it has to be a \nliving, breathing human being collecting these payments; no paper \nentities. We have eliminated the three-entity rule that was \nconsistently used to get around farm program limits. We have reduced \ndirect payments by $300 million. We have reformed Schedule F to prevent \nthe abusive use of nonoperating losses to shield nonfarm income--a \nsavings of over $450 million. We have crop insurance reform of over \n$5.6 billion. We have decreased the corn ethanol support by $1.2 \nbillion.\n  We have eliminated these so-called cowboy starter kits where people \ndown in certain States were selling farm and ranchland off as \nsubdivisions and having a farm program payment go with those lots, \nthose 10-acre lots. We brought a screeching halt to that abuse.\n  The disaster assistance in this bill is budgeted and paid for. In the \nlast 3 years, every State in the Nation has received disaster \npayments--every State--none of it budgeted for, none of it paid for. \nThese disaster provisions are budgeted and paid for, and they further \nreform disasters because in the past you could have losses on one part \nof your operation, even though you had gains on the rest of it, and \nstill get a disaster payment. Under this proposal, under this new law, \nif you have not had losses on your whole farm operation--disaster \nlosses on your whole farm operation--you are not going to get a \ndisaster payment.\n  I wish the Washington Post, when they write their editorials, would \nbother to read the legislation they are critiquing because clearly they \ndo not know what they are writing about.\n  The final point I want to make: The Senator from New Hampshire, the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, who is my friend, somebody for \nwhom I have respect and affection, suggests over and over that somehow \nthis is not paid for, that it is going to add to the deficit. No. The \nCongressional Budget Office, who are the official scorekeepers, and the \nJoint Committee on Taxation have scored this bill. This is what they \nsay. We reduce the deficit over 5 years by $67 million; over 10 years, \nby $110 million. This bill is fully pay-go compliant--fully. This bill \nis paid for. It is paid for without a tax increase.\n  One final point: The Washington Post wrote another egregious story \nthe other day saying: Oh, there is this $16 billion additional cost \nthat might be out there. Yes, and elephants fly. Look, when are they \ngoing to get objective in their reporting at the Washington Post? They \nhave suggested there might be this $16 billion cost. Really? There also \nmight be $16 billion of savings. A lot of things could happen. You \nknow--lightning strikes. A lot of things could happen.\n  Look at the last farm bill. We brought that in $17 billion in the \ncommodity provisions below what was forecast at the time. Did the \nWashington Post ever write a story about that? Did they ever? No.\n  This bill is paid for. It is paid for without a tax increase. The \nprofessional scoring of this legislation is that it is $10 billion over \nbaseline, completely paid for, without a tax increase.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the importance of the \nnutrition assistance title of the farm bill. The bill goes a long way \ntoward ensuring that families in America will have food on their table, \neven when times are tough. The bill also clarifies that their rights to \ncertain nutrition services are enforceable.\n  Sections 4116 through 4118 of the bill specifically reinforce \nCongress's longstanding intention that the Food Stamp Act's provisions \nand its regulations are fully enforceable and should be enforced. The \ncourts have historically and correctly understood Congress's intent \nthat low-income households have the right to enforce these provisions.\n  The language of the Food Stamp Act and its implementing regulations--\nparts 271, 272, 273, and so on--have the kind of clear language \nrequired for judicial enforcement. We made sure that they are \nmandatory, not aspirational, and that they set out requirements for how \neach individual is to be treated, not general program-wide goals. They \nclearly define the benefited class as low-income people receiving or \nseeking food assistance. Nothing in the act or regulations suggests \nthat substantial compliance overall excuses denying any individual the \nbenefit of these rules.\n  Along with oversight by the Department of Agriculture, lawsuits by \nfamilies participating in food stamps are one of the ways we can ensure \nthe Food Stamp Program fulfills its purpose. Indeed, it is partly \nbecause applicants and recipients can and do bring lawsuits to enforce \nprogram rules that the Department has not been required to withhold \nfunds from States to enforce service standards in the program.\n  This legislation also makes explicit that various civil rights laws \nare binding in the Food Stamp Program. This is not a change--these laws \nand their regulations have applied since they were written, and both \nhave been intended to be fully enforceable. This legislation just \nreiterates a point that we hope and believe was already clear.\n  None of this would have been a question until two recent, unfortunate \ncourt decisions. The first case, Reynolds, comes from the Second \nCircuit. It applied a standard of analysis that departed from all prior \nFederal court precedent and held that applicants and recipients could \nhold a state accountable for the maladministration of the program by \nlocal food stamp agencies only in the rarest of circumstances. The act \nis and has been clear that States are responsible for full compliance \nwith all applicable regulations. States' responsibility is no less \nbecause they have chosen to have counties or other local agencies \noperate the program for them. The option of local administration exists \nonly as a courtesy or convenience to the States, not to reduce their \naccountability. The State is just as responsible for what the local \nagency does as if the State agency performed those acts itself. This \nlegislation emphasizes that point.\n  In the other case, called Almendarez, a Federal district court \nrefused to consider a suit brought by low-income people who need \nassistance in a language other than English to apply for food stamps. \nThe Department's regulations clearly provide rights for families that \nneed language assistance. Now the act explicitly confirms that those \nregulations are enforceable. Future cases can be decided on the merits, \nas they should be.\n  This bipartisan legislation goes a long way toward providing food for \nworking families, and providing the security of knowing that help is \nenforceable by law. I thank the chairman and\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\nthe committee for their tremendous work.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: How much time \nremains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Iowa will hold for a \nsecond--the Republican leader has 14 minutes, the Senator from New \nHampshire has 2\\1/2\\ minutes, the majority side has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. President, I understand that, obviously, in a quorum call the \ntime is taken evenly off of both sides. Since we have 11 minutes left, \nI yield myself 4 minutes of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, would the Chair please remind this Senator \nwhen his 4 minutes have elapsed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so notified.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to respond to a couple things my \nfriend from New Hampshire said. He talked about the sugar provisions in \nthe bill and the support price of sugar, that it is over world prices. \nI always point out to people that when you go in a restaurant, or \nanywhere you go to eat, the sugar is free. You get these little packs \nof sugar wherever you go. You go to Starbucks, you get free sugar. You \ngo to the airport, and you go down and get a cup of coffee, or \nsomething like that, there is free sugar. It cannot get much cheaper \nthan that.\n  Does anyone believe if we were to drop these sugar support prices \ndown about 50 percent--which is what would happen with what the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire wishes to have happen--do you believe candy prices \nare going to go down? Do you believe food prices are going to go \ndown? Come on. It just means that the manufacturers, the processors \nwill just make more profits, that is all, and our nation's sugar \nfarmers won't. So you can't get much cheaper than free when it comes to \nsugar when you go into your restaurants and coffee shops and places \nsuch as that.\n\n  The next thing the Senator talked about is the $16 billion that the \nWashington Post keeps talking about in new spending because of this new \nprogram, this new option we have, this new reform program. That is a \ndoom's day scenario. Sure, if the bottom falls, if commodity prices \nfall 40 percent, yes, we could see significant expenditures. But even \nthe Department of Agriculture in this administration has said they \ndon't expect prices to decline much if at all over the next 12 to 18 \nmonths. As pointed out earlier, because of the increased prices of \nfertilizer, fuel, equipment--all of the input costs of agriculture--if \nthese prices drop to where they were 8 years ago, Lord help us. We \nwould have real economic hardship in rural America. So we have this new \nprogram in the bill to help farmers deal with the new economic \nrealities in agriculture.\n  So, yes, you can take a doom's day scenario, but we don't plan our \nlives around the fact that we have perhaps a 1 in 40 million chance of \ngetting hit by an asteroid. We don't plan our daily excursions by the \nfact that we face on the order of a 1 in 50,000 chance that we could \nget hit by a tornado or struck by lightning. Of course you can always \nhave doom's day scenarios. That is not how we crafted this new program \nnor is it a reasonable way to judge it. We planned it in relation to \nwhat is really happening in agriculture.\n  The last thing the Senator said was something about logrolling, where \nsome members will help other commodities or regions and then in return \nmembers who have been helped will support policy for other commodities \nin a different area. That is a total distortion of how this process \nworks. The fact is, in my area in Iowa, we don't grow cotton and \npeanuts, let's face it. We just don't. I don't have much expertise in \nthat area, to be honest about it, so I rely upon Senator Chambliss or \nSenator Cochran or those Members from other parts of the country who \nknow their agriculture. They know those commodities. So we rely upon \ntheir expertise. You bet we do. I hope they rely a little bit on our \nexpertise when it comes to crops such as wheat and corn and soybeans \nand other crops. The same goes for ranches. The distinguished Presiding \nOfficer comes from an area of the country where they have ranches. We \ndon't have ranches in Iowa, so I rely upon the Presiding Officer, who \nis on the Agriculture Committee and who knows a lot about ranching and \nwhat it means in his part of the country and what it means to have \nlivestock and livestock producers who run ranches. The Presiding \nOfficer also knows what it means for this nation to shift to new and \nrenewable forms of energy, including cellulosic energy, which he has \nbeen a leader on. So we rely upon each other for this kind of \nexpertise. That is not logrolling; that is just recognizing that \ndifferent Senators who come from different parts of the country have \ndifferent expertise, and they can bring that expertise to the \nAgriculture Committee. That is exactly how we develop these farm bills. \nIt is not logrolling, it is simply recognizing that we want this \nlegislation to work effectively everywhere across the nation, \nregardless of the commodities grown or region involved, and to cover \nthe whole broad range of issues and challenges encompassed in this \nbill.\n  That is why I think we have a very good bill here. As my friend \nSenator Chambliss said, of course we don't agree with every single \nthing in it, but that is the art of legislation, which is to compromise \nand to work things out so that we can get good bipartisan support and \nmultiregional support. We did that in this farm bill. You can't get \nmuch more bipartisan than 81 votes in the Senate or 318 votes in the \nHouse. When you have that kind of overwhelming support, then you know \nyou probably have a good bill.\n  So, again, I urge Senators to vote to override the President's veto.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n                     FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENERGY USE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator Bingaman and I will be introducing \nin the Senate today a resolution to express the sense of the Senate \nregarding the use of gasoline and other fuels by the departments and \nagencies of the Federal Government. We simply refer to all of the \nproblems we see every morning, as we get up, in the papers and on the \ntelevision about how families are coping with this gas problem. We \nsimply say in a respectful way in the last paragraph--I will read it:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     require all Federal departments and agencies to take \n     initiatives to reduce daily consumption of gasoline and other \n     fuels by departments and agencies.\n\n  I thank my colleagues. The full text will be available to all Members \nthis afternoon. It is not as if we will be able to vote on this, but it \nwill be some message to take back home that you are in support of it.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I request to be added as an original \ncosponsor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I also request to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, now that we have had this vote on the \nveto of the conference report, none of us had wanted to have to \noverride a veto. As we move ahead now, because of the technicality and \nthe little glitch that we have had, we are not sure where we are going \nto be when we come back, but there is going to be, possibly, the chance \nthat we are going to have to take up the full bill again as the House \ndid and passed it with a big vote. Over the next several days, I hope \nmaybe these waters will smooth out, and we can move ahead with the \nconcurrence of the White House so farmers and ranchers will have some \ndependability on what type of programs we are going to have out there \nfor them.\n  Let me say again to my chairman, Senator Harkin, it has been a \npleasure to work with him and Senator Conrad, who has been such a great \nally in this process. It was great leadership to get us to where we are \nnow. Thank you on behalf of all farmers across America. Senator Baucus \nand Senator Grassley have been so valuable in our process. We named all \nthe staff the other day, but we wouldn't be where we are without them.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and everybody have a safe holiday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from Iowa \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks made \nby my good friend from Georgia, Senator Chambliss. This has been a long \neffort. We worked very hard on this bill. I wish to reassure Senators, \nthis is a good bill. I know there are some editorials out there written \nabout it in the Washington Post and other publications. That is all \npart of the process of debating and enacting legislation. But you have \nto think, a lot of those editorials are written by those who likely \nhave never supported a farm bill anyway, so there you go. It is like \nanything else, is this bill exactly what I would have wanted or Senator \nChambliss would have wanted or Senator Conrad would have wanted or \nanybody else? No. But that is the art of legislation. It requires \ncooperation, bipartisanship, compromise, and getting legislation \nthrough that benefits all of our country.\n  As I have said many times, this farm bill benefits everyone from \nfarmers and ranchers, people in small towns such as my hometown of \nCumming, population of 162, to people who live in New York City.\n  The fact that we had 82 votes now on the override--81 before on the \nconference report on the bill--and the overwhelming votes in the House, \nI believe indicates people understand this is a broad bill that covers \nevery American--not just farmers, not just ranchers but everyone. It is \ngood for our country, good for our future. It is a bill that will make \nsure we will continue to have an abundant, safe, affordable supply of \nfood for our people in this country, that we help low-income families \nput food on their tables and that we help farmers and ranchers conserve \nand protect our nation's priceless resources for present and future \ngenerations.\n  This bill helps us move ahead to producing energy from cellulosic \nmaterials--we have laid the foundation for having that in the future. \nJust as we laid the foundation before for grain-based ethanol, now we \nhave laid the foundation for cellulose-based ethanol in the future.\n  It is a good bill, good for America. Again, I thank Senator \nChambliss, first, for when he was chairman actually starting this \nprocess and then working together to get this bill through to its \nconclusion; Senator Conrad, who has been such a valuable ally in this \neffort, bringing the expertise that he has as the budget chairman and, \nas I often said, making sure we keep on track. I have often said, in \nwriting legislation if you do something here that affects something \nthere and that affects something else, the Budget Committee and the \nbudget chairman have the knowledge and the expertise to know the budget \nimpact of such actions. It has been an invaluable resource to us, to \nhave that expertise of Senator Conrad on this committee and during this \nwhole debate and development of this farm bill.\n  I will also thank, again, Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley, our \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, who worked so \nclosely with us to develop this legislation and make sure we had the \nproper funding so we could get this bill through. They were invaluable \nhelping us to get this bill finally through.\n  I wish to make sure there is no doubt in anyone's mind now--14 of the \n15 titles in the farm bill conference report are now law. We do not \nrequire anybody else's signature; 14 of the 15 titles are now the law \nof the land. As Senator Chambliss said, we do have this one little \nglitch--evidently an innocent mistake, a clerical error that title III \nwas not included. We will deal with that at some other point. I don't \nknow exactly when, but that should not be much of a problem, since it \nwas simply a clerical error. We will take care of that.\n  I want people to know we have been in contact with both USDA and \nUSAID, the Agency for International Development. They told my staff \nbasically they could get by for a couple of weeks without our having to \ndo more today. We will have to move ahead as soon as we can, perhaps \nthat will not be until right after the recess, so our Pub. L. 480 \nprograms and our development assistance programs, our market access \nprogram, which is so important for our fruits and vegetables, specialty \ncrops and other programs in the trade title are taken care of.\n  Again, I thank everyone. As Senator Chambliss said, we have already \nthanked our staff, but I don't know if we can thank them enough. They \nhave hung in every day on this.\n  I was going to say now they can take a vacation, but they have to \nwait until this other title gets taken care of; but sometime soon our \nstaffs will be able to take a break.\n  Mr. President, I would like to expand upon my remarks on the \nnutrition title\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\nof the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 so that I may provide \nmy colleagues with more information about the very important changes \nmade in the nutrition title, particularly to the Food Stamp Program. \nThe Food Stamp Program is the single most important antihunger program \nin our Nation, helping millions of families, seniors, and people with \ndisabilities afford an adequate diet. It is our country's largest child \nnutrition program and serves as a critical work support program, \nenabling low-income working families to make ends meet and put food on \nthe table every month.\n  I know that many Senators have not had the opportunity to pore over \nthe details of the legislative language and conference report for the \nnutrition title. So let me take this opportunity to provide some \nbackground on what has been accomplished in the nutrition area of this \nbill.\n  The conference report makes major investments and improvements in the \nFood Stamp Program in this bill--starting with changing the name of the \nprogram to the ``Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program'' or \n``SNAP.'' The change reflects the reality that food assistance benefits \nare no longer ``stamps'' but have been updated and modernized and are \nnow provided on special cards, like the debit or credit cards that most \nAmericans carry in their wallets. For the purposes of my remarks today, \nI will use the term ``Food Stamp Program'' throughout my comments one \nlast time before this historic change is made.\n  One of the primary goals for the Food Stamp Program was to end the \ndecades of erosion in the purchasing power of food stamp benefits. \nBecause of harmful cuts to the program enacted in the midnineties, with \neach passing year the purchasing power of most households' benefits has \nactually decreased. The biggest annual cut, which has so far cumulated \nin about $25 less in food assistance each month for the typical working \nfamily, was from a freeze to the program's standard deduction. This cut \nhas affected about 10 million people a year, including many low-income \nworking families with children, senior citizens living on a fixed \nincome, and persons with disabilities.\n  The largest benefit improvement in this bill is an increase in the \nstandard deduction, which has been frozen for households of three or \nfewer people for over 10 years, and end any future erosion in its value \nby inflating the deduction each year. The inflated amounts will be \ncalculated based on the previous year's unrounded amount, so over time \nwe will not lose any more ground to inflation. This change will improve \nbenefits for about 13 million people and provide a typical working \nfamily an additional $6 a month in food assistance in 2009, rising to \n$17 a month by 2012.\n  Similarly, because it was not adjusted for inflation, the $10 monthly \nminimum food assistance benefit purchases only about one-third as much \nfood today as it did when it was set more than 30 years ago. The \nminimum benefit is set at 8 percent of the thrifty food plan, rounded \nto the nearest whole dollar. This will mean it will be about $14 per \nmonth in 2009--almost a 50-percent increase. The Thrifty Food Plan is \nautomatically indexed for inflation. As a result, the minimum benefit \nwill maintain its purchasing power. And, because the Thrifty Food Plan \nis set at different levels for high-cost areas like Alaska and Hawaii, \na new and slightly higher minimum food assistance benefit will be \nprovided in those areas. For example, in fiscal year 2009 the Hawaii \nminimum benefit level will be $22 a month. Additionally, about 15 \nStates have special combined application projects where SSI recipients \nreceive standardized benefits. I expect USDA will reevaluate the cost-\nneutrality of these projects so that these households also can receive \nhigher standardized benefit amounts to account for the higher monthly \nminimum benefit and standard deduction levels.\n  The conference report ends erosion in other areas as well, including \nthe dependent care deduction and asset limit, about which I will speak \nmore briefly, but also the commodities for The Emergency Food \nAssistance Program, TEFAP, and grants for community food projects and \nfruits and vegetables in schools. For the first time since I have been \nworking on farm bills, we have clearly established the principle that \nthe value of benefits in our nutritional help for low-income families \nand individuals should not erode over time, just as they do not in our \nincome tax code or the Social Security and Medicare Programs. This is a \nremarkable achievement.\n  Another core principle that is addressed in this bill is that \nbuilding savings and accumulating assets is an important path to \nfinancial independence. And here I want to especially thank the ranking \nmember, Senator Chambliss, for his leadership. Many agree that it is \ncounterproductive to discourage savings by forcing people to liquidate \ntheir retirement savings or other financial assets when they lose their \njobs and need to turn to food assistance to feed their families. \nPolicymakers from across the political spectrum agree that asset \ndevelopment is important to helping low-income Americans make a \npermanent transition out of poverty as well as avoiding it in their \nlater years. After all, a family does not spend its way out of poverty. \nQuite the opposite, most families build a path to financial security on \nthe foundation of assets, whether it be a home, a small business, or \nretirement savings.\n  This bill ensures that all retirement accounts and education savings \naccounts are excluded from a household's financial assets when \ndetermining whether or not they are eligible for food assistance. And \nfor the first time in nearly two decades the $2,000 and $3,000 asset \nlimits will be adjusted for inflation each year.\n  It is also important to note what the Congress did not do in the \nasset area. The administration proposed eliminating a State option \ncalled expanded categorical eligibility which allows States to conform \nthe food stamp asset rules to those used in a TANF-funded benefit, and \nproposed using those savings to finance the exclusion of retirement \naccounts from eligibility determinations. Both the House and Senate \nrejected that approach because of a belief that some assets, such as \nretirement funds, should be excluded from the program on a national \nbasis.\n  In addition, by leaving the existing State option on categorical \neligibility in place, States have the full flexibility to set their own \nasset policy. I strongly encourage USDA to work with States to expand \nthe use of this State option beyond the 15 States that thus far have \nexpanded categorical eligibility. States with nearly 40 percent of the \nfood stamp caseload do not currently use the national asset policy. I \nhope that in the coming months and years we will see more and more \nStates take the option.\n  Another major improvement in this bill supports working families by \nallowing them to deduct the full amount of their childcare expenses \nfrom their income for purposes of food assistance eligibility and \nbenefit determinations. The current cap on the dependent care deduction \nhas not been raised in 15 years, but child care costs have continued to \ngrow. Even when a low-income working family gets help paying for child \ncare, the family's share, or copayment, can be substantial. Now, \nbecause of changes in this bill, the amount of food assistance that a \nfamily receives will reflect the actual child care costs families pay \nto be able to hold down their jobs. By lifting the cap, families \neligible for the deduction will be able to deduct the full value of \ntheir childcare costs, rather than just a portion of the costs. The \nchange would provide an average of almost $500 a year--more than $40 a \nmonth--to approximately 100,000 households that pay high childcare \ncosts.\n  This change was made cognizant of current USDA policy on the \nchildcare deduction, which takes a broad view of what constitutes a \ndependent care cost, defers to parents about what is appropriate \nchildcare, and lets States determine how to set verification policy. \nThis proposal was part of USDA's original farm bill proposal and they \nhave given us every reason to believe they will continue these policies \nand do nothing that would limit what is deductible or the amount \nfamilies may deduct.\n  For households that apply or recertify their eligibility after \nOctober 1, 2008, the dependent care cap will no longer be in effect. We \nexpect that States will notify households already participating in the \nprogram with dependent care expenses at or above the\n\n[[Page S4751]]\n\ncurrent cap about the policy change. These households should be given \nthe opportunity to receive the higher dependent care deduction that \ncorresponds to their full costs as soon as the provision takes effect. \nA benefit increase for these households however, is their option. In no \ncase should a household have its benefits terminated or reduced for not \nresponding to paperwork requesting verification for the amount of \nchildcare costs they have above the current cap. In two areas, this \nbill builds upon the very successful State options provided in the 2002 \nfarm bill. These simplifications have made the program less burdensome \non States agencies and families alike, have helped to keep low-income \nhouseholds connected to the Food Stamp Program, and have been a major \nfactor in the sustained drop in State food assistance error rates.\n  The 2002 farm bill allowed States to extend ``simplified'' reporting \nrules to most households. Some 48 States and the District of Columbia \nhave adopted this popular State option, which dramatically simplifies \nthe rules for how many food stamp participants inform the State about \nchanges in their income and other circumstances.\n  Unfortunately, due to an oversight in the 2002 bill, States are not \nallowed to apply simplified reporting to several categories of \nhouseholds, such as households with only elderly or disabled members. \nUSDA wisely, through guidance and in its proposed regulation, allowed \nStates to extend the option to some households that might be excluded, \nsuch as homeless households and migrant and seasonal farmworkers. This \nbill specifically allows these households to be included in simplified \nreporting and extends the State option to households with only elderly \nand disabled members, so long as States extend the simplified option \nfor 1 year rather than 6 months for such households to reflect the fact \nthat many of them live on fixed incomes and have stable living \nsituations and thus do not have many changes to report. In fact \nimposing 6 month reports on these households would make them worse off \nby putting their food assistance at risk more often than is now the \ncase.\n  This change will allow States to simplify their operations and reduce \nconfusion, by having just one reporting system with common forms, staff \ntraining, and other rules. I urge USDA to implement this provision and \nthe underlying simplified reporting option in a way that allows it to \nachieve its full intent of minimizing the number of changes that \nhouseholds need to report and that States need to respond to, whether \nthose changes are for food stamps or for another program that the State \nadministers along with the Food Stamp Program. Simplified reporting \ncannot be simple if USDA allows exceptions to our basic principle that \nchanges should only be made to the case if a household reports that \ntheir income exceeds the gross income limit.\n  Another popular and successful provision from the 2002 farm bill gave \nStates the option to provide 5 months of transitional food assistance \nto families that leave welfare. We did this not only because we wanted \nto reduce the paperwork burden but also to keep eligible families \nconnected to food assistance when they left welfare for work. This is \nimportant because we know that, for families who are leaving welfare \nfor employment, the first couple of months are particularly vulnerable. \nHaving work supports such as food assistance help them to weather this \nperiod and actually decreases the likelihood that they will return to \ncash assistance.\n  The 2002 farm bill made this State option available to families that \nleave Federal TANF-funded cash assistance programs. Since then, some \nStates have established separate State-funded cash assistance programs \nfor certain groups of poor families with children. These State programs \ngive greater flexibility to States to develop services and supports \nthat can serve these families appropriately.\n  This bill extends to States the option to provide transitional food \nassistance to individuals participating in these State-funded public \nassistance programs. Several States have specifically indicated that \nthis change will be beneficial to them and the families with children \nthat they serve.\n  For all of these benefit improvements, I expect USDA to implement the \nprovisions in a way that is sensitive to the needs of the State \nagencies that administer the program. It is with some disappointment \nand disbelief that I note that the administration still has not yet \nissued final regulations for the 2002 farm bill's food stamp \nprovisions. In implementing this bill I urge USDA to provide \nsufficient, flexible guidance to States in a timely manner. One of the \nhelpful implementing policies USDA allowed in 2002 was to extend the \n120-day quality control hold harmless protections to provisions that \nare State options, such as simplified reporting and transitional food \nstamps. I expect USDA to allow that policy for this farm bill as well.\n  In addition to major improvements in the benefit levels and rules, \nthe nutrition title contains numerous program oversight and integrity \nprovisions, as well as provisions that address basic program \noperations.\n  As I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, this bill finalizes the \nreplacement of paper coupons in favor of the electronic benefits on \nplastic cards that are now the way people access their food assistance \nacross the country. The bill prohibits States from issuing any new \ncoupons and provides that existing coupons shall be redeemable for only \n1 year from the date this bill is enacted. This is a minor change in \nthe operation of the program, since no State currently issues coupons \nand fewer are redeemed each month. Nonetheless, the change required \nnumerous technical and conforming revisions in the statute to purge the \nact of ``coupons'' and other trappings of the old system. No policy \nchanges are intended in making these revisions other than to reflect \nthe existing reality. For example, in replacing the word ``coupons'' \nwith ``benefits'' Congress did not intend to change policy beyond \nsimply recognizing that coupons do not exist anymore. The term \n``benefits'' refers to the food voucher-like benefits that households \nreceive on electronic benefit transfer cards, EBT, but does not include \nauxiliary activities under the act, such as nutrition education or food \nstamp employment and training services.\n  Despite the overwhelming success of electronic benefits in \nmodernizing benefit delivery, reducing retailer fraud, and removing a \nlarge source of stigma for recipients, there is one area where there \nremain concerns about EBT benefits, and this bill has tried to address \nthe concern. Under the old food stamp coupon system, some households, \nespecially seniors who qualify for small benefits, could store up those \nsmaller amounts and use several months' worth in one shopping trip or \nfor a special occasion, such as a holiday gathering. With food stamp \ncoupons there was no deadline for how long they were good for.\n  Under EBT systems, however, some States have moved households' \nbenefits ``offline'' after as few as 3 months if there is no activity \nin the account. This can be a problem for households that receive small \nbenefits and want to store them up for a special supermarket trip.\n  So this bill strikes a balance. It allows States to move a \nhousehold's benefits offline if the household has not accessed the EBT \naccount for 6 months. But the State will be required to notify the \nhousehold of this step and to reinstate its benefits within 48 hours if \nthe household makes a request.\n  I expect States to make the process for recovering benefits after \nthey have been moved offline easy for households. Any inquiry about \nfood assistance, or general request for assistance from a household \nthat has had benefits moved offline, should be considered a request for \nreinstatement of lost benefits. In other words, households should not \nhave to contact a particular phone number or ask for some complicated \nreinstatement option in order to get benefits restored to their \naccounts. Rather, eligibility workers and local office or call center \nemployees should assist households and should help them to initiate the \nprocess of reinstating their benefits.\n  I recognize that some States may need to renegotiate the terms of \ntheir EBT contracts, and I urge USDA to work with States to implement \nthe provision as quickly as possible given the time constraints set by \nthe effective date constraints.\n  This bill also responds to another benefit issuance matter that has \ncome\n\n[[Page S4752]]\n\nup recently in Michigan and in other places over the years. States \ncurrently issue food stamps in one monthly installment for each \nhousehold. They may, and usually do, ``stagger'' food stamps by issuing \nthe month's food stamps to different households on different days of \nthe month, for example, based on the last digit of the household head's \nSocial Security number. This practice spreads out the state's workload \nand helps supermarkets smooth out the demand for food.\n  Some States--most recently Michigan--have faced pressure from \nretailers and others to divide each individual households' monthly \nallotment into two or more issuances over the month. I do not support \nsuch a change and was surprised to learn that the law permitted it. \nDividing households' monthly food stamp allotments could prevent some \nhouseholds from making large buying trips or from purchasing large, \neconomy-size containers of staple foods. It also would be burdensome on \nhouseholds with small benefit amounts--such as seniors--because they \nwould have to use their food assistance EBT card at multiple shopping \ntrips during the month instead of only one. In fact, the Michigan \nDepartment of Human Services polled current food assistance recipients \nabout such a potential change and learned that recipients strongly \nopposed splitting food assistance benefits into a twice-monthly \nallotment.\n  The bill includes a provision that would prevent States from dividing \nmonthly allotments. No other policy changes are envisioned. The bill \ndoes not intend to change the rules with respect to the issuance of \nexpedited benefits, the proration of benefits for partial months, the \nissuance of supplemental benefits in the event a benefit correction is \nneeded, the way that people who reside, or formerly resided, in drug or \nalcohol addiction treatment facilities receive food assistance, or any \nother area.\n  The nutrition title also clarifies a provision that has inadvertently \ndenied food assistance benefits to innocent people. Individuals who are \nbeing actively pursued by law enforcement for outstanding felony \ncharges or for violations of probation or parole are not eligible for \nfood assistance benefits. This rule appropriately ensures that \nfugitives do not receive public support.\n  However, in practice, this rule occasionally denies food assistance \nto the wrong people--innocent people whose identities may have been \nstolen by criminals or those whose offenses were so minor or so long \nago that law enforcement has no interest in pursuing them. If the \nissuing authority does not care to apprehend the applicant when \nnotified of his or her whereabouts, there is no public purpose served \nby denying food assistance benefits.\n  Unfortunately, inadequate guidance to States has resulted in exactly \nthat. This provision would correct this by requiring USDA to clarify \nthe terms used and make sure that States are not incorrectly \ndisqualifying needy people who are not being actively pursued by law \nenforcement authorities.\n  One important area of the bill has not gotten a lot attention. It has \nto do with our own, as well as USDA's oversight of State administration \nof the program. Several provisions in the nutrition title are included \nto improve oversight of States with respect to computer systems, \neligibility processes, and access to benefits.\n  For example, the bill requires States to adequately test and pilot \nnew computer systems. I do not wish to see another instance of a State \nimplementing a multimillion dollar computer system that does not work, \nand which USDA knew would not work. Time and time again, I have read \nabout computer systems that do not work and either cause families to \nwait 3 months for food stamps or that issue benefits inaccurately. That \nis unacceptable management of the program. USDA must demand adequate \ntesting and hold States, not clients, accountable for any mistakes in \nbenefits when there is a major systems failure.\n  The bill also includes a provision that was proposed by USDA to \nincrease the penalties on States if, despite these measures, a ``major \nsystems failure'' nonetheless occurs. If the Secretary determines that \noverissuances have occurred because of a ``major systems failure,'' the \nStates, rather than households, as is usually the case, are to be \nliable to repay the Federal Government for the cost of the \noverissuance. This is entirely appropriate because the mistake is \nclearly not the household's fault, and their ability to purchase food \nshould not be compromised because of the State's egregious mistakes. \nWhen major State problems occur, the State's energy and resources \nshould be focused on fixing the problem, not on collecting from low-\nincome households that had no role in the mistake.\n  New automated systems are not the only program area that requires \nmore oversight, monitoring, and enforcement of standards. States are \nnow using online applications, conducting business with clients over \nthe phone, and in some cases closing local offices and reducing staff \nas a result of these changes. New technologies present enormous \nopportunities to improve customer service, but they also carry risks if \nthe technology does not work or the State agency lacks sufficient \noversight. The bill is, in part, responding to a recent GAO report that \nfound that USDA has not collected sufficient information on the effects \nof alternative methods of benefit delivery on program access, payment \naccuracy, and administrative costs. The bill requires USDA to set \nstandards for identifying when States are making major changes in their \noperations and for States to notify USDA and report on the effect these \nchanges have on program integrity and households' access to benefits.\n  Though the provision of which I am speaking, section 4116 does not \nspecifically pertain to the privatization of the Food Stamp Program, it \ndoes have particular relevance given recent efforts by two States, \nTexas and Indiana, to privatize major components of their food \nassistance delivery mechanism. Prior to the approval by the Food and \nNutrition Service of both the Texas contract and the Indiana contract, \nI communicated extensively with the Food and Nutrition Service by \nletter as to the kinds and manner of data collection that I deemed \ncritical in each instance. I continue to be extremely concerned that \nUSDA is not properly monitoring those projects, as well as other State \nefforts to transform the way that services are delivered with respect \nto how these new systems are affecting the most vulnerable members of \nour society. Because that correspondence was extensive and because it \nis in the records of USDA, I will not submit it here for the record. I \nwould note however, that in implementing section 4116 of the conference \nreport, I expect USDA to closely review my prior correspondence \nregarding the Texas and Indiana contracts regarding what kinds of \ninformation should be collected. In particular, I expect USDA to review \nmy letter to Secretary Johanns sent on January 19, 2006. That letter in \nparticular clearly laid out expectations as to proper evaluation \ncriteria, especially as they pertained to program access for certain \nvulnerable populations, such as individuals with disabilities and those \nwith limited-English proficiency.\n  I would also like to note that USDA has thus far refused, both in the \ncase of Texas and the case of Indiana, to gather appropriate quality \ncontrol data in the specific geographic areas that were initially \nrolled out for testing. In those cases, I asked USDA to gather quality \ncontrol data that was specific to the geographical area that was being \ninitially rolled out so that a comparison could be made to the rest of \nthe State that was still operating under normal parameters, and I asked \nUSDA to gather data that would allow for a timely evaluation of the \npilot area. USDA responded that this was not possible because quality \ncontrol data is not gathered for substate geographical areas and \nquality control data is not available for evaluation until many months \nafter it is first gathered.\n  This provision allows USDA to rectify this situation and, in addition \nto other reporting measures, I fully expect USDA, in implementing this \nprovision, to ensure that quality control data is gathered when there \nare major changes in program design that allows for comparison of \nsubstate areas that are being tested and which allows for the timely \nuse of the State-reported data in evaluation prior to moving ahead with \nlater phases of a project.\n  Another provision of the bill creates an explicit State option for \naccepting food assistance applications over the\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\ntelephone. As I previously mentioned, innovative States have \nexperimented with online applications and telephone interviews as a way \nof streamlining the process for people who have difficulty coming to \nwelfare offices, such as working families with busy schedules and \nsenior citizens.\n  The nutrition title would allow households to apply for food \nassistance over the telephone and have their benefits date back to the \ndate of the telephone application. This is important to ensure that \nhouseholds that apply over the telephone do not have a delay in their \nbenefits and receive smaller benefits for the first month. We have \nprovided that a telephone signature should be accepted as adequate for \nall purposes. No subsequent mail-in application should be required in \norder for the application to be considered filed by the State agency.\n  Throughout the history of the Food Stamp Program, the courts have \nplayed a positive, constructive role in ensuring that congressional \nintent is carried out. The program has not been overrun with litigation \nbecause both Congress, in writing statutes, and USDA, in writing \nregulations, have taken great pains to be clear and specific. On those \nrare occasions when courts have misunderstood our intent on an \nimportant matter, Congress has amended that statute accordingly. \nBecause USDA keeps the Agriculture Committees closely apprised of its \nregulatory actions, Congress also has been comfortable with--indeed \nsupportive of--litigation to enforce the Department's regulations. On \nnumerous occasions when we leave a matter open in the statute, it is \nbecause USDA has told us exactly how it plans to address the matter in \nregulations. Congress has always operated on the assumption, and with \nthe intent, that the program's regulations would be fully enforceable \nand fully complied with to the same extent as the statute.\n  I was disturbed to learn of two recent cases in which courts \ndisregarded the longstanding history of judicial enforcement of the act \nand regulations. A district court in Ohio refused to entertain a suit \nbrought to enforce the Department's regulations for serving people \nwhose primary language is not English, and an appellate court in New \nYork held that States are less responsible for compliance with the act \nand regulations when the program is administered by local governments \nthan when the State administers the program itself.\n  Accordingly, this legislation clarifies that States must comply with \nthe Department's rules on service to non-English-speaking households as \nwell as with the statute. The regulations, no less than the statute, \ncreate rights for households to ensure that they can receive benefits.\n  Responding to the New York case, the legislation clarifies that \nStates' responsibility is no less in locally administered systems. \nCongress has granted States the option for local administration as a \nconvenience; nothing in the law reduces States' responsibility if they \ntake this option. If the State could not be held fully accountable for \nstrict compliance with the act and regulations in these cases, local \nadministration would not be permitted. These amendments correct that \nproblem.\n  I have been a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee or the House \nAgriculture Committee for over 30 years. I have always operated on the \nassumption that the act and regulations create enforceable rights for \nactual and prospective participants and that litigation may properly \narise under provisions of either. When I have heard of examples where \napplicants or clients were not provided with the service that the act \nand rules provide, such as timely and fair service, assistance for \nthose who need it by the State agency or 10 days to turn in requested \npaperwork, I have supported the right of an individual to file a claim \nagainst the State to enforce the rules established by Congress and the \nregulations stemming from the statute.\n  With very few exceptions, the old Food Stamp Act and the new Food and \nNutrition Act are based on the principle of individual rights. Much of \nthat stems from a history in the 1960s and 1970s of clients not being \nable to gain access to the program. To be sure, section 2 has little in \nit to enforce: subsections (a) through (g) of section 7 do not affect \nindividual households, and sections 9, 10, 12, and 15 focus on \nretailers and wholesalers. Within section 11, paragraphs (e)(19), \n(e)(20), (e)(22), and (e)(23), as well as subsections (f) through (h), \n(k), (l), (n) through (r), and (t), regulate state agencies rather than \nhouseholds. The same is true in section 16 of the beginning of \nsubsection (a) as well as of subsections (c), (d), and (f) through (k). \nSections 14(a), 18(e) and (f), 19, 23, 25, and 27 similarly do not \nconvey rights to households. A few other provisions by their terms no \nlonger apply to anyone. But by and large, the Agriculture Committees, \nand Congress as a whole, have consistently intended that the Food Stamp \nProgram be administered in strict conformity with the Food Stamp Act \nand with regulations the Secretary has duly promulgated under this act \nand that prospective and actual participants be entitled to enforce \nthese provisions legally.\n  The legislation also clarifies the act's privacy protections to \nensure that those receiving confidential information for legitimate \nreasons are not free to make other uses of that information or to \nretransmit it to third parties. Any decisions about releasing or using \ninformation should be made in advance by the Department or State food \nstamp agencies. The focus was on retransmission of information. Other \nthan the provision explicitly allowing these records to be accessed in \nhouseholds' litigation, the bill does not expand initial access to \nconfidential information. Confidential records would continue to be \nunavailable to the general public and others not having a legitimate \nreason relating to program administration.\n  In the program integrity area the bill responds to USDA's request for \nmore flexibility in how they penalize retailers who have committed \nfraud against the program. Electronic benefits have greatly reduced the \noccurrence of clients converting their food assistance benefits into \ncash, but there sometimes remain problems with stores finding ways to \nenrich themselves at the expense of the Federal Government and low-\nincome households. Under this bill USDA will have more flexibility in \nthe types of penalties it can impose on such stores. USDA will be able \nto disqualify an offending retailer, subject the retailer to financial \npenalties, or both.\n\n  Elsewhere in the bill, the Secretary is provided expanded authority \nto penalize individuals and companies that defraud USDA programs. While \nthat provision does not apply to any of the individuals and families \nwho receive food assistance it could be used with respect to retailers \nand other program operators. Given our history of collaboration with \nthe Department on crafting this retailer fraud provisions as well as \nfraud detection and enforcement systems in the other nutrition \nprograms, it is not my expectation that the Secretary would ever use \nthat authority without extensive consultation with the Agriculture \nCommittees.\n  The bill also adds two new specific disqualifications for recipients \nwho have intentionally used their food assistance benefits \ninappropriately. I do not think these kinds of behaviors are common \namong food assistance recipients, but they are nonetheless \ninappropriate, and people who engage in them should be penalized. The \nfirst came up because of a story in my State. Apparently someone used \ntheir food assistance benefits to buy water in returnable containers. \nThe individual's real goal, however, was to discard the water and \nreturn the container for the cash deposit. This kind of activity is \nobviously not consistent with the purpose of the program and States \nwill now have specific authority to deal with it when it occurs.\n  The second would address instances where food assistance recipients \nintentionally resell food that they have purchased with food assistance \nbenefits. This is a little bit of a grey area, and I want to be clear \nabout what we do and do not intend with this provision. It is not \nconsistent with the goals of the program for individuals to resell \nlarge quantities of food for a profit that they have bought with food \nstamp benefits. However, I recognize that food stamp households may \noccasionally buy a cake mix which is used to make cupcakes for their \nchild's elementary school bake sale or they may shop for one another \nand reimburse each other for food. Two families who share an\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\napartment may sometimes share or swap food, even though they generally \npurchase and prepare their meals separately. These are not fundamental \naffronts to the integrity of the program. In fact, these are facts of \nlife for honest low- and moderate-income families. USDA and States \nshould only treat the egregious cases--where recipients intentionally \nsell food that was clearly purchased with food assistance benefits for \na cash profit--as fraud. Innocent, well-intentioned low-income \nindividuals should not be disqualified under this new provision.\n  The bill also includes $20 million in the nutrition title for pilot \nprojects to test innovative ways of using the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program to improve the diets and overall health of \nrecipients and to especially reduce the problems of obesity and the \nrelated bad health outcomes. Particularly, this funding is provided for \nUSDA to carry out a pilot program that would test whether certain \nincentives can be effective in helping food stamp households to \npurchase healthier foods. The funding is intended to be used for a \npilot program using the existing EBT infrastructure. For example, a \nparticipating household that purchases fruits and vegetables with their \nfood stamp benefits would receive a discount on the portion of their \npurchase that is deemed healthful. Or alternatively, the household \nwould have extra benefits added onto its EBT card for the component of \ntheir grocery store purchases that are healthful.\n  This provision is an investment in a very important area. But I must \nbe clear that it is very important for these pilot projects to be \nrigorously evaluated and that the evaluations be independent, so the \nAgriculture Committee can have reliable information on what really \nworks and does not work to change people's food purchasing behavior, \ndiets, and health status. To provide USDA with maximum flexibility in \nimplementing this provision, the statute does not go into great deal \nabout the structure of the pilot program. However, I have every \nexpectation that USDA will consult closely with the Agriculture \nCommittee as it works to implement this provision.\n  The bill also requires USDA to study the cost and feasibility of \nreinstating the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico into the national Food \nStamp Program. Since 1982 Puerto Rico has received a fixed block grant \namount for food assistance, rather than be a part of the U.S. program \nlike the 50 States, District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. \nThis block grant does not take into account changes in economic or \ndemographic conditions, such as unemployment or the number of people \nwho are in need of food assistance. Puerto Rico operates their \nNutrition Assistance Program with rules very similar to the Food Stamp \nProgram, except that it has been forced to impose much lower \neligibility criteria as a result of capped funding. For example, a \nPuerto Rican household has a maximum net income limit of only 23 \npercent to 34 percent of the poverty level, instead of the 100 percent \ncut off used in the Food Stamp Program. It is important that Congress \ngain a better understanding of whether we are meeting the food needs of \nU.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico and whether inclusion in the Food \nStamp Program would be appropriate in the Commonwealth. With this study \nI hope to get a better understanding of what the local conditions are \nin Puerto Rico and how to address the issues in the next farm bill.\n  Another provision of the bill seeks to ensure that all children who \nlive in households receiving food stamps are getting the free school \nmeals to which they are entitled. Forty percent of all food assistance \nrecipients are school-age children and about 45 percent of food \nassistance benefits go to families with school-age children. Food \nassistance benefits are a critical factor in reducing food insecurity \namongst families with children. All children in families receiving food \nassistance get another important benefit--automatic enrollment for free \nschool meals provided through the National School Lunch and School \nBreakfast Programs. Such children have been eligible for free school \nmeals for some time, but the requirement that they be automatically \nenrolled without completing a duplicative paper application was enacted \nin 2004 and will be effective nationwide for the first time in the 2008 \nto 2009 school year.\n\n  The goal of the direct certification requirement is to move to a \nsystem that seamlessly enrolls 100 percent of school-age children in \nhouseholds receiving food assistance benefits for free school meals \nwithout imposing any additional paperwork on already stressed families. \nUnfortunately, it appears that some States are not implementing this \nprovision effectively. As a result, families and schools must fill out \nand process needless paperwork that was already processed by the food \nstamp agency. I strongly encourage USDA to work with States to ensure \nbetter implementation of direct certification. Government need not and \nshould not be unnecessarily redundant and wasteful. This legislation \nrequires USDA to report to Congress annually on each State's progress \ntoward that goal and to identify best practices. The report can thus be \nused to help States assess their own progress and expand the reach of \ndirect certification.\n  The farm bill nutrition title makes a significant new investment in \nfood purchases for emergency food organizations, increasing the Federal \nmandatory funding that is available from $140 million per year to $250 \nmillion, adjusted for annual food inflation. Because the amount has \nbeen flat since 2002 it has lost purchasing power, while food prices \nhave climbed by more than 15 percent. TEFAP also will receive $50 \nmillion in additional funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2008 to \ndeal with the short-term immediate needs of food banks in light of the \nrecent economic downturn and high food price inflation.\n  I would also like to highlight some of the changes we made to the \nFood Distribution Program on Indian reservations. As my colleagues may \nknow, under the Food Stamp Act, tribal governments have the authority \nto run a commodity program for their tribal members who would prefer \ncommodities to food stamps. The program helps ensure that low-income \nNative Americans who live in very remote areas and for whom food stamps \nare not an option have access to nutritious foods. Currently, there are \napproximately 243 tribes receiving benefits under the FDPIR through 98 \nIndian tribal organizations and five State agencies.\n  The bill makes a number of changes to the program. First, the statute \nis clarified to ensure that individuals disqualified from the Food \nStamp Program are also disqualified from FDPIR. Second, the bill \nprovides more authority to ensure that traditional and local foods are \nincluded in the food package based on input from program participants. \nFinally, and perhaps most important, Congress is requiring USDA to \nsubmit a report on the FDPIR food package and its ability to meet the \nfood and health needs of low-income Native Americans. I am deeply \nconcerned that FDPIR may be failing as a substitute for the Food Stamp \nProgram. Unlike food stamps, it does not differentiate between the food \nneeds of the poorest versus those with more income. Moreover, I am \nconcerned that the quality of the food provided in the food package is \nnot as healthy and nutritious as it ought to be, nor does it respond to \nthe diet and health challenges of Native Americans. The Secretary has \nopen ended authority to improve or expand FDPIR, which is an \nentitlement to Native Americans in lieu of the Food Stamp Program. I \nlook forward to hearing from USDA about if or how FDPIR needs to be \nmodified to respond to the food security needs of its participants.\n  The nutrition title also make a very significant investment in the \nhealth of our Nation's children by expanding the Fresh Fruit and \nVegetable Program, which will receive $150 million annually within 5 \nyears and thereafter be indexed to inflation. Several important policy \nchanges are also made to the program. First, because eating habits are \nestablished early in life, we limit the program to just elementary \nschools, with an appropriate transition period for currently \nparticipating secondary schools. The bill also includes significantly \nstrengthened targeting of program funds to low-income children by \nspecifying that priority be given to applicant schools that have the \nhighest proportion of children who are eligible for free or reduced-\nprice meals. I expect USDA and states to take this income targeting \nvery seriously. The\n\n[[Page S4755]]\n\nstatute is very clear. It does not suggest that the prioritization of \nlow-income schools is optional but clearly indicates that first \npriority be given to the schools with the greatest proportion of low-\nincome children. The statute also removes any reference to dried fruits \nthat previously existed. The program is intended to provide fresh \nfruits and vegetables only.\n  As my colleagues may gather from my remarks, I am extremely proud of \nwhat we have accomplished in the nutrition title of this farm bill. We \nhave made the title a top priority within the bill and taken pains to \nensure that we strengthen our Federal nutrition programs for the tens \nof millions of children, seniors and families they serve. Of course, we \nstill have a long way to go before we end hunger in this country. But \nwith this legislation we will be moving in a direction of reducing \nhunger, strengthening our people and building healthier, stronger \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, in addition to the more than 1,000 farm, conservation, \nnutrition, consumer and religious organizations who urged us to \noverride this veto, more than 2,700 Americans signed an online \npetition, which said the following:\n\n       We urge Congress to override President Bush's veto of the \n     2008 farm bill . . . It protects the safety net for all of \n     America's food producers, increases funding to feed our \n     nation's poor, enhances support for important conservation \n     initiatives, and helps make America more energy independent . \n     . . Please vote to override President Bush's veto and enact \n     the 2008 Farm Bill into law.\n\n  I will not enter all the names into the Record because there are e-\nmail addresses listed here, and I don't want to make all those public.\n  I ask consent to have the petition printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       We urge Congress to override President Bush's expected veto \n     of the 2008 Farm Bill which takes our country in a bold new \n     direction. It protects the safety net for all of America's \n     food producers, increases funding to feed our nation's poor, \n     enhances support for important conservation initiatives, and \n     helps make America more energy independent.\n       The House and the Senate passed the Farm Bill on May 14-15 \n     with enough bipartisan support to override a possible veto by \n     President Bush.\n       We urge members of Congress to continue to vote for the \n     interests of Americans instead of caving to President Bush \n     who is out of touch with the everyday needs of middle \n     America.\n       Please vote to override President Bush's veto and enact the \n     2008 Farm Bill into law.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we should take a moment to appreciate the \nhistoric nature of this vote. This is the first time ever a \nPresidential veto of a farm bill has been overridden. Of course, we all \nknow this is far more than a farm bill. In fact, that is a misnomer. \nThis is a food bill, a conservation bill, an energy bill--all those \nthings combined in a way that I think should make us all proud. It got \n82 votes for a reason. It is a good product. It got 316 votes on a \nPresidential override because it is a good product.\n  I thank especially the leadership of the Agriculture Committee. Our \nchairman, Senator Harkin, who is indefatigable, to have a vision to \nturn farm policy in a new direction, to be more conservation oriented--\nhistory will treat him very kindly. Senator Chambliss--we call him, in \nour office ``Cool Hand Luke'' because you couldn't ask for a better \npartner throughout an effort than Senator Chambliss has been to all of \nus. He has been steadfast. He has been calm, cool, and collected in a \nlot of situations that demanded real restraint in order to keep things \ntogether. I also thank him for the friendship we have formed throughout \nthis effort.\n  To the staffs--I wish to especially thank my staff: Jim Miller, my \nlead negotiator who has given body and soul to this effort. I calculate \nhe spent more than 3,000 hours over the last 2 years on this effort; \nTom Mahr, my legislative director, who has a lot of brainpower that he \nbrought to this effort, as he does to so many jobs in my office. I \ndeeply appreciate all the assistance Tom has given me and the other \nmembers, the other negotiators; Scott Stofferahn, my other negotiator, \nwho helped write the disaster provisions that have proven to be so well \ndone. John Fuher is a member of my staff who has taken on a lot of \nresponsibility at a young age. He has stepped up onto the stage. I \nappreciate it. Miles Patrie and Joe McGarvey handled key sections of \nthe legislation; on Senator Harkin's staff, Mark Halverson, the staff \ndirector. I joked the other day he started to go gray in this process. \nYou know, it may go further than gray with the little glitch that \nhappened over on the House side; and Susan Keith, who is so determined \nto write good agriculture policy, she can be proud of what she has \nhelped accomplish in this bill; Martha Scott Poindexter is a consummate \nprofessional, somebody for whom we developed high regard. It has been a \ndelight to work with her; Martha Scott, we appreciate the good humor \nyou have brought to this effort, as well as Vernie Hubert, a consummate \npro. These are talented people, good people. They deserve our thanks.\n  I also wish to thank, if I can, the occupant of the chair, Senator \nNelson of Nebraska. He is a critically important member of the \nAgriculture Committee who has provided that kind of mature leadership \nthat is so often necessary in writing legislation of this importance. I \nthank the occupant of the chair for all he did to make this a reality \nas well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4755-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I want to start by acknowledging the \ntremendous work of Senators Conrad, Harkin, and Chambliss. This farm \nbill has taken countless hours of patience and perseverance. Thank \ngoodness they have all that in abundance, along with great skill, \nwisdom and vision\n  I especially want to recognize Senator Conrad's work here in the \nSenate and Congressman Pomeroy's work in the House. We wouldn't be \nwhere we are today without their efforts and I wanted to publicly thank \nthem.\n  Mr. President, the Congress has made a major decision today. That \ndecision is to say to this President: It is time to start taking care \nof things here at home. It is a pretty substantial message--\nnotwithstanding the objections of the President, this Congress said we \nneed to stand for family farmers and have voted overwhelmingly to \ndecide that we will override the President's veto and voted \noverwhelmingly to decide that we will override the President's veto. \nSometimes there is not much distance between the right track and the \nwrong track. But with respect to the farm bill, the distance here \nbetween the right track and the wrong track, between the President and \nthe Congress, is a country mile. It surprises me, in fact.\n\n  This Congress has said: Let's start taking care of things here at \nhome for a change. Now, family farmers have always been the bedrock of \nthis country's family values. They, in many cases, work alone. They \nraise a family out under yard lights, out in the country. They take big \nrisks every year.\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\nThey live on hope. They do not come to work in blue suit. They put on \nwork shoes and work clothes and work hard, and all they ask for is a \ndecent return on their investment, despite the substantial risks they \ntake. Because of that this Congress, for a long period of time, over \nmany decades, has decided to create a safety net so that when family \nfarmers run into a patch of trouble, this Congress and this country \nsay: You are not alone. We want to help you through these price valleys \nand through these tough times.\n  So that safety net was significantly what we voted on today. The \nPresident began last year threatening to veto a farm bill, and \nconsistently threatened that veto, and finally decided to exercise that \nveto, and the Congress said: You are wrong, Mr. President.\n  The President came to my State of North Dakota. He said to farmers: \nWhen you need me, I will be there. But when farmers needed him, he was \nnot there. That is a matter of fact. This Congress has used awfully \ngood judgment in overriding the President's veto.\n  About a year ago, a little over a year ago, I introduced an \nagriculture disaster bill here in the Congress. For 3 years in a row I \nhave added an agriculture disaster piece to the supplemental \nappropriations bill because we did not have a disaster title in the \nfarm bill. For 3 years as an appropriator I put disaster money in the \nAppropriations supplemental bill. Finally, on the third opportunity, we \ngot it in a bill the President had to sign. But we had to go on bended \nknee when they had disasters over much of farm country to get disaster \nhelp. Now we have a farm bill that has a disaster title. That is a \nsignificant step forward.\n  A lot of folks do not understand much about farming. They think that \nCorn Flakes, oatmeal, and puffed rice come in boxes. They do not. But \nthose who put it in the boxes make much more money than those who plow \nthe ground and plant the seeds that produce the corn and the oats and \nthe wheat.\n  Now, this is a pretty substantial day for those of us who care about \nfamily farmers and want good farm policy. This veto override is good \npublic policy.\n  Rodney Nelson, a cowboy poet from North Dakota, who is a rancher and \na farmer out near Almont and Judd, ND, wrote a piece. I have mentioned \nit before to my colleagues. But he asks this question rhetorically in \nhis piece: What is it worth? What is it worth for a kid to know how to \nweld a seam, to drive a combine, to fix a tractor? What's it worth for \na kid to know how to pour cement? What is it worth for a kid to know \nhow to work livestock, work in the hot summer sun and the cold winter \nday? He asks: What is it worth for a kid to know how to teach a calf to \ndrink milk out of a pail? What is it worth for a kid to know how to \nbuild a lean-to? What is it worth for a kid to know how to fix a \ntractor that won't run?\n  There is only one place in this country where all of those skills are \ntaught, and that is on America's family farms. That is the university \nwhere all of those courses exist, and we lose it at our peril. That is \nwhy we write farm legislation. What is it worth? It is worth plenty to \nthis country to say to family farmers during tough times: You are not \nalone, because we have created a farm bill to say here is a helping \nhand during tough times. That is what this is all about. I think the \naction today is something we ought to be proud of.\n  Is this bill everything I would have liked? No. My colleague and I, \nSenator Grassley, offered an amendment on the floor of the Senate that \nwas critical in terms of policy dealing with payment limits. We lost. \nWe got 56 votes, we needed 60.\n  The fact is, this bill remains a good bill. It is late. It should \nhave been done months ago. We fought through 9 or 10 months of \nPresidential veto threats. But it is done and finally I think farmers \nwho are working their fields now in the spring and trying to figure out \nhow they are going to do this year, I think farmers are going to be \nable to look at this bill and say: Congress cared. Congress cared \nenough to override the President's veto and put in place a farm bill \nthat once again says: America cares about family farming and its \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me say first I commend the remarks of \nthe Senator from North Dakota who again reminds us of the importance of \nthis legislation that we have been working on for many months now, and \nnow having the votes, an overwhelming number of votes in the Senate to \noverride the President's veto.\n  It is a bill that will help our farm families. But it is also a bill \nthat we know from the percentage breakdown is about nutrition and \nconservation and so much else. So we are grateful for all of the work \nthat went into this.\n  I am thinking today about not only this legislation. I want to spend \na few moments talking about our veterans. But also we had an \nopportunity today at lunch to listen to three individuals whose \nstories, among others, are portrayed in a book about the Freedom Riders \nin the early 1960s and the impact they had on civil rights, and the \ncourageous witness they provided is an understatement. People literally \nrisked their lives for freedom in the South.\n  When I think about our veterans today, the GI bill that Senator Webb \nbrought to this body, and so many of us cosponsored, when I think about \nthe GI bill, the work today on agriculture and nutrition, and also the \nwitness provided by these speakers today at lunch who were Freedom \nRiders, I am, of course, thinking about Senator Kennedy who is not with \nus today. He is outside of Washington and we are anxiously awaiting his \nreturn.\n  But I was thinking, as we all are today, about him and about his \nhealth but also his presence here. Everything we did today virtually he \nhas had an impact on for more than a generation, whether it was \nnutrition or whether it was helping our veterans or whether it was \nhaving the courage to stand up for civil rights. So we are thinking of \nhim today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4756-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4756-S4757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GI BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wanted to make a couple of remarks about \nthe GI bill of rights. We had an opportunity today to vote on a piece \nof legislation which included that. That legislation is so necessary \nfor our veterans. I know, Mr. President, you in your State, as a former \nGovernor and Senator, know the impact of veterans.\n  In Pennsylvania, we have over a million veterans, and so many of them \nserved our country in war after war. And in this war, the war in Iraq \nor anywhere in the world where they serve, all they are asking us to do \nis to help them in a couple of very basic ways: They want our respect, \nwhich we should always provide, and I think most Americans do over and \nover again. But they also should have the right to an education after \nthey have served their country. It is that simple. We all know \neducation is often referred to as the great equalizer. Sometimes when \nsomeone comes from a disadvantaged background, they are able to lift \ntheir sights and partake in the American dream because they have an \neducation.\n  If soldiers are serving in combat, men and women in uniform for \nAmerica, the least we should do is provide them with an education when \nthey come home so they can have the chance at the American dream here \nat home.\n  I think the last thing, certainly not in that order, they have a \nright to expect is quality health care. We have a long way to go. \nDespite great work by people who work in the VA, there is a long way to \ngo to provide the kind of quality health care our veterans have a right \nto expect.\n  So when we remember on this floor the words of Abraham Lincoln a long \ntime ago when he talked, about people who served in combat and war, he \ntalked about caring for him who has borne the battle and his widow and \nhis orphan. When we think about that today, caring for him or her who \nhas borne the battle, it must mean at least those three things: our \nrespect, quality health care, and a quality education.\n  That is why this bill is so important. I am grateful so many of our \ncolleagues agree with that. But we have got a long way to go to make \nsure the GI bill is the law of the land, not just something to debate \nbut the law of the land.\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\n  I hope the President, I hope people on both sides of the aisle here \njoin us in that, in making sure the GI bill of rights at long last is \nthe law of the land.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. KLOBUCHAR).

Madam President, I rise to talk about the need for \ndramatic, bold health care reform in this country, so every American \nhas real access to good, affordable health care. In doing so, I wrap up \na project I began 8 weeks ago with six of my Senate colleagues to \nhighlight our proposed solutions to reforming health care in America.\n  I start by thanking those colleagues, Senators Coburn, DeMint, Thune, \nIsakson, Martinez, and Burr for joining me here on the Senate floor and \nin other venues to talk about this enormously important challenge for \nall of us.\n  We have reaffirmed what I think virtually every American knows, that \nwe are in a health care crisis in this country, and there are some \nfundamental things broken, some fundamental things wrong with our \npresent health care delivery system.\n  I want to reaffirm what was said: We need not just tinkering at the \nedges but some bold, dramatic reform to fix that system and give every \nAmerican access to good quality and affordable health care.\n  But I also want to reaffirm there are clear choices to be made, \ndramatically different alternatives. We have laid out our positive \nchoices in contrast to the other large alternatives, the single payer \nsocialized solution that several of our colleagues here in this body \nhave long advocated.\n  Our message, my colleagues and mine, Senators Coburn and DeMint, \nThune, Isakson, Martinez, and Burr, has been simple at its core: The \nhealth care system must be centered on the doctor-patient relationship. \nHealth care plans must be flexible and there must be real choice. \nAmericans must be able to own and control their own plans and decisions \nand choose how those plans work for them, and Washington should not \ncontrol or run or mandate all of this.\n  We believe individuals and families should own their own health \ninsurance, and we oppose the Government managing or rationing people's \nhealth care. We believe individuals are capable and are better than \nbureaucrats at choosing that coverage which is best suited for their \nown needs.\n  We are opposed to forcing people to enroll in a plan versus providing \nincentives to encourage individuals and families to choose to enroll. \nWe believe existing Government programs can be improved and modernized \nso they provide more efficient quality care to serve the purpose of \ntheir enactment.\n  In contrast to that, we oppose attempts to expand these specifically \ntargeted programs and make them a Trojan horse for broader overreaching \nsocialized medicine and sickness management by the Federal Government.\n  Instead of looking to put more people on Government health care, we \nshould assure that the truly indigent have health coverage. My friends \nand colleagues who tried to rationalize a dramatically expanding SCHIP, \nfor example, the ability to offer Government health care to already \ninsured children, argued we have to put children first. But last year \nthis Senate unfortunately and overwhelmingly rejected an amendment by \nSenator Coburn that would have assured that all children in the United \nStates would have health care coverage before funding special interest \npork projects.\n  We believe we should open and expand the health insurance marketplace \nto Americans so they can shop for health care across State lines and \nlet insurance companies compete to provide quality, cost-effective \ncare.\n  We oppose increasing the number of costly mandates that price \nindividuals in so many cases out of the market and restrict consumer \nchoice and access.\n  As my friend from South Carolina stated, there are almost 2,000 \nindividual mandates in health care, covering in some cases \nacupuncturists and hair prostheses.\n  These mandates obviously drive up the cost of health care. In fact, \naccording to the CBO, for every 1 percent increase in the cost of \nhealth care, 300,000 people lose their insurance. So there is a real \nhuman cost to so many of these mandates. This is supposed to be a free \nmarket society. I am perplexed as to why a consumer in South Carolina \nshould not be able to shop for cheaper health insurance if that product \nis offered and sold in Louisiana.\n  This is commonsense reform to drive down mandates to a reasonable \nlevel. It would force insurance companies to compete with each other \nacross State lines to offer cheaper quality plans. Americans are able \nto purchase or invest in almost anything in any State of the Union. \nThis does promote competition. It encourages companies to offer better \nprices and better quality and more attractive interest rates for \nsavings and better service. Why can't we bring that positive aspect to \nthe market of health insurance?\n  My colleagues and I who join together in this discussion recognize \nthat seniors have increasingly turned to Medicare Advantage plans \nbecause they offer better value, more choice, a higher quality of care \nthan traditional fee-for-service Medicare. We oppose attempts to cut \nMedicare Advantage and reduce health care choices for seniors. Again, \nunfortunately, too many folks in this body are moving in the other \ndirection. In fact, the chairman of the Finance Committee has indicated \nthat the majority side of the aisle will offer a Medicare package that \nwill likely significantly cut funding for the popular Advantage plan.\n  I have heard from thousands of Louisiana seniors who are \noverwhelmingly pleased with their Medicare Advantage plans. I hope we \ncan preserve this option for seniors and find a reasonable compromise \nso we don't cut Medicare Part C and negatively affect those seniors.\n  We believe we should dramatically reform the tax treatment of health \ncare by providing powerful incentives that will increase access by \nallowing Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money to pay for \nhealth care. We oppose tax increases that do the opposite, that seize \nAmerican money from American families to pay for government-run and \ngovernment-dominated health care. That limits access to doctors. It \nlowers the quality of health services. Addressing health care through \nour Tax Code would fundamentally change the health care market, if we \ndo it in the right way. By letting Americans keep more of their money \nfor health care through refundable tax credits, we can empower \nAmericans with more resources to obtain and access care.\n  We have seen the results of increased utilization of health savings \naccounts. We want to see that when given the freedom to keep their tax-\nfree money for health care, Americans will make conscious efforts to \nstay healthier, make better health care decisions, and shop for more \ncost-effective care and services. HSAs, health savings accounts, are a \nnewly implemented concept and one that is working. Americans want \nchoice, and tax advantage options such as HSAs allow for more choice in \nhealth care. We know our proposals would reform a broken system into \none that is patient centered, high quality, lower cost, and where \nfamilies choose and own their own health care plan. Government-run \nhealth care does not work and limits access and choice for families.\n  If you do not believe that, look to our neighbors. To the north we \nsee Canada, which has a weekly lottery to see which of their citizens, \nin essence, can go to the doctor. Look to our friends across the \nAtlantic, to the British. The British National Health Service recently \npromised to reduce the wait time for hospital care to 4 months. That is \nsupposed to be a dramatic improvement under that model, under Great \nBritain's national health care system.\n  Is that the kind of health care we want Americans to have? I \nsincerely hope our proposals over the last 8 weeks will be some part of \npromoting this badly needed debate. I sincerely hope that important \ndebate leads to action, to results in the Senate and the Congress, \nresults for the American people. Health care is one of the most \nimportant issues for American families today. It is time we actually do \nsomething instead of sitting on our hands in Washington. We need to go \nback to the\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\nStates to talk about how we need to reform the American health care \nsystem. It is time to embrace the challenge of health care reform and \ndo something now, not just punt to future Congresses, future Washington \npoliticians, future Presidents.\n  I hope our discussion over the last 8 weeks helps promote that, not \njust debate but debate leading to action to improve the lives of all \nAmericans with regard to health care.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this morning when I read the Wall \nStreet Journal, I was interested in this article: ``Energy Watchdog \nWarns of Oil Production Crunch.'' This is the IEA, the International \nEnergy Agency, that makes estimates and keeps the world informed on the \nstatus of energy supplies. The conclusion in this article is that the \ndemand for energy throughout the world continues to rise, but the \nsupply is flat.\n  I think there is no question that this is a problem this country \nfaces, the problem of supply. Too often people in the Senate are \nunwilling to talk about the problem of supply. As a matter of fact, in \n1995, President Clinton vetoed a bill that would have opened a very \nsmall portion, about 2,000 acres, of the ANWR coastal plain, which is a \nmillion and a half acres set aside for oil exploration. It would have \nopened it to oil and gas development. That was shortsighted, a mistake, \nand it has had a devastating effect on Americans.\n  As this article in the Wall Street Journal points out, it predicts \nglobal demand for oil of 116 million barrels per day by 2030. Today the \nworld's demand is only 87 million barrels a day, and we are paying $135 \nfor each of those barrels. As the demand continues to rise--and we know \nit will--so will the cost. It will become higher and higher. This is \nwhat I have been trying to say now for 20 years in the Senate. We \nshould be able to produce more of America's oil, and we import today 67 \npercent of our oil.\n  During the oil embargo in the 1970s, we imported about 34 percent. We \nare almost totally dependent now on oil from offshore. American oil is \nnot available to this country. The alarming fact is, the military is \nthe largest consumer of oil in the country. It uses about 4.8 billion \ngallons of oil per year. The problem really is, if we had an embargo \ntoday, we could not sustain our military, let alone our essential \ninfrastructure. Our economy could not survive another embargo.\n  We need to realize we can produce American energy to meet our needs. \nIf we produce it over a period of years, the price will be stabilized. \nThe interesting thing is, on May 1--right here on the Senate floor--the \nsenior Senator from New York called drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge ``plain wrong.'' He said it was an ``old saw.'' He said \nthe field's probable 1 million barrels a day would reduce gas prices \n``only a penny a gallon.''\n  Then, on May 11, the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, said:\n\n       There is one way to get the price of oil down and it's two \n     words--Saudi Arabia. If they were to increase 800,000 barrels \n     per day, the price would come down probably 35 to 50 cents a \n     gallon. That's a lot.\n\n  Now, why would 800,000 barrels of Saudi oil reduce gas prices 50 \ncents a gallon and 1 million barrels of American-produced oil from our \nState reduce the price at the pump only a penny?\n  As a matter of fact, the Senator from New York said this extra supply \nfrom Saudi Arabia would probably reduce the price of a gallon of gas by \n62 cents before it was all over. Imagine that: 800,000 barrels of oil \nfrom Saudi Arabia could bring down the price of a gallon of gasoline by \n62 cents. There is an absolute inconsistency with what the Senator from \nNew York has told the Senate. I find that appalling on a thing such as \nthe oil supply now, in view of the price of gasoline for Americans at \nthe pump. They are paying the price because of President Clinton. They \nare paying the price because of stubborn opposition to develop the \nresources in my State.\n  Now, they tell us that drilling in the arctic could harm the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge. It will not. As a matter of fact, the land we are \ngoing to develop was set aside in the act of 1980, a million and a half \nacres in the Arctic Plain, so it could be explored. It will not be part \nof the Arctic Wildlife Refuge until the exploration and development of \nthat area is over.\n  I think there is no question we have to find a way to have the \nMembers of this body make up their minds: What is the problem America \nfaces today? It is supply. Our demand is increasing, like the rest of \nthe world, but we do not have an American supply of oil. Off our \nshores, and in the deep water off Alaska, there is a bountiful supply \nof oil. We have two-thirds of the Continental Shelf of the United \nStates, and there is only one well on that two-thirds of the \nContinental Shelf.\n  If you look over to the other side of the Bering Straits in Russia--\nRussia, which was a net importer of oil just 20 years ago, now is a net \nexporter of oil. Why? Because they developed the OCS off their shores. \nThey now have a strong economy in Russia. Why? Because they do not \nexport petrodollars anymore. They use money in their own country to \nfinance development in their own country.\n  We have to make up our minds whether we are going to face blind \nopposition, incorrect, and uninformed opposition, or whether we are \ngoing to take the actions needed to develop American oil to meet \nAmerican demand, and whether we are going to use the deep water off our \nshores to produce oil as does the rest of the world.\n  Norway produces oil off their shores. Britain produces oil off their \nshores. As a matter of fact, we produce oil off our southern shore, but \nwe are prevented from producing oil off our northern shore. It is \nabsolutely inconsistent and irrational what we are facing.\n  Our pipeline, at its peak, was transporting 2.1 million barrels of \noil to the west coast of the United States. Today, it is producing \nabout 700,000 barrels a day. It is two-thirds empty, in effect. It \nwould not need a new pipeline to carry the oil that would be produced \nin ANWR. It is there. It could carry more than 1 million barrels a day \neasily. Yet it has been opposed. It has been opposed for over 20 years, \nby the same irrational people who come to the floor and say: Oh, oh, \nSaudi Arabia, produce more oil. Produce 800,000 barrels of oil a day, \nand we can probably expect gas prices at the pump to come down 62 \ncents. But if you bring 1 million barrels of oil down from Alaska, it \nis only going to affect the price by a penny.\n  I have to tell you, we have to have smarter energy solutions. I hope \nthe time will come when we have a rational debate on this floor. I am \nreminded of that rational debate when we finally approved the \nlegislation that brought about the construction of the Alaska oil \npipeline in the 1970s. We waited 4 years for that pipeline to start \nbecause of stubborn opposition from the extreme environmentalists. It \nwas finally overcome. That opposition was overcome by an act that was \nstarted right here on the floor of the Senate, which closed the courts \nof the United States to any further litigation over building that \npipeline.\n  We were just following the oil embargo. America realized we had to \nhave more American oil. There was no filibuster on this floor. The vote \nwas 49 to 49, and that tie was broken by the then-Vice President.\n  Now, what has happened? Why should every time we bring up ANWR we \nhave a filibuster? Why can't we bring to the American continent the \nresources of the continent that happen to be in our State?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I say to the Senator, I do not want to \ndisrupt your line of thinking because I agree so much with you. But \nevery time I hear people talking about ANWR, and I hear people talking \nabout stopping any drilling or exploration in ANWR, it occurs to me, \nhere you are, the senior Senator from Alaska. You have been here for a \nlong time, and I have gone with you up to the area in which you\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\nare talking about drilling. I have heard people compare that to a \npostage stamp in a football field or something like that. It is a tiny \narea up there.\n  The question I have is twofold. First of all, why is it that as near \nas I can determine, people who live there all want to explore and \nresolve this problem we have in this country by drilling and exploring \nin ANWR? Who are we down here to tell them up in Alaska what is best \nfor them? That would be the No. 1 question.\n\n  Then, the second thing is, what I have observed, I say to the senior \nSenator from Alaska, who has been here longer than I have, is that \nevery time this has come up--I came from the House to the Senate back \nin 1995--now, on October 27, 1995, we voted 52 to 47, right down party \nlines, to go ahead and start exploring in ANWR. All the Republicans \nsupported it. All the Democrats opposed it. Then, again, on November \n17, 1995, the same thing happened: We voted to explore, the Democrats \nvoted against it.\n  Then, after all that work was done, the President--then-President \nClinton--on December 6, 1995, vetoed the bills that had this authority \nwe had given them to drill. Then the same thing--I could go on and on--\nbut in 2005, the same thing happened. The Senate voted on an amendment \nto the budget resolution to strike the expansion of exploration in \nANWR. It failed by a vote of 49 to 51, right down party lines.\n  I guess the second question I would ask the Senator is, why is making \nus self-sufficient a partisan issue? Why do the Democrats oppose it and \nthe Republicans support it?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have to tell the Senator, that is comparatively new in \nterms of my time in the Senate. When I first arrived here, there was \nbipartisan support for producing American oil. We had a coalition with \nRepublicans and Democrats, and we worked with the administration, \nwhether it was Republican or Democrat, to find a way to bring more oil \non line, oil produced by Americans and consumed by Americans.\n  When the opposition started on a political basis, we were then \nimporting about 20 percent of our oil. As the opposition has continued, \nas I said, we now import 67 percent. That money, which would have been \nspent in this country producing millions of jobs, and putting people \ninto permanent jobs, long-term jobs, is going to all these countries \nthroughout the world because we do not have that investment. We have \nnow what we call petrodollars, and we have to send our exports overseas \nto bring that money back.\n  This chart shows that 1 million barrels of imported oil cost the \nAmerican economy 20,000 jobs, and we are importing 14 million barrels a \nday now.\n  So I tell the Senator, it is a recent phenomenon comparatively, and \nit is partisan. It started with President Clinton.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Well, Madam President, I will only respond to say that is \nmy observation. I have not been here as long as the Senator has, but \nevery year since I have been here, we have had this vote, and the \npeople up there want us to drill, to explore, to produce.\n  I remember the argument against the Alaska pipeline. They said: Oh, \nit is going to destroy the caribou. What it has done, if you go up \nthere, as I have been with you at any time during the summer months, \nthe warm months, the only shade the caribou can find is the pipeline. \nYou see them all out there. It has actually had the effect of \nincreasing the breed.\n  But anyway, I keep thinking, if we had followed through with what we \nare talking about doing back in the middle 1990s, we would now be \nproducing our own energy, producing our own oil, and we would not have \nthese high prices at the pumps.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I will close on this statement.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the \nWall Street Journal be printed in the Record. I would hope that the \nSenate would pay attention to it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From The Wall Street Journal, May 22, 2008]\n\n             Energy Watchdog Warns of Oil-Production Crunch\n\n                  (By Neil King Jr. and Peter Fritsch)\n\n       The world's premier energy monitor is preparing a sharp \n     downward revision of its oil-supply forecast, a shift that \n     reflects deepening pessimism over whether oil companies can \n     keep abreast of booming demand.\n       The Paris-based International Energy Agency is in the \n     middle of its first attempt to comprehensively assess the \n     condition of the world's top 400 oil fields. Its findings \n     won't be released until November, but the bottom line is \n     already clear: Future crude supplies could be far tighter \n     than previously thought.\n       A pessimistic supply outlook from the IEA could further \n     rattle an oil market that already has seen crude prices \n     rocket over $130 a barrel, double what they were a year ago. \n     U.S. benchmark crude broke a record for the fourth day in a \n     row, rising 3.3% Wednesday to close at $133.17 a barrel on \n     the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n       For several years, the IEA has predicted that supplies of \n     crude and other liquid fuels will arc gently upward to keep \n     pace with rising demand, topping 116 million barrels a day by \n     2030, up from around 87 million barrels a day currently. Now, \n     the agency is worried that aging oil fields and diminished \n     investment mean that companies could struggle to surpass 100 \n     million barrels a day over the next two decades.\n       The decision to rigorously survey supply--instead of just \n     demand, as in the past--reflects an increasing fear within \n     the agency and elsewhere that oil-producing regions aren't on \n     track to meet future needs.\n       ``The oil investments required may be much, much higher \n     than what people assume,'' said Fatih Birol, the IEA's chief \n     economist and the leader of the study, in an interview with \n     The Wall Street Journal. ``This is a dangerous situation.''\n       The agency's forecasts are widely followed by the industry, \n     Wall Street and the big oil-consuming countries that fund its \n     work.\n       The IEA monitors energy markets for the world's 26 most-\n     advanced economies, including the U.S., Japan and all of \n     Europe. It acts as a counterweight in the market to the views \n     of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The \n     IEA's endorsement of a crimped supply scenario likely will be \n     interpreted by the cartel as yet another call to pump more \n     oil--a call it will have a difficult time answering. Last \n     week, the Saudis gave President Bush a lukewarm response to \n     his plea for more oil, saying they were already adding \n     300,000 barrels a day to the market, an announcement that did \n     nothing to cool prices.\n       At the same time, the IEA's conclusions likely will be \n     seized on by advocates of expanded drilling in prohibited \n     areas like the U.S. outer continental shelf or the Alaska \n     National Wildlife Refuge.\n       The IEA, employing a team of 25 analysts, is trying to shed \n     light on some of the industry's best-kept secrets by \n     assessing the health of major fields scattered from Venezuela \n     and Mexico to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iraq. The fields \n     supply over two-thirds of daily world production.\n       The findings won't be definitive. Big producers including \n     Venezuela, Iran and China aren't cooperating, and others like \n     Saudi Arabia typically treat the detailed production data of \n     individual fields as closely guarded state secrets, so it's \n     not clear how specific their contributions will be. To try to \n     compensate, the IEA will use computer modeling to make \n     estimates. It will also collect information gathered by IHS \n     Inc., a major data and analysis provider based in Colorado, \n     as well as the U.S. Geologic Survey, a smattering of oil and \n     oil-service companies, and national petroleum councils.\n\n\n                           supply-side gloom\n\n       But the direction of the IEA's work echoes the gathering \n     supply-side gloom articulated by some Big Oil executives in \n     recent months. A growing number of people in the industry are \n     endorsing a version of the ``peak-oil'' theory: that oil \n     production will plateau in coming years, as suppliers fail to \n     replace depleted fields with enough fresh ones to boost \n     overall output. All of that has prompted numerous upward \n     revisions to long-term oil-price forecasts on Wall Street.\n       Goldman Sachs grabbed headlines recently with a forecast \n     saying that oil could top $140 a barrel this summer and could \n     average $200 a barrel next year. Prices that high would add \n     to the inflationary pressures weighing on the world economy \n     and to the woes of fuel-sensitive industries such as airlines \n     and autos.\n       The IEA's study marks a big change in the agency's efforts \n     to peer into the future. In the past, the IEA focused mainly \n     on assessing future demand, and then looked at how much non-\n     OPEC countries were likely to produce to meet that demand. \n     Any gap, it was assumed, would then be met by big \n     OPEC producers such as Saudi Arabia, Iran or Kuwait.\n       But the IEA's pessimism over future supplies has been \n     building for some time. Last summer, the agency warned that \n     OPEC's spare capacity could shrink ``to minimal levels by \n     2012.'' In November, it said its analysis of projects known \n     to be in the works suggested that the world could face a \n     shortfall by 2015 of as much as 12.5 million barrels a day, \n     unless there was a sharp drop in expected demand. The current \n     IEA work aims to tally the range of investments and projects \n     under way to boost production from the fields in question to \n     get a clearer sense of what to expect in production flows.\n       ``This is very important, because the IEA is treated as the \n     world's only serious independent guardian of energy data and \n     forecasts,'' says Edward Morse, chief energy\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\n     economist at Lehman Brothers. Examining the state of the \n     world's big oil fields could prod their owners into \n     unaccustomed transparency, he says.\n       Some critics of the IEA, while praising its new study, say \n     a revision in the agency's long-term forecasting is long \n     overdue. The agency has failed to anticipate many of the big \n     energy developments in recent years, such as the surge in \n     Chinese demand in 2004 and this year's skyrocketing prices. \n     ``The IEA is always conflicted by political pressures,'' says \n     Chris Skrebowski, a London-based oil analyst who keeps his \n     own database on big petroleum projects and is pessimistic \n     about supply. ``In this case I think they want to make as \n     incontrovertible as possible the fact that we are facing a \n     real crunch.''\n\n\n                             U.S. Forecasts\n\n       The U.S. Energy Department's own forecasting shop, the \n     Energy Information Administration, has long stuck to the same \n     demand-driven methodology as the IEA, assuming that supply \n     will keep up with the world's growing hunger for oil. But the \n     U.S. agency also has embarked on its own supply study, which \n     it hopes to complete this summer. Like the IEA, its \n     preliminary findings are somewhat gloomy: They suggest daily \n     output of conventional crude oil alone, now about 73 million \n     barrels, will plateau at 84 million barrels, and that it will \n     take a significant uptick in production of nonconventional \n     fuels such as ethanol to push global fuel supplies over 100 \n     million barrels a day by 2030.\n       ``We are optimistic in terms of resource availability, but \n     wary about whether the investments get made in the right \n     places and at a pace that will bring on supply to meet \n     demand,'' says Guy Caruso, the U.S. agency's administrator.\n       In Paris, analysts at IEA also fret that a lack of \n     investment in many OPEC countries, combined with a diminished \n     incentive to ramp up output, casts serious doubt over how \n     much the cartel will expand its production in the future. The \n     big OPEC producers have been raking in record profits, \n     creating a disincentive in many countries to sink more \n     billions into increased oil production.\n       Meanwhile, politics and other forces are delaying projects \n     that could bring more oil on-stream. Continued fighting in \n     Iraq has stymied efforts to revive aging fields, while \n     international sanctions on Iran have kept investments there \n     from moving forward. Rebel attacks in Nigeria and political \n     turmoil in Venezuela have cut into both countries' output. \n     Big non-OPEC producers such as Mexico and Russia, which have \n     either barred or sidelined international operators, are \n     seeing production slump. The U.S., with a legal moratorium \n     barring exploration in 85% of its offshore waters, is \n     struggling to keep its output steady.\n       The IEA study will try to answer one question that bedevils \n     those trying to forecast future prices and the supply-demand \n     balance: How rapidly are the world's top fields declining? \n     The rates at which their production dwindles over time are a \n     much-debated barometer of the health of the world's oil \n     patch.\n\n\n                             Depletion Rate\n\n       A study released earlier this year by the Cambridge Energy \n     Research Associates, a consulting firm and unit of IHS, \n     concluded that the depletion rate of the world's 811 biggest \n     fields is around 4.5% a year. At that rate, oil companies \n     have to make huge investments just to keep overall production \n     steady. Others say the depletion rate could be higher.\n       ``We are of the opinion that the public isn't aware of the \n     role of the decline rate of existing fields in the energy \n     supply balance, and that this rate will accelerate in the \n     future,'' says the IEA's Mr. Birol.\n       Some analysts, however, contend that scarcity isn't the \n     issue--only access to reserves and investment in tapping \n     them. ``We know there is plenty of oil and gas resource in \n     the world,'' says Pete Stark, vice president for industry \n     relations at IHS. He says the difficulties of supply aren't \n     buried in oil fields, but are ``above ground.''\n       Mr. Morse at Lehman Brothers notes that there are plenty of \n     questions about supply yet to be answered. ``However \n     confident the IEA may be about the data it has, they know \n     nothing about the resources we've yet to discover in the deep \n     waters or in the arctic,'' he says.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I do thank the Chair for her patience.\n  Let me do one last thing.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Stevens pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n575 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair for her patience and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, let me thank the Senator \nfrom Alaska. This is a frustration I have felt for so long: that it is \nnot just that right down party lines we are not able to produce in \nANWR, but also it goes offshore. We have tried, on the Republican side, \nto do something about increasing the supply--by drilling in Alaska, by \ngoing at the tar sands, and I am sure the Senator from Colorado will \ntalk a little bit about shale out in the western part of his State and \nin my State of Oklahoma, trying to give tax incentives for the \nproduction at marginal wells, which are wells that produce under 15 \nbarrels of oil a day.\n  I can give a statistic that I do not have to back up because it has \nnever been refuted. If we had all the marginal wells flowing today that \nhave been shut down in the last 10 years, it would amount to more than \nwe are currently importing from Saudi Arabia.\n  So I think it is very arrogant, when you have two hard-working \nSenators and one Member of the House from Alaska who want very much to \ndo what 100 percent of the people want to do in Alaska; that is, to \nimprove their economy by producing cheap oil for us domestically so we \ncan bring down the price of gas, when they will not allow us to do it.\n  Let me make one comment. I am going to be joined by the Senator from \nColorado. I want to touch upon one other area.\n  If we had been and would be successful in being able to drill more \noil domestically so we can bring down the price of gas, no matter how \nmuch we produced, it can't go into the gas tank until it has been \nrefined. So refining capacity is something that is very critical in \nthis country. Again, right down party lines, they have prevented us \nfrom having that refinery capacity.\n  Three different times I had on the floor a bill called the Gas Price \nAct. All it was was a bill to start building refineries in America. It \nhas been 30 years; 1976 was the last refinery we had in America. What \nwe need to do is start building refineries. Well, with the BRAC \nprocess--and for those of you who come from States that don't have any \nmilitary operations, you may not know what this is, but the BRAC \nprocess is the Base Realignment and Closure Commission. That is where \nyou go through an independent entity to determine which of the military \ninstallations should be shut down. Of course, when you shut down a \nmilitary installation, it is economically devastating to the adjoining \ncommunities.\n  With the Gas Price Act, what we have done is provide that if you have \nbeen shut down as a military installation, we could provide assistance \nthrough the Economic Development Administration for cities--if they are \nso inclined--to make applications so that they can turn these closed \nbases into refineries.\n  I thought when we developed this thing that it wouldn't be a problem \nat all because no one should be against it. Everyone knows we have to \nincrease our refining capacity. We offered amendments on this bill to \nstreamline the process.\n  Also, if people changed their minds in communities, they would be \nable to stop this from taking place. States have a significant, if not \ndominant, role in permitting existing or new refineries. Yet States \nface particularly technical and financial constraints when faced with \nthese extremely complex facilities. So my Gas Price Act requires the \nadministrator to coordinate and concurrently review all permits with \nthe relevant State agencies to permit refineries. This program does not \nwaive or modify any environmental law and consequently should not have \nhad anyone in opposition to it.\n  Now, we brought it twice to the floor--three times to the floor and \ntwice we had votes--and right down party lines, every Democrat voted \nagainst the Gas Price Act. All we wanted to do, along with the local \ngovernments and local communities, was to build refineries so that we \ncould refine what will hopefully be someday an increase in capacity so \nwe will not be reliant upon foreign countries for our ability to run \nthis machine called America, but we would be able to produce our own \nenergy.\n  I think it is important that every time we talk about increasing \nproduction, which we just have to do, we also have to talk about the \nrefining capacity. We are all ready to go, I say to my good friend from \nColorado, with the Gas Price Act if we are able to move in that \ndirection.\n  I believe that over the Memorial Day recess, when everybody is out \nthere driving and people are much more sensitive to the price of gas, \nthey are going to look back and say: You know, maybe the Republicans \nwere right all of those years; maybe we should be increasing our \nsupply, as the Senator from Alaska put it, of gasoline and oil produced \nin America.\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nOklahoma on this particular issue. I also wish to thank the last \nspeaker, Ted Stevens of Alaska, for his leadership in making sure we \nhave adequate energy for the American people. Right now, we are falling \nshort. The reason for that is this Congress. It is not business where \nwe should assert blame; it is not the stock markets we have heard \nblamed on this floor, or the futures market. It is simply because \nCongress has been tying up these reserves and not providing the \nincentives we need to move ahead with oil refineries and to make \nsupplies available on the market.\n  This is a supply-and-demand issue. The demand in this country is \nexceeding the supply. If we want to become less dependent on foreign \noil, we need to do more than what we have done historically.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Allard pertaining to the introduction of S. 3062 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first of all, I agree wholeheartedly \nwith the comments and the legislative ideas my friend from Colorado \nhas. Again, it is a great frustration that we have tried so hard for so \nmany years to expand our supply here in this country. Hopefully, now, \none of the benefits we will get from the high price of fuel is the \nrecognition that we have to start producing our own energy in this \ncountry. That is what we should be doing.\n  Hopefully, after this holiday, when we get back, enough people will \nhave spent enough money driving around and there will be enough \npolitical pressure that we can get people to agree to start drilling in \nANWR, drilling offshore, drilling in the shale area, and experimenting \nin some of these areas where we could become totally self-sufficient in \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4761-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4761-S4763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                IRAQ WAR\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to address a little-known secret, \na secret to the media and therefore a secret to the American people; \nthat is, we are winning the war in Iraq.\n  Yesterday, I read an article--I think it was maybe the day before \nyesterday--in the New York Post by Ralph Peters. It was called \n``Success in Iraq: A Media Blackout.'' In it, he writes:\n\n       As Iraqi and coalition forces pile up one success after \n     another, Iraq has magically vanished from the headlines. Want \n     a real ``inconvenient truth''? Progress in Iraq is powerful \n     and accelerating.\n\n  I think he hit the nail on the head. When this war got tough, the \ncut-and-run defeatist provisions started making their way into bills \nand amendments. Those provisions send a powerful message to our troops \nand to our enemies: America is not committed to this fight.\n  But America has remained committed, and through that commitment we \ncontinue to attain success. I have been to Iraq, and I have watched the \ntide turn. I believe I have been there many more times than any other \nMember. I am on the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I spend time \nthere. I see, month after month, the changes in what has happened since \nthe acceleration.\n  My visit in June 2006 was in the wake of Zarqawi's death. Iraqis were \noperating under a 6-month-old parliament. Al-Qaida continued to \nchallenge coalition forces throughout Iraq. In response, coalition \nforces launched 200 raids against al-Qaida, clearing out the \nstrongholds. The newly appointed Defense Minister and I discussed the \ncurrent situation in Iraq, the violence brought to that country by al-\nQaida, and the transformation beginning in Iraq. I saw the emergence of \na sense of what Iraq could be.\n  Fast forward to May 2007. I returned to Iraq and visited Ramadi, \nFallujah, Baghdad, and several other areas. Ramadi went from being \ncontrolled by al-Qaida and hailed as a capital under control of the \nIraqi troops--by the way, this was at a time when Ramadi was being \ndeclared as the potential terrorist capital of the world. We saw \nneighborhood security watch groups identifying the IEDs with orange \nspray paint. We saw joint security stations. Things started \naccelerating and improving over there. Increased burden-sharing was \ntaken on by the Iraqis. Fallujah came under the control of the Iraqi \nbrigade. We had our marines there going door to door World War II \nstyle. At that time, I observed--in May 2007--that all of the sudden it \nwas under their own security. Al Anbar changed from a center of \nviolence to a success story. In Baghdad, sectarian murders decreased 30 \npercent, and joint security stations stood up, forming deep \nrelationships between coalition and Iraqi forces and civilians--\n``brotherhood of the close fight,'' as General Petraeus put it. You \nhave to be there to see it and witness personally the excitement that \nis demonstrated by the Iraqis and the pride they have that they are now \nin a position to do things for themselves that they were depending on \nus for before.\n  On July 30, 2007, 2 months after I returned from Iraq, Michael \nO'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack wrote an op-ed piece in the New York \nTimes. It was interesting because we had never seen anything positive \nabout our troops or about the war effort in the New York Times. This \none talked about troop morale, that it was high, with confidence in \nGeneral Petraeus's strategy; civilian fatality rates were down roughly \na third since the surge began; the streets in Baghdad were coming back \nto life with stores and shoppers. I can remember that. When I am over \nthere, I will go into a shopping area and go up to someone carrying a \nbaby and talk to them through an interpreter. That is where you get to \npeople who are excited because there could be a new life in the young \nperson. They noted that American troop levels in Tal Afar and Mosul \nnumbered only in the hundreds because the Iraqis stepped up to the \nplate. More Iraqi units were well integrated in terms of ethnicity and \nreligion. Local Iraqi leaders and businessmen were cooperating with \nembedded provincial reconstruction teams to revive the local economy \nand build new political structures.\n  I returned to Iraq on August 30, and the surge continued its success. \nI traveled to the contingency operating base in Tikrit, Patrol Base \nMurray, south of Baghdad, and visited with Ambassador Crocker and \nGeneral Petraeus, who gave his wonderful testimony this morning to the \nSenate Armed Services Committee.\n  I saw again on July 30 a significantly changed Iraq. Less than half \nof the al-Qaida leaders who were in Baghdad when the surge began were \nstill in the city. They either fled, have been killed, or have been \ncaptured. The U.S. troop surge in Iraq threw al-Qaida off balance and \nproduced dramatic results. There was a 75-percent reduction in \nreligious/ethnic killings in the capital. They doubled the seizures of \ninsurgents' weapons caches. There was a rise in the number of al-Qaida \nkills and captures. There was the destruction of six media cells--\ndegrading al-Qaida's ability to spread propaganda. Anbar incidents and \nattacks dropped from 40 per day to less than 10 a day. This is between \nthe two times I had been there. The economy grew and markets were open, \ncrowded, stocked, selling fresh fruit, and running as you would expect \nthem to. A large hospital project in the Sunni Triangle was back on \ntrack The Iraqi Army performance was significantly improving. Iraqi \ncitizens formed a grassroots movement called Concerned Citizens League. \nMost of the cities in America, including my cities in Oklahoma, have \nneighborhood watch programs, where the neighborhoods and people who \nlive there are watching to prevent crimes. That is what is happening in \nBaghdad and throughout Iraq.\n  You now see Baghdad returning to normalcy. You see kiddie pools, \nlawns cared for, amusement parks, and markets. The surge provided \nsecurity, and security allowed local populations and governments to \nstand up. Basic economics took root, and Iraqis began spending money on \nIraqi projects.\n  In September, a month later, Katie Couric was there. If there is one \nwho has been a critic of anything in this administration, our troops, \nor anything happening in Iraq, it is Katie Couric. She said:\n\n       Well, I was surprised, you know, after I went to eastern \n     Baghdad. I was taken to the\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\n     Allawi market, which is near Haifa Street, which was the \n     scene of that very bloody gun battle back in January, and, \n     you know, this market seemed to be thriving, and there were a \n     lot of people out and about. A lot of family-owned businesses \n     and vegetable stalls, and so you do see signs of life that \n     seem to be normal . . . the situation is improving.\n\n  Madam President, that is not Senator Inhofe talking, it is Katie \nCouric, who has been probably the worst critic of things over there. So \npeople are realizing that good things are happening.\n  Despite these successes, the truth about what our troops and the \ncoalition have accomplished in Iraq, it is hidden by the mainstream \nmedia. In a recent report of the Media Research Center, it shows that \nas the improvements took place--this is the timeframe I was talking \nabout, in late 2007. There were this many stories in 2007, and as \nthings improved, it went from 178 in the month of September, down to \n108 in October, down to 68 in November, and it shows the media bias \nthat is out there.\n  As Ralph Peters put it in the article I quoted a minute ago:\n\n       The basic mission of the American media between now and \n     November is to convince you, the voter, that Iraq's still a \n     hopeless mess.\n\n  I returned to Iraq on March 30 of this year, just about the same time \nPrime Minister Maliki kicked off his Basra campaign. I was at Camp \nBucca, right next to Basra, when they took the initiative. I was there \nworking with Major General Stone and saw what his task force is doing \nnow for detainees.\n  Before I talk about detainees, let me say how proud their troops were \nthat, for the first time in a major surge, they came into Basra to take \ncare of their own province. We were there.\n  I have been disturbed about the representation as to how our \ndetainees have been treated. I stopped down at Camp Bucca, the largest \ndetainee camp anywhere in all of Iraq. They separated the extremists \nand were arming the moderates with education and job skills. We found \nout that most of them--the vast majority of those who were detainees \nwere actually working before they became detainees, and they were \nfighting because there is total unemployment there. The only place they \ncould get a job was with the military.\n  What General Stone has done such a great job of is retraining these \npeople--training them to be carpenters and masons. It is very \nsuccessful, truly turning bombers and criminals into productive Iraqi \ncitizens and sending them back into the population. Out of 6,000 \nreleased, only 13 were rearrested. That kind of tells us the \nsuccess story. These people are integrating in and working on our side, \nworking in neighborhood groups.\n\n  We are now seeing the lowest violence indicators since April 2004. \nThe Iraqi people are turning away from violence. The Government of Iraq \nis asserting more control, searching out militia and insurgent \nstrongholds.\n  Operations in Basra and, more recently, in Sadr City have shown the \ncapabilities of the Iraqi security forces and the will of Iraqi \nleadership. I wish you could have been at the hearing this morning. You \ncould have seen and listened to the progress being made in Sadr City. \nThe Iraqi people are just taking back their streets.\n  As Ralph Peters said in his article, instead of the media even \nmentioning the positive role the Iraqis are taking in fighting this \nwar, they focus on a small fraction of Iraqi soldiers choosing not to \nfight. Mr. Peters, I agree with you that ``our troops deserve better, \nthe Iraqis deserve better, and you, the American people, deserve \nbetter. The forces of freedom are winning.'' That is what he said, and \nI agree.\n  Iraq is at a decisive turning point in its journey toward democracy. \nThe surge created opportunities that the Iraqi people have not taken \nfor granted. The ``awakening'' is spreading from Al Anbar to Diyala \nProvince. ``Concerned Citizens Leagues,'' through coalition support, \nare now taking back Iraqi streets from the insurgents. The once \nturbulent and violent Al Anbar Province has returned to Iraqi control. \nThey are actually doing these things themselves.\n  The surge enabled the Government of Iraq to meet 12 out of the \noriginal 18 benchmarks set for it, including 4 out of the 6 legislative \nbenchmarks. That means their Government is starting to put it together.\n  Iraq has also conducted a surge, adding well over 100,000 additional \nsoldiers--these are Iraqi security forces--and police to the ranks of \nits security forces in 2007 and is slowly increasing its capability to \ndeploy and employ these forces.\n  It is anticipated that Iraq will spend over $8 billion on security \nthis year and $11 billion next year. Iraq's 2008 budget has allocated \n$13 billion for reconstruction, and a $5 billion supplemental budget \nthis summer will further invest export revenues in building the \ninfrastructure.\n  What I am saying is that the reconstruction in that country is now \nbeing paid for by the Iraqis. One of the chief criticisms we have had \nby people whom I call the cut-and-run folks was that they are not \npaying their own part.\n  One of the best programs we have is the Commander Emergency Relief \nProgram, which allows our commanders to make determinations as to what \nneeds to be done immediately. It is spending a small amount of money \nand will go a long way by doing it. How many people know that the Iraqi \nGovernment recently allocated $300 million for our forces to manage the \nIraqi CERP? They are taking over their own responsibility.\n  The Iraqi Government has also committed $163 million to gradually \nassume Sons of Iraq contracts, $510 million for small business loans, \nand $196 million for a joint training and reintegration program. Oil \nreserves are being shared with the provinces.\n  Al-Qaida is a spent force in Iraq. Syria has ceased supporting \nforeign fighters in Iraq. The Saudis are cracking down on supporters of \nIslamic terrorists in their own country. Iran is becoming isolated.\n  We have to remain focused and realize that these successes will not \ncontinue until we, the people, become so informed that we recognize the \nsuccesses.\n  The first thing I hear from the Iraqi forces on the many trips I have \nmade there is that: The people of America don't appreciate what we are \ndoing. Now they know more than before how much we do appreciate it, how \ncritical it is that we stay with it.\n\n  I think--and I will wind up with this--Ahmadinejad made a statement, \nand inadvertently he was a great help to us because when all the \nsurrender resolutions were entered in this body, the President of Iran \nassumed one was going to pass and America was going to leave Iraq--he \nmade the statement that when America leaves Iraq, it is going to create \na vacuum, and we are going to fill that vacuum.\n  Anyone who knows history in the Middle East knows there are no two \ngroups who dislike each other more than the Iranians and Iraqis. That \ngot the attention of the Iraqis. That is one of the many reasons, with \nthe supernatural powers in intelligence and war capabilities of General \nPetraeus and General Odierno and some of the rest who are involved, \nthat caused this whole thing to turn around.\n  The success story is well told in the article to which I referred. I \nask unanimous consent to have that article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Success in Iraq: A Media Blackout\n\n                           (By Ralph Peters)\n\n       May 20, 2008.--DO we still have troops in Iraq? Is there \n     still a conflict over there?\n       If you rely on the so-called mainstream media, you may have \n     difficulty answering those questions these days. As Iraqi and \n     Coalition forces pile up one success after another, Iraq has \n     magically vanished from the headlines.\n       Want a real ``inconvenient truth''? Progress in Iraq is \n     powerful and accelerating.\n       But that fact isn't helpful to elite media commissars and \n     cadres determined to decide the presidential race over our \n     heads. How dare our troops win? Even worse, Iraqi troops are \n     winning. Daily.\n       You won't see that above the fold in The New York Times. \n     And forget the Obama-intoxicated news networks--they've \n     adopted his story line that the clock stopped back in 2003.\n       To be fair to the quit-Iraq-and-save-the-terrorists media, \n     they have covered a few recent stories from Iraq:\n       When a rogue U.S. soldier used a Koran for target practice, \n     journalists pulled out all the stops to turn it into ``Abu \n     Ghraib, The Sequel.''\n       Unforgivably, the Army handled the situation well. The \n     ``atrocity'' didn't get the traction the whorespondents hoped \n     for.\n       When a battered, bleeding al Qaeda managed to set off a few \n     bombs targeting Sunni\n\n[[Page S4763]]\n\n     Arabs who'd turned against terror, that, too, received \n     delighted media play.\n       As long as Baghdad-based journalists could hope that the \n     joint U.S.-Iraqi move into Sadr City would end disastrously, \n     we were treated to a brief flurry of headlines.\n       A few weeks back, we heard about another Iraqi company--100 \n     or so men--who declined to fight. The story was just \n     delicious, as far as the media were concerned.\n       Then tragedy struck: As in Basra the month before, absent-\n     without-leave (and hiding in Iran) Muqtada al Sadr quit under \n     pressure from Iraqi and U.S. troops. The missile and mortar \n     attacks on the Green Zone stopped. There's peace in the \n     streets.\n       Today, Iraqi soldiers, not militia thugs, patrol the lanes \n     of Sadr City, where waste has replaced roadside bombs as the \n     greatest danger to careless footsteps. U.S. advisers and \n     troops support the effort, but Iraq's government has taken \n     another giant step forward in establishing law and order.\n       My fellow Americans, have you read or seen a single \n     interview with any of the millions of Iraqis in Sadr City or \n     Basra who are thrilled that the gangster militias are gone \n     from their neighborhoods?\n       Didn't think so. The basic mission of the American media \n     between now and November is to convince you, the voter, that \n     Iraq's still a hopeless mess.\n       Meanwhile, they've performed yet another amazing magic \n     trick--making Kurdistan disappear.\n       Remember the Kurds? Our allies in northern Iraq? When last \n     sighted, they were living in peace and building a robust \n     economy with regular elections, burgeoning universities and \n     municipal services that worked.\n       After Israel, the most livable, decent place in the greater \n     Middle East is Iraqi Kurdistan. Wouldn't want that news \n     getting out.\n       If the Kurds would only start slaughtering their neighbors \n     and bombing Coalition troops, they might get some attention. \n     Unfortunately, there are no U.S. or allied combat units in \n     Kurdistan for Kurds to bomb. They weren't needed. And \n     (benighted people that they are) the Kurds are proAmerican--\n     despite the virulent anti-Kurdish prejudices prevalent in our \n     Saudi-smooching State Department.\n       Developments just keep getting grimmer for the MoveOn.org \n     fan base in the media. Iraq's Sunni Arabs, who had supported \n     al Qaeda and homegrown insurgents, now support their \n     government and welcome U.S. troops. And, in southern Iraq, \n     the Iranians lost their bid for control to Iraq's government.\n       Bury those stories on Page 36.\n       Our troops deserve better. The Iraqis deserve better. You \n     deserve better. The forces of freedom are winning.\n       Here in the Land of the Free, of course, freedom of the \n     press means the freedom to boycott good news from Iraq. But \n     the truth does have a way of coming out.\n       The surge worked. Incontestably. Iraqis grew disenchanted \n     with extremism. Our military performed magnificently. More \n     and more Iraqis have stepped up to fight for their own \n     country. The Iraqi economy's taking off. And, for all its \n     faults, the Iraqi legislature has accomplished far more than \n     our own lobbyist-run Congress over the last 18 months.\n       When Iraq seemed destined to become a huge American \n     embarrassment, our media couldn't get enough of it. Now that \n     Iraq looks like a success in the making, there's a virtual \n     news blackout.\n       Of course, the front pages need copy. So you can read all \n     you want about the heroic efforts of the Chinese People's \n     Army in the wake of the earthquake.\n       Tells you all you really need to know about our media: \n     American soldiers bad, Red Chinese troops good.\n       Is Jane Fonda on her way to the earthquake zone yet?\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4763-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4763-S4766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise, similar to many of my \ncolleagues this afternoon, to talk about the high price of gasoline and \nwhat we need to do as we are leaving Washington and going home for \nMemorial Day recess to hear, I am sure, from many constituents that \nthey are very concerned about this crisis of paying an ever-increasing \namount for gasoline.\n  Today, I am sure, the market is going to set another record for the \nnumber of days gas prices continue to go up, and our constituents want \nto see relief. I know many of my colleagues have come out here and \ntalked about new supply. I certainly feel one of the biggest priorities \nthe Senate has is to pass a tax credit bill for renewable energy so we \ncan get predictability in the market and continue to get new energy \nincentives in place. That will take pressure off some of these other \nsupply issues. But many of my colleagues keep talking about the United \nStates looking for more oil or things the United States can do to get \ninto the oil game in a more robust way.\n  This chart shows it pretty clearly. The United States has 2 percent \nof the world's oil reserves--2 percent. These are all the other \ncountries with which my colleagues are familiar: Saudi Arabia at 20 \npercent of the world's oil reserves; Iraq and Iran, another 18 percent. \nThese are the big players.\n  The point is, the United States is not going to dramatically impact \nthe price of oil by what we do with only 2 percent of the world's oil \nreserve. So if we want a solution, we are not going to get a solution \nout of what the United States can do in continuing to be addicted to \noil.\n  It is very important to also note that in the past, we have had many \na conversation about this problem and what is the high price of \ngasoline. We had the same debate when it was the high price of \nelectricity. No one wanted to hear about any other issue than the fact \nthat it was just a supply-and-demand problem. In fact, the Vice \nPresident in 2001 said, when talking about the electricity crisis, when \nprices were going through the roof:\n\n       They have got a whole complex set of problems out there \n     that are caused by relying only on conservation and not doing \n     anything about the supply side of the equation.\n\n  We found out very shortly thereafter that, no, that was not right. It \nwas not about conservation and supply side; it was about the \nmanipulation of the electricity market. There were lots of people like \nthat. The Cato Institute had a similar take on it. This was in 2002. In \n2002, we had gone through much of the Enron debacle, and we had seen \nprices in the State of Washington for electricity rise almost 3,000 \ntimes what they had been. Yet people were still saying:\n\n       Most of the price spike in 2000-2001 is explained by \n     drought, increased natural gas prices, the escalating cost of \n     nitrogen oxide emissions . . . and retail price controls.\n\n  We all know the history, now that we have had a few years to look \nback on it. It wasn't those supply and demand factors but the fact that \nwe actually had unbelievable manipulation of the electricity market.\n  The reason why I am bringing that up is because I wish to make sure \nwe are policing the oil markets. I wish to make sure we in the United \nStates are doing everything we can to burst this oil price bubble we \nare seeing. We want to pop this price bubble and give consumers a more \nreliable number about supply and demand that even the oil company \nexecutives are saying. They have testified before Senate committees \nsaying oil should be anywhere from $50 to $60 a barrel; that what we \nare seeing in the marketplace is not about the normal supply-and-demand \nfeatures, but it is actually about the fact that something else is \ngoing on in the marketplace. This is one CEO from ExxonMobil, recently \nin early April, who testified:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50-$55 per barrel.\n\n  I am not against discussions about future oil exploration. That is \nnot the point. The point is, what are we going to do to solve this \nproblem and burst this price bubble that while we are going out for the \nMemorial Day recess is going to continue to plague the economy, \ncontinue to plague our consumers, and continue to cause major havoc to \nour economy.\n  I think one of the solutions is to ensure effective oversight in the \noil market as it relates to oil futures. I know people say they might \nnot wish to talk about oil futures, but I am going to talk about oil \nfutures because of the effect of substantial deregulation has had on \nthese markets. On December 15 of 2000, at 7 p.m. on a Friday night as \nCongress was adjourning a lame-duck session, the last day of the 106th \nCongress, on an 11,000-page appropriations bill came to the floor of \nthe Senate, we added a 262 page amendment--the Commodities Futures \nModernization Act--that basically deregulated the energy futures market \nand said it didn't have to have the oversight of other products.\n  While the Commodities Exchange Act Reauthorization that recently \npassed as part of the Farm bill gives the CFTC more teeth to police \nthese U.S. futures markets, under an administrative loophole \nspeculators are still free to trade U.S. based energy commodities on \nU.S. trading engines free from full U.S. oversight meant to prevent \nfraud, manipulation, and excessive speculation. This is done under and \ninformal CFTC staff ``no-action'' letter, which essentially means that \nthe CFTC will not take action against\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\na foreign exchange to prevent fraud, manipulation, and excessive \nspeculation. That means, at least on ICE Futures Europe, trading of \nU.S. crude oil futures, particularly the West Texas Intermediate oil \ncontract, and U.S. home heating oil futures and U.S. gasoline futures--\nproducts that are produced in the United States, delivered in the \nUnited States, consumed in the United States, and traded in the United \nStates--are escaping U.S. oversight. I think that is a great concern to \nthe American consumer who wants to make sure we have transparency in \nenergy markets.\n  If we think about other trading, stocks for example, we have the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission. They look at the stock market, and \nthey have oversight to make sure there is nothing untoward happening in \nthe market, like manipulation. We also have NYMEX, another exchange in \nthe United States. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees \nthat futures exchange and has oversight. Also the Chicago Mercantile \nExchange--the CFTC has oversight of that futures exchange. The CFTC \nimplements market rules. But as for trading U.S. energy futures on ICE \nFutures Europe, the CFTC has said: No, we don't have to have oversight \nof that exchange.\n  As I mentioned, the Congress has charged the CFTC with protecting \nconsumers by policing futures markets for fraud, manipulation, and \nexcessive speculation. It does this by requiring certain market rules \nlike position limits, large trader reporting, record keeping, and \ntrader licensing and registration. These are tried-and-true tools that \nGovernment has used to protect consumers, to protect investors, to \nprotect business, to protect our economy, to make sure manipulation is \nnot happening.\n  I often think these are great programs, but wonder why we allow \ncertain trading of critical energy commodities to escape such oversight \nrequirements. I always like to give the example of cattle futures \nbecause somehow it seems we are more willing to regulate hamburger in \nAmerica and than we are oil.\n  Here are two examples of U.S. commodities: cattle futures trading and \noil futures trading. When we look at the rules, cattle futures are not \nan exempt commodity; but when you consider the ICE Futures Europe, oil \ncertainly is. For cattle futures, the exchange trading U.S. cattle \nfutures has to register with the CFTC, whereas oil trading on the ICE \nFutures Europe does not. And daily reporting requirements: more for \nhamburger and less for oil on ICE Futures Europe. What about \nspeculative limits? more for hamburger and less for oil on ICE Futures \nEurope.\n\n  Why am I so concerned about this significant change that transpired? \nThe significant change that transpired is since ICE Futures Europe--\nwhich again is not subject to U.S. oversight meant to prevent fraud, \nmanipulation, and excessive speculation--began trading West Texas \nIntermediate oil in February 2006, oil has gone from $60 a barrel in \n2006 now to over $134 a barrel. You bet I want to get down to the brass \ntacks about exactly how this exchange is working, to have the oversight \nand to see what large trading positions are being used in this market.\n  Many people have a concern about this. One report in the Asia Times \nwas quoted as saying:\n\n       Where is the CFTC now that we need [speculation] limits? It \n     seems to have deliberately walked away from its mandated \n     oversight responsibilities in the world's most important \n     traded commodity, oil.\n\n  This is by F. William Engdahl, who said this in early May of this \nyear.\n  People are observing and wanting to know what we are going to do \nabout this situation. That is why I think it is incredibly important to \ntake action. What am I talking about, taking action? First of all, \ntoday Senator Snowe and myself and several of our colleagues are \nsending a letter to the CFTC insisting that they reverse their no \naction in oversight of this foreign market, noting that this is a dark \nforeign market where oil futures are traded. We are saying bring the \nbright light of day into this exchange and protect consumers by \nensuring that market manipulation of oil prices is not happening.\n  As I said, the CFTC basically gave up this oversight under an \ninformal staff no action letter process. How did this happen? Well, in \n1999 the London based International Petroleum Exchange, the IPE, which \nwas a much smaller and foreign owned exchange, asked the CFTC for a no \naction letter, and received it. The IPE wanted to locate trading \nterminals in the U.S. but did not want to be subject to direct CFTC \noversight. The CFTC decided that the IPE did not have to have to be \nsubject to direct CFTC oversight because the CFTC agreed that the \nUnited Kingdom was going to be doing it. Then, in 2001, the U.S. owned, \nAtlanta based, InterContinental Exchange, or ICE, came along and bought \nthe IPE. After that, the now U.S. owned IPE continued to escape U.S. \noversight even though it received the foreign exchange no action letter \nbased on it being a foreign based exchange.\n  So, in 2001, we can see a U.S. based entity basically purchased this \nforeign exchange, and the CFTC did not take action. In 2006, now named \nICE Futures Europe, it starts trading what is a U.S. oil product, \ntrading on U.S. desks in the United States and the CFTC continues to \nbasically take no action to review that.\n  Our letter says the CFTC should start reviewing these trades \nimmediately and reverse their no action decision. We hope that while we \nare at recess, the CFTC will take this action.\n  Why is this so important? Because many are concerned that U.K. \noversight over U.S. energy trading is not sufficient to protect our \nconsumers from fraud, manipulation, and excessive speculation. In fact, \nCFTC Commissioner Bart Chilton, on April 22 of this year, said:\n\n       I am generally concerned about a lack of transparency and \n     the need for greater oversight and enforcement of the \n     derivatives industry by the [United Kingdom's Financial \n     Services Authority].\n\n  He is basically saying he has great concerns about the oversight by \nthe government in the United Kingdom. He should have great concerns \nabout that because the oversight in the United Kingdom is not \ncomparable to the oversight in the United States.\n  The problems at the FSA led to the collapse of England's Northern \nRock Bank. There was much written about this issue. They had high \nturnover in the staff, inadequate numbers to carry the load of what \nthey were responsible for, very limited direct contact with the bank, \nincomplete paperwork, and limited understanding of their duties.\n  All this led to major problems, and it led the CEO of the Financial \nServices Authority to say:\n\n       It is clear from the thorough review carried out by the \n     internal audit team that our supervision of Northern Rock in \n     the period leading up to the market instability of late last \n     summer was not carried out to a standard that was acceptable.\n\n  There are those in the United Kingdom who are criticizing the \noversight abilities of their Financial Services Authority to handle \nthis area.\n  The CFTC could act today in helping the United States bust this price \nbubble by doing their job and step in to provide needed oversight of \nthis market.\n  One energy trader analyst from Oppenheimer said in April:\n\n       Unless the U.S. Government steps in to rein in speculators' \n     power in the market, prices will just keep going up.\n\n  This is what energy analysts are saying. So we have a great deal of \ncontinuity in the marketplace of people telling us it is time for us to \nact. In fact, we are going to be having a hearing when we return on \nTuesday after the Memorial Day recess. I know we are going to hear from \nmany people, but one of them will be Professor Greenberger of the \nUniversity of Maryland Law School, a former CFTC department head, who \ntestified before one of our joint Democratic Policy Committee hearings. \nHe says:\n\n       The ICE [oil trading] loophole could be ended immediately \n     by the CFTC without any legislation.\n\n  I want to make sure the CFTC knows we will continue to pursue this. \nWe hope they take action. We hope they will address this issue. But if \nthey do not, we stand ready to make sure oversight in this financial \nmarket, that is a dark market on the ICE Futures Europe exchange, has \nthe bright light of day and that they take immediate action to start \ninvestigating what is happening in our U.S. commodities markets so we \ncan give consumers better protection. It is time to burst the oil price \nbubble. I think people everywhere across this country, and analysts on \nWall Street, are saying: This is\n\n[[Page S4765]]\n\nnot supply and demand. So it is up to us to make sure we have the \nenforcement in place to protect consumers, and that is what we hope the \nCFTC will realize their role and responsibility is.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I was very interested in the \ndistinguished Senator's remarks and her analysis. What is interesting \nto me is that a number of years ago Boone Pickens came to me and when \noil was down around $40 a barrel, he said: Orrin, oil is going to go to \n60 bucks a barrel, and it is going to go up from there to $100 a \nbarrel. This was years ago. And I said: That is not true. He said: It \nis true. Well, he told me a couple of weeks ago, and this is pathetic, \nand said we are sending $600 billion of our money to purchase non-\nAmerican oil when we have it within our grasp to create much of the oil \nthe United States of America needs from our own American oil sources.\n  I will cite with particularity the oil shale and tar sands in \nColorado, Wyoming, and Utah. It is well established that there are 3 \ntrillion potential barrels of oil there, and it is pretty much taken \nfor granted that we can get at least 800 billion to almost 2 trillion \nbarrels of oil out of that at somewhere between $40 and $60 a barrel. \nBut because of legislative maneuvering by my friends across the aisle, \nwe can't get regulations established to do the work that has to be \ndone.\n  Now, I am for every form of alternative oil. And, frankly, nobody has \na right to say I am not because I am the one who passed, with some very \nimportant colleagues, the CLEAR Act. The CLEAR Act created the \nincentives for alternative fuels, alternative fuel vehicles and \nalternative fuel infrastructure that are being used right now.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I certainly want to say that I know of the work of the \nSenator from Utah, because we worked together on plug-in hybrids and \nother incentives, and he clearly does support renewable fuels and \nchanging our tax credit policies, so I applaud that.\n  I am glad you brought up Boone Pickens, because I heard him on the TV \nthe other day, I think it was 2 days ago, and he said that while he \nthought the United States had great opportunity in natural gas, he \nthought the way to get off our dependence on foreign oil, besides that, \nwas to make investment in wind and solar. So I will look forward to \nworking with the Senator when we return on trying to push those tax \npolicies to make sure we continue to incent those good renewable energy \npolicies.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I thank the Senator from Washington for her \ncomments, because she has been central to this effort, especially with \nregard to plug-in hybrid vehicles. Now, those are a still a distance \naway yet, but, nevertheless, we can do it. That effort may not \ncompletely solve our energy problem, but it certainly would alleviate \nsome of it.\n  In addition, a number of other measures I put through are the \ninvestment tax credits to spur the development of solar, geothermal, \nwind, and other renewable forms of electricity. No question about it. \nBut that alone still not going to solve our problem, especially not \nwith liquid fuels.\n  We had testimony yesterday from oil company executives who said if we \ndo everything in our power on alternative fuels by 2025, or around that \ntime, we might be able to get 20 percent of our energy needs. But in \nthe meantime, what are our cars, trucks, trains, and planes going to \nrun on? They have to run on oil. And we have the oil within the \nconfines of the United States, on land and offshore, to resolve a lot \nof these difficulties. But it will take years even to do that, if we \ncan get past the environmental extremists to be able to do this. In the \nmeantime, we are losing jobs, we are losing our economy, and we are \nlosing with respect to a lot of other problems. In the end, we are \ngoing to have to resolve it by drilling for American oil, both \nconventional and unconventional oil, and we have the ability to do it, \nand to do it in ways that make sense, that are environmentally sound, \nand are economical. Some of my colleagues on the other side object to \nCanadian oil because Canada is putting up a million barrels a day out \nof their tar sands, and they do not like the fact the tar sands have \nsome carbon in them. But the fact is, Canada is going to go to 3 \nmillion barrels a day. So what do we do if we don't take Canadian oil \nwhen they are happy to sell it to us? We are going to have to go to \nVenezuela, Russia, the Middle East, and other places to get our oil, \nand many of those countries are antithetical to what we believe in and \nare not particularly happy about United States power in this world.\n  Now, Mr. Pickens also predicted it is only going to be a matter of \ntime until we are going to be called in and these oil barons from these \nother foreign lands, who aren't particularly enamored of the United \nStates--in fact, if anything, they are jealous of the United States--\nare going to say: You have been consuming 25 percent of the world's \noil, but you only have 6 percent of the world's population. We are \ngoing to have to cut you back, especially now that they can sell all \nthey want to China, India, and other countries that are voracious in \ntheir demands for oil.\n  We have to wake up and realize we can't sit back and hope ethanol is \ngoing to solve this problem. We can produce about 5 billion barrels of \nethanol, which is the equivalent to about 3\\1/2\\ billion gallons of \noil. However, we consume 3\\1/2\\ billion gallons of gas. If we do \neverything in our power to do ethanol, we are not going to be able to \nresolve our energy problem without increasing our oil supply, too.\n  I might add that I see some very important work being done on \nrenewables. I talked to my friend Vinod Khosla. Vinod is building a \nsolar thermal plant, 200 megawatts, in California that should be \nfinished by 2010. He believes we can do that all over the place. Boone \nPickens has decided that in the wind corridor from Canada right down \nthrough Texas, he could build windmills all up and down that corridor \nthat would provide over one thousand megawatts of power, which would be \nvery beneficial to our country, but that's electricity, not liquid \nfuel.\n\n  We know we can find more and more natural gas on our Federal lands if \nwe want to do it. We know how to do natural gas-driven vehicles right \nnow. We actually have natural gas stations in Utah and we have natural \ngas drivers, but they are the exception to the rule. We know how to \nbuild hydrogen cars that have absolutely zero emissions, but we only \nhave 9 million tons of hydrogen in this country. You would have to have \nat least 150 million tons of hydrogen to make a dent, and the only \nfeasible way to get that much hydrogen is probably through nuclear. We \nare about the only major nation in the world that isn't going ahead \nwith nuclear as we should. We know it is one of the cleanest sources of \nenergy in the world. I personally believe we will find methodologies \nand ways of neutralizing nuclear waste.\n  We can no longer afford to sit back and believe ethanol is going to \nsolve all our problems, or wind power is going to solve all our \nproblems, or solar power is going to solve all our problems, or that \ngeothermal is going to solve all our problems. We have to distinguish \nbetween electricity and liquid fuels. Because of the work I have done \nto promote geothermal, I went out to Utah 2 weeks ago and helped \ndedicate the ground for the first geothermal power plant in over 20 \nyears. This company, which is a very rare company, is going to build \nthese all up and down Utah, where we have all kinds of geothermal \nprospects. It's wonderful, but it doesn't solve our liquid fuel \nproblem. It will not get us to where we can continue to keep our \neconomy alive in America.\n  A lot of this has stopped because of environmental extremism. We all \nwant clean air and clean water, and I don't think any environmentalist \nshould start chewing me up when I am the one who helped put these bills \nthrough that have spurred on alternative energy and hybrid \ntechnologies, and I will do everything in my power to continue spurring \nit on. But let us make no mistakes about it, we have to have oil over \nthe next 20, 25 years and beyond that in order to keep America strong.\n  And to blame the big oil companies--we hear: Big oil companies--one \nof the Senators yesterday said: How could you do this to America? Now, \nlet's get the facts. The big oil companies are only 6 percent of the \nworld's deliverers\n\n[[Page S4766]]\n\nof oil. The vast majority of oil that is delivered is by government-\nowned entities. Not ours, but foreign government-owned entities. We \nhave made it all but impossible to drill for oil within the continental \nUnited States, especially on Federal grounds. And again, it is \nenvironmental extremism that is stopping that.\n  I want people to have jobs. I also want to go full bore in all of \nthese other alternative forms of energy that hopefully will alleviate \nsome of this dependency we have, but we can alleviate a lot of our \ndependency by doing the oil shale work in Colorado, Wyoming, and in my \nhome State of Utah. That needs to be done. It takes one acre to produce \n5 barrels of ethanol. I'm a big fan of ethanol incentives, as I've \nsaid. However, Mr. President, do you realize how much oil can be \nachieved from 1 acre in oil shale in those tri-State areas? It is \nbetween 100,000 and 1 million barrels of oil. And we are just letting \nit sit there because we can't get the leases and my friends on the \nother side of the aisle are specifically blocking it.\n  Because of liberal, excessive environmental restraints, we can't get \nAmerican oil to save America. We can't drill in American waters. China \nis. They are coming right over to our waters and drilling for oil that \nwe can't drill for because of these extremists. And they blame 6 \npercent of the world's oil-producing companies and say they are the \ncause of all these problems? Give me a break. It is about time we wake \nup. Sure, politically it sounds good, but practically and \nscientifically it is total bull corn, I think may be my best way of \ndescribing it.\n  I am for all these environmental things too, but I want it to work. I \ndon't want it to be a political exercise so one side can win over the \nother.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4766-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4766-S4767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Now, Madam President, I want to change the subject for a \nminute. I need to make a few remarks on the ongoing effort to conduct \nsomething that resembles a fair and productive judicial confirmation \nprocess, which is something that is bothering me here today as well. As \nyou can see, I am not in a good mood.\n  It looks obvious that the commitment by leaders on the other side of \nthe aisle to confirm three more appeals court nominees by the Memorial \nDay recess is not going to be met. Failure was not inevitable. There \nwas a clear path to keep that commitment with nominees who had long ago \nbeen fully vetted, nominees who have been pending for up to 2 years, \nhighly qualified nominees with the highest ratings from the American \nBar Association and who have the support of their home State Senators.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle knew how to keep their \ncommitment, but instead they chose the path of greatest resistance, the \npath with the greatest chance of failure. And failure is exactly what \nis happening. These days, we often make comparisons between how \nPresident Bush's nominees are being treated today and how President \nClinton's nominees were treated. Now here is one more comparison to \nconsider.\n  In November 1999, Majority Leader Trent Lott promised to hold a vote \nby May 15, 2000 on two of President Clinton's most controversial \njudicial nominees, with my consent as the Judiciary Committee chairman, \nRichard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the Ninth Circuit, two very liberal \nnominees. These nominees were opposed by hundreds of grassroots groups. \nTheir records caused a great deal of angst among many Senators on this \nside of the aisle. The majority leader did not make his commitment in \nvague, fuzzy terms. He named names, picked dates, and stated \nobjectives. He made a commitment and he kept it, and they both sit on \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to this day.\n  They were both competent. Would I have nominated them? No. Would a \nRepublican President have nominated them? No. But they were competent, \nthey did have the approval of the ABA, and they deserved a vote up or \ndown and they got it.\n\n  We took a cloture vote to ensure there would be no filibuster, and \nconfirmed those controversial nominees on March 8, 2000, a week earlier \nthan promised. It is a very different situation today.\n  I wish to address some other issues that highlight the current state \nof the judicial confirmation process. Talking about numbers, \npercentages, and comparisons makes some people's eyes glaze over, while \nothers have trouble sorting out the dueling figures. If enough \nconfusion exists, the American people might not fully appreciate what \nis going on. But as our former colleague from New York, the late \nSenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan once said--a friend of mine--``You are \nentitled to your own opinion but not to your own set of facts.''\n  I believe facts matter. I believe the truth matters. Some have \nclaimed the Senate has confirmed 86 percent of President Bush's \njudicial nominees compared to only 75 percent of President Clinton's. \nThis claim is either true or false. If you believe, as I do, that the \ntruth matters, then it is important to know the answer. What is true? \nThe most recent figures from the Congressional Research Service show \nthe Senate has confirmed 85 percent of President Bush's appeals court \nnominees compared to 84 percent of President Clinton's nominees. That \nis about as nonpartisan and objective a source as you can find. It \nturns out the Senate confirmed, not 75 percent of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees but 84 percent. No matter how you slice, dice or spin \nit, this claim is not true.\n  Another claim often repeated on the Senate floor by Democrats is that \nwhen I chaired the Judiciary Committee, I blocked more than 60 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees by denying them a hearing. Some \nclaims, apparently, need not be true as long as they are useful. In \nthis one, the judicial confirmation version of the urban myth seems \nuseful indeed, based on the number of times it is repeated in various \nversions and permutations. This claim is no more true than the first \none I mentioned. Some Clinton nominees were not confirmed. Some \nnominees of every President are not confirmed.\n  In 1992, George Herbert Walker Bush left office, the Senate was \ncontrolled by the same party as today, the Democratic Party, and \nreturned more than 50 unconfirmed judicial nominees to President Bush. \nI don't recall that we stood and moaned and groaned like is going on \ntoday, at this time. We didn't. The fact is, that is what happens at \nthe end of a Presidential term. The claim being made today, however, is \nall those unconfirmed Clinton nominees could have been confirmed but \nwere not, solely because I, as chairman, refused to give them hearings.\n  This is one of those claims that some apparently hope no one will \nbother to unpack and sort out. But consider this. A dozen of those \nnominees were not confirmed because President Clinton withdrew them. He \nactually withdrew them. That was not my prerogative as chairman. That \nwas his prerogative as President. It continues to baffle me how the \nJudiciary Committee chairman can be blamed because nominees who no \nlonger exist were not confirmed. Many of those unconfirmed nominees did \nnot have the support of their home State Senators. Judiciary Committee \nchairmen of both parties, before me and after me, including the current \nchairman, do not give hearings to nominees without the support of their \nhome State Senators. That is a matter of fact.\n  We also hear the claim that in Presidential election years, the \njudicial confirmation process is, to quote the current Judiciary \nCommittee chairman, ``far less productive.''\n  Once again, this claim is not true. The average number of appeals \ncourt nominees given hearings and the number of judicial nominees \nconfirmed goes up, not down, in Presidential election years.\n  Finally, we hear the astounding claim that Republicans are supposedly \nobstructing the nomination of Judge Helene White to the Sixth Circuit \nbecause we have asked her questions about her record, her \nqualifications, and her judicial philosophy. Judge White was nominated \nless than 2 months ago, and the Judiciary Committee was given just 22 \ndays from her nomination until her hearing--a period far shorter, even, \nthan noncontroversial nominees over the years.\n  We had 70 days before Seventh Circuit Court nominee John Tinder's \nhearing, for example, and 120 days before Second Circuit nominee Debra \nLivingston received a hearing. We had only 22\n\n[[Page S4767]]\n\ndays this time and the chairman close to waive his own rule and hold a \nhearing without an evaluation from the American Bar Association, \nsomething we still do not have today for Judge White.\n  That is a party that insisted we always have the ABA evaluation in--\nfor Republican nominees.\n  So written questions following the hearing were entirely in order. \nThe number of questions asked of Judge White pales in comparison to the \nnumber of questions my friends on the other side have asked of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees who had been pending far longer and \nfor whom we had received an ABA--American Bar Association--evaluation.\n  We had 112 days before Fifth Circuit nominee Jennifer Elrod's \nhearing, for example, more than five times longer than we had with \nJudge White. Yet my Democratic friends gave Judge Elrod 108 questions, \nfar more than Judge White has received. After all that, the Senate \nconfirmed Judge Elrod by voice vote.\n  I might add, to mention a nonjudicial nominee, Grace Becker, who was \nnominated 189 days ago to head the Civil Rights Division. She has \nreceived 250 questions from my Democratic friends. I hear they are not \ndone yet. It is as though no Republican should have the job of heading \nthe Civil Rights Division. Grace is a former counsel on the Judiciary \nCommittee and is well known to all of us as a woman of intellect, \ncharacter, and compassion. She is a Eurasian woman with whom I think \nnobody can find one iota of fault.\n  A few days ago, the current Judiciary Committee chairman said the \njudicial confirmation process reminded him of the fairytale, \n``Goldilocks and the Three Bears.'' Sometimes it reminds me, instead, \nof the episode of the sitcom ``Seinfeld'' about ``Bizarro World.'' That \nis the world where everything up is down, left is right, and everything \nis not as it seems. In the ``Bizarro World'' of today's judicial \nconfirmation process, a plan almost certain to fail is called a \ncommitment; 84 is called 75; a senatorial courtesy see is called a \npocket filibuster; being more productive is being called being less \nproductive; and due diligence is being called obstruction. I believe \nthe facts and the truth matter, even in the judicial confirmation \nprocess, in spite of some of this rhetoric.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4767-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4767-S4768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WARTIME SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, In February I addressed the Senate about \nour progress in Iraq. I categorized the results of General Petraeus' \ncomprehensive counterinsurgency strategy as being remarkable.\n\n  When General Petraeus first began to implement his strategy 16 months \nago, I was optimistic. However, I must admit that I did not expect to \nsee the level of success that has been accomplished in such a short \nperiod of time.\n  What are those accomplishments?\n  Al-Qaida has largely been removed from its sanctuaries in Ramadi, \nFallujah, Baghdad and much of the Diyala province. I went there when \nall those were seemingly under Al-Qaida control. I also went back and \nwalked the streets of Ramadi after the surge. That was the second trip.\n  Make no mistake, these are major victories.\n  However, what has largely gone unnoticed by the media, is that even \nin the less than 2 months since General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker \ncame before Congress, these successes have continued and expanded.\n  Which leads me to ask the obvious question? Why, with all of these \naccomplishments that were attained through the blood, sweat and tears \nof our service members and their families, do the members on the other \nside of the aisle insist upon throwing it all away by setting arbitrary \ndeadlines for the removal of the bulk of our forces from Iraq?\n  The only logical answer is that instead of attempting to devise a \ncohesive strategy that achieves victory, the Democrats are more \ninterested in pandering to the appeasement wing of their party in a \nmisguided attempt to curry political favor.\n  This is a strategy for defeat and national shame.\n  I repudiate such an approach. My colleague, Senator McCain repudiates \nsuch an approach. And I believe the American people will repudiate this \napproach once they have all of the facts that somehow continue to \nescape widespread coverage by our media. Why don't they tell the truth? \nWhy don't they tell about the successes?\n  But before I discuss the most recent accomplishments of U.S. and \nIraqi forces, I believe it is important for the American people to \nunderstand one of the elements behind our recent success.\n  General Petraeus' strategy is based upon the classic \ncounterinsurgency tactic of providing security to the local population, \nthereby enabling the government to restore services to its people. \nThis, in turn, creates in the population a vested interest in the \nsuccess of government institutions.\n  One of the ways this is accomplished is through the use of Joint \nSecurity Stations. Under this tactic, a portion of a city, such as a \nneighborhood, is cordoned off then searched for insurgents. Previously, \nonce this was accomplished, our forces would return to large forward-\noperating bases, usually on the periphery of that city. The result was \neasy to predict, the insurgents would return once the sweep had \nconcluded.\n  Under General Petraeus' strategy, our forces remain in the \nneighborhood and build Joint Security Stations, which then become home \nto a company-sized unit of American service members, as well as Iraqi \narmy and police units. They live together. These facilities not only \nhelp secure the surrounding area, but simultaneously enable our forces \nto train and evaluate Iraqi forces. Much like the police officer \nwalking a beat in a major city, our forces use the Joint Security \nStation to learn about the locale where they are assigned and can \nquickly adapt to meet the unique security needs of the individual \ncommunity. This, in turn, permits the creation of vital infrastructure \nprojects that provide power, clean water and schools to these newly \nsecured areas. This instills within the people in the area a desire for \nthe security and civil services to continue; which, in turn, \nstrengthens the population's support for an effective government to \nmaintain these improvements. The success of these Joint Security \nStations can be seen in their creation throughout Iraq, with more than \n50 of them in Baghdad alone.\n  But, as I previously stated, since General Petraeus' testimony in \nFebruary, the Coalition has only added to the accomplishments of al \nAnbar, Baghdad, and Diyala.\n  At the time of General Petraeus' testimony, many lauded these \nsuccesses. But many also pointed to three major challenges that \ncontinued to face the Coalition.\n  The first major challenge was in this northern city of Mosul. Despite \nthe fact that al-Qaida has largely been thrown out of its former \nsanctuaries in central Iraq, the terrorists have retreated to and are \nregrouping their forces in this northern city. It should also be noted \nthat al-Qaida has used Mosul as a key logistics, transportation and \nfinancial center. In fact, Reuters has quoted U.S. military officials \nas saying that Mosul is al-Qaida's last major urban stronghold in Iraq.\n  Second, the Iraqi government did not have control of the vital \nsouthern city of Basra, which was dominated by a number of Shiite \nfactions. As my colleagues well know, Basra is home to Iraq's only \nseaport and the area surrounding the city is the location of much of \nthe nation's oil wealth.\n  Third, the Iraqi Government did not have control of a neighborhood in \neastern Baghdad known as Sadr City, a predominately Shiite district \nthat is a center of support for Moktada al-Sadr.\n  However, since General Petraeus' testimony there have been remarkable \nchanges in Mosul, Basra, and Sadr City.\n  First, I must say that I am increasingly confident about the \nCoalition's chances for making positive advances in Mosul.\n  Remember, shortly after the fall of Saddam Hussein's government, \nGeneral Petraeus, then a major general in command of the 101st Airborne \nDivision, was responsible for restoring order in Mosul. It was here \nthat General Petraeus was first able to implement and refine his \ntheories on counterinsurgency warfare and was largely successful in \nsecuring the city.\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\nUnfortunately, with the 101st's departure and the sharp reduction in \nthe number of Coalition forces in Mosul--to as few as one American \nbattalion--the city and surrounding area became a haven for al-Qaida.\n  However, in mid-2007 the Coalition forces began to achieve some \nsuccess. This occurred in no small part because of the increased \neffectiveness of the 2nd and 3rd Iraqi divisions that were assigned to \nthe city and surrounding areas. According to the Institute for the \nStudy of War, in May and June positive results quickly became apparent \nwith the capture or killing of 13 al-Qaida leaders, including 6 emirs \nand 4 terrorist cell leaders. Yet, as al-Qaida members were being \npushed out of Baghdad and al Anbar Province, the number of terrorists \nin Mosul was increasing.\n  However, our forces, led by the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, which \nreplaced the 4th Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division in December, and \nthe Iraqi security forces have kept the pressure on. In mid-December, \nal-Qaida's security emir for northern Iraq was captured along with al-\nQaida's security emir for Mosul. This was followed by the capture of \nal-Qaida's deputy emir for all of Mosul.\n  Our successes also have been strengthened with the reinforcement of \nour forces by additional U.S. and Iraqi forces. This has enabled \nCoalition and Iraqi forces to implement the counterinsurgency strategy \nof utilizing Joint Security Stations in the eastern and western \nportions of Mosul, much like those that were so successful in Baghdad.\n  The Iraqi Army units in Ninawa Province, of which Mosul is a major \ncity, also have a new commander, LTG Riyadh Jalal Tawfiq. This is an \nimportant development since Lieutenant General Tawfiq played a vital \nrole in securing Baghdad.\n  Despite these promising developments, much remains to be \naccomplished. On May 10, the Coalition launched Operation Mother of Two \nSprings. Though it is too early to tell if this operation will have the \nsame successes that our forces are experiencing in Baghdad, MG Mark \nHertling, the commander of Multi-National Forces--North stated \nyesterday that daily attacks are down 85 percent since the operation \nbegan. The General also noted that the Coalition has detained more than \n1,200 individuals many of whom are self-proclaimed al-Qaida members who \ndescribe themselves as ``battalion commanders . . . suicide bomb \nmakers, foreign fighter facilitators, financiers and emirs.'' Moreover, \na number of arms caches have been discovered. However, the desperation \nof al-Qaida appears to have increased due to Saturday's attack by two \nfemale suicide bombers.\n  Mr. President, the battle for Mosul is being fought right now. The \nfinal outcome has yet to be decided. However, initial indications point \nto a successful conclusion because of the implementation of a proven \ncounterinsurgency strategy, improvements in the Iraqi security forces \nand the bravery and dedication of our fighting men and women.\n  The second major area of consternation was Basra. Until recently, \nShiite groups such as the Mahdi militia--which is associated with \nMoktada al-Sadr--ruled the streets.\n  In order to counter this lawlessness, Prime Minister al-Maliki \nlaunched Operation Charge of the Knights. This was a bold initiative. \nFirst, Prime Minister al-Maliki showed that he is a leader who is \nwilling to make difficult political decisions to secure a better future \nfor his people by traveling to Basra and taking personal charge of this \noperation. Second, this was a large-scale operation led and planned by \nIraqi security forces to restore central government control in Basra.\n  At first, poor planning seemed to have doomed this operation. Even \nGeneral Petraeus initially stated, ``The fact is that the Iraqi \noperations in Basra were not properly planned . . . in the wake of \nrecent operations, there were units and leaders found wanting in some \ncases . . .''\n  However, it appears that we all judged this operation too quickly. \nAccording to a recent article in the New York Times, ``the oil-\nsaturated city of Basra has been transformed by its own [Iraqi security \nforces] surge.'' Iraqi forces ``have largely quieted the city, to the \ninitial surprise and growing delight of many inhabitants who only a \nmonth ago shuddered under deadly clashes between Iraqi troops and \nShiite militias . . . government forces have taken over Islamic \nmilitant's headquarters and halted the death squads and vice \nenforcers.''\n  It should also be noted that according to the highly respected Jane's \nDefence Weekly ``in areas occupied by Iraqi army forces, the government \nhas begun a wide ranging set of operations to solidify its long-term \npresence.''\n  In fact, due in large part to the success of Operation Charge of the \nKnights, Jane's Defence Weekly made the following observation: \n``Operation Charge of the Knights provides further evidence that the \nIraqi army can fight effectively and lead operations when supported by \ncoalition enablers such as air support, logistics, and intelligence. \nThe Basra security operation follows other successful Iraqi army \nperformances in the south, notably the January 2007 defeat of the Jund \nal-Samaa sect in pitched battles outside Karbala and the January 2008 \nsimultaneous takedown of a dozen cultist cells from the same \norganization spread across Basra and Nasiriyah.''\n  Finally, examples of the major strides the Iraqi forces are making \ncan be seen in the operations that were launched this week in Sadr \nCity. Yesterday, the New York Times reported that six battalions of, \n``Iraqi troops pushed deep into Sadr City. . . as the Iraqi government \nsought to establish control over the densely populated Shiite enclave \nin the Iraqi capital. The long awaited military operation, which took \nplace without the involvement of American ground forces, was the first \ndetermined effort by the government of Prime Minister al-Maliki to \nassert control over the sprawling Baghdad neighborhood, which has been \na bastion of support for Moktada al-Sadr. The operation comes in the \nwake of the government's offensive in Basra, which for the time being \nseems to have pacified the southern Iraqi city and restored government \ncontrol.''\n  The New York Times goes on to report about the Sadr City operation, \n``the Iraqi forces quickly assumed positions at a main thoroughfare and \nnear major hospitals and police stations. Two companies ventured even \nfurther north to secure the Iman Ali Hospital. . . No American ground \nforces accompanied the Iraqi troops, not even military advisers. But \nthe Americans shared intelligence, coached the Iraqis during the \nplanning and provided overhead reconnaissance throughout the operation. \nStill, the operation was very much an Iraqi plan.''\n  Madam President, I believe that Ambassador Crocker summed up the \nsituation best when he stated in his testimony: ``Al-Qaida is in \nretreat in Iraq, but it is not yet defeated. Al-Qaida's leaders are \nlooking for every opportunity they can to hang on. Osama bin Ladin has \ncalled Iraq `the perfect base,' and it reminds us that a fundamental \naim of al-Qaida is to establish itself in the Arab world. It almost \nsucceeded in Iraq; we cannot allow it a second chance. . .''\n  The choice is clear. The men and women of our armed forces have made \nreal and sustained progress over the past 16 months. The list of their \naccomplishments and the accomplishments of the Iraqi security forces \ngrows longer every day.\n  The balance is changing. Now, more then ever, is the time to stand \nbehind our forces to ensure they achieve the victory of which they so \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4768-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4768-S4770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in the final year of President \nClinton's final Congress, two of his circuit court nominees, Richard \nPaez and Marsha Berzon, were pending in the Judiciary Committee. \nFrankly, they were quite controversial. For example, Judge Paez had \nopenly defended judicial activism. He said if the Democratic branch has\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\nfailed to act on a political matter, it was incumbent on judges to do \nso, even if the matter properly belonged to the legislature.\n  Not surprisingly, conservative groups and many Republican Senators \nopposed the Paez and Berzon nominations. The Chamber of Commerce, a \nbusiness association, not an ideological group, was so troubled by the \nprospect of Judge Paez's confirmation that it broke its policy of \nstaying out of nomination disputes and opposed his nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the release by \nthe Chamber of Commerce opposing Judge Paez.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n     U.S. Chamber Announces Opposition to Paez Judicial Nomination\n\n       Washington, D.C.--The United States Chamber of Commerce \n     today announced its opposition to the elevation of district \n     court judge Richard Paez to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. \n     The 9th Circuit Court reviews federal court decisions in \n     California, Arizona, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada and \n     Montana.\n       In taking the unusual step of opposing a judicial nominee, \n     Chamber senior vice president Lonnie Taylor said, ``Judge \n     Paez' lower court rulings demonstrate an alarming degree of \n     judicial activism that must not be rewarded.''\n       Taylor specifically cited Paez' ruling in John Doe I v. \n     Unocal, saying the decision ``represents an unconstitutional \n     judicial intrusion into foreign policy with dangerous \n     implications for the U.S. economy and world markets.''\n       In the Unocal case--which concerns the construction of an \n     offshore drilling station and natural gas pipeline--Judge \n     Paez held that U.S. companies doing business overseas were \n     liable for the actions of foreign governments. The ruling \n     opened the door to environmental activists and others to use \n     similar class action lawsuits as an avenue of attack on \n     disfavored business projects, Taylor charged.\n       ``Judge Paez' ruling, if upheld, could cripple \n     international commerce and establish a far-reaching precedent \n     of holding U.S. companies hostage to the actions of foreign \n     governments,'' said Taylor.\n       Improving the ability of American businesses to compete in \n     the global marketplace is a top priority of the Chamber. As \n     part of the Chamber's efforts to advance free trade, it will \n     oppose any attempts to undermine international \n     competitiveness. The U.S. Chamber notified Senators of its \n     opposition to Judge Paez in a letter yesterday.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest \n     business federation representing more than three million \n     businesses and organizations of every size, sector and \n     region.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The California Senators, to their credit, were \ntireless advocates for Judge Paez and Judge Berzon. Their nominations \nbecame the California Senators' cause, and their ultimate confirmations \nwere due to our colleagues' tireless advocacy.\n  Their confirmations, though, were also due to then-Majority leader \nTrent Lott ensuring that his commitment regarding the Paez and Berzon \nnominations was, in fact, kept. On November 10, 1999, Majority Leader \nLott placed a colloquy between himself and then-Democratic Leader \nDaschle in the Congressional Record. In it, Senator Lott committed to \nproceed to Paez and Berzon by March 15 of the following year, which of \ncourse was a Presidential election year, as this year is.\n  Majority Leader Lott also stated he did not believe that filibusters \nof judicial nominations are appropriate, and that if they were to \noccur, he would file cloture on their nominations and he would himself \nsupport cloture if necessary.\n  He noted then-Judiciary Chairman Hatch was consulted on that \ncommitment. Given that many in our conference and over 300 groups \nopposed those nominations, it would have been easier in many respects \nfor Senator Lott not to fulfill his commitment. He could have taken a \nhands-off approach, shrugged his shoulders, put the onus on Chairman \nHatch to make good on the majority leader's commitment. After all, \nSenator Lott was not the Judiciary Committee Chairman, Senator Hatch \nwas. He could simply have said he did not control what happened in the \nJudiciary Committee, Chairman Hatch did. But Senator Lott understood \nthat commitments in this body are not to be taken lightly, especially \nwhen they are made by the majority leader himself.\n  So true to his word, Majority Leader Lott worked to ensure that his \ncommitment was kept. The Paez and Berzon nominations were reported out \nof the committee. The majority leader, Senator Lott, filed cloture on \nboth. On March 8, 2000, a week ahead of schedule, he and I and Chairman \nHatch and a supermajority of the Republican conference voted to give \nJudges Paez and Berzon an up-or-down vote.\n  Most of those Republicans, myself included, then voted against them \nbecause of concerns about their records. But Judges Paez and Berzon \nwere then, of course, confirmed and have been sitting on the Ninth \nCircuit for 8 years because Senator Lott honored his commitment.\n  Unfortunately, a similar commitment made to my conference was not \nhonored today. Last month, my good friend from Nevada, the majority \nleader, acknowledged that the Democratic majority needed ``to make more \nprogress on'' circuit court nominations.\n  To that end, he committed to do his ``utmost;'' ``to do everything'' \npossible; to do ``everything within [his] power to get three [more] \njudges approved to our circuit [courts] before the Memorial Day \nrecess.''\n  ``Who knows,'' he even suggested, ``we may even get lucky and get \nmore than that [because] we have a number of people from whom to \nchoose.''\n  True, the majority leader gave himself an out. He could not \n``guarantee'' his commitment because ``a lot of things can happen in \nthe Senate.'' But when the Senate majority leader commits to do \neverything in his power to honor a commitment, that should mean \nchoosing a path that likely will yield a result.\n  Well, today we learned we are not going to get three more circuit \ncourt confirmations by the Memorial Day recess, let alone the four or \nmore the majority leader thought might be possible. No, we are going to \nget one. Only one.\n  Given my friend's clear commitment and the numerous nominees the \nDemocratic majority had to choose from, the question my Republican \ncolleagues and I are asking is this: Did the majority do its \n``utmost''? Did it do ``everything'' possible? Did it do ``everything \nwithin [its] power''?\n  In fact, we are asking did it do anything at all to realistically \nensure the commitment would be kept?\n  When my friend made his commitment, he noted that we had circuit \ncourt nominees from all over the country in the Judiciary Committee who \ncould be processed. He listed the States they were from. Most have been \npending for a long time, and the Judiciary Committee has had ample time \nto study their records. Indeed, some have already had hearings; others \nhave already been favorably reported by the committee to other \nimportant positions. These nominees were, in effect, on the two-yard \nline, and could easily have been picked and confirmed.\n  People like Peter Keisler; he has been pending for almost 700 days. \nHe has had a hearing. He has been rated unanimously well-qualified by \nthe American Bar Association. He has earned accolades from Republicans \nand Democrats alike, including an endorsement from the Washington Post. \nHis paperwork is complete, and he is ready to go.\n  Or people like Chief Judge Robert Conrad; he has been pending for \nover 300 days. The Senate has already confirmed him, on two separate \noccasions, to important Federal legal positions, first as the chief \nFederal law enforcement officer in North Carolina and then to a life-\ntime position on the Federal trial bench. He, too, has received the \nABA's highest rating, and has earned praise from Republicans and \nDemocrats alike. He has the strong support of both home-State senators \nand is ready for a vote.\n  During our colloquy, my friend did not reference the nomination of \nMichigan State Judge Helene White as an option. That is because her \nnomination to the Sixth Circuit did not yet exist. It wasn't here. It \narrived here later that day, at which point there were only 5\\1/2\\ \nweeks until the Memorial Day recess. Or, put another way, her \nnomination arrived 700 days after Mr. Keisler's, 300 days after Judge \nConrad's.\n  Thirty-five days is not much time to process a nominee who, by her \nown admission, has participated in 4,500 cases, half of which are \ncompletely new since her last nomination. Indeed, the average time for \nconfirming a judicial nominee in this administration is 162 days. The \nmajority decided to try to\n\n[[Page S4770]]\n\nrun Judge White through the process in just 35 days. It scheduled a \nhearing for her that was only 22 days after her nomination. I respect \nthe abilities of members on the Judiciary Committee, but even they \ncannot review 4,500 cases in 22 days.\n  In addition, when the majority scheduled her hearing, the ink was \nbarely dry on the FBI's background investigation, which had come up \nonly the day before, and the committee had yet to receive her ABA \nreport. In fact, today as I speak, it still is not here.\n  This matters because Chairman Leahy has made it abundantly clear that \nthe receipt of the ABA report is a precondition for him to allow a vote \non a judicial nominee, saying: ``Here is the bottom line. . . . There \nwill be an ABA background check before there is a vote.'' He reiterated \nthat his rule will be observed with respect to the White nomination.\n  So to honor the majority leader's commitment, did our Democratic \ncolleagues choose someone whom the committee had ample time to vet, \nwhose paperwork has been done for a long time, and who, in the case of \nJudge Conrad, the Senate had already confirmed--twice? No, they decided \nto rush through Judge White, someone whom several members of the \ncommittee are completely unfamiliar with, and whose record for most of \nthe last decade the entire committee is completely unfamiliar with, \nincluding thousands of her cases.\n  In essence, the majority decided to throw a confirmation ``hail \nMary'' to satisfy its own Democratic membership, instead of taking a \nbi-partisan path that had every indication of success and would have \nfulfilled the commitment, like finally processing Mr. Keisler or Judge \nConrad.\n  If the majority were serious about keeping its commitment all this \nshould have been avoided. My friend from Nevada has said he consulted \nfully with Chairman Leahy before making his commitment. Chairman Leahy \nhas been the lead Democrat on the Judiciary Committee for over a \ndecade. He, perhaps more than anyone, is aware of the logistical \nrequirements for processing nominees.\n  We assume he would have advised the majority leader of the near-\ncertain impossibility of confirming Judge White in time to keep the \ncommitment. Even if he didn't, the ranking member and I did just that \nalmost a month ago, when we wrote to him and the Chairman, expressing \nour serious concerns about this very situation arising.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2008.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Capitol Building, Washington, \n         DC\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senators Reid and Leahy: We write to express our \n     serious concern regarding statements made by Chairman Leahy \n     during last week's Judiciary Committee Executive Business \n     Meeting. In discussing Senator Reid's April 15, 2008, \n     commitment to confirm three more circuit court nominations \n     before the Memorial Day recess, Senator Specter asked \n     Chairman Leahy to clarify whether he was saying he would not \n     honor the commitment if the scheduling was not ``convenient \n     for the two Michigan nominees.'' In response, Chairman Leahy \n     stated, ``I will do everything possible to get it [done] by \n     Memorial Day, but if the White House slow walks [the Michigan \n     nominees' paperwork], we probably won't.''\n       We all know there are several time-consuming steps in the \n     judicial confirmation process, including a Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation background investigation, the issuance of a \n     rating by the American Bar Association (ABA), a hearing, \n     questions for the nominee following the hearing, a Committee \n     vote, and finally a floor vote. Given these standard \n     prerequisites and Judge Helene White's recent nomination date \n     of April 15, 2008, we do not believe regular order and \n     process will allow for her confirmation prior to May 23, \n     2008. In addition, the FBI is currently conducting a \n     supplemental investigation for Mr. Raymond Kethledge, which \n     must be completed prior to his hearing. Chairman Leahy's \n     statements insinuate that, if the Committee cannot process \n     Judge White and Mr. Kethledge prior to the recess, then the \n     straightforward commitment made by the Majority Leader and, \n     by reference, Chairman Leahy will not be honored.\n       We would hope, given the likelihood that Judge White and \n     Mr. Kethledge cannot be confirmed prior to the recess, that, \n     in order to fulfill the commitment, Chairman Leahy would turn \n     to other outstanding circuit court nominees pending in \n     Committee who have been ready for hearings and waiting far \n     longer than Judge White or Mr. Kethledge. As we have \n     mentioned previously, Mr. Peter Keisler has already had a \n     hearing and has been waiting for over 660 days for a simple \n     Committee vote, and Judge Robert Conrad and Mr. Steve \n     Matthews, nominees to the Fourth Circuit, are ready for \n     hearings and have been waiting for many months. Both Judge \n     Conrad and Mr. Matthews have enjoyed strong home-state \n     support from their Senate delegations, one of whom is a \n     valued member of the Committee. All three of these nominees \n     deserve prompt consideration by the Committee and up-or-down \n     votes by the full Senate.\n       It is simply a matter of fairness to include in the \n     commitment, nominees who clearly can be processed and who \n     have been ready for hearings and pending the longest. \n     Further, we object to the selective importance that the \n     Judiciary Committee is placing on home-state senatorial \n     support. The Committee appears to view the support of \n     Republican senators as a necessary, but insufficient, \n     condition for their constituent nominees; while at the same \n     time deeming dispositive the views of Democratic senators, \n     either for or against a nominee. As the Majority Leader \n     himself noted, such disparate treatment is patently unfair.\n       The clock is ticking. It has now been two full weeks since \n     your commitment to do `everything' you could to confirm three \n     more circuit court nominees by the Memorial Day recess. Yet \n     since that commitment, the Committee has only scheduled one \n     hearing for one circuit court nominee. More troubling still \n     is the fact that the Chairman strongly intimated last week \n     that the Committee may refuse to honor the commitment, not \n     because it is impossible for it to do so, but because the \n     Chairman's preferred queue of nominees will not be ready in \n     time due to the standard requirements of the FBI and the \n     actions of a third party (the ABA), upon which the Democratic \n     Majority has placed particular importance over the years.\n       If the Committee does not hold a hearing for two more \n     circuit court nominees prior to May 6, 2008, it is \n     exceedingly unlikely that the Senate will be able to confirm \n     at least three circuit court nominees prior to May 23, 2008, \n     given the standard amount of time it takes to move a \n     nomination through the steps in the confirmation process. In \n     order to honor the commitment, we respectfully urge the \n     Committee to schedule hearings for Judge Conrad and Mr. \n     Matthews, and hold a Committee vote for Mr. Keisler as soon \n     as possible.\n       We look forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mitch McConnell.\n     Arlen Specter.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The reasons for our concern a month ago have proven to \nbe correct. Anyone could have seen this problem coming--anyone, except \nevidently, our Democratic colleagues who must have chosen not to.\n  Which brings me back to the question I and my Republican colleagues \nare asking: Is it consistent with a commitment to do ``everything \nwithin your power'' to confirm three more circuit nominees by Memorial \nDay, to then choose the one nominee who, for logistical reasons alone, \nis the least likely to be confirmed in time to keep the commitment? Mr. \nPresident, chasing the impossible, and then blaming others or \nexpressing surprise when it eludes your grasp is not a good excuse, and \nwill be remembered for a long, long time.\n  So today is a sad and sobering day for me and my colleagues. There \nare now well-founded questions on our side about the majority's stated \ndesire to treat nominees fairly and to improve the confirmation \nprocess. And there is frustration that will manifest itself in the \ncoming days, and will persist until we get credible evidence that the \nmajority will respect minority rights and treat judicial nominees \nfairly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4770-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4770-S4771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEMORIAL DAY 2008\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in observance of Memorial Day this \nyear, I had the distinct honor of meeting a group of World War II \nveterans from Kentucky who had traveled to our Nation's Capital to see \nthe World War II Memorial. A couple of the veterans, by the way, told \nme this was their first trip to Washington.\n  This memorial, completed in 2004, is a fitting tribute to the \nmillions of Americans--some who returned home, some who did not--who \nput on their country's uniform to fight the greatest and most \ndestructive war the world\n\n[[Page S4771]]\n\nhad ever seen. The awe the memorial inspires reminds us all why this \ngroup of patriots is called the ``greatest generation.''\n  The 35 Kentucky World War II veterans I met were able to travel to \nWashington thanks to the nonprofit organization Honor Flight, which \ntransports World War II veterans from anywhere in the country to see \ntheir memorial, free of charge. Many veterans, for physical or \nfinancial reasons, are unable to make the trip on their own, and so \nwithout Honor Flight they would not get the chance to visit the \nmemorial created for them and their fellow fighters at all.\n  About 36,500 World War II veterans live in Kentucky today, with about \n2.5 million throughout the country. Unfortunately, that number shrinks \neach day as time advances for these brave warriors. Honor Flight and \nits volunteers, many of whom are veterans themselves, are doing a great \nservice for our Nation by making it possible for these veterans to make \nthis important trip.\n  So this Memorial Day, I hope everyone says thank you to a man or \nwoman who wore the uniform. We should remember the bravery of those who \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for our country. And while most of us will \nnever know the heroism shown by the World War II veterans I was \nprivileged to meet, we can marvel at the courage shown every day by our \ncurrent generation of heroes serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I mentioned to the veterans from Kentucky yesterday my own father who \nserved in Europe during World War II, who arrived after the Battle of \nthe Bulge and was in the conflict from about March of 1945 forward, \nuntil he met with the Russians at Pilsen, which I believe is now in the \nCzech Republic. I mentioned to them that I have a letter he wrote to my \nmother. There were a number of letters, but this particular one is \netched in my memory because it is dated May 8, 1945.\n  Underneath the date he wrote ``V-E Day,'' so they were calling it \nVictory in Europe Day even then. He had seen some very severe fighting \nand lost a great many of his company, and one could sense the elation \nin his voice that the conflict was now ended.\n  But then there was a subsequent letter I thought was quite prophetic, \nparticularly for a regular foot soldier who was not an officer. He had \na chance to interact with some of the Russians because they met the \nRussians in Pilsen. He said to my mother: I think the Russians are \ngoing to be a big problem down the way.\n  So it was interesting that there was this sense, even to the foot \nsoldiers, that our alliance with the Soviet Union was a short-term \nmarriage of convenience and might subsequently be a big problem down \nthe road. Of course, his prophecy was proven accurate.\n  While in Pilsen, he got a chance to befriend some Czechs, and I have \nsome letters that were exchanged with friends from what was then \nCzechoslovakia. He told me that all of those letters stopped a couple \nyears later when the Iron Curtain descended across Europe and he was \nunable to communicate further with any of the Czech friends he made. I \nshare that story of my own father on Memorial Day for my colleagues.\n  In closing, I would mention that the particular flight from Kentucky \nyesterday was dedicated to the memory of John Polivka, who had planned \nto be on the trip. He was a World War II veteran who planned to be on \nthe trip but who passed away on Monday, May 19, just this week. So the \nveterans dedicated their Honor Flight to Washington to their colleague \nwhom they had hoped would be able to join them. Even though there was \ngreat sadness over his loss, there was great joy in being able to \nwitness the World War II Memorial which symbolizes their extraordinary \ncontribution to our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that names of the World War II veterans who \nwere here this week be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         World War II Veterans\n\n       Homer Brown, Jr.; Joseph Raley; James Thomas; George \n     Coffey; Charles Hanson; Donovan Chard; Bernie Carr; William \n     Pickerill; Robert Barrow; Robert Davis; Gainey ``Ed'' Sipes; \n     Emmett Leezer; Charles Mauer; Leroy Faber; Russell Harrison; \n     Morell Milroy; Blue Lynch; George Wolford; Norman Inman; \n     Frank Godbey; John Toy; Burnett Napier; Bobby Barker; Oscar \n     La Fontaine; Joel O'Brien, Jr.; Louis Tracy; Garnett Clark; \n     Joseph McFadden; Earl Wieting; Woodrow Bryant; Raymond \n     Roggenkamp; Robert Weixler, Sr.; Richard Lewis; Thomas \n     Shields; and Joseph Pottinger.\n\n                     Directors of the Honor Flight\n\n       Brian Duffy, Jean Duffy, William Garwood, James T. \n     MacDonald, and Robert Hendrickson.\n\n     This Honor Flight was dedicated to the memory of John \n     Polivka, who passed away on Monday, May 19th.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, let me indicate that we are not entirely unfamiliar on the \nJudiciary Committee with Judge White. She was actually an appointee of \nPresident Clinton. For many months, she languished before the committee \nwhen it was under Republican control. So she should be a judge with \nwhom at least a considerable number of the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee would have been familiar from her previous appointment. Any \nsuggestion that she was a new arrival or a novelty of some kind to the \ncommittee would not be accurate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan April 30, 2008, letter to the Republican leader and the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee signed by the majority leader, \nindicating, among other things, the following:\n\n       In a floor statement on April 15 I pledged my best efforts \n     to have the Senate consider three circuit court nominations \n     prior to the Memorial Day recess. I stand by my pledge.

I stand by my pledge. I \n     cautioned explicitly that ``I cannot guarantee'' this outcome \n     because it depends upon factors beyond my control. \n     Nonetheless, I remain optimistic we can meet that goal.\n       A hearing for Fourth Circuit nominee Steven Agee, as well \n     as district court nominees recommended by Senators Lugar and \n     Kyl, will take place tomorrow afternoon. A hearing for Sixth \n     Circuit nominees Raymond Kethledge and Helene White, as well \n     as a Michigan district court nominee, will take place next \n     Wednesday. Senator Leahy has expedited consideration of the \n     Michigan nominees in light of my April 15 remarks.\n       Nothing in my pledge regarding judicial nominations \n     deprived Chairman Leahy of his prerogative to determine the \n     sequence of nomination hearings in his committee. No one \n     presumed to instruct Senator Specter about the sequence of \n     nominations during the years he served as Chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee. And certainly Senator Hatch exercised \n     the chairman's prerogatives freely during the years in which \n     more than sixty of President Clinton's nominees were denied \n     hearings or floor consideration.\n       The Democratic majority has treated President Bush's \n     judicial nominations with far greater deference than \n     President Clinton was afforded by a Republican-controlled \n     Senate. Three-quarters of President Bush's court of appeals \n     nominees have been confirmed; in contrast, only half of \n     President Clinton's appellate nominations were confirmed. \n     Altogether, 145 of President Bush's judicial nominees, 90 \n     percent of them, have been confirmed in the years that \n     Democrats have controlled the Senate. Last year the Senate \n     confirmed 40 judges, more than during any of the three \n     previous years with Republicans in charge. The federal \n     judicial vacancy rate is the lowest it has been in years.\n       Chairman Leahy and I will continue to work with you both to \n     process judicial nominations in due course, consistent with \n     the Senate's constitutional role.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid.\n\n\n[[Page S4772]]\n\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, one of the great privileges that I \nhave as a Member of this body is to travel around my home State of \nRhode Island and hear directly from the people I was elected to serve. \nWe are a small State, and we all know one another pretty well. So it is \na pleasure to get out and listen to people, to hear what is on their \nminds, their good news and their bad news, and the challenges and the \nopportunities they and their families face each and every day.\n  One of the things we do is to regularly hold community dinners around \nthe State. My wife Sandra and I get together with folks over pasta and \nmeatballs or hamburgers and hot dogs and we talk about the issues that \nare interesting to them.\n  Mr. President, having the opportunity to hear people of my State \nshare their stories this way has made such a difference in my work here \nin Washington. I say to the Presiding Officer, I know that as you \nrepresent the people in Florida, you feel very much the same way and \nI've heard you both in committee and on this floor give speeches and \nremarks that have focused on individual constituents of yours who had \ntroubles and problems that they needed to attend to and you needed to \nattend to. So I know that you feel very much the same way.\n  You know, we stand in this Chamber and we debate back and forth on \nthe war in Iraq or the price of a gallon of gas or the crisis in the \nhousing industry. But when we go back home, we see people who are \nliving in the middle of these issues every day. In Rhode Island right \nnow, there are parents worrying about their sons and daughters serving \noverseas in Iraq. There are families watching the numbers on the gas \npump roll, roll, roll, flying higher and higher, and they are wondering \nhow they are going to make ends meet. And there are working people who \nsee their mortgage payments climb out of reach, and they face the \ngnawing, terrible fear that they might lose the home their children \ngrew up in. So, as glorious as is this grand Chamber we have the \nopportunity to serve in, the reason we are really here is that it is \nall about them.\n  And last Sunday evening, we had one of those moments. We hosted a \ncommunity dinner in Bristol, RI, which is a beautiful, historic town on \nRhode Island's East Bay. Bristol is known for many wonderful things, \nbut one is the oldest--and I think the best--Fourth of July parade in \nthe United States of America. So it was great to be in Bristol, and it \nwas a beautiful evening. The day had been rainy, and toward the end of \nthe day, the clouds had begun to open up and the evening Sun was \nshining through on the clouds above. The earth and the trees were still \nwet around, but they were lit up by the lit sky, and we were in this \nhandsome stone VFW hall that is just a little bit back from Bristol \nHarbor. It was beautiful not only outside but inside because we had a \nwonderful group of people. And as the questions and answers were \nwinding down toward the end of the evening, a man stood up and he took \nthe microphone, and he began to speak.\n  The man was COL Edward Cyr. Colonel Cyr is a 29-year veteran of the \nArmy Reserves, 399th Combat Support Hospital. He has served two tours \nin Iraq, first in 2003 and then again from June 2006 to October 2007, \nand was also deployed to Kosovo in 2001. When he is not serving our \ncountry in the Army Reserves, Colonel Cyr is a nurse anesthetist at \nSaint Anne's Hospital in Massachusetts. He is a loving husband to his \nwife Patricia, and he is the father to five daughters.\n  Colonel Cyr wanted to tell me about a provision in the 2008 Defense \nauthorization bill which grants early retirement eligibility to \nreservists and National Guard members who have served on Active Duty \nsince September 11, to allow these individuals to gain 3 months of \nretirement eligibility for every 90 days of Active service.\n  He was concerned that the effective date of the legislation was set \nfor the date of its passage, and that it did not reach back to \nSeptember 11 to pick up all the veterans who had served since that \ndate. I agreed to help him with that legislation, to make the date of \nthe early retirement provision retroactive to September 11, 2001, so \nthat it would reach every veteran in this conflict who served our \ncountry and carried the burden of a disastrous war policy with such \ngreat honor and dignity.\n  And often people come with a specific request like that, but that was \nnot what was significant about this. What was significant about this \nwas that Colonel Cyr took the chance to tell his story.\n  He spoke of the strains of his multiple deployments which have \nweighed so heavily upon him and his family. He spoke of the blood of \nthe wounded soldiers he worked on, on his hands, on his clothes, in his \nvery pores. He spoke of their service and their loss and his pride in \nthe men and women who served beside him. When he was done, the big room \nwas quiet.\n  I asked him--I was a little embarrassed to ask because I did not want \nto ask a personal question that might not be welcome, but I asked him \nanyway: I said, Colonel, if I may ask a personal question, what was \nyour family situation through all of this? He paused a minute, and he \nsaid: Well, Senator, I am glad you asked that question because my wife \nis sitting right beside me. And he proudly pointed her out, and he said \nthis: For all those months, over three tours, she had to go it alone, \nraising my five daughters, and I want to take this chance to thank her \nbecause if it weren't for her, I wouldn't have had a home to come home \nto.\n  Mr. President, you could have heard a pin drop. There was not a dry \neye in the House, including my own. And the room then burst into \napplause.\n  Mr. President, this was just one of those moments--just one of those \nmoments. I do not think I can explain it, and frankly, I do not even \nwant to try because if I tried to explain it, I would just make it \nsmaller. So all I want to say, as we all leave this glorious Chamber to \ngo home to our States to celebrate this Memorial Day weekend, for all \nthe Edward Cyrs and for all the Patricia Cyrs across this country, \nthank you and God bless you.\n  Mr. President, I believe there is no quorum present.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6081, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 6081) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to provide benefits for military personnel, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread three time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelated to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 6081) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on Memorial Day in 1884, Justice Oliver \nWendell Holmes said:\n\n       It is now the moment when by common consent we pause to \n     become conscious of our national life and to rejoice in it, \n     to recall what our country has done for each of us, and to \n     ask ourselves what we can do for our country in return.\n\n  I am pleased that today, on the eve of the Memorial Day weekend, the \nSenate has been able to recall what our service men and women have done \nfor each of us. I am pleased that we can do something for them in \nreturn. And I am pleased that we have been able to pass the Heroes \nEarnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2008.\n  Nearly 1.5 million American service men and women have served in \nIraq, Afghanistan, or both. Nearly 30,000\n\n[[Page S4773]]\n\ntroops have been wounded in action there.\n  It is time that Congress showed its gratitude to these brave men and \nwomen. They have devoted their lives to the pursuit of American \nfreedom.\n  Today, we are doing just that. We have passed a bill that offers tax \nrelief to these men and women who serve our country so valiantly.\n  During a trip to Iraq last year, I saw the amazing job that our \ntroops are doing. I met many Montanans from small towns such as Roundup \nand Townsend.\n  I saw firsthand what a heavy burden our troops bear for all of us. \nThey face hardships and danger. But they keep at it every day.\n  This bill makes permanent the special tax rules that make sense for \nour military. Many of these rules expired at the end of 2007.\n  For example, most troops doing the heavy lifting in combat situations \nare lower ranking soldiers in the lower income brackets. Some of them \nare earning combat pay at levels that would qualify for the earned \nincome tax credit. But under current law, combat pay does not count \ntoward computing the EITC.\n  Congress fixed that temporarily. But the provision that fixed the \nproblem expired at the end of 2007.\n  The EITC is a beneficial tax provision for working Americans. It \nmakes no sense to deny it to our troops.\n  Today, we have made combat duty income count for EITC purposes, and \nwe have made that change a permanent part of the Tax Code.\n  This military tax package also eliminates obstacles in the current \ntax laws that create problems for some veterans and service members.\n  For example, family members of fallen soldiers killed in the line of \nduty receive a death gratuity benefit of $100,000. But the tax law does \nnot allow the survivors to put this benefit into a Roth IRA. This bill \nwill guarantee that the family members of fallen soldiers may take \nadvantage of these tax-favored accounts.\n  Another problem for our disabled veterans is the time limit for \nfiling to get a tax refund. Most VA disability claims filed by veterans \nare quickly resolved. But many disability awards are delayed because of \nlost paperwork or the appeals of rejected claims. Once a disabled vet \nfinally gets a favorable award, the disability award is tax-free.\n  In many cases, however, these disabled veterans paid taxes on the \npayments in the past. The veterans cannot get the taxes paid back \nbecause the law bars them from filing a claim for a tax refund that \ngoes back far enough.\n  We take care of this problem by giving disabled veterans an extra \nyear to claim their tax refunds.\n  This bill is paid for by requiring that companies that do business \nwith the Federal Government pay their employment taxes. The bill makes \nsure that foreign subsidiaries of U.S. parent companies that have \ncontracts with the Federal Government pay employment taxes for their \nemployees.\n  Another offset in the bill is a provision that makes certain that \nindividuals who relinquish their American citizenship or long-term \nresidency pay their fair share of Federal taxes. This provision ensures \nthat these folks pay the same tax for appreciation of assets, such as \nstocks or bonds, as they would pay if they sold them as U.S. citizens \nor residents.\n  We owe the men and women fighting in our armed forces an enormous \ndebt of gratitude. They leave their families and put their lives on the \nline to fight for our freedoms.\n  And so today, the Senate pauses to recall what our service men and \nwomen have done for each of us. Today, the Senate pauses to ask \nourselves what we can do for them in return. And today, the Senate \npauses to say thank you.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Heroes Earnings Assistance and \nRelief Tax Act of 2008, the HEART Act, which passed the Senate by \nunanimous consent today, was a bipartisan effort that incorporates most \nof the provisions in the Defenders of Freedom Tax Relief Act of 2007, \nwhich passed the Senate last December. The HEART Act also makes \npermanent and expands upon some of the tax relief measures that I \ncoauthored with Senator Baucus in 2003, while chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  Our men and women who serve in the military make tremendous \nsacrifices to keep this great Nation safe and strong. Oftentimes, this \nvery service makes taxes complicated and sometimes unfair. It is only \nright that these honorable men and women get treated fairly under the \nFederal Tax Code. The Federal Tax Code shouldn't penalize people for \nserving their country.\n  It has been a few years since Congress enacted a tax relief measure \nfor the military. As such, we have updated the relief package to \ninclude some additional relief. Amongst some of these new measures is a \nclarification that members of the military who file a joint tax return \nwould be eligible for the stimulus rebate payment even if one spouse \ndoes not have a Social Security number.\n  The bill also ensures that U.S. employers of Americans working abroad \npursuant to a Government contract pay Social Security and Medicare \ntaxes, regardless of whether they operate through a foreign subsidiary. \nAmongst the offsets in the HEART Act is a provision that ensures \nindividuals who relinquish their U.S. citizenship or long-term \nresidency pay the same Federal taxes for the appreciation of assets as \nthey would have paid if they sold them prior to relinquishing their \nU.S. citizenship or terminating their long-term residency.\n  It is unfortunate that the Senate was not able to strike an agreement \nwith the House to include a provision that Senator Roberts championed. \nThis provision would make more service members eligible for low-income \nhousing.\n  However, Senator Roberts has been reassured by House, Ways and Means \nDemocrats that this provision will be processed with the House's low-\nincome housing credit reform measures, which was part of their housing \nbill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate has passed legislation \nwhich will assist military families. I agree with Ways and Means \nChairman Charles Rangel that this legislation should be called the \n``thank you bill.'' As we approach Memorial Day, I am pleased that the \nHouse and Senate have passed this important legislation which will help \nthousands of military families.\n  I would like to thank Senators Baucus and Grassley for the work they \nhave done on this bill. The HEART Act reflects a compromise reached by \nthe Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees. Last year, Senator \nSmith and I introduced the Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of 2007, \nwhich would help those who bravely serve their country and the families \nthat they have left behind.\n  The HEART Act includes several provisions from the Active Duty \nMilitary Tax Relief Act of 2007. It also includes additional provisions \nto help military families and veterans who often struggle financially.\n  The best definition of patriotism is keeping faith with those who \nserve our country. That means giving our troops the resources they need \nto keep them safe while they are protecting us. And it means supporting \nour troops at home as well as abroad.\n  Currently, there are over 160,000 military personnel serving in Iraq. \nThere are approximately 33,000 United States servicemembers in \nAfghanistan. Many of these men and women are reservists and have been \ncalled to active duty, frequently for multiple tours.\n  Most large businesses have the resources to provide supplemental \nincome to reservist employees called up I applaud the businesses that \nhave been able to pay supplemental income to their reservists, but it \nis not easy for small businesses to do the same.\n  In January 2007, the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nheld a hearing on veterans' small business issues. A majority of our \nveterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are Reserve and National \nGuard members--35 percent of whom are either self-employed or own or \nare employed by a small business.\n  We heard some disturbing statistics about the impact and unintended \nconsequences the call up of reservists is having on small businesses. \nAccording to a January 2007 survey conducted by Workforce Management, \n54 percent of the businesses surveyed responded that they would not \nhire a citizen soldier if they knew that they could be called up for an \nindeterminate amount of time. I am concerned that long call ups and \nredeployments have made it hard for\n\n[[Page S4774]]\n\nsmall businesses to be supportive of civilian soldiers.\n  The Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of 2007 provides a tax credit \nto small businesses to assist with the cost of paying the salary of \ntheir reservist employees when they are called to active duty. A \nsimilar provision is included in the HEART Act.\n  In addition to helping small businesses, the Active Duty Military Tax \nRelief of 2007 addresses concerns related to differential military pay, \nincome tax withholding, and retirement plan participation. These \nprovisions will make it easier for employers who would like to pay \ntheir employees supplemental income, above their military pay, and make \npension contributions. Our legislation would make differential military \npay subject to federal income tax withholding. In addition, with \nrespect to the retirement plan rules, the bill provides that a person \nreceiving differential military pay would be treated as an employee of \nthe employer making the payment, and allows the differential military \npay to be treated as compensation. These provisions are included in the \nHEART Act.\n  The Active Duty Military Tax Relief Act of 2007 would make permanent \nthe existing provision which allows taxpayers to include combat pay as \nearned income for purposes of the earned income tax credit, EITC. \nWithout this provision, some military families would no longer be \neligible to receive the EITC because combat pay is currently not \ntaxable. It also would provide tax relief for the death gratuity \npayment that is given to families that have lost a loved one in combat. \nThis payment is currently $100,000. Our current tax laws do not allow \nthe recipients of this payment to use it to make contributions to tax-\npreferred saving accounts that help with saving for retirement. Both of \nthese provisions are included in the HEART Act.\n  Recently, Representatives Ellsworth and Emanuel and Senator Obama and \nI introduced the Fair Share Act of 2008 which ends the practice of U.S. \ngovernment contractors setting up shell companies in foreign \njurisdictions to avoid payroll taxes. I think that is appropriate that \nthe Fair Share Act is included in the HEART Act. The revenue raised \nfrom closing this abusive loophole will help offset the tax relief \nprovided to military families.\n  On March 6, 2008, Farah Stockman of the Boston Globe reported that \nKellogg, Brown and Root Inc.--KBR--has avoided payroll taxes by hiring \nworkers through shell companies in the Cayman Islands. The article \nestimates that hundreds of millions of dollars in payroll taxes have \nbeen avoided a disturbing, yet not all too surprising discovery.\n  The Fair Share Act of 2008 will end the practice of U.S. Government \ncontractors setting up shell companies in foreign jurisdictions to \navoid payroll taxes. The legislation amends the Internal Revenue Code \nand the Social Security Act to treat foreign subsidiaries of U.S. \ncompanies performing services under contract with the United States \ngovernment as American employers for the purpose of Social Security and \nMedicare payroll taxes.\n  Our service men and women need to know that we are honoring their \nservice. These changes to our tax laws will help our military families \nwith some of their financial burdens. It cannot repay the sacrifices \nthey have made for us, but it is a small way we can support our troops \nand their families at home and abroad.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to congratulate Senator Webb \non the passage of S.22 the Post 9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance \nAct. This is an important piece of legislation worthy of serious \nconsideration.\n  However, despite its noble intent, I voted against the measure for \ntwo reasons. First, Senator Webb's legislation was attached to a \nmassive spending amendment which, coupled with the rest of the wartime \nsupplemental bill, exceeds the $108.1 billion expenditure limit set by \nthe President. Therefore, for this reason, and others, I believe that \nthe President will veto this legislation.\n  The second reason is that I believe that Senators Graham, Burr, and \nMcCain have offered a superior piece of legislation, S.2938 the \nEnhancement of Recruitment, Retention and Readjustment through \nEducation Act. S.2938 will assist our nation's veterans by \nsignificantly improving education benefits for both those who have left \nthe services and those who decided to make the military their career.\n  Specifically, S.2938 will permit Guard and Reservists to more easily \nqualify for benefits; eliminate the $1,200 fee that servicemembers are \ncurrently required to pay in order to qualify for education benefits; \nand increase the annual stipend for books to $1,000. Most importantly, \nthe Graham, Burr and McCain legislation will increase the level of \nmonthly payments for a college education from $1,100 to $1,500.\n  I view this as a much simpler and fairer compensation package than \nS.22. S.22 would provide tuition assistance equal to the sum charged by \nthe program in which the veteran is enrolled. However, this assistance \nis capped at the amount of in-state tuition imposed by the most \nexpensive public college in the same state as the school where the \nveteran is enrolled.\n  Obviously, this is a very complicated funding mechanism which I fear \nwill unnecessarily complicate the future education plans of many \nservicemembers. I am also concerned that such a funding scheme will \nadversely affect those veterans who wish to pursue educational \nopportunities at private and parochial colleges and universities.\n  However, S.22 is not without its advantages, since it provides a \nbasic housing allowance. But, the Graham, Burr and McCain bill also \nsupports military families by enabling servicemembers and veterans the \noption of transferring some of those benefits to a spouse or child. \nThis is a provision that S.22 does not contain.\n  In final analysis these are two serious pieces of legislation that \nmerit close scrutiny. However, in my final analysis, I believe that the \nGraham, Burr and McCain bill is the superior bill and I look forward to \ndebating that measure and voting for it once the Senate returns from \nthe Memorial Day recess.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4774-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4774-S4776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GOOD WISHES FOR SENATOR KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, in my 11\\1/2\\ years in the Senate, I have \nworked closely with a very special man, a very caring man, a very \nliberal man, a very energetic man, a very thoughtful man, and a man who \nhas become my dear friend. That man is Senator Ted Kennedy, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n\n  A great blow was dealt to the Senate when we found out Senator \nKennedy had a malignant brain tumor. This blow is not because of what \nmay or may not get done in his absence. No, this blow went straight to \nthe heart of anyone who has known this man as a friend.\n  Many find it hard to believe that Senator Kennedy, the third most \nliberal Senator in the Senate, and I, the fourth most conservative \nSenator in this body, could get along or actually enjoy each other's \ncompany. But we do.\n  When I was chairman of the HELP Committee, I worked under what I \ncalled my 80 percent rule. I always believed we could agree on 80 \npercent of the issues and on 80 percent of each issue, and that if we \nfocus on the 80 percent, we can do great things for the American \npeople. Senator Kennedy and I worked together on proposals using that \nrule, and we found that 80 percent in the things we undertook. We also \nfound friendship.\n  In those 2 years, we passed 35 bills out of the Health Education, \nLabo Pensions Committee, and the President signed 27 of those into \nlaw. Most of them passed almost unanimously. Again, it was kind of the \nbelief that if two people that far apart could come together on an \nissue, it must be OK. The HELP Committee used to be the most \ncontentious committee in the Senate, but in our 3 years of working \ntogether as chairman and ranking member, we turned it into the most \nproductive committee in the Senate. I\n\n[[Page S4775]]\n\nremember being in the President's office at a bill signing and having \nhim say, ``You know, you are the only committee sending me anything.'' \nWe got to checking on it, and he was right.\n  I could not help but think of my friend as I stood next to the \nPresident while he signed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act \na few weeks ago. That bill was the fourth bill that month Senator \nKennedy and I sent to the President. We had worked on it for several \nyears, and we are glad it finally passed, almost unanimously. We \nbriefly conferenced it with the other side, so the differences are \nalready worked out before they vote on the bill. It went to the \nPresident's desk. That is a perfect example of how we worked together \nto pass legislation that had been held up for years.\n  Another example is the mine safety law. In 6 weeks, we worked \ntogether to pass the first changes to mine safety law in almost 30 \nyears. The average bill around here takes about 6 years to pass. That \none happened in 6 weeks.\n  We share an incurable optimism, and if you add that in with Ted's \nwork ethic and my persistence, you have a great recipe for success.\n  When we don't get along, you will see us come to the Senate floor and \ndebate our policy differences passionately. Once the votes are cast and \nwe walk off the floor, we move on to tackle the next issue, and we do \nthat as colleagues with a deep respect for the other person and his \nbeliefs.\n  We have taken trips around the country together to look at mine \nsafety and hurricane damage. I have also invited Vicki and Ted to come \nto Wyoming to dig fossils with Diana and me when our schedules can work \nit in. We have some 60-million-year-old fossil fish in Wyoming. If you \never see the brown bones of a fish in a piece of white rock, it \nundoubtedly came from Wyoming. If you see brown bones in a brown rock, \nit probably came from the other place, which would be China. But I have \ninvited him out to do a little fishing in the fossil field with me. \nThis week I even sent him a very small one that we might be able to use \nfor bait if we get to do that.\n  Mr. Chairman, if you are listening, I do still expect you to make \nthat trip to Wyoming for the fossil dig.\n  Senator Kennedy has a very deep human side. Although he has one of \nthe busiest schedules of any Senator, he makes time to do small things \nfor those around him. There is a program called Everybody Wins; it is a \nreading program, where an individual who is willing to volunteer their \ntime meets each week with a young person and they read. One reads to \nthe other, and the other reads back. It is a tremendous help to kids in \nreading. But to do that, you have to sacrifice an hour each week, and \nyou work with the same child each week. Senator Kennedy does that. Not \nmany people make that kind of a time commitment.\n  Senator Kennedy is also thoughtful. I will always remember when he \nbrought me a gift when each of my grandchildren was born. One happened \nto be a little pair of training pants that said ``Irish Mist'' on the \nback. He even treats my staff like family. He made a copy of the \npainting he made for Vicki on their wedding day and presented it to my \nscheduler when she got engaged. He always makes a special point to \nthank my staff on the Senate floor for all their hard work to get their \nbills through. He somehow finds time for all these things. He also came \nto a staff coffee in my office. Every month, we do a staff coffee, and \nthat means I invite two Democratic Senate offices and two Republican \nstaff offices to come to my office, so people can meet their \ncounterparts in a less violent situation than working on a bill. If \nthey know their counterparts--if you get to know somebody, it is pretty \nhard to work against them when you actually have to do the work. On \nthis particularly rare occasion, the Senator showed up also. He came to \nmy office and dramatically presented me with a photo of a University of \nWyoming football helmet and a Harvard football helmet next to each \nother, with a note that said, ``The Cowboys and the Crimson make a \ngreat team.'' I agree.\n  Senator Kennedy has quite a few friends from Wyoming, one of which is \nthe former Senator Al Simpson. Al and Senator Kennedy worked together \nfor many years. They even did a little radio program. So when I was \nelected, my first bill was one dealing with OSHA. That is one of the \nprimary areas of interest of Senator Kennedy. He was ranking member on \nthe committee. After I got it drafted, I went around to every member of \nthe committee and I pleaded with them and they sat down and went \nthrough the bill with me, a section at a time, and asked questions. I \nanswered them. The last person I had on the list to talk to--and the \nmost formidable, in my view, because I knew his history--was Senator \nKennedy. So to get permission to meet with him, I called Al Simpson and \nsaid: Could you talk to Senator Kennedy for me and see if he would meet \nwith me to go through this bill?\n  The next day I got a call from Senator Kennedy, who said: Yes, come \non down to my office. I will meet with you. So I went down there. My \nmother had been named ``Mother of the Year'' for Wyoming the day \nbefore, and he presented me with clippings of my mother's award. He \nwent through that bill with me, a section at a time.\n  It wasn't until the markup of the bill that I found out that was not \nthe way you did things around here. He explained that in his, I think, \n35 years at that time, he had never had a Senator ask him to sit down \nand go through a bill a section at a time. The bill did not pass, but \nseveral sections of the bill are now law. It was the first eight \nchanges in OSHA in the history of OSHA. After we did those eight \nchanges, he came to me and said: I have this needle stick bill I have \nbeen trying to get through. Would you take a look at it?\n  I did. We made some changes to get to the 80-percent rule, and it \npassed unanimously here and in the House and the President signed it. \nThe nurses were appreciative and the janitors were appreciative because \neither of them could get an accidental needle stick and they wouldn't \nknow where it had been and they would have to wait months to find out \nif they were going to get something from it.\n  I learned a lot from each of these opportunities to work with Ted \nKennedy. I had no idea I would be chairman of the committee, and he \nwould be the ranking member. Then I had no idea the majority would \nchange and he would become chairman and I would become ranking member. \nI remember meeting with him after he became chairman, where we took a \nlook at the bills we intended to get done during these 2 years, and we \nhave had pretty substantial progress on that. I told him I was glad he \nwas chairman because after I had studied under him for 2 years, I would \nbe able to do a much better job when I became chairman again. He \nlaughed.\n  A week ago today, we were resolving some issues on the floor and \nseveral other things we are trying to get done, and I remember being \nover in that corner where he was telling me about his dad's recipe for \ndaiquiris, and earlier this week we passed the National Day of the \nAmerican Cowboy, and that reminded me of an incident in Montana when \nSenator Kennedy was helping his brother, he actually went to a bucking \nhorse sale and rode a bucking horse and wound up on the cover of LIFE \nmagazine--to get the Kennedy name out to help get his brother \nnominated. As a result, Montana and Wyoming both went for Senator John \nF. Kennedy and put him over the top for the nomination to be President.\n  There are a lot of other stories I would like to tell, but I will not \nbecause of the time.\n  Ted, my chairman, Diana and I are praying for you and your family \nduring this trying time. ``Cancer'' is the last word any family wants \nto hear. I know you will fight it; you have that fighting spirit. I \nwish to see you at the next bill signing in the President's office and \nwith me again in the HELP Committee hearing room. We have more bills to \npass, fossils to dig, fights to battle, and laughs to enjoy together. \nWe have to keep up our bill-of-the-month club for the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I echo the words of my friend, Senator Enzi \nfrom Wyoming, about Senator Kennedy. I have had the honor for only 15 \nmonths now to serve on his and Senator Enzi's HELP Committee. Even more \nimportant than Senator Enzi points out and even more important than \nSenator Kennedy's passion for his work, his commitment to social and\n\n[[Page S4776]]\n\neconomic justice and his never, ever giving up in fighting for those \nthings he believes in, is what Senator Kennedy does personally for all \nkinds of people, including people who don't live in his State, people \nwhom he has never met, people who walk down the hall. He brings them \ninto his office and gives them a book, written by Senator Kennedy, but \nin the name of his dog Splash. And he talks to children. Again, they \nare people Senator Kennedy doesn't even know, who can do nothing for \nhim politically. He gives so much in those ways.\n  As Senator Enzi does, I hope Senator Kennedy will be back here as \nstrong as ever. He has used that energy and passion for so many others, \nand he will put that same energy and passion into being cured. We all \nlook forward to that day in the fairly near future.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown pertaining to the introduction of S.

Soldiers, sailors, \nmarines, and airmen; officers and enlisted; volunteers and draftees; \nyoung and old; they were all members of our American family our \nfathers, brothers, sons, mothers, wives, sisters, cousins, neighbors \nand friends. More than 41 million Americans have served their nation \nduring a time of war over the course of our history. More than 651,000 \nAmericans have lost their lives as a result of that service. It is \nlikely that somewhere in every family's extended network of relatives, \nneighbors and friends, there is a veteran, perhaps even a veteran whose \nservice and sacrifice we honor on Memorial Day.\n  Despite the fact that some 200,000 of our fellow citizens are today \nwearing uniforms and serving in hostile theaters far from home, too \nmany Americans see Memorial Day weekend only as a long weekend marking \nthe end of the school year, the opening of pools, and the beginning of \nsummer. We are beguiled by the warm breezes redolent of honeysuckle. We \nare distracted by bright sunshine and outdoor pleasures. We are lulled \ninto a sense of security and carelessness, at home in our safe \nneighborhoods with new-mown lawns, cheerful flowerbeds, and shady \nstreets. It is easy to forget that in distant places, men in dusty \nuniforms patrol dangerous streets mined with improvised explosive \ndevices.\n  If you take a moment to look more closely, however, you may notice \nthe flags flying from front porches along those shady streets. You \nmight notice other flags, smaller flags, planted in front of marble \nmarkers throughout cemeteries around your town, each marking the grave \nof a veteran. You may notice families visiting gravesites in a ritual \nas old as war itself, laying down flowers to remember and honor those \nwhose lives were lost too soon, too violently, too far away from home \nand family, in pursuit of causes larger than themselves. They are gone, \nbut not forgotten by those who knew and loved them best.\n  War is a terrible tool of nations, and its use exacts a high price in \nboth blood and treasure. On Memorial Day, the nation honors those who \nhave paid this price with great courage and even greater sacrifice. It \nis important to remember the lives of those who were lost, lest we come \nto think that war is ever easy, or quick, or certain in its course. We \ndo well to remember the words of Sir Winston Churchill, 1874-1965: \n``Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and easy, or that \nanyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and \nhurricanes he will encounter. The statesman who yields to war fever \nmust realize that once the signal is given, he is no longer the master \nof policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events.''\n  The current wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have meant that many of the \ngravesites being visited this Memorial Day, more than 4,000 of them, \nare raw and new. Many of the families visiting those graves bring young \nchildren with them, children who have lost a father or mother. They \nknow that their parent died a hero. But that knowledge does not make \nthe day-to-day tasks of school, homework, sports practices, or learning \nlife skills from their parents any easier for these children. It does \nnot make it any easier for the parent left behind to shoulder a life's \nwork that they thought would be shared with their partner. As a nation, \nwe should not give them any reason to worry that their family member's \nsacrifice will ever be dismissed or overlooked.\n  Ours is a fortunate nation, blessed with a rich and bounteous land. \nIt is populated by hard-working, creative, inventive, people who are \ngenerous and compassionate. And, it is governed by the best form of \ngovernment ever devised by man. The tangible symbols of that government \nare the documents of our government the Declaration of Independence and \nour Constitution that set forth the ideals by which we live and \noperate. As a Nation, we do not always live up perfectly to those \nideals in practice, but we are again fortunate that the system is self-\ncorrecting, with the people ultimately in control. None of these \nfortuitous circumstances could persist, however, without the bravery, \nvalor, and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform who defend our \nNation and preserve our Constitution. To them, we owe eternal \ngratitude. Their willingness to answer the call to battle, and to fight \nso valiantly and so well in so many conflicts over the years, has kept \nthe Nation strong.\n  Whether they died at Concord, Gettysburg, in Flanders Fields, \nVietnam, or in Iraq and Afghanistan; whether their graves date from \nthis century or those that came before, on this last Monday in May, I \nhope that Senators and all Americans will set aside a few quiet moments \nto remember, and honor, the men and women who have lost their lives in \nthe service of the Nation. In those quiet moments, I also hope that the \nNation will say a prayer for the families they left behind.\n  I close with a few stanzas from a poem by Theodore O'Hara, entitled, \n``The Bivouac of the Dead.''\n\n                        The Bivouac of the Dead\n\n     The muffled drum's sad roll has beat\n     The soldier's last tattoo!\n     No more on life's parade shall meet\n     The brave and fallen few.\n\n     On Fame's eternal camping ground\n     Their silent tents are spread,\n     And glory guards with solemn round\n     The bivouac of the dead.\n\n     Rest on, embalmed and sainted dead,\n     Dear is the blood you gave--\n     No impious footstep here shall tread\n     The herbage of your grave.\n\n     Nor shall your glory be forgot\n     While Fame her record keeps,\n     Or honor points the hallowed spot\n     Where valor proudly sleeps.\n\n     Yon marble minstrel's voiceless stone\n     In deathless song shall tell,\n     When many a vanquished year hath flown,\n     The story how you fell.\n\n     Nor wreck nor change, nor winter's blight,\n     Nor time's remorseless doom,\n     Can dim one ray of holy light\n     That gilds your glorious tomb.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, Memorial Day is a day of reflection. It \nis a day reserved for remembering those who have given their lives in \nservice to our country. While we may choose to remember these \nindividuals in different ways, each American has a responsibility to \nrecognize the contribution of those who have paid the ultimate \nsacrifice to defend the values upon which this Nation was built.\n  Over the years, I have had the opportunity to meet with a number of \nthe men and women serving in our military, many of whom I am proud to \nsay are fellow Utahns. I am always very humbled by this experience. The \ncourage and dedication of these individuals offers much to emulate.\n  I recognize the sacrifice of the countless men and women who over the \ndecades have selflessly given their lives to uphold freedom and defend \nthe many values we hold dear. Each of these individuals not only gave \nof their own life but left forever altered the life of a mother, \nfather, husband, wife, son, daughter, brother, or sister. Those\n\n[[Page S4777]]\n\nloved ones who are left behind are owed our respect and support. We \nmust continue to work to ensure the fallen are remembered and those \nthey leave behind are not forgotten.\n  In this time of war, my thoughts and prayers are with all who serve \nthis Nation and with those families who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice. I am deeply grateful for this service. Please let us not \nforget the courage and selflessness of these individuals--to them we \nowe a debt beyond our means to repay. This Nation shall forever stand \ngrateful and proud of each man and woman who has willingly accepted the \ncall to defend our freedoms and provide for our safety at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4777-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CELEBRATING ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with the great pleasure of \nrecognizing the month of May as Asian Pacific American Heritage Month \nand honoring the many contributions that Americans of Asian and Pacific \nIslander descent have made to our great Nation and to my home State of \nNevada.\n  I am proud of the role this distinguished chamber played in the \ndesignation of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, albeit many years \ntoo late. On June 19, 1978, some 135 years after the arrival of the \nfirst Japanese immigrant to the United States, Representatives Frank \nHorton and Norman Mineta introduced a joint resolution ``authorizing \nand requesting the President to proclaim the 7-day period beginning on \nMay 4, 1979, as 'Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week''--H.J. Res. \n1007. Two months after being passed overwhelmingly by the House, the \nSenate unanimously approved the joint resolution and promptly sent it \nto President Jimmy Carter for his signature.\n  In addition to recognizing the onset of Japanese immigration to \nAmerica, the month of May was selected because May 10, 1869, also known \nas Golden Spike Day, marked the completion of the first \ntranscontinental railroad in the United States, to whose construction \nChinese pioneers contributed greatly. Hundreds of miles of this \nrailroad passed through a newly admitted and mostly uninhabited western \nstate that I have called home for my whole life. Without the tireless \nefforts and tremendous sacrifices of these Asian settlers, the state of \nNevada would have remained largely disconnected from the rest of our \ncountry for an untold number of years.\n  Rising to support H.J. Res. 1007, Senator Spark Matsunaga, who served \nthe State of Hawaii for over 13 honorable years before succumbing to \ncancer, remarked that ``most Americans are unaware of the history of \nPacific and Asian Americans in the United States, and their \ncontributions to our Nation's cultural heritage.'' He continued by \nsaying that one of the two main purposes of the joint resolution was \n``to imbue a renewed sense of pride among our citizens of Pacific and \nAsian ancestry.'' I am delighted that the many celebrations taking \nplace around the country to commemorate Asian Pacific American Heritage \nMonth, particularly in my home State of Nevada, have showcased the \nenduring sense of pride that Senator Matsunaga spoke about nearly three \ndecades ago.\n  Almost 14 years after President Carter signed H.J. Res. 1007 into \nlaw, Representative Frank Horton once again assumed the leadership role \non this issue and introduced a bill to permanently designate May of \neach year as ``Asian Pacific American Heritage Month''--H.R. 5572. \nAfter this bill was passed by both Houses of Congress, President George \nH.W. Bush signed it into law on October 23, 1992.\n  Ever since, our country has taken the time at the end of each spring \nto celebrate the innumerable contributions that Americans of Asian and \nPacific Islander ancestry have made and continue to make to the United \nStates. To the roughly 15 million Asian and Pacific Islander Americans \nwho currently live in our country, and most especially to the thousands \nof those who reside in Nevada, I wish you all the best during this \njoyous time of year. I urge my colleagues in this Chamber to do the \nsame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4777-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH R. EGAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I join Senator Ensign today to recognize the \nremarkable life of Joe Egan, who passed away on May 7, 2008.\n  Joe is known in Nevada and throughout the country as a skilled \nattorney who worked hard to make our Nation safer and to stop the \nproposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste dump from being built in Nevada. \nI think Joe hated the nuclear waste dump project as much as I do. In \nhis obituary, he arranged to have his ashes spread over Yucca Mountain. \n``Radwaste buried here only over my dead body,'' he said.\n  After learning in 1996 that Yucca Mountain was scientifically \nunsuitable for storing radioactive waste, he was deputized as the lead \nlawyer for the State of Nevada's efforts to fight the dump. Nevadans \nshould be proud to have had such a magnificent person fighting for \nthem.\n  Joe was a key force in dealing multiple blows to the project and \nbringing it to a standstill. Over the years, Joe has made it abundantly \nclear that the project is unsafe and that the science behind it is \nunsound. It speaks to his character that although he was not from \nNevada, he fought against this project with both passion and strength \nbecause he knew that it was the right thing to do. When we finally end \nthe battle against the Yucca Mountain project, we will have done it \ntogether with Joe and his team.\n  Joe was by no means antinuclear. He just wanted to see nuclear power \nproduced safely and the dangerous wastes it produces to be managed \nproperly. He also worked hard on nonproliferation efforts, helping the \nUnited States secure thousands of tons of weaponsgrade uranium from all \nover the world.\n  Joe's legacy will live on through his family, friends, and through \nhis tremendous efforts to keep Nevadans and all Americans safe.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. We have both had the pleasure to know and work with Joe. \nHe was a brilliant man a Minnesota native who received three degrees, \nin physics, nuclear engineering, and technology and policy from the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. He received his law degree from \nColumbia University. During his lifetime, Joe did everything from \nworking in the control room of a nuclear powerplant to serving as \npresident of the International Nuclear Law Association. Joe was a \nstrong supporter of nuclear energy. Throughout his life, he fought for \nthe development of sensible, sound, and safe nuclear policies.\n  Joe served as Nevada's lead attorney in the fight against dumping \nnuclear waste in Nevada. Applying his deep knowledge of the law and \nnuclear engineering, Joe helped the State of Nevada in our fight \nagainst Yucca Mountain.\n  Mr. REID. Joe Egan was a talented person who led a rich life which \nwas tragically cut short by an aggressive cancer. I am saddened by his \ndeath, and will not forget all that he has done for the people of \nNevada. To his wife, children, and family, I wish to extend my deepest \nsympathies.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The work that Joe has accomplished during his lifetime \nwill forever stand as a fitting testament to his character. He was an \namazing lawyer, a great father, and he will be sorely missed by all. My \nsincere condolences go out to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4777-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4777-S4778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING MENA BOULANGER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the contributions of \nMena Boulanger to the Chicagoland area. Next week, Mena is retiring \nafter 30 years of work to raise public awareness of the Forest Preserve \nDistrict of Cook County and its conservation efforts throughout its \n76,000 acres.\n  In the fall of 1973, the Boulanger family--Mena and David and \nchildren Sarah and John--made their way from Seattle, WA, to Cook \nCounty, IL. The family began spending almost every weekend exploring \nthe various Forest Preserve District sites in the Western suburbs of \nChicago. Leaving behind the landscape of their native Pacific \nNorthwest, the family's appreciation of the Midwest flora and fauna \ncame slowly, and so did a commitment to the prairie around Chicago--\nlands now part of Chicago Wilderness.\n  In 1979, Mena began as the first, full-time Director of Development \nfor the Lincoln Park Zoological Society. For\n\n[[Page S4778]]\n\nthe following 11 years, Mena dramatically increased fundraising \nefforts, allowing the Lincoln Park Zoo to expand at an unprecedented \nrate.\n  Mena transitioned to Chicago's Zoological Society, working with the \nBrookfield Zoo in 1991, where she assumed the role as Vice President \nfor Development. It was during this time, that Mena achieved one of her \nmost significant long-term accomplishments. Mena helped secure \nadditional bonding authority for the Forest Preserve District so that \nit could address its capital maintenance needs, as well as the needs of \nthe Brookfield Zoo and Chicago Botanic Gardens. The Forest Preserve \nDistrict's holdings--and those of the Brookfield Zoo and Chicago \nBotanic Garden--have significantly improved through the use of these \nbond funds.\n  In 2003, she became the Vice President of Government Affairs and \nStrategic Initiatives, directing the Zoo's local, State, and Federal \ngovernment communications and solicitation programs. Mena worked \nclosely with Zoo staff to help the Forest Preserve District better \nserve Cook County residents through special outreach programs, \nincluding tours for senior groups, family pass programs at area \nlibraries, and information on Brookfield Zoo job fairs and lecture \nseries.\n  One of Mena's signature achievements was raising funds for the Hamill \nFamily Play Zoo, an award-winning play area for children age 8 and \nunder that has served as a model for many zoos across the country.\n  A few years ago, Mena was diagnosed with breast cancer. In the midst \nof a personal health crisis and in addition to pursuing traditional \ntherapies, Mena thought about all of the women in her life--daughter, \ngranddaughters, friends, colleagues--and enrolled in an NIH-funded \nstudy at Loyola University in Chicago, examining the effects of \nmeditation on immune cells in breast cancer patients. That is what \nmakes Mena special. She is always optimistic, always strong, and always \nlooking to help others. I am happy to say that Mena's cancer is in \nremission. She is a survivor. She is also an inspiration.\n  To say that Mena is ``retiring'' somehow doesn't seem quite right. It \nwould be more accurate to say that she is redirecting her energies. I \nhave no doubt that Mena will remain involved in her community and \ncommitted to the many causes in which she believes so deeply. I know \nshe is excited to spend more time with her family, especially her four \ngrandchildren. Mena will enjoy having more free time to spend hiking, \npicnicking and exploring the lands of the Forest Preserve District she \ntreasures so dearly. And if you know Mena, you also know that she \nenjoys a good, spirited political debate. I can only imagine how \nretirement will foster that passion.\n  It is with a sense of gratitude that I wish Mena Boulanger well as \nshe prepares to retire from the Chicago Zoological Society and moves on \nto the next chapter in her life. Mena has created a lasting impact on \nthe lives of thousands through her work and volunteerism in the \nChicagoland region. Anyone that has visited either the Lincoln Park Zoo \nor Brookfield Zoo since 1980 has benefited from Mena's efforts and \ngenerosity.\n  I wish Mena Boulanger the best in her retirement and thank her for \ncaring for the Midwest flora and fauna she embraced some 35 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4778-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING DOMINIC AND BRENDA RANDAZZO\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor two constituents, \nDominic and Brenda Randazzo, who have spent much of their lives giving \nback to their community.\n  Dominic and Brenda are a remarkable couple. Through 45 years of \nmarriage, three children and seven grandchildren, they have maintained \nan unyielding spirit of giving back.\n  They were honored recently as the 2008 Servant Leaders of the Year by \nProvena St. Mary's Foundation in Kankakee, IL.\n  Provena St. Mary's Hospital has a special meaning for Dominic and \nBrenda. It is where they were both born.\n  For many years, both Dominic and Brenda have been among the \nhospital's most loyal supporters. Dominic has served as lead fundraiser \nfor the hospital's annual Black Tie Gala for more than 8 years.\n  Last year, Dominic asked Brenda if she could lend some helpful \nsuggestions for an auction benefiting the hospital. Brenda wound up \nchairing the auction and raised generous contributions.\n  Dominic grew up in Kankakee, IL and after he graduated from college, \nspent nearly 2 years in the United States Army, including time in \nGermany. After his years in the service, Dominic went to work for \nArmour Pharmaceutical in 1960 where he met his lovely wife, Brenda.\n  Two years ago, Dominic retired as the manager of community and \ngovernment relations for Aventis Behring. This job combined Dominic's \ntwo favorite passions, community and legislation.\n  Brenda grew up in Chebanse, IL, with dreams of becoming a flight \nattendant or an interior designer. After working at Armour \nPharmaceutical and meeting Dominic, Brenda joined Albanese Development, \na company that designs, builds, and decorates hotels. Brenda's caring \nnature helped her excel in the hospitality industry, ultimately being \nnamed General Manager of Year in 2000 by the American Hotel and Lodging \nAdministration.\n  Provena St. Mary's is only one of many community organizations to \nwhich the Randazzos give so generously of their time and talents.\n  Dominic also spends countless hours with the United Way of Kankakee \nCounty. In 2004, he chaired that organization's Leadership Giving \nCampaign and broke its previous fundraising record. For his efforts, he \nwas honored with the Ken Cote Award, better known as the Mr. United Way \nAward.\n  For more than 15 years, Dominic organized the Hemophilia Foundation \nof Illinois' annual Walk-and-Bike-a-thon.\n  Throughout her career in hotel management, Brenda, too, has always \nfound time to help others. On Halloween, Brenda invited Easter Seals to \nbring children to trick-or-treat at the hotel. She also mentored low-\nincome women--helping them obtain jobs at her hotels and access to \npublic transportation. And she is a stalwart supporter of both the \nArthritis Foundation and the Rotary Club in Bourbonnais, IL.\n  Their motivation for their service is simple and inspiring. Dominic \nand Brenda Randazzo both say that they have been blessed, and they want \nto share their blessings with others.\n  We are all enriched by the good works and fine example of caring \ncitizens such as the Randazzas. I congratulate both Dominic and Brenda \non their well-deserved honor and thank them for their many years of \nselfless giving to others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4778-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4778-S4779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GUNS AND CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, often when we talk about combating gun \nviolence, we discuss preventing criminal access to dangerous firearms. \nHowever, we must also focus our attention on the unsupervised access to \nfirearms by our children and teenagers. While firearms in the hand of \ncriminals pose a significant threat to society, many of the fatal \nfirearm incidences in our country occur when children and teens \ndiscover loaded and unsecured firearms in their own homes. Over the \nyears, suicides and accidental shootings have claimed the lives of \nthousands of young people. Sadly, many of these tragedies could have \nbeen prevented through commonsense gun legislation.\n  The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1.69 \nmillion children in the United States live in households with unlocked \nand loaded firearms. Tragically, firearms kill an average of nearly \neight children and teenagers a day. What's more, the Children's Defense \nFund estimates that at least four times this number are injured in \nnonfatal shootings.\n  Many parents believe that simply educating their children about the \ndangers firearms can pose is enough to keep them safe. Unfortunately, \nthis is simply not the case. A study conducted by the Harvard School of \nPublic Health, involving 201 families who have guns in their homes, \nfound that 39 percent of the parents who stated their children did not \nknow the storage location of their firearms were contradicted by their \nchildren. In addition, 22 percent of the parents who believed their \nchildren had not handled their\n\n[[Page S4779]]\n\nguns were contradicted by their children. The study concluded that \nalthough many parents had warned their children about gun safety, there \nwas still a significant possibility that they were misinformed about \ntheir children's actions with their guns.\n  Common sense tells us that when guns are secured, the risk of \nchildren injuring or killing themselves or others with a gun is \nsignificantly reduced. By passing legislation that would require that \nall handguns sold by a dealer come with a child safety device, such as \na lock, a lock box, or technology built into the gun itself, we could \nsignificantly decrease the possibility of a child misusing a firearm. I \nurge my colleagues to take up and pass such sensible gun safety \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4779-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING SEAN KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of a young man \nwhose life was cut short because of a tragic crime--a hate crime. I \ncame to the Senate floor, 1 year ago today, to speak about a vicious \nattack that killed Sean Kennedy on May 16, 2007. He was just 20 years \nold. As I have done countless times in the past, I have again come to \nthe floor to highlight the needless deaths of hate crimes' victims and \nthe need to enact Federal hate crimes legislation.\n  Recently, I had the opportunity to speak to Sean Kennedy's mother \nElke Kennedy. I had heard that Elke had read about her son in the \nCongressional Record and was grateful that someone had recognized his \ndeath and understood the need for hate crimes legislation. For every \nvictim of a hate crime, many more family members and friends are \nimpacted by the tragic loss. While I know the pain of losing a son, I \ncan only imagine the grief Elke must have felt when someone took the \nlife of her son simply for who he was. As a nation, what do we say to \nElke and other family members who have lost a loved one to a hate \ncrime? What salve do we have to offer them for their pain? I believe we \ncould start by passing Federal hate crimes legislation to demonstrate \nour national commitment to ending bias-motivated crimes.\n  No parent should have to fear for their child's safety because of \ntheir sexual orientation and because our laws do not adequately protect \nthem. It is the Government's first duty to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. Federal and State \nlaws intended to protect individuals from heinous and violent crimes \nmotivated by hate are woefully inadequate. Sean's death is an \nunfortunate reminder of this fact.\n  The Matthew Shepard Act would better equip the Government to fulfill \nits most important obligation by protecting new groups of people as \nwell as better protecting citizens already covered under deficient \nlaws. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing current \nlaw, we can lessen the very impact of hate on our society. Moreover, \nfor parents like Elke Kennedy and Judy Shepard, Matthew's mother, it \nwill finally prove that their sons' deaths were not in vain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4779-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4779-S4780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REFORMING THE FEDERAL HIRING PROCESS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to speak today about the \nbroken hiring process in the Federal Government and the need to recruit \nand retain the next generation of Federal employees.\n  The Federal Government is the largest employer in the United States, \nbut every day talented people interested in Federal service are turned \naway at the door. Too many Federal agencies have built entry barriers \nfor younger workers, invested too little in human resources \nprofessionals, done too little to recruit the right candidates, and \ninvented an evaluation process that discourages qualified candidates. \nAs a result, high-quality candidates are abandoning the Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Government has become the employer of the most \npersistent.\n  This problem was forcibly brought home at a hearing on May, 8, 2008, \nof the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal \nWorkforce, and the District of Columbia entitled ``From Candidates to \nChange Makers: Recruiting the Next Generation of Federal Employees,'' \nwhich I chair. The subcommittee heard testimony from the Office of \nPersonnel Management, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Merit \nSystems Protection Board, the Government Accountability Office, Federal \nemployee unions, think tanks, a human resources consulting firm, and an \nexpert in New Media marketing.\n  The Government Accountability Office's testimony pointed out the \nbroad failures of agencies to address these issues and stated, \n``Studies by us and others have pointed to such problems as passive \nrecruitment strategies, unclear job vacancy announcements, and \nimprecise candidate assessment tools. These problems put the Federal \nGovernment at a competitive disadvantage when acquiring talent.''\n  The Office of Personnel Management OPM is supposed to be the leader \nin the Federal Government on personnel and human capital practices, but \nnot enough is being done. OPM's answer is to offer a legislative \nproposal that would have the Federal Government rehire retired \nemployees on a part-time or limited-time basis. This demonstrates a \nclear lack of focus on attracting the next generation of Federal \nworkers and working to retain the current employees. OPM estimates that \n30 percent of the Federal workforce--approximately 600,000 employees--\nwill retire in the next 5 years. Rehiring former employees does not \naddress the changing culture of job seekers.\n  Mr. Dan Solomon, the chief executive office of the marketing firm \nVirilion, addressed the issue of developing recruitment strategies that \nare friendly to 25- to-35-year-old. Mr. Solomon laid out the challenge \nbefore Federal agencies in recruiting the next generation testifying, \n``younger people are a difficult group to reach and engage . . . bottom \nline: people looking for jobs are online and the government needs to be \nthere to attract the best.''\n  Reports and surveys from the Merit Systems Protection Board MSPB, the \nPartnership for Public Service, and the Council for Excellence in \nGovernment demonstrate that young people strongly desire to work in \npublic service. Agencies need to meet young people where they are, and \ndeveloping recruitment strategies, using online resources and \nstreamlining the hiring process are essential to attracting the next \ngeneration of Federal employees. In the private sector, employers post \njobs through many online venues and only require a resume and cover \nletter. Applying to the Federal Government should be accessible and \neasy.\n  There were many good suggestions made to improve the process. I \nbelieve that if OPM forced agencies to adopt those recommendations \nimprovements would be made. For example, MSPB offered four sound \nrecommendations that could significantly improve agencies' efforts if \nadopted, First, agencies should manage hiring as a critical business \nprocess, and not an administrative function that is relegated to the \nhuman resources staff. Second, agencies should evaluate their own \ninternal hiring practices to identify barriers to high-quality, timely, \nand cost-effective hiring decisions. Third, employ rigorous assessment \nstrategies that emphasize selection quality, not just cost and speed. \nFinally, agencies should implement sound marketing practices and better \nrecruitment strategies, improve their vacancy announcements, and \ncommunicate more effectively with applicants.\n  Agencies can do this. The problem is not Congress. Since 2002, \nCongress has given agencies the flexibilities they need. Agencies no \nlonger must rely on the rule of three or selecting only from the top \nthree candidates who apply; they can use category ratings; and they can \nget direct hire authority from OPM. However, in many cases Federal \nagencies are not using these authorities. Neither is the competitive \nprocess the problem. The notion that merit system principles and \nveterans preference are barriers to hiring is wrong. These are good \nmanagement practices that ensure agencies select qualified candidates \nand do not use discriminatory practices.\n  OPM has not done enough to force agencies to streamline their hiring \nprocesses and appeal to the next generation of employees. OPM developed \nthe 45-day hiring model and Hiring Tool Kit to reduce the hiring time \nat agencies to 45 days and streamline internal processes. However, \nthese have not reduced the number of complaints\n\n[[Page S4780]]\n\nfrom applicants about the length and complexity of the process. The 45-\nday model is 45 workdays or 9 weeks. Furthermore, agencies still \nrequire too much information up front from candidates instead of an \napproach that requires more information as the employee moves through \nthe process.\n  Agencies need to adapt, just as the private sector has, to the \nculture of the next generation of Federal workers. Candidates should \nreceive timely and informative feedback. Candidate-friendly \napplications that welcome cover letters and resumes should be \nimplemented. And, more pipelines into colleges and technical schools \nneed to be developed to recruit candidates with diverse backgrounds.\n  Witnesses from the hearing were committed to improving the process \noffered many recommendations to help agencies. However, these \nrecommendations are not new and I am concerned that their efforts may \nbe too little, too late. Agencies have the existing authorities to \nstreamline their processes and some are already doing so, but it is not \nenough.\n  I am convinced that only through agency leadership that prioritizes \nthis issue will any meaningful reforms take place. I will continue to \npress this administration to address this issue, and I encourage the \nnext administration to take on the challenge of reforming the \nrecruitment and hiring process to ensure that the Federal workforce is \nthe greatest workforce in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4780-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4780-S4781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, for the last 8 weeks, a group of Republican \nSenators, led by Senator Vitter, have come to the floor to talk about \nhealth care. Thus far Senators Vitter, Thune, Isakson, and DeMint have \nspoken about health care particularly the choice we are facing this \nNovember in electing our next President. I don't think there has ever \nbeen such a clear difference in opinions between parties on an issue \nthat issue is health care.\n  One side would like the Government to run health care. The other side \nwould like to give individuals and families the resources to access \ntheir own health care that they can control and take with them from job \nto job. In a nutshell--big government v. individual and family choice.\n  This week I am responsible for talking about the most tangible area \nwe see this dichotomy--Medicare. Under Medicare, beneficiaries either \nhave fee-for-service or Medicare Advantage. The Government sets prices \nand makes coverage decisions under fee-for-service. Multiple private \nsector companies offer comprehensive coverage under Medicare Advantage. \nBut the best example of individual choice and private sector \ncompetition is seen under Medicare's drug benefit--Part D. Let me first \ntalk about Medicare Advantage.\n  In 2008, Medicare Advantage plans are offering an average of \napproximately $1,100 in additional annual value to enrollees in terms \nof cost savings and added benefits. Some examples of extra benefits \navailable through Medicare Advantage plans are; No. 1, coordination of \ncare; No. 2, special needs services; No. 3, predictability in out-of-\npocket costs; No. 4, reduced cost-sharing for Medicare covered \nservices; and No. 5, vision and dental benefits.\n  Competition in the Medicare Advantage Program has created significant \nvalue for beneficiaries. Medicare Advantage enrollees typically benefit \nfrom reduced cost-sharing relative to FFS Medicare. All regional PPO \nenrollees have the protection of a required catastrophic spending cap \nand a combined Part A and B deductible. Sixty-seven percent of plans \nhave coverage for eye glasses. Eighty-three percent have coverage for \nroutine eye exams. Eighty-six percent cover additional inpatient acute \ncare stay days. Ninety percent waive the 3-day hospital stay \nrequirement for skilled nursing facility care.\n  Many Medicare Advantage plan enrollees also receive basic Part D \nprescription drug coverage at a lower cost than stand-alone Part D \nplans can provide. Enrollees in Medicare Advantage plans that include \nPart D coverage save money on drug coverage in two ways: No. 1, \nMedicare Advantage plan drug premiums for basic coverage in 2008 were, \non average, about $6 less than average Part D premiums for basic \ncoverage; and No. 2, the Medicare Advantage payment structure allows \nMedicare Advantage with Part D to use rebates to further reduce Part D \npremiums. On average, Part D premium savings from rebates was more than \n$16 per month in 2008. In 2007 it was reported that 99 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries have access to Medicare Advantage plans with \nzero added premiums, while 86 percent have access to plans that would \ncover prescription drugs with a zero premium through Medicare \nAdvantage.\n  Some say Medicare Advantage is not needed because Medicare meets all \nthe needs of the beneficiaries, but if this was true, millions of \nseniors would not purchase supplemental Medigap coverage to add \nbenefits and pick up some costs. If Medicare Advantage plans were no \nlonger available to those currently enrolled, 39 percent of the \nbeneficiaries would go without supplementary coverage because they \ncould not afford it. According to the NAACP, Medicare Advantage plans \nhave been able to provide low income beneficiaries more comprehensive \nbenefits and lower cost-sharing than if they just had Medicare alone.\n  Medicare Advantage enrollees report on their experience in Medicare \nAdvantage plans through the Consumer Assessment of Health Plan Survey, \nCAHPS. Scores from CAHPS are consistently high. Eighty-six percent of \nrespondents give their plan a rating of 7 or higher, on a scale of 10. \nNinety percent of respondents indicated that they usually or always \nreceived needed care. And 88 percent of respondents indicated that they \nusually or always received care quickly.\n  As I said earlier, the greatest example of individual choice and \nprivate sector competition is found in Medicare Part D. The overall \nprojected cost of the drug benefit is $117 billion lower over the next \n10 years than was estimated last summer due to the slowing of drug cost \ntrends, lower estimates of plan spending, and higher rebates from drug \nmanufacturers. Compared to original Medicare Modernization Act \nprojections, the net Medicare cost of the new drug benefit is $243.7 \nbillion, or 38.5 percent, lower over the 10-year period, 2004 to 2013.\n  Ninety percent of Medicare beneficiaries in a stand-alone Part D \nprescription drug plan, PDP, will had access to at least one plan in \n2008 with lower premiums than they were paying in 2007. In every State, \nbeneficiaries had access to at least one prescription drug plan with \npremiums of less than $20 a month. The national average monthly premium \nfor the basic Medicare drug benefit in 2008 is projected to average \nroughly $25. Seventeen organizations will offer stand-alone \nprescription drug plans nationwide in 2008.\n  Beneficiaries had a wide range of plans from which to choose--some \nthat have zero deductibles and some that offer other enhanced benefits, \nsuch as reduced deductibles and lower cost sharing. There also are \noptions that cover generic drugs in the coverage gap for as low as \n$28.70 a month; nationwide, beneficiaries in any State can obtain such \na plan for under $50 a month.\n  Consumer satisfaction with the Part D benefit is very high: Wall St \nJournal/Harris Interactive, December 2007--87 percent satisfied; VCR \nResearch/Medicare Rx Network, November 2007--83 percent satisfied; KRC/\nMedicare Today, October 2007--89 percent satisfied; and 90 percent of \ndual eligible beneficiaries and 85 percent of beneficiaries with \nlimited incomes are satisfied. Both the KRC and VCR survey show that \nsatisfaction is increasing 10 to 12 percent over the past 2 years and \nthat 65 percent to 77 percent say that their Medicare plan is saving \nthem money.\n  Our experience with the Medicare Advantage and Part D drug plan shows \none thing--competition and choice works. Under Part D we have true \ncompetition--private plans bidding against one another and driving down \nthe price of drug benefit packages to seniors. Seniors can go onto \nMedicare.gov and select the plan that best suits their needs for drugs, \ncopays, pharmacy locations, and the overall premium. As I described \nearlier--premiums are more reasonable than we predicted and \nsatisfaction is very high--competition and choice works.\n  Under Medicare Advantage we have competition-lite. Plans compete for \nbeneficiaries, but Medicare Advantage reimbursement is tied to Medicare \nfee-\n\n[[Page S4781]]\n\nfor-services rates in an area. People love to talk about how Medicare \nAdvantage plans are reimbursed too much, but unfortunately that rally \ncry is based off a study that did not compare apples to apples. If you \ncompare the cost of delivering Part A and B services alone, Medicare \nAdvantage plans are only paid 2.8 percent more than Medicare FFS. I am \ncomfortable paying 2.8 percent more because seniors have more choices, \nthey receive more comprehensive benefits, and their care is coordinated \nunder Medicare Advantage plans. Medicare Advantage plans actually match \ntreatments with diseases and maintenance care with chronic conditions.\n  Senator Coburn and I want to move Medicare Advantage from \ncompetition-lite to full competition. We will be introducing a bill in \nthe coming weeks that will force Medicare Advantage plans to truly \ncompete against each other on price. Medicare Advantage plans already \ncompete on service and quality under our bill they will have to taken \nlessons from Part D drug plans and compete on price.\n  If you have been listening from the beginning, you hopefully \nunderstand how effective competition and choice have been in two parts \nof the Medicare program. And you understand why I want that same robust \nhealth care competition and choice for every American. Every American \ndeserves access to quality, affordable health care of their choice and \ncompetition between health care plans will help achieve that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4781-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REBUILDING AMERICA'S IMAGE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, our go-it-alone foreign policy over the \nlast 8 years has severely damaged our image and stirred up anti-\nAmerican sentiment around the world. We have lost the international \ngoodwill we had following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, \nand the failed strategy of the war in Iraq has cost us a good number of \nallies.\n  A worldwide survey conducted last year of 28,000 people, asking them \nto rate 12 countries, put the United States at the bottom, along with \nIran and Israel, when it comes to having the world's most negative \nimage. In fact, even North Korea ranked higher than the United States \nin that survey. Another survey found that our favorability rating \naround the world dropped considerably from 2000 to 2006. For example, \nin Germany, we went from a favorability rating of 78 percent in 2000 to \n37 percent in 2006. In Spain, only 23 percent of people have a \nfavorable opinion of the United States. I could go on and on, but I \ndon't think anyone can dispute the fact that our image and credibility \nin the world has dropped dramatically. This negative trend hurts us. It \nmakes it more difficult to implement our foreign policy, and even \nthreatens our national security by making the United States a target.\n  With that being said, as the most powerful country in the world we \nstill have an unprecedented opportunity to both help those in less \nfortunate countries and help our country regain the moral authority we \nonce held.\n  A lot of interesting ideas have been proposed to repair our damaged \nimage. Some of the most creative suggestions have come from students, \nsuch as the paper I recently received from Occidental College in Los \nAngeles. That paper makes recommendations for United States policy \nchanges on issues like the war in Iraq, oil and energy issues, and \nillegal immigration, just to name a few. Calling for the United States \nto lead rather than dominate, to be a beacon more than a bullhorn, this \npaper presents a possible path to help repair our standing in the \ninternational community. I don't agree with everything in the paper, \nbut it is full of interesting ideas that can make a difference. It is \nencouraging to see that the youth of this country have taken a serious \ninterest in our country's image. I encourage my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to take a serious look at this and other proposals \nto see what Congress can do to help ensure that future generations \ninherit a government that is well respected throughout the world.\n  It is my hope that with the new administration, our country will be \nable to turn the page of the past 8 years and focus on a foreign policy \nthat is more constructive. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nand the next President to make this happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4781-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4781-S4782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICA'S FOSTER CARE CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today, during National \nFoster Care Month, to speak for the more than a half million children \nliving in foster care across the United States who are waiting for a \nloving family to adopt them.\n  I encourage potential parents throughout our country to open their \nhearts, their lives and their homes to these vulnerable children and \nprovide them with the safe, permanent families that all children \ndeserve. As an adoptive parent myself, I know first-hand the joy and \nfulfillment adoption can bring to a family, and I cannot think of a \nmore perfect gift to give a child than the love, nurturing, and \nprotection they need to grow.\n  A sense of stability is critical to the development of children. Yet, \nyoung children in foster care never know how long they will stay in one \nplace or where they will be sent off to next, resulting in a \nfrightening lack of consistency and security.\n  I recently had the chance to meet with Aaron Weaver, a young man from \nNebraska, who shared with me some of his experiences in the foster care \nsystem: ``Growing up in foster care, a tattered yellow vinyl suitcase \nalways accompanied me, as I switched families, rules and routines,'' he \nsaid.\n\n       I hated that suitcase. It was a constant reminder of how \n     unstable my life was, and how every day was uncertain.\n\n  Fortunately, after 6 years in Nebraska's foster care system, Aaron \nwas finally adopted. Adoption for him meant a family who gave him \nunconditional love. Adoption meant the end of packing his suitcase, \nwondering where he would be placed next. Adoption gave him, for the \nfirst time, the freedom and confidence to think about his future not in \nterms of where he would be sleeping next month, but in terms of what \nhis goals were and where he wanted to go in life.\n  In 2005, just 10 percent of Nebraska's foster care children were \nlucky enough to be adopted into new families like Aaron's, leaving \nnearly a thousand more waiting eagerly for adoptive homes. \nUnfortunately, any chance of these children being placed with adoptive \nparents becomes worse the longer they remain in foster care. In fact, \nwhen a child reaches the 8- to 9-year age range, the probability that \nchild will continue to wait in foster care exceeds the probability that \nhe or she will be adopted; and the number of children in this older age \ngroup is growing.\n  The Adoption Incentive Program, a Federal program first enacted into \nlaw as part of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, is up for \nreauthorization this year. This important program encourages State \ngovernments to find permanent homes for foster children through \nadoption by rewarding those States which have increased their number of \nplacements. Additionally, the program provides special incentives to \nfocus on finding homes for older foster children and those with special \nneeds. I am proud to report that, through this program, my home State \nof Nebraska was awarded $1,392,000 between 2000 and 2006 for finding \nadoptive families for 2,483 children, money which will be reinvested to \nmake this number even greater.\n  I believe we have a responsibility to help foster children in \nNebraska and across the Nation join loving, permanent adoptive families \nsuch as Aaron's. I hope all of you agree and will join me in my \ncommitment to improving America's foster care system.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize May as National \nFoster Care Month. I salute the thousands of families in Kentucky and \nthroughout the country who serve as foster parents, along with those \nwho expand their families by adopting a child from the foster care \nsystem. Unfortunately, not every child finds a home. In 2005, more than \n24,000 foster children reached their 18th birthdays without being \nadopted. As these young adults aged out of the foster care program, \nthey faced many of life's challenges without the family support and \nencouragement that many of us take for granted. With over a half \nmillion children currently in our Nation's foster care system, it is \nimperative that we do all that we can to ensure that they\n\n[[Page S4782]]\n\nare able to join the families they so desperately need and deserve.\n  From my home State of Kentucky, Chris Brown is a testament to the \nimportance of adoption. Chris entered foster care at the age of 11, \nafter the death of his mother. He spent more than 2 years in foster \ncare before being adopted. At the age of 13, Chris was adopted by his \nBig Brothers, Big Sisters mentor, Dave Brown. Chris thrived in his \nadoptive home, and was presented with opportunities he would not have \nhad otherwise. Through the support of his adopted family, he was able \nto attend Northern Kentucky University, where he majored in psychology. \nNow married and with a family of his own, Chris has dedicated his \ncareer to social work, using his talents and skills to give back to the \ncommunity. Chris's story demonstrates how an investment in just one \nchild can pay off for an entire community.\n  The care provided by foster homes and foster families is of great \nvalue. Raising awareness about the number of foster children in \nAmerica, and making it easier for families to adopt is crucial to \nguaranteeing that America's foster children have the resources and \nsupport they need to succeed. Chris Brown is an excellent example of \nhow a child can thrive and develop in a loving family. National Foster \nCare Month reminds us of our obligation to America's youth. I commend \nall those who love and accept into their homes those children needing a \nhome.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in observance of National Foster \nCare Month. Throughout our Nation, so many families provide loving and \ncaring homes for children who have suffered from abuse and neglect. \nThis month is an important reminder to thank the families who welcome \nthese children into their homes, as well as the State and local \nofficials, social workers, health care workers, and others in our \ncommunities who look for signs of abuse and take action to ensure it \nstops.\n  Social workers, in particular, have numerous demands placed on them \nin their efforts to ensure appropriate care of abused and neglected \nchildren, those with disabilities and our vulnerable elderly. To help \nthese workers in their important jobs, I recently introduced the \nDorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young Jr. Social Reinvestment Act with \nSenator Mikulski. I look forward to swift passage of this bill so that \nwe can better support our Nation's social workers.\n  I also want to thank those who help parents who may have a substance \nabuse problem or who suffer from mental illness. These important \nprofessionals help so many parents to overcome their illnesses, which \ncan be a barrier in providing safe and stable homes for their children.\n  Our justice systems, including our judges, attorneys and local law \nenforcement, who work every day to ensure the safety of our children, \nalso deserve our recognition this month. So many of them take the extra \ntime in their overburdened caseloads to ensure they are doing the right \nthing for the future of each abused and neglected child. In fact, in my \nhome State of Oregon, Judge Pamela Abernethy runs a program in her \ncourtroom that engages mental health professionals, law enforcement \nofficials, child development specialists and others in a team approach \nthat has produced great outcomes for children and their parents. Her \nwork helps to stop the cycle of abuse that we see too often in \nfamilies. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Harkin to \npass our bill, the Safe Babies Act, which will work to replicate \nsuccessful programs like Judge Abernethy's across the Nation.\n  However, we know that often children may not be able to return to \ntheir birth families. In America we are lucky that many families, \nincluding my own, have a great love in their heart for children and are \nlooking to adopt.\n  Oregonians Tim and Sari Gale, for example, originally were very \ninterested in adopting an infant. However, as they continued to look \ninto adoption, they could not get the images out of their minds of the \nolder children they saw in the brochures. ``We started to ask ourselves \nwhy we would adopt an infant, when so many children were in need of \nparents,'' said Shari. ``It started making more and more sense for us \nto adopt an older child.''\n  Soon, Andrew became a member of the family. ``It has been heart-\nwarming and amazing to watch the gradual process whereby this \nfrightened little boy learned to love and to trust,'' observed a family \nfriend. ``Andrew has blossomed under the Gales' loving care.'' Watching \nAndrew interact with peers at high school events or serving as a \ncounselor for other children at summer riding camp, one would never \nguess this likeable and polite young man had spent his early years as \nan abused and neglected child. The Gales truly are a testament to the \nhealing power of a loving family.\n  The Federal Adoption Incentive Program, which was first enacted in \n1997 as part of the Adoption and Safe Families Act, encourages States \nto find foster children permanent homes through adoption. The Adoption \nIncentive Program is due to expire on September 30. Congress must \nreauthorize this act so that it can continue to serve as a vitally \nimportant incentive to States for finalizing adoptions for children in \nfoster care, with an emphasis on finding adoptive homes for special-\nneeds children and foster children over age 9. I am proud of Oregon's \nsuccess in finalizing more than 12,700 adoptions of children from \nfoster care between 2000 and 2006. This has resulted in Oregon \nreceiving $3.1 million in Federal adoption incentive payments, which \nare invested back into the child welfare program.\n  In 2005, roughly 2,065 children from Oregon's foster care system were \nadopted--but nearly 3,500 foster children in Oregon were still waiting \nfor adoptive families, and they waited an average of about 2\\1/2\\ years \nto join a new family. These vulnerable children have waited long \nenough.\n  Again, it is important that we thank foster care and adoptive \nfamilies in our Nation, as well as frontline workers who protect our \nchildren, for the wonderful work that they do and love that they share.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4782-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4782-S4787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish today to discuss the U.S. export \ncontrol system bureaucracy and its impact on our national interests.\n  Recently I chaired a hearing of the Oversight of Government \nManagement Subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee entitled ``Beyond Control: Reforming \nExport Licensing Agencies for National Security and Economic \nInterests.'' Some of the issues explored in the hearing were: revising \nthe multilateral coordination and enforcement aspects of export \ncontrols; addressing weaknesses in the interagency process for \ncoordinating and approving licenses; reviewing alternative bureaucratic \nstructures or processes to eliminate exploitable seams in our export \ncontrol system; and ensuring that there are enough qualified licensing \nofficers to review efficiently license applications.\n  Witnesses from the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military \nAffairs, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, and \nthe Department of Defense's Defense Technology Security Administration \nresponded to almost a decade's worth of analysis, recommendations, \nreports, and testimony from the Government Accountability Office, GAO. \nThe GAO witness on the panel identified numerous instances of \ninefficiency and ineffectiveness in the U.S. export control system, \nincluding poor strategic management, insufficient interagency \ncoordination, shortages of manpower, short-term fixes for long-term \nproblems, and inadequate information systems.\n  Although the agency witnesses acknowledged their progress in \naddressing these shortcomings, they also articulated a deeper need for \ngreater reform in response to the challenges of globalization in the \n21st century. I would go one step further then the administration \nwitnesses. The U.S. export control system is a relic of the Cold War \nand does not effectively meet our national and economic security needs.\n  Recent examples demonstrate the challenges of controlling sensitive \nexports. Dual-use technology has been diverted through Britain and the \nUnited Arab Emirates, UAE, to Iran. A recent attempt by two men to \nsmuggle sensitive thermal imaging equipment to China shows that Iran is \nnot alone in\n\n[[Page S4783]]\n\nits desire for sensitive technology. However, the effort to control the \nflow of dual-use technology goes beyond our borders. Working with the \ninternational community is critical as technologies which were once \nonly produced in the U.S. are now being produced elsewhere.\n  The second group of witnesses, representing many decades of \ngovernment and private sector experience with export controls, \nidentified recommendations that could begin to modernize this system: \neliminating the distinction between weapons and dual-use technology; \nreducing the total number of items on control lists; implementing \nproject licenses that cover a multitude of items instead of relying on \nan item-by-item licensing process; passing an updated Export \nAdministration Act; focusing on multilateral export controls and \nharmonizing them with our allies; and reestablishing high-level policy \nmanagement of both dual-use and munitions exports at the White House. \nMr. President, I would like to ask to have printed in the Record, \nfollowing my remarks, a CRS memorandum providing an excellent overview \nof U.S export controls.\n  An opportunity to revise our ineffective and inefficient export \ncontrol system will accompany the arrival of the new administration in \nJanuary. I urge my colleagues to consider these recommendations for \nimproving the management and bureaucracy of the export control system \nas the Congress debates and updates relevant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the two CRS memoranda \nto which I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 2008.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     Re: Background for Hearing on U.S. Export Controls.\n     To: Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs \n         Committee; Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \n         Management; the Federal Workforce; and the District of \n         Columbia.\n\n     From: Ian F. Fergusson, Specialist in International Trade and \n         Finance; Richard F. Grimmett, Specialist in National \n         Defense, Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division.\n\n       This memorandum responds to your request for background \n     information in support of your upcoming hearing on the U.S. \n     export control system. The memo discusses the legislative \n     authority, structure, and function of U.S. dual-use and \n     defense export controls. It also discusses current issues \n     related to the administration of those controls.

Dual-use goods are commodities, software, or \n     technologies that have both civilian and military \n     applications.\n       U.S. export controls are also utilized to restrict exports \n     to certain countries in which the United States imposes \n     economic sanctions. Through the Export Administration Act \n     (EAA), the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), and other \n     authorities, Congress has delegated to the executive branch \n     its express constitutional authority to regulate foreign \n     commerce by controlling exports. In its administration of \n     this authority, the executive branch has created a diffuse \n     system by which exports are controlled by differing agencies \n     under different regulations. This section describes the \n     characteristics of the dual-use, munitions, and \n     nuclear controls. The information contained in the section \n     also appears in chart form in Appendix 1.\n       Various aspects of this system have long been criticized by \n     exporters, non-proliferation advocates and other stakeholders \n     as being too rigorous, insufficiently rigorous, lax, \n     cumbersome, too stringent, or any combination of these \n     descriptions. In January 2007, the Government Accountability \n     Office (GAO) designated government programs designed to \n     protect critical technologies, including the U.S. export \n     control system, as a `high-risk area' ``that warrants a \n     strategic re-examination of existing programs to identify \n     needed changes.'' The report cited poor coordination among \n     export control agencies, disagreements over commodity \n     jurisdiction between State and Commerce, unnecessary delays \n     and inefficiencies in the license application process, and a \n     lack of systematic evaluative mechanisms to determine the \n     effectiveness of export controls.\n\n\n                          The Dual-Use System\n\n       The Export Administration Act (EAA). The EAA of 1979 (P.L. \n     96-72) is the underlying statutory authority for dual-use \n     export controls. The EAA, which is currently expired, \n     periodically has been reauthorized for short periods of time. \n     The last incremental extension expired in August 2001. At \n     other times and currently, the export licensing system \n     created under the authority of EAA has been continued by the \n     invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n     (IEEPA) (P.L. 95-223). EAA confers upon the President the \n     power to control exports for national security, foreign \n     policy or short supply purposes. It also authorizes the \n     President to establish export licensing mechanisms for items \n     detailed on the Commerce Control List (see below), and it \n     provides some guidance and places certain limits on that \n     authority.\n       Several attempts to rewrite or reauthorize the EAA have \n     occurred over the years. The last comprehensive effort took \n     place during the 107th Congress. The Senate adopted \n     legislation, S. 149, in September 2001, and a competing House \n     version, H.R. 2581, was developed by the then House \n     International Relations Committee, and the House Armed \n     Services Committee. The full House did not act on this \n     legislation. More modest attempts to update the penalty \n     structure and enforcement mechanisms in context of renewing \n     the 1979 Act for a period of 5 years has been introduced in \n     the 110th Congress as the Export Enforcement Act of 2007 (S. \n     2000).\n       The EAA, which was written and amended during the Cold War, \n     was based on strategic relationships, threats to U.S. \n     national security, international business practices, and \n     commercial technologies many of which have changed \n     dramatically in the last 25 years. Some Members of Congress \n     and most U.S. business representatives see a need to \n     liberalize U.S. export regulations to allow American \n     companies to engage more fully in international competition \n     for sales of high-technology goods. Other Members and some \n     national security analysts contend that liberalization of \n     export controls over the last decade has contributed to \n     foreign threats to U.S. national security, that some controls \n     should be tightened, and that Congress should weigh further \n     liberalization carefully.\n       Administration. The Bureau of Industry and Security in the \n     Department of Commerce administers the dual-use export \n     control system. The export licensing and enforcement \n     functions that now form the agency mission of BIS were \n     detached from the International Trade Administration in \n     1980 in order to separate it from the export promotion \n     functions of the Department of Commerce. In FY2006, BIS \n     processed 18,941 licenses with a value of approximately \n     $36 billion. During the same fiscal year, BIS approved \n     15,982 applications, denied 189, and returned 2,763 \n     (usually because a license was not necessary), for an \n     approval rate of 98.8%, disregarding the returned \n     licenses. BIS was appropriated $72.9 million in FY2008 \n     with budget authority for 365 positions. The President's \n     FY2009 request for BIS is $83.7 million, a 14.8% increase \n     from FY2008, with budget authority for 396 positions. In \n     addition to its export licensing and enforcement \n     functions, BIS also enforces U.S. anti-boycott regulations \n     concerning the Arab League boycott against Israel.\n       Implementing Regulations. The EAA is implemented by the \n     Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR 730 et seq). \n     As noted above, the EAR is continued under the authority of \n     the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) in \n     times when the EAA is expired. The EAR sets forth licensing \n     policy for goods and destinations, the applications process \n     used by exporters, and the Commerce Control List (CCL). The \n     CCL is the list of specific goods, technology, and software \n     that are controlled by the EAR. The CCL is composed of ten \n     categories of items: Nuclear materials, facilities, and \n     equipment; materials, organisms, microorganisms, and toxins; \n     materials processing; electronics; computers; \n     telecommunications and information security; lasers and \n     sensors; navigation and avionics; marine; and propulsion \n     systems, space vehicles, and related equipment. Each of these \n     categories is further divided into functional groups: \n     Equipment, assemblies, and components; test, inspection, and \n     production equipment; materials; software; and technology. \n     Each controlled item has an export control classification \n     number (ECCN) based on the above categories and functional \n     group. Each ECCN is accompanied by a description of the item \n     and the reason for control. In addition to discrete items on \n     the CCL, nearly all U.S. origin commodities are ``subject to \n     the EAR.'' This means that any product ``subject to the EAR'' \n     may be restricted to a destination based on the end-use or \n     end-user of the product. For example, a commodity that is not \n     on the CCL may be denied if the good is destined for a \n     military end-use, or to an entity known to be engaged in \n     proliferation.\n       Licensing Policy. The EAR sets out the licensing policy for \n     dual-use commodities. Items are controlled for reasons of \n     national security, foreign policy, or short-supply. National \n     security controls are based on a common multilateral control \n     list, however the\n\n[[Page S4784]]\n\n     countries to which we apply those controls are based on U.S. \n     policy. Foreign Policy controls may be unilateral or \n     multilateral in nature. Items are controlled unilaterally for \n     anti-terrorism, regional stability, or crime control \n     purposes. Anti-terrorism controls proscribe nearly all \n     exports to the 5 state sponsors of terrorism. Foreign policy-\n     based controls are also based on adherence to multilateral \n     non-proliferation control regimes such the Nuclear Suppliers' \n     Group, the Australia Group (chemical and biological \n     precursors), and the Missile Technology Control Regime.\n       The EAR sets out timelines for the consideration of dual-\n     use licenses and the process for resolving interagency \n     disputes. Within 9 days from receipt, Commerce must refer the \n     license to other agencies (State, Defense, or NRC as \n     appropriate), grant the license, deny it, seek additional \n     information, or return it. If the license is referred to \n     other agencies, the agency to which it is referred must \n     recommend the application be approved or denied within thirty \n     days. The EAR provides a dispute resolution process for a \n     dissenting agency to appeal an adverse decision. The \n     interagency dispute resolution process is designed to be \n     completed within 90 days. This process is depicted \n     graphically in Appendix 2.\n       Enforcement and Penalties. Because of the expiration of the \n     EAA, current penalties for export control violations are \n     based on those contained in the International Emergency \n     Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.). For \n     criminal penalties, IEEPA sanctions individuals up to $1 \n     million or up to 20 years imprisonment, or both, per \n     violation [50 U.S.C. 1705(b)]. Civil penalties under IEEPA \n     are set at $250,000 per violation. IEEPA penalties were \n     recently raised to the current levels by the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Enhancement Act (P.L. 110-96), \n     which was signed by President Bush on October 16, 2007.\n       Enforcement is carried out by the Office of Export \n     Enforcement (OEE) at BIS. OEE has a staff of approximately \n     164 in Washington and eight domestic field offices. OEE is \n     authorized to carry out investigations domestically and works \n     with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct \n     investigations overseas. OEE also conducts pre-license and \n     post-shipment verification along with in-country U.S. embassy \n     officials overseas.\n       The Export Enforcement Act of 2007. One of the persistent \n     concerns about the administration of the dual-use system is \n     that it operates under the emergency authority of the \n     International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA), the \n     underlying EAA having last expired in 2001. On August 3, \n     2007, the administration-supported Export Enforcement Act of \n     2007 (S. 2000) was introduced by Senator Dodd. The draft bill \n     would reauthorize the Export Administration Act for five \n     years and amend the penalty and enforcement provisions of the \n     Act. The proposed legislation would revise the penalty \n     structure and increase penalties for export control \n     violations. The bill would raise criminal penalties for \n     individuals up to $1 million and raise the term of potential \n     imprisonment to ten years for each violation. For firms, it \n     would raise penalties to the greater of $5 million or 10 \n     times the value of the export. Under the 1979 FAA, the base \n     penalty was the greater of $50,000 or 5 times the value of \n     the export, or five years imprisonment. It would expand the \n     list of statutory violations that could result in a denial of \n     export privileges, and it extends the term of such denial \n     from not more than 10 years to not more than 25 years.\n       The enforcement provisions of the Administration proposal \n     would expand the authority of the Department of Commerce to \n     investigate potential violations of EAA overseas. It provides \n     for enforcement authority at other places at home and abroad \n     with the concurrence of the Department of Homeland Security. \n     The proposed draft legislation would restate the enforcement \n     provisions of the EAA to account for the current structure of \n     Customs and Border Security and the Immigration and Customs \n     Enforcement in the Department of Homeland Security. It would \n     also direct the Secretary of Commerce to publish and update \n     best practices guidelines for effective export control \n     compliance programs. It also would expand the confidentiality \n     provisions beyond licenses and licensing activity to include \n     classification requests, enforcement activities, or \n     information obtained or supplied concerning U.S. multilateral \n     commitments. The bill included new language governing the use \n     of funds for undercover investigations and operations and \n     establishes audit and reporting requirements for such \n     investigations. It also authorized wiretaps in enforcement of \n     the act.\n       Some in the industry community have criticized the \n     legislation for focusing on penalties and enforcement without \n     addressing business concerns such as streamlining the license \n     process. While the Administration favors the 5 year renewal \n     period of the current EAA as a period in which a new export \n     control system may be devised, the length of the extension \n     may also serve to take the pressure off such reform \n     efforts.\n\n\n                        Military Export Controls\n\n       Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA). The AECA provides \n     the statutory authority for the control of defense articles \n     and services. It sets out foreign and national policy \n     objectives for international defense cooperation and military \n     export controls. Section 3(a) of the Arms Export Control Act \n     (AECA) sets forth the general criteria for countries or \n     international organizations to be eligible to receive United \n     States defense articles and defense services provided under \n     the act. It also sets express conditions on the uses to which \n     these defense items maybe put. Section 4 of the Arms Export \n     Control Act states that U.S. defense articles and defense \n     services shall be sold to friendly countries ``solely'' for \n     use in ``internal security,'' for use in ``legitimate self-\n     defense,'' to enable the recipient to participate in \n     ``regional or collective arrangements or measures consistent \n     with the Charter of the United Nations,'' to enable the \n     recipient to participate in ``collective measures requested \n     by the United Nations for the purpose of maintaining or \n     restoring international peace and security,'' and to enable \n     the foreign military forces ``in less developed countries to \n     construct public works and to engage in other activities \n     helpful to the economic and social development of such \n     friendly countries.'' The AECA also contains the statutory \n     authority for the Foreign Military Sales program, under which \n     the U.S. government sells U.S. defense equipment, services, \n     and training on a government-to-government basis.\n       Licensing Policy. The International Traffic in Arms \n     Regulations (ITAR) sets out licensing policy for exports (and \n     some temporary imports) of U.S. Munitions List (USML) items. \n     A license is required for the export of nearly all items on \n     the USML. Canada has a limited exemption as it is considered \n     part of the U.S. defense industrial base. In addition, the \n     United States has recently signed treaties with the United \n     Kingdom and Australia to exempt certain defense articles from \n     licensing obligations to approved end-users in those \n     countries. These treaties must be ratified by the Senate. \n     Unlike some Commerce controls, licensing requirements are \n     based on the nature of the article and not the end-use or \n     end-user of the item. The United States prohibits munitions \n     exports to countries either unilaterally or based on \n     adherence to United Nations arms embargoes. In addition, any \n     firm engaged in manufacturing, exporting, or brokering any \n     item on the USML must register with DDTC and pay a yearly \n     fee, currently $1,750, whether it seeks to export or not \n     during the year.\n       Congressional Requirements. A prominent feature of the AECA \n     is the requirement of congressional consideration of foreign \n     arms sales proposed by the President. This procedure includes \n     consideration of proposals to sell major defense equipment, \n     defense articles and services, or the re-transfer to other \n     nations of such military items. The procedure is triggered by \n     a formal report to Congress under Sections 36 of the Arms \n     Export Control Act (AECA). In general, the executive branch, \n     after complying with the terms of applicable section of U.S. \n     law, usually those contained in the Arms Export Control Act, \n     is free to proceed with an arms sales proposal unless \n     Congress passes legislation prohibiting or modifying the \n     proposed sale.\n       The traditional sequence of events for the congressional \n     review of an arms sale proposal has been the submission by \n     the Defense Department (on behalf of the President) of a \n     preliminary or ``informal'' classified notification of a \n     prospective major arms sale 20 calendar-days before the \n     executive branch takes further formal action. This \n     ``informal'' notification is submitted to the Speaker of the \n     House (who traditionally has referred it to the House Foreign \n     Affairs Committee), and to the Chairman of the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee. This practice stems from a February 18, \n     1976, letter of the Defense Department making a nonstatutory \n     commitment to give Congress these preliminary classified \n     notifications. It has been the practice for such ``informal'' \n     notifications to be made for arms sales cases that would have \n     to be formally notified to Congress under the provisions of \n     Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). These \n     ``informal'' notifications always precede the submission of \n     the required statutory notifications, but the time period \n     between the submission of the ``informal'' notification and \n     the statutory notification is not fixed. It is determined by \n     the President. He has the obligation under the law to submit \n     the arms sale proposal to Congress, but only after he has \n     determined that he is prepared to proceed with any such \n     notifiable arms sales transaction.\n       Under Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act, \n     Congress must be formally notified 30 calendar-days before \n     the Administration can take the final steps to conclude a \n     government-to-government foreign military sale of major \n     defense equipment valued at $14 million or more, defense \n     articles or services valued at $50 million or more, or design \n     and construction services valued at $200 million or more. In \n     the case of such sales to NATO member states, NATO, Japan, \n     Australia, or New Zealand, Congress must be formally notified \n     15 calendar-days before the Administration can proceed with \n     the sale. However, the prior notice thresholds are higher for \n     NATO members, Australia, Japan or New Zealand. These higher \n     thresholds are: $25,000,000 for the sale, enhancement or \n     upgrading of major defense equipment; $100,000,000 for the \n     sale, enhancement or upgrading of defense articles and \n     defense services; and $300,000,000 for the sale, enhancement \n     or upgrading of design and construction services, so long as \n     such sales to these countries do not include or involve sales \n     to a country outside of this group of nations.\n       Commercially licensed arms sales also must be formally \n     notified to Congress 30 calendar-days before the export \n     license is issued if they involve the sale of major defense\n\n[[Page S4785]]\n\n     equipment valued at $14 million or more, or defense articles \n     or services valued at $50 million or more (Section 36(c) \n     AECA). In the case of such sales to NATO member states, NATO, \n     Japan, Australia, or New Zealand, Congress must be formally \n     notified 15 calendar-days before the Administration can \n     proceed with such a sale. However, the prior notice \n     thresholds are higher for sales to NATO members, Australia, \n     Japan or New Zealand specifically: $25,000,000 for the sale, \n     enhancement or upgrading of major defense equipment; \n     $100,000,000 for the sale, enhancement or upgrading of \n     defense articles and defense services, and $300,000,000 for \n     the sale, enhancement or upgrading of design and construction \n     services, so long as such sales to these countries do not \n     include or involve sales to a country outside of this group \n     of nations. It has not been the general practice for \n     the Administration to provide a 20-day ``informal'' \n     notification to Congress of arms sales proposals that \n     would be made through the granting of commercial licenses.\n       A congressional recess or adjournment does not stop the 30 \n     calendar-day statutory review period. It should be emphasized \n     that after Congress receives a statutory notification \n     required under Sections 36(b) or 36(c) of the Arms Export \n     Control Act, for example, and 30 calendar-days elapse without \n     Congress having blocked the sale, the executive branch is \n     free to proceed with the sales process. This fact does not \n     mean necessarily that the executive branch and the \n     prospective arms purchaser will sign a sales contract and \n     that the items will be transferred on the 31st day after the \n     statutory notification of the proposal has been made. It \n     would, however, be legal to do so at that time.\n       Administration. Exports of defense goods and services are \n     administered by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls \n     (DDTC) at the Department of State. DDTC is a component of the \n     Bureau of Political-Military Affairs and consists of four \n     offices: Management, Policy, Licensing, and Compliance. In \n     FY2008, DDTC was funded at a level of $12.7 million and had a \n     staff of 78 ($6.6 million for licensing activities, 44 \n     licensing officers). In the 12 months ending March 2008, DDTC \n     completed action on 83,886 export license applications, and \n     its FY2009 budget request reported that license application \n     volumes have increased by 8% a year. DDTC's FY2009 budget \n     request, however, did not ask for additional staffing and its \n     budget request called for an increase of $0.4 million to \n     $13.1 million ($6.9 million for licensing activities). On \n     March 24, 2008, 19 Members of Congress wrote to the \n     Chairwoman and Ranking Member of the House State and Foreign \n     Operations Appropriations Subcommittee to request a funding \n     level of $26 million, including $8 million collected yearly \n     from registration fees. Senator Biden, in his Foreign \n     Relations Views and Estimates letter to the Senate Budget \n     Committee also described DDTC as ``seriously understaffed'' \n     and suggested ``a doubling of that figure ($6.9 million for \n     licensing) is warranted.\n       Critics of the defense trade system have long decried the \n     delays and backlogs in processing license applications at \n     DDTC. The new National Security Presidential Directive (NSPD-\n     56), signed by President Bush on January 22, 2008, directed \n     that the review and adjudication of defense trade licenses \n     submitted under ITAR are to be completed within 60 days, \n     except where certain national security exemptions apply. \n     Previously, except for the Congressional notification \n     procedures discussed above, DDTC had no defined time-line for \n     the application process. DDTC's backlog of open cases, which \n     had reached 10,000 by the end of 2006, has been reduced to \n     3,458 by March 2008. During this period, average processing \n     time of munitions license applications have also trended \n     downward from 33 days to 15 days. However, GAO reported in \n     November 2007 that DDTC was using ``extraordinary \n     measures--such as extending work hours, canceling staff \n     training, meeting, and industry outreach, and pulling \n     available staff from other duties in order to process \n     cases'' to reduce the license backlog, measures that it \n     described as unsustainable.\n       Enforcement and Penalties. The AECA provides for criminal \n     penalties of $1 million or ten years for each violation, or \n     both. AECA also authorizes civil penalties of up to $500,000 \n     and debarment from future exports. DDTC has a small \n     enforcement staff (18 in the Office of Defense Trade \n     Compliance) and works with the Defense Security Service and \n     the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement (ICE) units at the Department of Homeland \n     Security (DHS). DDTC assists the DHS and the Department of \n     Justice in pursuing criminal investigations and prosecutions. \n     DDTC also coordinates the Blue Lantern end-use monitoring \n     program, in which U.S. embassy officials in-country conduct \n     pre-license checks and post-shipment verifications. In \n     FY2006, DDTC completed 489 end-use cases, 94 (19%) of which \n     were determined to be unfavorable.\n\n                                Nuclear\n\n       A subset of the abovementioned dual-use and military \n     controls are controls on nuclear items and technology. \n     Controls on nuclear goods and technology are derived from the \n     Atomic Energy Act as well as from the EAA and the AECA. \n     Controls on nuclear exports are divided between several \n     agencies based on the product or service being exported. The \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates exports of nuclear \n     facilities and material, including core reactors. The NRC \n     licensing policy and control list is located at 10 C.F.R. \n     110. BIS licenses ``outside the core'' civilian power plant \n     equipment and maintains the Nuclear Referral List as part of \n     the CCL. The Department of Energy controls the export of \n     nuclear technology. DDTC exercises licensing authority over \n     nuclear items in defense articles under the ITAR.\n\n\n           Defense Technology Security Administration (DTSA)\n\n       DTSA is located in the Department of Defense, Office of the \n     Under Secretary of Defense for Policy under the Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense for Global Security Affairs. DTSA \n     coordinates the technical and national security review of \n     direct commercial sales export licenses and commodity \n     jurisdiction requests received from the Departments of \n     Commerce and State. It develops the recommendation of the DOD \n     on these referred export licenses or commodity jurisdictions \n     based on input provided by the various DOD departments and \n     agencies and represents DOD in the interagency dispute \n     resolution process. In calendar year 2007, DTSA completed \n     41,689 license referrals. Not all licenses from DDTC or BIS \n     are referred to DTSA; memorandums of understanding govern the \n     types of licenses referred from each agency. DTSA coordinates \n     the DOD position with regard to proposed changes to the \n     International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and the \n     Export Administration Regulations (EAR). It also represents \n     the DOD in interagency fora responsible for compliance with \n     multinational export control regimes. For FY2008, DTSA had a \n     staff of 187 civilian and active duty military employees and \n     received funding of $23.3 million.\n\n                                APPENDIX 1: BASIC EXPORT CONTROL CHARACTERISTICS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Characteristic                     Dual-Use                Munitions                 Nuclear\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLegislative Authority................

The UAE federation is led by the ruler of \n     Abu Dhabi, Khalifa bin Zayid al-Nuhayyan, now about 60 years \n     old. The ruler of Dubai traditionally serves concurrently as \n     Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE; that position \n     has been held by Mohammad bin Rashid Al Maktum, architect of \n     Dubai's modernization drive, since the death of his elder \n     brother Maktum bin Rashid Al Maktum on January 5, 2006.\n       In part because of its small size--its population is about \n     4.4 million, of which only about 900,000 are citizens--the \n     UAE is one of the wealthiest of the Gulf states, with a gross \n     domestic product (GDP) per capita of about $55,000 per year \n     in terms of purchasing power parity. Islamist movements in \n     UAE, including those linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, are \n     generally non-violent and perform social and relief work. \n     However, the UAE is surrounded by several powers that dwarf \n     it in size and strategic capabilities, including Iran, Iraq, \n     and Saudi Arabia, which has a close relationship with the UAE \n     but views itself as the leader of the Gulf monarchies.\n       The UAE has long lagged behind the other Persian Gulf \n     states in political reform, but the federation, and several \n     individual emirates, have begun to move forward. The most \n     significant reform, to date, took place in December 2006, \n     when limited elections were held for half of the 40-seat \n     Federal National Council (FNC); the other 20 seats continue \n     to be appointed. Previously, all 40 members of the FNC were \n     appointed by all seven emirates, weighted in favor of Abu \n     Dhabi and Dubai (eight seats each). UAE citizens are able to \n     express their concerns directly to the leadership through \n     traditional consultative mechanisms, such as the open majlis \n     (council) held by many UAE leaders.\n       The UAE's social problems are likely a result of its open \n     economy, particularly in Dubai. The Trafficking in Persons \n     report for 2007 again placed the UAE on ``Tier 2/Watch List'' \n     (up from Tier 3 in 2005) because it does not comply with the \n     minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is \n     making significant efforts to do so. The UAE is considered a \n     ``destination country'' for women trafficked from Asia and \n     the former Soviet Union.\n       Defense Relations With the United States and Concerns About \n     Iran. Following the 1991 Gulf war to oust Iraqi forces from \n     Kuwait, the UAE, whose armed forces number about 61,000, \n     determined that it wanted a closer relationship with the \n     United States, in part to deter and to counter Iranian naval \n     power. UAE fears escalated in April 1992, when Iran asserted \n     complete control of the largely uninhabited Persian Gulf \n     island of Abu Musa, which it and the UAE shared under a 1971 \n     bilateral agreement. (In 1971, Iran, then ruled by the U.S.-\n     backed Shah, seized two other islands, Greater and Lesser \n     Tunb, from the emirate of Ras al-Khaymah, as well as part of \n     Abu Musa from the emirate of Sharjah.) The UAE wants to refer \n     the dispute to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), but \n     Iran insists on resolving the issue bilaterally. The United \n     States is concerned about Iran's military control over the \n     islands and supports UAE proposals, but the United States \n     takes no position on sovereignty of the islands. The UAE, \n     particularly Abu Dhabi, has long feared that the large \n     Iranian-origin community in Dubai emirate (est. 400,000 \n     persons) could pose a ``fifth column'' threat to UAE \n     stability. Illustrating the UAE's attempts to avoid \n     antagonizing Iran, in May 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud \n     Ahmadinejad was permitted to hold a rally for Iranian \n     expatriates in Dubai when he made the first high level visit \n     to UAE since UAE independence in 1971.\n       The framework for U.S.-UAE defense cooperation is a July \n     25, 1994, bilateral defense pact, the text of which is \n     classified, including a ``status of forces agreement'' \n     (SOFA). Under the pact, during the years of U.S. \n     ``containment'' of Iraq (1991-2003), the UAE allowed U.S. \n     equipment pre-positioning and U.S. warship visits at its \n     large Jebel Ali port, capable of handling aircraft carriers, \n     and it permitted the upgrading of airfields in the UAE that \n     were used for U.S. combat support flights, during Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom (OIF). About 1,800 U.S. forces, mostly Air \n     Force, are in UAE; they use Al Dhafra air base (mostly KC-10 \n     refueling) and naval facilities at Fujairah to support U.S. \n     operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       The UAE, a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), \n     has developed a free market economy. On November 15, 2004, \n     the Administration notified Congress it had begun negotiating \n     a free trade agreement (FTA) with the UAE. Several rounds of \n     talks were held prior to the June 2007 expiration of \n     Administration ``trade promotion authority,'' but progress \n     had been halting, mainly because UAE may feel it does not \n     need the FTA enough to warrant making major labor and \n     other reforms. Despite diversification, oil exports still \n     account for one-third of the UAE's federal budget. Abu \n     Dhabi has 80% of the federation's proven oil reserves of \n     about 100 billion barrels, enough for over 100 years of \n     exports at the current production rate of 2.2 million \n     barrels per day (mbd). Of that amount, about 2.1 mbd are \n     exported, but negligible amounts go to the United States. \n     The UAE does not have ample supplies of natural gas, and \n     it has entered into a deal with neighboring gas exporter \n     Qatar to construct pipeline that will bring Qatari gas to \n     UAE (Dolphin project). UAE is also taking a leading role \n     among the Gulf states in pressing consideration of \n     alternative energies, including nuclear energy, to \n     maintain Gulf energy dominance.\n\n\n                         Export Control Issues\n\n       Cooperation Against Terrorism. The relatively open society \n     of the UAE--along with UAE policy to engage rather than \n     confront its powerful neighbors--has also caused differences \n     with the United States on the presence of terrorists and \n     their financial networks. However, the UAE has been \n     consistently credited by U.S. officials with attempting to \n     rectify problems identified by the United States.\n       The UAE was one of only three countries (Pakistan and Saudi \n     Arabia were the others) to have recognized the Taliban during \n     1996-2001 as the government of Afghanistan. During Taliban \n     rule, the UAE allowed Ariana Afghan airlines to operate \n     direct service, and Al Qaeda activists reportedly spent time \n     there. Two of the September 11 hijackers were UAE nationals, \n     and they reportedly used UAE-based financial networks in the \n     plot. Since then, the UAE has been credited in U.S. reports \n     (State Department ``Country Reports on Terrorism: 2006, \n     released April 30, 2007'') and statements with: assisting in \n     the 2002 arrest of senior Al Qaeda operative in the Gulf, Abd \n     al-Rahim al-Nashiri; denouncing terror attacks; improving \n     border security; prescribing guidance for Friday prayer \n     leaders; investigating suspect financial transactions; and \n     strengthening its bureaucracy and legal framework to combat \n     terrorism. In December 2004, the United States and Dubai \n     signed a Container Security Initiative Statement of \n     Principles, aimed at screening U.S.-bound containerized cargo \n     transiting Dubai ports. Under the agreement, U.S. Customs \n     officers are co-located with the Dubai Customs Intelligence \n     Unit at Port Rashid in Dubai. On a ``spot check'' basis, \n     containers are screened at that and other UAE ports for \n     weaponry, explosives, and other illicit cargo.\n       The UAE has long been under scrutiny as a transhipment \n     point for exports to Iran and other proliferators. In \n     connection with revelations of illicit sales of nuclear \n     technology to Iran, Libya, and North Korea by Pakistan's \n     nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, Dubai was named as a key \n     transfer point for Khan's shipments of nuclear components. \n     Two Dubai-based companies were apparently involved in trans-\n     shipping components: SMB Computers and Gulf Technical \n     Industries. On April 7, 2004, the Administration sanctioned a \n     UAE firm, Elmstone Service and Trading (FZE), for allegedly \n     selling weapons of mass destruction- related technology to \n     Iran, under the Iran-Syria Non-Proliferation Act (P.L. 106-\n     178). More recently, in June 2006, the Bureau of Industry and \n     Security (BIS) released a general order imposing a license \n     requirement on Mayrow General Trading Company and related \n     enterprises in the UAE. This was done after Mayrow was \n     implicated in the transhipment of electronic components \n     and devices capable of being used to construct improvised \n     explosive devices (IED) used in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       Current Controls. The UAE is not subject to any blanket \n     prohibitions regarding dual- use Commerce exports. In \n     general, the UAE faces many of the same license requirements\n\n[[Page S4787]]\n\n     as other non-NATO countries. In the Export Administration \n     Regulations (15 CFR 730 et seq.), the UAE is designated on \n     Country Group D and thus is not eligible for certain license \n     exceptions for items controlled for chemical biological and \n     missile technology reasons. Reexports of U.S. origin goods \n     from one foreign country to another subject to EAR are also \n     controlled, and may require the reexporter regardless to \n     nationality to obtain a license for reexport from BIS.\n       The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control \n     maintains a comprehensive embargo on the export, re-export, \n     sale or supply of any good, service or technology to Iran by \n     persons of U.S. origin, including to persons in third \n     countries with the knowledge that such goods are intended \n     specifically for the supply, transhipment or re-exportation \n     to Iran (Iranian Transaction Regulations, 31 CFR 560.204). \n     Re-exportation of goods, technology and services by non-U.S. \n     persons are also prohibited if undertaken with the knowledge \n     or reason to know that the re-exportation is intended \n     specifically for Iran. (31 CFR 560.205). In addition, BIS \n     also maintains controls on exports and reexports for items on \n     the Commerce Control List (EAR, 15 CFR 746.7).\n       The lack of an effective export control system in the UAE \n     and the use of the emirates' ports as transhipment centers \n     has been a concern to U.S. policymakers. To that end, BIS \n     released an advanced notice of proposed rule-making on \n     February 26, 2007 that would have created a new control \n     designation: ``Country Group C: Destinations of Diversion \n     Control.'' This designation would have established license \n     requirements on exports and re-exports to countries that \n     represent a diversion or transhipment risk for goods subject \n     to the Export Administration Regulations. According to BIS, \n     the Country C designation was designed ``to strengthen the \n     trade compliance and export control system of countries that \n     are transhipment hubs.'' Designation on the Country Group C \n     list could lead to tightened licensing requirements for \n     designees. Although no countries were mentioned in the \n     notice, it was widely considered to be directed at the United \n     Arab Emirates.\n       Perhaps as a response to the possibility of becoming a \n     `Country C' designee, the UAE Federal Council passed the \n     emirate's first ever export control statute in March 2007. \n     That law, also created a control body known as the National \n     Commission for Commodities Subject to Import, Export, and Re-\n     export Controls and that law was signed on August 31, 2007 by \n     Emirates President H.H. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. \n     Reportedly, the law's structure and control lists were \n     modeled after the export control regime of Singapore, \n     another prominent transhipment hub. It remains unclear, \n     however, the extent to which the law is being enforced or \n     whether resources are being devoted to preventing the \n     diversion or illegal transhipment of controlled U.S. goods \n     and technologies.\n       The United States has one export control officer (ECO) on \n     the ground in the UAE to investigate violations of U.S. dual-\n     use export control laws. This officer may be augmented by \n     U.S. Foreign Commercial Officers in conducting end-use check \n     and post-shipment verifications. A recent GAO report \n     mentioned a ``high-rate of unfavorable end-use checks for \n     U.S. items exported to the UAE,'' but the report did not \n     elaborate further.\n       The United States also has engaged in technical cooperation \n     to assist the UAE in developing its export control regime. \n     Officials from BIS and other agencies reportedly traveled to \n     the UAE in June 2007 to discuss the proposed statute. In \n     addition, the Department of State has also provided training \n     through its Export Control and RelatedBorder Security (EXBS) \n     program. This program provides participating countries with \n     licensing and legal regulatory workshops, detection \n     equipment, on-site program and training advisers, and \n     automated licensing programs. Since FY2001, UAE has received \n     between $172-$350 thousand annually in this assistance. For \n     FY2009, State has requested $200 thousand for the UAE under \n     this program.\n\n                                             RECENT U.S. AID TO UAE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         FY2007 and FY2006                                 FY2008       FY2009\n                                             (Combined)                 FY2007             (est.)

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to my \nfriend Rabbi Stephen Baars, of Bethesda, MD, whom I had the honor of \nsponsoring as our guest Chaplain for this morning. Given all that Rabbi \nBaars has done to help others, it was fitting that he was picked to \nlead the Senate in prayer. No tribute would be complete, however, \nwithout giving Senators a greater understanding of his outstanding and \nunique accomplishments.\n  Born and raised in London, Rabbi Baars originally envisioned himself \nworking in business or sales until, at age 19, he went on vacation to \nIsrael and became enamored with Judaism. When he finally returned to \nLondon 6 months later, he had made up his mind to become a rabbi. \nShortly thereafter, he moved back to Jerusalem, where he attended \nrabbinical school for 9 years through Aish HaTorah, a nonprofit network \nof Jewish educational centers.\n  After completing his studies, Rabbi Baars moved to Los Angeles to \nwork for Aish HaTorah. It was in L.A. that he tried a second career as \na stand-up comedian. On the advice of a friend, Rabbi Baars began \ntaking comedy classes at UCLA and performing stand-up in clubs. In \nfact, he is the only rabbi to have performed at the famous L.A. Improv. \nEventually, he would stop performing because he found his spiritual \nwork more rewarding. His comedic skills, however, would play a role in \nhis future work, serving as means for him to get his message across to \naudiences.\n  In 1990, Rabbi Baars moved to the Washington, DC, region and began \nteaching Jewish studies classes throughout the DC area. Some of his \nstudents included Senators, Representatives, and top business leaders. \nIn 1998, he established a Washington, DC, chapter of Aish HaTorah, and \nserved as its executive director. It was there that he established his \nmost ambitious and creative project yet. In 2002, troubled by America's \nhigh divorce rate, Rabbi Baars created BLISS, an innovative, \nnondenominational marriage seminar that mixes humor with advice taken \nfrom the Torah and Talmud. Always an optimist who sees the best in \npeople, Rabbi Baars conducts these seminars and prepares his \nprovocative ``Think Again'' e-mail newsletter with the belief that \nhuman beings all contain the skills and attributes they need to be good \nspouses and parents and that they just need to learn how to reach deep \ninto themselves to utilize these abilities.\n  Rabbi Baars continues to operate BLISS, which has won rave reviews \nfrom many of its participants. Not too long ago, he was kind enough to \ndemonstrate a sample presentation to my staff, who very much enjoyed \nit. He has stated that his goal for BLISS is to help reduce the divorce \nrate in America to the single digits. Some may mock this goal as naive, \nbut as Rabbi Baars says, ``If you pick a goal that's reasonable to \nachieve, you didn't look high enough.''\n  Of course, it should come as no surprise that someone as dedicated to \nhelping families as Rabbi Baars is happily married. He and his wife \nRuth have been together for 16 years and have been blessed with seven \nwonderful children. His wife and family are a constant source of \nstrength and support for Rabbi Baars as he pursues his life's work.\n  Thank you, Rabbi Baars, for all you have done to bring families \ntogether. It was truly an honor to have you pray with us today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4787-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4787-S4788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENDANGERED SPECIES DAY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, 2 years ago I sponsored a resolution \ndesignating the third Friday in May as Endangered Species Day. This \nresolution passed by unanimous consent. There were no objections. The \nresolution was nonpartisan and noncontroversial.\n  The goal of Endangered Species Day was simple: to give students an \nopportunity to learn about the threats facing endangered and threatened \nspecies and the work being done to save them.\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\n  Last year, I introduced a similar resolution. Once again, it passed \nby unanimous consent and was noncontroversial. Over 60 events were held \nin cities across the country. It was used as an educational tool for \nteachers and a day for parents to take their children to the zoo.\n  This year the resolution was offered for a third time. It was thought \nit would pass quickly and without controversy. However, this was not \nthe case. It was held up by an unknown Senator. We could not clear the \nhold, so we were unable to get unanimous consent to pass the \nresolution.\n  Now why is this important? The fact is that 90 events were scheduled \nin 28 States. Twenty events took place in California to commemorate the \nday. In my city of San Francisco, the Golden Gate National Recreation \nArea and the Farralones National Marine Sanctuary led nature hikes in \nsearch of the endangered tidewater goby and explained to children what \nthey can do to save them. The Antelope Valley Conservancy hosted its \nthird annual Endangered Species Day Conference that brought together \nFederal, State, and local leaders to discuss their recovery efforts. \nSimilarly, the San Diego Zoo held public lectures on the affects that \nglobal climate change will have on endangered species.\n  These events still went on as planned. Teachers continued to educate \ntheir students about what we need to do as a Nation and at the local \nlevel to protect our planet and endangered species.\n  We know that global climate change, habitat destruction, and the \nillegal trade and hunting of endangered species carry serious \nconsequences for their future survival. These threats are ongoing. More \neffective wildlife management programs are needed like those to save \nthe California condor, least Bell's vireo songbird and the California \ngrey whale.\n  I am disappointed that this noncontroversial resolution was prevented \nfrom passing. The goals of Endangered Species Day are simple and \nuncontroversial: to build awareness about the threats facing our \nplanet's species. If we don't recognize these threats and act now to \naddress them, our planet's endangered species may soon become our \nplanet's extinct species. I am hopeful that all those who took part in \nlast Friday's events came away knowing that more work needs to be done \nto protect our planet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4788-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING DAVID COOK\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I want to congratulate a Missourian \nwho has accomplished something truly remarkable. We have known our \nshare of champions in Missouri, like the 2006 St. Louis Cardinals and \nthe Big 12 North winning University of Missouri football team. We have \nalso had our share of great entertainers, like Josephine Baker, Scott \nJoplin, and Sheryl Crow. But it is very rare that we have someone who \nis both. Last night, David Cook, a native of Blue Springs, MO, and a \ngraduate of Central Missouri State University, achieved that rare \ncombination when he was crowned winner of ``American Idol.''\n  David's victory was remarkable even by ``American Idol's'' standards. \nThe show has become one of the greatest competitions the country has \never witnessed. It is ubiquitous. It is practically unavoidable. And \nwith the eyes of the whole country watching, David Cook won ``American \nIdol'' by the incredible margin of 12 million votes out of a record \n97.5 million votes cast. His performances, along with those of David \nArchuleta, the other worthy finalist, drew in more viewers than watched \nthe season finale last year.\n  It is telling of the graciousness and humility of this superbly \ntalented young man that David didn't even intend to try out for the \nshow. The only reason he was at the audition was to support his \nbrother. But while entering the contest may have been accidental, it is \nno accident that the country voted him the next ``American Idol.'' His \neasy confidence and visible passion (not to mention that voice), made \nhim the clear choice. He was also one of the nicest contestants ever to \nappear on the show--even notoriously grumpy Simon Cowell said so.\n  So I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to Missouri's next \nsuperstar, David Cook. I wish you the best of luck in what I am sure \nwill be a stellar career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4788-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES S. HOLT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I pay tribute to Dr. James S. Holt, who \npassed away on April 28, 2008.\n  Dr. Holt was known to many Members of this Senate because of the \noutstanding contributions he made to developing sound Federal public \npolicy related to agriculture, immigration, and employment. It was \nthrough his involvement in these issues before Congress that I got to \nknow Jim and gained a tremendous respect for his wealth of knowledge \nand integrity--and especially his unwavering commitment to finding \npolicy solutions that were correct, even if that meant they were also \nuncomfortable or difficult.\n  Jim Holt received his Ph.D. in agricultural economics from the \nPennsylvania State University in 1965, and then served 16 years on the \nPenn State faculty as a professor of agricultural economics and farm \nmanagement. From 1978 until the present, Dr. Holt headed his own \nconsulting firm, as well as serving as senior economist to a \nWashington, DC, law firm, where his responsibilities included research, \npolicy analysis, and government relations in matters related to labor, \nagriculture, immigration and animal welfare.\n  Dr. Holt authored more than 70 publications and served agricultural \nclients in more than 30 States. Jim was a recognized expert with unique \nknowledge of the H-2A program and served as a consultant to national \norganizations such as the National Council of Agricultural Employers \nand the Agriculture Coalition for Immigration Reform during his \ninvolvement in the major immigration and H-2A reform efforts in \nCongress during the past 30 years.\n  I first became aware of Jim's expertise when he helped farmers in my \nown State of Idaho to establish the Snake River Farmers Association an \norganization that helps obtain legally authorized workers through the \nH-2A temporary and seasonal foreign agricultural worker program. \nEarlier this year in Idaho, at a meeting of the association, Jim and I \nteamed up again to address the grave labor situation facing Idaho \nfarmers.\n  I had the pleasure of working with Jim in the development of the \nAgJOBS legislation that I coauthored with Senators Feinstein and \nKennedy. As my colleagues know, this bill has enjoyed broad bipartisan \nsupport and even passed the Senate in 2006. Jim brought his unique \nknowledge to the process of developing this historic legislation that \nbrought together farm worker advocates and growers in an effort to \nprovide a legal and stable agricultural workforce. During the past \ndecade, Dr. Holt testified numerous times in both Chambers of Congress \nbefore the Committees on Agriculture, Judiciary, and Education and \nLabor in an effort to educate members on the importance of reforming \nour farm labor system and the severe economic consequences if we fail \nto do so. When we succeed in enacting the AgJOBS legislation and I am \nconvinced that will ultimately happen--it will be in no small part \nbecause of the immeasurable effort Dr. Holt devoted to that cause over \nthe past decade.\n  On behalf of the policymakers who have worked with Jim Holt and \nbenefited from his wise counsel over the years, I would like to express \nprofound regret at his passing. He will be sorely missed. Let me extend \nmy deepest sympathies to Jim's many friends and colleagues, and to the \nfamily he leaves behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4788-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4788-S4789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING ABIGAIL TAYLOR\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, last fall I came before the Senate to \nask my colleagues to join me in passing the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool \nand Spa Safety Act on behalf of an amazing little girl, Abigail Taylor, \nof Edina MN.\n  And in December of 2007, with Abigail as our inspiration, Congress \nanswered the call. We not only passed the bill, but working with the \nTaylor family and child safety experts, we included provisions in the \nlegislation to create tough new safety standards that require all \nexisting public pools with single drains to install the latest drain \nsafety technology. On December 19,\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\n2007, the President signed the Pool and Spa Safety Act into law.\n  One of the most touching moments in my time in the Senate was that \nday in December when I was able to call Scott Taylor from the Senate \ncloakroom to let him know that the pool safety bill had passed. Abbey \nmay have been a small girl, but there is no doubt she had a super-sized \nimpact on our world.\n  From the beginning, Abbey said she wanted her story told so that it \nwould make a difference. And it did. Although Abbey is no longer with \nus, she will always live on through this important new law that will \nprotect other children so they do not have to suffer what she did. I am \ncertain that this new law would not have passed except for the \ninspiring courage of Abbey Taylor and her family. It was their gift to \nall the children of America.\n  The city of Edina, MN, will designate May 24, 2008, as Abigail Taylor \nDay the day Abigail would have celebrated her seventh birthday.\n  On May 24, I ask that we join in honoring Abbey Taylor, ``Amazing \nAbigail'' as we called her, and keep the entire Taylor family--Scott, \nKatey, Grace, Christina, and Audrey--in our thoughts. We owe them all a \ndebt of gratitude for their courage and their pursuit of a safer \nAmerica for all our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4789-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nENHANCING SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS ACT OF 2008\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, last year, I was proud to cosponsor America \nCOMPETES, legislation which addressed many issues essential to \nmaintaining America's competitive leadership in an increasing \ncompetitive and technological global marketplace. I was heartened by \nthe bipartisan support for that effort. Today, I rise to urge my \ncolleagues to join me and my friend from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, in \nextending that effort, by supporting legislation to enhance education \nefforts in science, technology, engineering and mathematics--the fields \nknown as STEM.\n  Strengthening STEM education is important not only to foster the \ninnovation needed to ensure our nation's future prosperity, but also so \nthat every citizen can benefit from our democracy's ever-increasing \npace of technological and scientific advance. Federal agencies \ncurrently administer more than a hundred different STEM education \nprograms, with over $3,000,000,000 spent annually. Yet there is little \ncoherence among these efforts. There is a clear need for increased \ncoordination of STEM education among states, and between the efforts of \nfederal agencies and of state and local educators.\n  The intent of our legislation, the Enhancing Science, Technology, \nEngineering, and Technology Act of 2008, is to bring coherence and \ncoordination to these efforts, for the benefit of students, science, \nand society. The legislation establishes a STEM Education Committee \nwithin the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy to \ncoordinate the initiatives of the many Federal agencies engaged in STEM \neducation, and to avoid unnecessary duplication among these efforts. It \nconsolidates existing STEM education initiatives within the Department \nof Education under the direction of an Office of STEM Education. It \nauthorizes grant funding for States which choose to work together to \ndevelop rigorous common STEM education standards with more meaningful \nand effective ways of measuring student learning. And it facilitates \nsharing of information about effective educational practices and \ninnovations so that they become widely available to STEM teachers and \neducators. Throughout this legislation, there is emphasis on developing \nstrategies to increase the participation of Americans from \nunderrepresented populations in our national science and engineering \nenterprise, bringing new perspectives for the benefit of all.\n  All of these efforts together will strengthen our efforts to help \nstudents learn, and teachers teach, not just to train the scientists \nand engineers of the future, but to empower all students to become more \nfluent in science and technology, and more capable in math.\n  I am pleased that Mr. Lugar has joined in this effort, as have Mr. \nSanders and Mr. Brown. In the House, Mr. Honda has introduced companion \nlegislation, joined by a bipartisan group totaling 40. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4789-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             CONGRATULATING KATELYN BOWLES AND RILEY MILLER\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

By \ninitiating a business plan between Future Business Leaders of America \nmembers and local government agencies, Ms. Bowles successfully secured \n$200,000 in grants for the project, including $153,000 from the \nKentucky Transportation Cabinet. Additionally, she managed to recruit \nfellow high school students to help with much of the renovation, \nscheduled to be completed next year.\n  In addition to being chosen as a State honoree, Ms. Miller, an eighth \ngrader at Drakes Creek Middle School in Bowling Green, KY, has been \nselected as one of America's top 10 youth volunteers. She is recognized \nfor her outstanding efforts in raising $50,000 for childhood cancer \nresearch over the past 3 years. Having lost two younger brothers to \nleukemia, raising money for cancer research is a particularly important \nmission for Ms. Miller. Last year alone, Ms. Miller managed 29 lemonade \nstands with over 200 volunteers across Bowling Green, raising $19,000. \nThis incredible feat demonstrates her exceptional dedication, \norganizational skill, and enormous capacity for leadership.\n  Ms. Bowles and Ms. Miller have proven themselves to be exemplary \nstudents and volunteers, deserving of the Prudential Spirit of \nCommunity Award. They are an inspiration to the citizens of Kentucky \nand to student leaders and community volunteers everywhere. I look \nforward to seeing all that they will accomplish in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4789-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4789-S4790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING L.

Mr. President. I rise today to tell you about a \nwonderful and humble man, William Peyton Harris of Camden, AL, who died \non February 25, 2008.\n  Mr. Harris was born October 22, 1909. He was a man who loved \nadventure and a man of many talents. He survived the Great Depression \nand worked some weeks for $5 per week. He grew up in a time when good \nmorals, good manners, and discipline were the norm.\n  He was very fortunate to have married Lois Sutherland who was the \nperfect life partner for him. She was with him for 62 years. They had \none son, my friend, Billy, three grandchildren and seven great-\ngrandchildren.\n  At the age of 12, he rode a horse 2\\1/2\\ miles to see the last \nsteamboats loading cotton bales on the Alabama River. Then, in the \nearly 1960s, he salvaged an old steamboat that sank in 1850 and his \ndiscovery revealed lost treasure.\n  He was well known in his later years for his artwork of Old South \nscenes and wildlife, especially the wild turkey, which he also loved to \nhunt. His art studio was in the back of an old country store he owned \nand operated for many years in Possum Bend. The store was known as the \n``Social Center'' of Possum Bend. After renting out the country store, \nhe concentrated more on his art. His popularity grew and in 2001, he \nwas interviewed by CNN and the interview aired on national television. \nBuyers for his art increased and more visitors stopped by his studio. \nNo matter how busy he was, there was always time for his friends and \ncustomers. Good conversation occurred on subjects from politics to \nweather, and from grandchildren to divorces and if you were down and \nout, or had a cold, he would always offer you a little of his special \n``remedy.''\n  As a son of a store owner in a nearby community myself, I remember \nsome of those times very well when as a young boy I observed such \nscenes, but times have changed. We are much ``busier'' now, though not \nnecessarily wiser. The old store stands vacant. Only fond memories \nremain of the life of a wonderful man who was one of the last of a \ngreat generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4790-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO KATHRYN TUCKER WINDHAM\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wish today to honor Kathryn \nTucker Windham, who is celebrating her 90th birthday on June 5, 2008. \nIn Alabama, one of our greatest treasures is our history, which is \noften best learned through the stories told by others. Alabama is lucky \nto have one of the world's best storytellers, Kathryn Tucker Windham, \nwho shares her memories and observances of our State's social history \nin a way unlike any other. Kathryn can tell stories about graveyards \nand ghosts, cooking or recipes and the Gee's Bend quilters that provide \nher listener with a unique view into life in the rural South.\n  Born in Selma, AL, Mrs. Windham grew up in Thomasville, where she \nbegan her writing career at the age of 12 working for the Thomasville \nTimes, a local weekly newspaper. After receiving her bachelor's degree \nfrom Huntingdon College in Montgomery, AL, Kathryn became one of the \nfirst women to cover the police beat for a major daily newspaper in the \nSouth at the Alabama Journal. She also worked as a reporter, \nphotographer, and State editor for the Birmingham News and as a \nreporter, city editor, State editor, and associate editor for the Selma \nTimes-Journal, where she won Associated Press awards for her writing \nand photography.\n  Kathryn is also the author of 24 books and is a playwright. She is \nwidely recognized for storytelling abilities in classrooms, historical \nmeetings, and storytelling events across Alabama. In addition to her \nwriting career, Mrs. Windham worked as the community relations \ncoordinator for the area agency on aging, which serves 12 rural \ncounties in southwest Alabama and promoted statewide war bond drives \nduring World War II.\n  Mrs. Windham's work in radio brought her a new level of notoriety, as \nshe is now a favorite contributor to National Public Radio's program, \n``All Things Considered.'' Her tales about life in the rural South tell \nlisteners more about our region than is widely known and have included \nstories about rumors of people who could kill a rattlesnake by \nspitting, a hailstorm in Thomasville that was supposed to have knocked \nthe eyes out of goldfish in a pond, or the frog houses Alabama children \nmake with cold mud.\n  Quoted in a 1999 article for Current magazine, Windham said of her \nstorytelling, ``It preserves a part of our Southern history maybe, our \nheritage. We need to know where we came from.'' I could not agree with \nher more. Kathryn Tucker Windham will leave an important legacy as a \ntrailblazing female journalist and a chronicler of life in Alabama that \nI greatly admire.\n  I join Kathryn's three children, Kathryn Tabb Windham, Amasa Benjamin \nWindham, Jr., and Helen Ann Windham Hilley, and her two grandsons, \nDavid Wilson Windham and Benjamin Douglas Hilley in wishing Mrs. \nWindham a happy 90th birthday. Mrs. Windham is a special and unique \nlady, and I wish her the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4790-3", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4790-4", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the presiding officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4790-5", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4790-S4791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:13 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhaving proceeded to reconsider the bill (H.R. 2712) to provide for the \ncontinuation of agricultural programs through fiscal year 2012, and for \nother purposes, returned by the President of the United States with his \nobjections, to the House of Representatives, In which I originated, it \nwas resolved that the said bill pass, two-thirds of the House of \nRepresentatives agreeing to pass the same.\n                                  ____\n\n  At 1:40 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S. 2829.

    \n\n[Pages S4795-S4805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 3052. A bill to provide for the transfer of naval vessels to \ncertain foreign recipients; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today, Senator Lugar and I are introducing \nthe Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2008, a bill to permit the transfer of \ncertain U.S. Navy vessels to particular foreign countries. All of the \nproposed ship transfer authorizations have been requested by the U.S. \nNavy, with the approval of the Office of Management and Budget.\n  Pursuant to section 824(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor fiscal year 1994, as amended, 10 U.S.C. 7307(a), a naval vessel \nthat is in excess of 3,000 tons or that is less than 20 years of age \nmay not be disposed of to another nation unless the disposition of that \nvessel is approved by law enacted after August 5, 1974. The bill we \nintroduce today would provide that required approval for six transfers: \na guided missile frigate for Pakistan; two minehunter coastal ships for \nGreece; an oiler for Chile; and two amphibious tank landing ships for \nPeru. These would all be grant transfers under section 516 of the \nForeign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2321j). If any Member of this \nbody has questions or concerns regarding one or more of the proposed \nship transfers, please let us know.\n  The bill also contains provisions that are traditionally included in \nship transfer bills, relating to transfer costs and repair and \nrefurbishment of the ships, and exempting the value of a vessel \ntransferred on a grant basis from the aggregate value of excess defense \narticles in a given fiscal year.\n  The authority provided by this bill would expire 2 years after the \ndate of enactment of the bill.\n  Finally, the Department of Defense has provided the following \ninformation on this bill:\n\n       These proposed transfers would improve the United States' \n     political and military relationships with close allies. They \n     would support strategic engagement goals and regional \n     security cooperation objectives. Active use of former naval \n     vessels by coalition forces in support of regional priorities \n     is more advantageous than retaining vessels in the Navy's \n     inactive fleet and disposing of them by scrapping or another \n     method.\n       The United States would incur no costs in transferring \n     these naval vessels. The recipients would be responsible for \n     all costs associated with the transfers, including \n     maintenance, repairs, training, and fleet turnover costs.\n       This act does not alter the effect of the Toxic Substances \n     Control Act, or any other law, with regard to their \n     applicability to the transfer of ships by the U.S. to foreign \n     countries for military or humanitarian use. The laws and \n     regulations that apply today would apply in the same manner \n     if this section were enacted.\n\n  The Secretary of the Navy, the Honorable Donald C. Winter, has added: \n``Expeditious enactment of the proposal is in the best interests of the \nNavy's Maritime Strategy as it will allow us to strengthen the \ncapabilities of partner nations.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3052\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide grants for eligible entities to provide services to improve \nfinancial literacy among older individuals; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Cantwell, I introduce \na bill to provide grants to Area Agencies on Aging to provide services \nto improve financial literacy among older individuals.\n  A number of trends have occurred over the past few years that make \nfinancial literacy a critical element of retirement security. The \npersonal savings rate in the United States has declined dramatically \nover the last two decades. According to the Commerce Department, the \npersonal savings rate was 0.2 percent in March of this year. This means \nfor every $1,000 of after-tax income, the average person saved only $2.\n  In addition, the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution \nretirement plans has generally placed the burden on employees to \neffectively manage the investment of their pensions.\n  However, many Americans, including older Americans, lack financial \nliteracy skills. In the 2008 Retirement Confidence Survey by EBRI/\nMatthew Greenwald & Associates, 40 percent of retirees surveyed \nreported that they are not knowledgeable about investments and \ninvestment strategies. In addition, a 2003 national survey by AARP of \nconsumers aged 45 and older found that they often lacked knowledge of \nbasic financial and investment terms. For example, only about half of \nrespondents reported knowing that diversification of investments \nreduces risk.\n  The Smith-Cantwell bill will improve older Americans' financial \nliteracy and help them better prepare for and manage their assets in \nretirement. Under the bill, grants will be provided to Area Agencies on \nAging to enable these organizations to provide services to improve \nfinancial literacy among older individuals, especially older women. \nThese services include education, training and other assistance.\n  This bipartisan financial literacy bill will help increase older \nAmericans' financial literacy so they can make more informed and \nprudent investment and retirement planning decisions. And I am pleased \nthat the Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement and the National \nAssociation of Area Agencies on Aging have both endorsed this bill.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important \nbill. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3053\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINANCIAL LITERACY SERVICES.\n\n       Part A of title XI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new section:\n\n\n                     ``financial literacy services\n\n       ``Sec. 1150A.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe rate of the excise tax on certain wooden arrows designed for use by \nchildren; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Smith, I am \nintroducing a bill to exempt wooden practice arrows from the unfair \nimpact of an excise tax designed for much more expensive hunter and \nprofessional arrows. The JOBS Act of 2004 changed the tax on all arrows \nfrom 12.4 percent of an arrow's value to a fixed amount, adjusted for \ninflation, that now stands at 39 cents per arrow. Under the prior law, \nwooden practice arrows that cost 30 cents paid a tax of 3.6 cents. \nUnder the current fixed tax, the same practice arrows are now assessed \na tax of 39 cents per arrow, more than doubling the arrows' cost to the \ncamps, schools and Boy Scouts that use them. The fixed tax is suited to \nthe higher cost of hunter and professional arrows, which sell for up to \n$100 apiece. It is not suited for the less costly practice arrows and \nthese should be made exempt as our legislation would do. The Archery \nTrade Association, which represents arrow makers large and small, \nsupports this bill and agrees that the newer fixed tax unfairly and \nunintentionally hurts the makers and users of wooden practice arrows. \nMoreover, there is a precedent for exempting practice arrows, because \nCode section 4161 exempts youth bows, defined by their draw weight, \nfrom taxes. The Joint Committee on Taxation puts the cost of this \narrows bill as $2 million over 10 years. This seems a small price to \npay to help wooden arrow manufacturers struggling to stay in business \nin Oregon and 9 other States: Washington, Wisconsin, Arizona, \nMinnesota, Indiana, Virginia, New York, Utah and Texas. I urge my \ncolleagues to support reform of the arrow excise tax to help both the \nmakers and users of children's wooden practice arrows.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3055\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF RATE OF EXCISE TAX ON CERTAIN \n                   WOODEN ARROWS DESIGNED FOR USE BY CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 4161(b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to arrows) is amended \n     by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (C) and by \n     inserting after subparagraph (A) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(B) Exemption for certain wooden arrow shafts.--\n     Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any shaft consisting of \n     all natural wood with no laminations or artificial means of \n     enhancing the spine of such shaft (whether sold separately or \n     incorporated as part of a finished or unfinished product) of \n     a type used in the manufacture of any arrow which after its \n     assembly--\n       ``(i) measures \\5/16\\ of an inch or less in diameter, and\n       ``(ii) is not suitable for use with a bow described in \n     paragraph (1)(A).''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to shafts first sold after the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 3057. A bill to amend title 37, Unite States Code, to provide a \nspecial displacement allowance for members of the uniformed services \nwithout dependents, to provide for an annual percentage increase in the \namount of the family separation allowance for members of the uniformed \nservices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor our Nation's veterans \nand their families. As we approach Memorial Day and reflect upon the \ncountless sacrifices of our service men and women, we must also take a \nmoment and remember our military families. These families have \nshouldered the burden of our military engagements, going extended \nperiods, sometimes years, without seeing their spouse, their mother, or \ntheir father. To help alleviate this burden, Senator Feinstein and I \nare introducing the Military Family Separation Benefit Enhancement Act.\n  The Military Family Separation Benefit Enhancement Act would peg the \nFamily Separation Allowance to the Consumer Price Index, allowing for \nincreases in the benefit, providing some additional relief to military \nfamilies separated by deployments. The Family Separation Allowance is a \nbenefit awarded to our military families when a service man or woman \nwith dependents is deployed overseas for 30 days or more. The current \namount of the Family Separation Allowance is only $250, which does not \nhave much purchasing power in these days of high fuel and food prices. \nThe Family Separation Allowance remains at $250, regardless of economic \nconditions.\n  When a service member is deployed, a family experiences new and \nunexpected costs. Oftentimes, the deployed service member is a vital \npart of a household, helping to raise children, perform various \ncommunity services and complete chores around the house. Therefore, \nmany of our military families are forced to seek additional help. \nFamilies must pay for extra child care or for a lawn care service, \ntasks that often are the deployed service member's responsibility.\n  Pegging the Family Separation Allowance to the Consumer Price Index \nwill better reflect the economic burdens our military families \nencounter. The FSA will not be stuck at $250 a month when fuel costs \nare skyrocketing and food prices continue to rise.\n  The Military Family Separation Benefit Enhancement Act also creates a \nnew Family Separation Allowance for those service members who do not \nhave dependents. Just because a service member does not have dependents \ndoes not mean he or she will not need help at home while overseas. Many \nstill need help maintaining their lawn, ensuring the upkeep of their \nhouse, or providing for the storage of their car.\n  Our bill is a means to help our military families and those who \nserve. Deploying overseas is a difficult adjustment for our military \nfamilies and this legislation will provide some relief.\n  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Feinstein and me to pass the \nMilitary Family Separation Benefit Enhancement Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 3059. A bill to permit commercial trucks to use certain highways \nof the Interstate System to provide significant savings in the \ntransportation of goods throughout the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Commercial \nTruck Fuel Savings Demonstration Act of 2008, which would help address \nthe growing crisis of energy costs for our Nation's trucking industry.\n  Our Nation faces record high energy prices, affecting almost every \naspect of daily life. The rapidly growing price of diesel is putting an \nincreasing strain on our trucking industry. The U.S. average on diesel \nprices reached $3.50 a gallon in February 2008 and prices have not gone \nbelow this amount since that time. The average price of diesel this \nweek is $4.50. Escalating fuel costs are especially devastating in \nstates where the cost of diesel fuel is exacerbated by Federal weight \nlimit restrictions that prohibit trucks that carry more than 80,000 \npounds from traveling on the Federal interstate system.\n  For example, under current law, trucks weighing 100,000 pounds are \nallowed to travel on the portion of Interstate 95 designated as the \nMaine Turnpike, which runs from Maine's border with New Hampshire to \nAugusta, our capital city. At Augusta, the State Turnpike designation \nends, but I-95 proceeds another 200 miles north to Houlton. At Augusta, \nhowever, heavy trucks must exit the modern four-lane, limited-access \nhighway and are forced\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\nonto smaller, two-lane secondary roads that pass through cities, towns, \nand villages.\n  The Commercial Truck Fuel Savings Demonstration Act of 2008, which I \nam introducing today, will provide immediate savings to our truckers. \nMy bill creates a 2-year year pilot program that would permit trucks \ncarrying up to 100,000 pounds to travel on the Federal interstate \nsystem whenever diesel prices are at or above $3.50 a gallon. This \nlegislation does not mandate that each state participate in the pilot \nprogram, but gives each state the opportunity, during this time of high \nfuel costs, to offer relief to their trucking industries.\n  Permitting trucks to carry up to 100,000 pounds on Federal highways \nwould lessen the fuel cost burden on truckers in three ways: First, \nraising the weight limit would allow trucking companies to put more \ncargo in each truck, thereby reducing the numbers of trucks needed to \ntransport goods: Second, trucks carrying up to 100,000 pounds would no \nlonger need to move off the main Federal highways where trucks are \nlimited at 80,000 pounds and take less direct routes on local roads \nrequiring considerably more diesel fuel and extended periods of idling \nduring each trip; and third, trucks traveling on the interstate system \nwould save on fuel costs due to the much superior road design of the \ninterstate system as compared to the rural and urban state road \nsystems.\n  I recently met with Kurt Babineau, a small business owner and second \ngeneration logger and trucker from my State who has been struggling \nwith the increasing costs of running his operation. Mr. Babineau's \noperation works just east of central Maine on the outskirts of the town \nof Mattawamkeag. All of the pulpwood his business produces, which is \nroughly 50 percent of his total harvest, is transported to Verso Paper, \nwhich is located in the southwestern part of the State, in the town of \nJay. The distance his trucks must travel is 165 miles and a round trip \ntakes approximately 8 hours to complete.\n  If Mr. Babineau's trucks were permitted to use Interstate 95, this \nwould reduce the distance his trucks must travel to approximately 100 \nmiles and would shave one hour off the time it takes his trucks to make \ntheir delivery to Verso Paper, saving his operation both time and fuel.\n  The results of less fuel consumption from decreased distance traveled \nwould create significant savings for Mr. Babineau's operation. His \ntrucks average 4 miles to the gallon, which calculates to approximately \n11.8 gallons an hour. Permitting trucks to travel on Interstate 95 \nwould save Mr. Babineau 118 gallons of fuel each week. The current cost \nof diesel fuel in his area is approximately $4.42 per gallon, and \ntherefore, combined with time saved on wages for drivers, his savings \nwould estimate to nearly $697 a week.\n  If you applied this savings to one year of trucking for Mr. \nBabineau's company alone, it would save his operation over $33,400 a \nyear and 5,664 gallons of fuel over the same period. These savings are \nnot only beneficial to Mr. Babineau's business, his employees, and the \nconsumer, but also to our Nation, as we look for ways to decrease on \nour overall fuel consumption.\n  Trucking is the cornerstone of our economy as most of our goods are \ntransported by trucks at some point in the supply chain. Some \nindependent truckers in my state already have been forced out of \nbusiness due to rising fuel costs and more businesses are facing a \nsimilar fate if Congress does not act soon to address our growing \nenergy crisis. The Commercial Truck Fuel Savings Demonstration Act \noffers an immediate and cost effective way to help our Nation's \nstruggling trucking industry. I am pleased that Senator Snowe has \njoined me as an original cosponsor of the bill, and I urge all my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleague from \nMaine, Senator Collins, in introducing legislation critical to \nrectifying not only a serious impediment to the movement of \ninternational commerce, but more importantly, will improve safety on \nour secondary roads and sustain a commercial trucking industry \nsuffering from an astonishing rise in diesel prices.\n  There are some of our colleagues who believe that expanding upon the \ncurrent Federal truck weight limitation of 80,000 pounds is dangerous, \ncompromising the safety of passenger vehicles driver who may be faced \nwith a truck weighing as much as 143,000 pounds, the limit on \nInterstates in Massachusetts and New York. I certainly concur that \nsafety of such drivers is very important, and I have the record to back \nthat up. Yet, in some areas the imposition of this outdated patchwork \nof weight limits puts the safety of pedestrians and the motor carrier \noperators themselves at risk.\n  Take the situation we face in Maine, where we currently have a \nlimited exemption along the southern portion of the Maine turnpike. \nMany trucks traveling to or from the Canadian border or into upstate \nMaine are not able to travel on our Interstates as a result of the \n80,000 pound weight limit. This forces many of them onto secondary \nroads, many of which are two-lane roads running through small towns and \nvillages in Maine. Tanker trucks carrying fuel teeter past elementary \nschools, libraries, and weaving through traffic to reach locations like \nour Air National Guard station. Not only is that an inefficient method \nof bringing necessary fuel to Guardsmen that provide our national \nsecurity, but imagine if you will one of those tanker trucks rupturing \non Main Street, potentially causing serious damage to property, causing \ntraffic chaos, and most importantly, killing or injuring drivers and \npedestrians.\n  This is not a far-fetched scenario. In fact, two pedestrians were \nkilled last year in Maine as a result of overweight trucks on local \nroadways, one tragic instance occurring within sight of the nearby \nInterstate. So I ask you, is the so-called safety argument truly a \nlegitimate reason for opposition as my constituents and many others \nacross small American communities are taking their lives in their hands \nwhen merely crossing Main Street?\n  As laid out in this legislation, it is obvious Senator Collins has a \nclear understanding of this safety issue, crafting a strategy that \nquantifies any potential risks to safety, and places the gathering of \nthat data in the hands of the nonpartisan Government Accountability \nOffice. It is my expectation that, like earlier studies that have \nindicated traffic fatalities involving trucks weighing 100,000 pounds \nare ten times greater on secondary roads than on exempted Interstates, \nthe data collected by the GAO will point the way to a permanent \nsolution that will enable America to harmonize the myriad weight limits \nacross our Nation's highways.\n  This legislation also exhibits a true sensitivity to one of the \ngreatest problems facing the domestic trucking industry, particularly \nour smaller operators: the cost of fuel. This is a problem that cannot \nbe ignored. The price of diesel nationally as I make this statement is \nfour dollars and 49 cents. One year ago today, it was two dollars and \n82 cents! We must act.\n  As a result of this legislation, motor carriers will be able to \nexpand their ability to carry loads when the price of diesel surpasses \nthree dollars and fifty cents per gallon. While this will only affect \nsome states that face a federal interstate system without a weight \nexemption, it will greatly facilitate the movement of goods across this \ncountry. Given that volume of goods projected to enter this country is \nforecast to increase by over 100 percent, we need a forward-thinking, \nintermodal plan in place. Having a greater synergy in terms of our \nweight limits will not only assist our Nation's struggling trucking \nindustry, but will simplify the flow of goods moving across our country \nand augment our Nation's economy.\n  I would like to thank Senator Collins for her steadfast efforts and \ninnovative thinking on this legislation as, side-by-side, we will \ncontinue to seek a resolution to this issue, which, to my eyes, is a \nsimple matter of fairness.\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 3061. A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2008 \nthrough 2011 for the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, to \nenhance measures to combat trafficking in persons, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the William \nWilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\nReauthorization Act of 2008. The Trafficking Victims Protection Act was \nauthored 8 years ago by Senator Brownback and the late Senator \nWellstone, and since then, through two re-authorizations, has been a \ntremendous asset in preventing and prosecuting human trafficking \ncrimes. Today, I am honored to be able to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize these valuable programs with my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Brownback.\n  Human trafficking is a major problem worldwide and the challenges \nremain great. According to the most recent State Department report, \nroughly 800,000 individuals are trafficked each year, the overwhelming \nmajority of them women and children. The FBI estimates approximately \n$9.5 billion is generated annually for organized crime from trafficking \nin persons. The International Labor Organization estimates that, at \npresent, 2.4 million persons have been trafficked into situations of \nforced labor.\n  These victims are trafficked in a variety of ways. Sometimes they are \nkidnapped outright, but many times they are lured with dubious job \noffers, or false marriage opportunities. The traffickers capitalize on \nthe victims' desire to seek a better life, and trap them with lifetime \ndebt bondages that degrade and destroy their lives.\n  Since 2000, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act has provided us \neffective tools, and in this reauthorization, our aim is to take the \nsuccesses and lessons of eight years of progress and expand our \nabilities to combat human trafficking. In Title I, the legislation \nfocuses on combating human trafficking internationally by broadening \nthe U.S. interagency task force charged with monitoring and combating \ntrafficking, and increasing the authority to the State Department \nOffice to Monitor and Combat Trafficking. Because of the difficulty in \naccurately understanding the full scope of the problem globally, we \nalso include provisions to coordinate our multiple federal databases, \nand set a reporting requirement to address forced labor and child \nlabor.\n  Today's reauthorization bill also expands our ability to combat \ntrafficking in the United States. We've provided for certain \nimprovements to the T-visa program, which protects trafficking victims \nand their families from retaliation, so that we can have their help in \nbringing traffickers to justice, without the victim fearing harm to \nthemselves or their loved ones. We also expand authority for U.S. \nGovernment programs to help those who have been trafficked, and require \na study to outline any additional gaps in assistance that may exist. \nFinally, we establish some powerful new legal tools, including \nincreasing the jurisdiction of the courts, enhancing penalties for \ntrafficking offenses, punishing those who profit from trafficked labor \nand ensuring restitution of forfeited assets to victims.\n  Human trafficking is a daunting and critical global issue. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this reauthorization and work with Senator \nBrownback and me to pass it in the Senate as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section \nsummary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\nWilliam Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \n                                of 2008\n\n\n                     Section-by-Section Description\n\n     Section 1.

Interagency task force to monitor and combat \n         trafficking\n       Section 101 adds the Secretary of Education to the existing \n     interagency task force to monitor and combat trafficking.\n     Section 102. Office to monitor and combat trafficking\n       Section 102 provides for several amendments to Section \n     105(b) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) \n     related to the State Department's Office to Monitor and \n     Combat Trafficking (the TIP Office) including mandating the \n     office, conferring additional responsibility to the Director \n     to work on public-private partnerships to combat trafficking \n     and providing that the Director of the office have the \n     ability to review and concur in State Department anti-\n     trafficking programs that are not managed by the Office to \n     Monitor and Combat Trafficking (TIP Office).\n     Section 103. Assistance for victims of trafficking in other \n         countries\n       Section 103 amends section 107(a) of the TVPA, including \n     ensuring that programs take into account the transnational \n     aspects of trafficking, support increased protection for \n     refugees, internally displaced persons and trafficked \n     children and emphasize cooperative, regional efforts.\n     Section 104. Increasing effectiveness of anti-trafficking \n         programs\n       Section 104 creates a new section to the TVPA to increase \n     the effectiveness of anti-trafficking programs by providing \n     that solicitation of grants be made publicly available and \n     awarded by a transparent process with a review panel of \n     Federal and private sector experts, when appropriate. The \n     provision provides a mandated evaluation system for anti-\n     trafficking programs on a program-by-program basis. It \n     requires that priorities and country assessments contained in \n     the most recent annual Report on Human Trafficking shall \n     guide grant priorities. It provides that not more than 5 \n     percent of the appropriations may be used for evaluations of \n     specific programs or for evaluations of emerging problems or \n     trends in the field of human trafficking.\n     Section 105. Minimum standards for the elimination of \n         trafficking\n       Section 105 amends section 108(b) of the TVPA by clarifying \n     that in evaluating whether a country's anti-trafficking \n     efforts convictions of principal actors that result in \n     suspended or significantly reduced sentences shall be \n     considered on a case-by-case basis.\n     Section 106. Actions against governments failing to meet \n         minimum standards\n       Section 106 amends Section 110 of the TVPA by providing \n     that if a country has been on the special watch list for \n     three consecutive years, such country shall be deemed to be \n     not making significant efforts to combat trafficking and \n     shall be included in the list of countries described in \n     paragraph (1)(C). The subsection includes a Presidential \n     waiver for up to one year if it would promote the purposes of \n     the act or is in the national interest of the United States.\n     Section 107. Research on domestic and international \n         trafficking in persons\n       Section 107 amends section 112A of the TVPA by requiring \n     the establishment and maintenance of an integrated database \n     within the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center, details \n     the purposes of the database, and authorizes $3 million \n     annually to the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center to \n     carry out these activities.\n     Section 108. Presidential award for extraordinary efforts to \n         combat trafficking in persons\n       Section 108 authorizes the President to establish a ``Paul \n     D. Wellstone Presidential Award for Extraordinary Efforts to \n     Combat Trafficking in Persons'' for persons who provided \n     extraordinary service in efforts to combat trafficking in \n     persons.\n     Section 109. Report on activities of the department of labor \n         to monitor and combat forced labor and child labor\n       Section 109 requires that the Secretary of Labor provide a \n     final report that describes the implementation of section 105 \n     of the TVPRA of 2005, including a list of imported goods made \n     with forced and/or child labor.\n\n    TITLE II--COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n Subtitle A--Ensuring Availability of Possible Witnesses and Informants\n\n     Section 201. Protecting trafficking victims against \n         retaliation\n       Subsection (a) of Section 201 amends section 101(1)(15)(T) \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to provide for \n     certain changes to the T visa for trafficking victims. \n     Paragraph (1) allows persons who are brought into the \n     country,for investigations or as witnesses to apply for such \n     a visa. It also allows a T visa for persons who are not able \n     to assist law enforcement because of the physical or \n     psychological trauma; it also clarifies the existing language \n     in the T Visa authorization and eliminates the ``unusual and \n     severe harm'' standard.\n       Paragraph (2) allows parents and siblings who are in danger \n     of retaliation to join the trafficking victims safely in the \n     United States. Subsection (b) modifies certain requirements \n     of the T Visa contained in section 214(o) of the INA, \n     including allowing 2 the extension of time for a T Visa in \n     exceptional circumstances and providing that the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security may look at certain security and \n     other conditions in the applicant's home country in making \n     the determination that extreme hardship exists.\n       Subsection (d) provides for certain changes to section \n     245(1) of the INA relating to adjustment of status of T visa \n     holders, including providing that the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security may waive the restriction on disqualification for \n     good moral character for T visa holders applying for \n     permanent residence alien status if the actions that would \n     have led to the disqualification are caused by or incident to \n     the trafficking.\n     Section 202. Information for work-based non-immigrants on \n         legal rights and resources\n       Section 202 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     create an information pamphlet for work-based non-immigrant \n     visa applications. The pamphlet will detail the illegality of \n     human trafficking and reiterate worker rights and information \n     for related services.\n     Section 203. Domestic worker protections\n       Section 203 sets forth new protections for trafficked \n     domestic household workers and preventative measures to be \n     followed by the State Department. Subsection (b) states that\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\n     the Secretary of State shall develop an information pamphlet \n     for A-3 and G5 visa applicants and describes the required \n     information to be included in the pamphlets. It mandates that \n     the pamphlets be translated into at least ten languages and \n     mailed to each A-3 or G-5 visa applicant in his/her primary \n     language.\n       Subsection (c) provides the circumstances in which the \n     Secretary may suspend a visa or renew a visa, as well as when \n     the Secretary is not permitted to issue a visa.\n       Subsection (d) provides the protections and remedies for A-\n     3 and G-5 visa holders working in the United States.\n       Subsection (e) ensures protection from removal for visa \n     holders wanting to file a complaint regarding a violation of \n     contract or some Federal, State, or local law to allow time \n     sufficient to participate fully in all legal proceedings.\n       Subsection (f) requires that every two years the Secretary \n     of State shall submit a report on the implementation of this \n     section and describes the necessary content of the report.\n     Section 204. Relief for certain victims pending actions on \n         petitions and applications for relief\n       Section 204 allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to \n     stay the removal of an individual which has made a prima case \n     for approval of a T Visa.\n     Section 205. Expansion of authority to permit continued \n         presence in the United States\n       Section 205 expands the authority to permit the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security to permit continued presence of \n     trafficking victims, including if the alien has filed a civil \n     action against the trafficking perpetrators (unless the alien \n     is not showing due diligence in pursuing his civil action). \n     It also allows for parole into the United States of certain \n     relatives of trafficking victims with several limitations.\n     Section 206. Implementation of trafficking victims protection \n         reauthorization act of 2005\n       Section 206 amends the Immigration and Nationality act and \n     requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue interim \n     regulations on the adjustment of status to permanent \n     residence for T Visa holders.\n\n             Subtitle B--Assistance for Trafficking Victims\n\n     Section 211. Assistance for certain nonimmigrant status \n         applicants\n       Section 211 clarifies that T-visa applicants have access to \n     certain public benefits.\n     Section 212. Interim assistance for child victims of \n         trafficking\n       Subsection (a) of Section 212 provides that if credible \n     information is presented that a child has been a trafficking \n     victim, the Secretary of HHS may provide interim assistance \n     to the child for up to 90 days. Subsection (a) also provides \n     that any federal official must notify HHS within 48 hours of \n     coming into contact with such child and that State or local \n     officials must notify HHS within 48 hours of coming into \n     contact with such a child. Long term assistance \n     determinations are to be made by the Secretary of HHS, the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n       Subsection (b) provides for education on identification of \n     trafficking victims.\n     Section 213. Ensuring assistance for all victims of \n         trafficking in persons\n       Subsection (a) of Section 213 amends the TVPA of 2000 to \n     specifically authorize an assistance program for victims of \n     severe forms of trafficking of persons and provides for \n     establishing a system that refers such victims to existing \n     programs at the Department of Health and Human Services and \n     the Department of Justice.\n       Subsection (b) requires a study on the gaps for assistance \n     to women in prostitution victimized under chapter 117 of \n     title 18.\n\n       Subtitle C--Penalties Against Traffickers and Other Crimes\n\n     Section 221. Restitution of forfeited assets; enhancement of \n         civil action\n       Section 221 amends chapter 77 of title 18 by allowing the \n     Attorney General in a prosecution brought under Federal law \n     to grant restoration or remission of property to victims of \n     severe forms of trafficking.\n     Section 222. Enhancing trafficking offenses\n       Section 222 amends title 18 of the U.S. Code to enhance \n     existing penalties for trafficking offenses. Subsection (a) \n     permits pretrial detention for trafficking offenders. \n     Subsection (b) ensures that obstruction or attempts to \n     obstruct or in any way interfere with enforcement of the \n     trafficking statutes is a separate offense. Subsection (c) \n     ensures that trafficking conspirators are punished as \n     though they had completed a violation. Subsection (d) \n     amends the trafficking statutes to hold accountable those \n     who knowingly or in reckless disregard financially benefit \n     from participation in a trafficking venture; it also \n     amends the forced labor and sex trafficking statutes to \n     clarify the definition of ``harm'' and ``abuse of the law \n     or legal process.'' Subsection (e) tightens the \n     immigration law to ensure that committing or conspiring to \n     commit trafficking offenses are grounds of inadmissibility \n     and removability. The provision also creates a new crime \n     of sex tourism that punishes individuals who go abroad for \n     sex tourism and sex tour operators that benefit from such \n     promoting such travel.\n     Section 223. Jurisdiction in certain trafficking offenses\n       Section 223 amends chapter 77 of title 18 by increasing the \n     jurisdiction of the courts to include any trafficking case \n     found in or brought into the United States, even if the \n     conduct occurred in a different country, as long as no more \n     than ten years have passed.\n\n         Subtitle D--Activities of the United States Government\n\n     Section 231. Annual report by the Attorney General\n       Section 231 requires that the annual report by the Attorney \n     General include activities by the Department of Defense to \n     combat trafficking in persons, actions taken to enforce \n     policies relating to contractors and their employees, actions \n     by the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive restrictions \n     on section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930, and prohibitions on \n     procurement of items or services produced by slave labor.\n     Section 232. Defense Contract Audit Agency audit\n       Section 232 requires the Defense Contract Audit Agency to \n     conduct an audit of all Department of Defense contractors and \n     subcontractors where there is substantial evidence to suggest \n     trafficking in persons, notify congress of the findings of \n     each audit, and certify that the contractor is no longer \n     engaging in such activities.\n     Section 233. Senior policy operating group\n       Section 233 amends section 206 of the TVPRA of 2005 to \n     ensure that the Senior Policy Operating Group reviews all \n     anti-trafficking programs.\n     Section 234. Preventing United States travel by traffickers\n       Section 234 provides that the Secretary of State may \n     prohibit the entry into the United States of traffickers.\n     Section 235. Enhancing efforts to combat the trafficking of \n         children\n       Section 235 sets forth comprehensive protections for child \n     victims of trafficking and other unaccompanied alien \n     children, including the following the provisions: (1) Care \n     and Custody of Unaccompanied Children: Care and custody of \n     all unaccompanied alien children shall be the responsibility \n     of Health and Human Services; (2) Transfer of Custody: \n     Consistent with the Homeland Security Act of 2002, requires \n     all departments or agencies of the federal government to \n     notify the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \n     within 48 hours. The custody of most unaccompanied alien \n     children encountered by immigration authorities must be \n     transferred to the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     within 72 hours with special rules for children who have \n     committed crimes or threaten national security; (3) Special \n     Repatriation Procedures and Safeguards for Mexican and \n     Canadian Nationals: Permits the Department of Homeland \n     Security to repatriate promptly certain unaccompanied alien \n     children from Canada or Mexico apprehended provided that \n     those Canadian and Mexican unaccompanied alien children who \n     are victims of severe forms of trafficking or have a fear of \n     persecution; (4) Safe and Secure Placements: An unaccompanied \n     alien child in the custody of HHS shall be placed in the \n     least restrictive setting that is in the best interests of \n     the child. Placement of child trafficking victims may include \n     placement with competent adult victims of the same \n     trafficking scheme in order to ensure continuity of support; \n     (5) Standards for Placement: An unaccompanied child may not \n     be placed with a person or entity unless HHS makes a \n     determination that the proposed custodian is capable of \n     providing for the child; (5) Representation: All \n     unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in \n     government custody, must have competent counsel to represent \n     them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from \n     mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking; (6) Special \n     Immigrant Juvenile Status: Revises procedures for obtaining \n     special immigrant juvenile status provided for under the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act.\n     Section 236. Temporary increase in fee for certain consular \n         services\n       Section 236 allows the Secretary of State to increase the \n     fee for processing machine readable non-immigrant visas by \n     two dollars. This increase shall be deposited in the Treasury \n     and will terminate two years following the initial increase.\n\n               TITLE III--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS\n\n       This title and the sections within it provide authorization \n     of appropriations for various trafficking programs.\n\n         TITLE IV--CHILD SOLDIERS PREVENTION AND ACCOUNTABILITY\n\n     Section 401. Short title\n       Section 401 provides that this title may be referred to as \n     the ``Child Soldier Prevention and Accountability Act of \n     2008''.\n     Section 402. Definitions\n       Section 402 provides for various definitions used \n     throughout the Act.\n     Section 403. Prohibition\n       Subsection (a) of Section 403 prohibits military \n     assistance, the transfer of excess defense articles, or \n     licenses for direct sales of military equipment to \n     governments that the State Department's annual human rights \n     report indicates have governmental armed forces or \n     government-supported armed forces, including paramilitaries, \n     militias or civil defense forces that recruit or use child \n     soldiers.\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\n       Subsection (b) provides that the Secretary of State \n     formally notify any government of such prohibitions.\n       Subsection (c) provides that the President may waive the \n     restriction in subsection (a) if doing so is in the national \n     interest of the United States. The President must publish \n     each waiver granted, and its justification, within 45 \n     calendar days.\n       Subsection (d) provides that the President may reinstate \n     assistance which is restricted if the Government has \n     implemented measures to come into compliance with this title \n     and has implemented policies to prohibit and prevent future \n     governmentsupported use of child soldiers.\n       Subsection (e) provides that notwithstanding the \n     restriction in subsection (a), assistance for international \n     military education and training and nonlethal supplies may be \n     provided for up to two years s/he certifies that the \n     government of that country is taking steps to implement \n     effective measures to demobilize child soldiers and the \n     assistance is provided to directly support \n     professionalization of the military.\n     Section 404.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to modify \ncertain provisions relating to oil shale leasing; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this weekend is the unofficial beginning \nof summer and the start of the summer driving season. This is as oil \nhits $135 per barrel and more and more cities and towns all over the \ncountry are seeing gasoline prices over $4 per gallon. In the face of \nthese challenges to the American economy and consumer, we have failed \nto take the steps that are necessary to address this problem either in \nthe short term or the long term.\n  Last week, the House and Senate voted to suspend filling the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. I voted against that effort as many on the \nother side hailed it as a major move that would help to alleviate \n``pain at the pump.'' Instead, oil prices have continued to increase \nevery day since that measure passed. I think this demonstrates that \nadding a mere 70,000 barrels a day to the marketplace means little when \nwe consume 21 million barrels of oil per day in this country alone.\n  Oil shale can be a major part of addressing rising oil prices by \npotentially bringing over 1 trillion barrels of oil to the domestic \nmarket. There are enormous oil shale reserves located in Colorado, \nWyoming, and Utah. Oil shale is energy we can develop here at home to \nlower gas prices, increase our Nation's security, and improve our \nbalance of trade by keeping money and investment in the United States \nrather than sending hundreds of billions of dollars overseas--\nfrequently to governments, I might add, that are unstable or whose \ninterests are counter to those of this country. It will also bring in \nbillions of dollars to the States and the Federal Treasury in the form \nof future royalties.\n  This bill is necessary because the fiscal year 2008 Interior, \nEnvironment, and Related Agencies bill has language prohibiting funds \nfrom being used by the Department of the Interior to prepare final \nregulations and will set forth the requirements for a commercial \nleasing program for oil shale resources or to conduct an oil shale \nlease sale as provided in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Without \nremoving this moratorium--and it is a moratorium--companies will not \nknow the rules of the road so they can make investment decisions, \nthings such as what the length of the oil shale leases will be, the \nroyalty rate, and reclamation and bonding requirements.\n  I have a letter from the Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals \nat the Department of the Interior, Stephen Allred, dated May 14 in \nsupport of removing the prohibition contained in last year's Interior \nbill on the Department of the Interior issuing oil shale regulations. I \nask unanimous consent at this time to have the letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     Ranking Minority, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and \n         Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard: Section 433 of the FY 2008 Interior, \n     Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act prohibits \n     our Department from issuing regulations related to oil shale \n     leasing. This letter is to communicate our opposition to this \n     prohibition and to urge its removal, so that the \n     Administration can move forward and issue regulations.\n       As you know, in Section 369 of the Energy Policy Act of \n     2005, the Congress directed the Department to take the steps \n     necessary to meet future requests for a commercial oil shale \n     leasing program on Federal lands. In 2007, the Bureau of Land \n     Management authorized six oil shale research, development, \n     and demonstration projects on public lands in northwestern \n     Colorado and northeastern Utah. These projects provide \n     industry access to oil shale resources to further their \n     development of oil shale technologies.\n       This type of research will require significant private \n     capital, with an uncertain return on this investment in the \n     immediate future. Part of the wisdom of Section 369 is that \n     it envisions the private sector will lead this investment--\n     not the American taxpayer. However, for these projects to be \n     successful, companies will require a level playing field and \n     a clear set of regulations or ``rules of the road.'' \n     Developing a regulatory framework now will aid in \n     facilitating a producing program in the future should oil \n     shale development prove to be economic. Impeding the Federal \n     Government's efforts at this stage could have serious \n     consequences.\n       Moving forward with these regulations does not mean \n     commercial oil shale production will take place immediately. \n     To the contrary, with thoughtfully developed regulations, \n     thoroughly vetted through a public process, we have only set \n     the groundwork for the future commercial development of this \n     resource in an environmentally sound manner. With the \n     administrative and regulatory certainty that regulations will \n     provide, energy companies will be encouraged to commit the \n     financial resources needed to fund their RD projects, and \n     the development of viable technology will continue to \n     advance. Actual commercial development and production will be \n     dependent upon the results of the RD efforts and more site-\n     specific environmental evaluations.\n       Consistent with the language in the Consolidated \n     Appropriations Act for FY 2008, the BLM is not spending FY \n     2008 funds to develop and publish final oil shale \n     regulations; however, the agency is moving forward in a \n     thoughtful, deliberative manner to publish proposed \n     regulations on oil shale. These proposed regulations will \n     reflect input already received from our partners in the \n     states. The publication of the draft regulations will provide \n     an opportunity for the public and interested parties to \n     remain engaged on this important issue.\n       Given the Nation's projected future energy needs, it is \n     incumbent on us to promote the development of oil shale for \n     our national security and energy security. Declining domestic \n     oil production and rising U.S. demand for oil increase the \n     Nation's dependence on imports, and leave us vulnerable to \n     rising energy costs. Households across America are struggling \n     to deal with these additional costs and experts predict that \n     the trend is\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\n     set to continue. In looking beyond traditional energy \n     resources to unconventional and alternative fuels, the \n     Department of the Interior has a key role to play in the \n     development of oil shale.\n       I ask for your support for removal of the prohibition on \n     issuing oil shale regulations in order that we may move \n     forward with the public process of finalizing regulations for \n     commercial oil shale development on Federal lands. I commit \n     to working closely with the Congress throughout the \n     development of this program.\n       A similar letter has been sent to the Honorable Dianne \n     Feinstein, Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, \n     and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, United \n     States Senate, the Honorable Norman D. Dicks, Chairman, \n     Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, \n     Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives, and \n     the Honorable Todd Tiahrt, Ranking Minority Member, \n     Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, \n     Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            C. Stephen Allred,\n\n                                              Assistant Secretary,\n                                     Land and Minerals Management.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, Allred points out that issuing these \nregulations is critical to providing regulatory certainty for these oil \nshale projects to go forward. With the regulatory certainty these \nregulations will provide, companies will have an incentive to commit \nthe resources necessary to develop this technology.\n  I also have a letter from Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne \ndated December 12, 2007, objecting to the inclusion of this moratorium \nthat was in the House version of the fiscal year 2008 Interior \nappropriations. I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 12, 2007.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment and \n         Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard: As the House and Senate consider the \n     Fiscal Year 2008 Interior, Environment and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations bill, I would like to voice my concern \n     regarding efforts to prohibit our Department from issuing \n     regulations related to oil shale leasing.\n       Section 606 of the House-passed Interior appropriations \n     bill would prohibit the use of funds to prepare or publish \n     final regulations regarding a commercial leasing program for \n     oil shale resources on public lands. The Energy Policy Act of \n     2005 (EPAct) was enacted with broad bipartisan support. The \n     EPAct included substantive and significant authorities for \n     the development of alternative and emerging energy sources.\n       Oil shale is one important potential energy source. The \n     United States holds significant oil shale resources, the \n     largest known concentration of oil shale in the world, and \n     the energy equivalent of 2.6 trillion barrels of oil. Even if \n     only a portion were recoverable, that source could be \n     important in the future as energy demands increase worldwide \n     and the competition for energy resources increases.\n       The Energy Policy Act sets the timeframe for program \n     development, including the completion of final regulations. \n     The Department must be able to prepare final regulations in \n     FY 2008 in order to meet the statutorily-imposed schedule.\n       The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued a draft \n     Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in August 2007. The \n     final EIS is scheduled for release in May 2008 and the \n     effective date of the final rule is anticipated in November \n     2008. The final regulations will consider all pertinent \n     components of the final EIS. Throughout this process BLM will \n     seek public input and work closely with the States and other \n     stakeholders to ensure that concerns are adequately \n     addressed. The Department is willing to consider an extended \n     comment period after the publication of the draft regulations \n     in order to assure that all of the stakeholders have adequate \n     time and opportunity to review and comment before publication \n     of the final regulations.\n       The successful development of economically viable and \n     environmentally responsible oil shale extraction technology \n     requires significant capital investments and substantial \n     commitments of time and expertise by those undertaking this \n     important research. Our Nation relies on private investment \n     to develop new energy technologies such as this one. Even \n     though commercial leasing is not anticipated until after \n     2010, it is vitally important that private investors know \n     what will be expected of them regarding the development of \n     this resource. The regulations that Section 606 would \n     disallow represent the critical ``rules of the road'' upon \n     which private investors will rely in determining whether to \n     make future financial commitments. Accordingly, any delay or \n     failure to publish these regulations in a timely manner is \n     likely to discourage continued private investment in these \n     vital research and development efforts.\n       The Administration opposes the House provision that would \n     prohibit the Department from completing its oil shale \n     regulations. I would urge the Congress to let the \n     administrative process work. It is premature to impose \n     restrictions on the development of oil shale regulations \n     before the public has had an opportunity to provide input.\n       Identical letters are being sent to Congressman Norm Dicks, \n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related \n     Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, House of \n     Representatives; Congressman Todd Tiahrt, Subcommittee on \n     Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies, Committee on \n     Appropriations, House of Representatives; and Senator Dianne \n     Feinstein, Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, \n     and Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, United \n     States Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dirk Kempthorne.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, Secretary Kempthorne also indicates the \ncritical nature of allowing the Department to issue these regulations \nin order to attract the private investment necessary to develop the oil \nshale resource.\n  Let me emphasize that this is not an environmental issue. No \ncommercial lease sales are permitted under the provisions of this bill. \nIn fact, commercial oil shale leases are banned for 2\\1/2\\ years \nbecause the technology for oil shale extraction is not yet economically \nviable on a wide scale. But, as I have said, the companies that \ninvested tens of millions of dollars in this technology already need to \nhave the Department of Interior issue the leasing ground rules so that \nthey know what their costs will be for taking part in the Federal \ncommercial leasing program when the time for leasing comes.\n  My bill also makes sure there is adequate public comment by requiring \nthat final regulations not be issued for at least 90 days after they \nhave been published in draft form.\n  When I offered this as an amendment in the Appropriations Committee, \nit was defeated by one vote and strictly along party lines. I heard \nfrom the other side of the aisle that because the Governor of Colorado \nand the junior Senator from Colorado opposed lifting this moratorium, \nCongress should not do so. I find this curious and incredibly \ninconsistent with prior debates over public lands policy. When we have \ndebated drilling in the section 1002 area of ANWR, the other side seems \nto have little or no regard for the desires of Alaska's Governor, the \npeople of the State of Alaska, or the entire congressional delegation \nabout how they want their public lands managed.\n  On this side of the aisle--that is, the Republican side of the \naisle--we have offered proposals to bring to market billions of barrels \nof domestic supply that are continually blocked. If we don't begin to \nput in place policies to enhance our domestic production, prices are \nonly going to go higher and the American people are going to pay the \nprice at the pump as well as suffer the consequences of a further drag \non the economy.\n  In closing, I wish to state that increasing domestic energy \nproduction, including from oil shale, will strengthen this country's \nnational security, lower gas prices, keep jobs and investments right \nhere at home, and, in these tight budgetary times, bring in hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to the States and the Federal Treasury through \nroyalty collections.\n  Congress needs to take a good, hard look at what it has done as far \nas encouraging further supply of energy for this country. As was \nmentioned in a number of editorials that have shown up in the papers, \nit is easy to blame companies and the stock market, and it is easy to \nblame the futures market, but really the problem starts right here in \nthe Congress. The Congress needs to come up with a solution to relieve \nthe inadequate supply of oil and gas. If that solution is not arrived \nat soon, Americans are going to be put out of business. We already hear \nabout airlines having to cut back on the number of employees they have \nbecause of the high cost of gasoline. So it is going to have a dramatic \nimpact on the economy of this country.\n  Just think about how much land we have tied up because of previous \naction by this Congress--the billions of barrels of oil that \npotentially would be available in ANWR; the huge amount of reserves \nthat we think is in the deep-sea portions that would be available off \nthe coast of this country. We\n\n[[Page S4803]]\n\nare the only country in the world that restricts drilling out in the \ndeep sea. There are potential reserves that would be available for \nconsumers of this country with oil shale in Utah and Colorado and \nWyoming. Now we have that tied up with a strict moratorium that tells \nthe oil producers of this country: We want you to shut down. We don't \nwant you to be able to move forward.\n  I think these are huge reserves, and if we had acted, actually, 10 \nyears ago, we wouldn't now have a problem. We are going to have a \nproblem for the next 10 years unless we do something quickly and \ndrastically, and we need to do something more than just saying that the \nStrategic Oil Reserve can't purchase oil for 6 months or we wait until \nit drops to less than $75 a barrel.\n  I am calling on my colleagues to join us because this is a serious \nproblem we are facing in this country, and the Congress needs to do \nsomething about it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. \n        Smith):\n  S. 3063. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor S corporation reform, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise today to \nintroduce the S Corporation Modernization Act of 2008 with my good \nfriend, Senator Orrin Hatch. I also want to say a special thanks to our \ncosponsors, Senators Gordon Smith of Oregon and Ben Cardin of Maryland. \nThis legislation makes needed changes to the tax code to help small and \nfamily-owned businesses across this Nation. It is my hope that these \npolicy changes will provide them the opportunity to grow their \nbusinesses, create jobs and stimulate the economy.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, as in so many rural States across the \ncountry, the vast majority of our businesse are small businesses. They \nare the local insurance agency, the flower shop, the coffee shop--and \nthey are most often organized as so-called ``S corporations.'' In fact, \nour country has more than four million S corporations nationwide. These \nbusinesses and their employees are truly the engines of our rural \neconomies. We must do all we can to ensure they can continue to compete \nin a global economy that is becoming steadily more competitive.\n  Because Congress has not updated many of the rules governing S \ncorporations--such as allowing better access to capital--I am concerned \nthat these privately-held businesses are not in the best position to \ndeal with the current downturn in the economy. We must modify our \noutdated rules so that these businesses that are starved for capital \nhave the means to expand and create jobs. Current law--particularly the \npunitive built-in gains tax penalty--not only limits the ability of S \ncorporations to attract new equity investors, but also effectively \nforces businesses to sit on `locked-up' capital that they cannot access \nand put to use to grow their business.\n  The S Corporation Modernization Act would update and simplify our S \ncorporation tax rules. It increases access to capital, encourages \nfamily-owned businesses to stay in the family, eliminates tax traps \nthat penalize unwary but well-meaning business owners, and encourages \ncharitable giving.\n  A strong economic recovery will depend on the health and strength of \nour small business sector--our S corporations. It is absolutely \nimperative that we work to ensure our tax rules that govern this sector \nare fair, simple and encourage growth. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to ensure these important \nchanges are made.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 3067. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nthe Dental Health Improvement Act; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from \nWisconsin and Maryland in introducing legislation to reauthorize the \nCollins-Feingold Dental Health Improvement Act, which was first signed \ninto law as part of the Health Care Safety Net Act Amendments of 2002. \nThe legislation we are introducing today will extend the authorization \nof this program, which provides grant funding to States to strengthen \nthe dental workforce in our Nation's rural and underserved communities, \nfor an additional 5 years.\n  While oral health in America has improved dramatically over the last \n50 years, these improvements have not occurred evenly across our \npopulation, particularly among low-income individuals and families. Too \nmany Americans today lack access to dental care. While there are \nclinically proven techniques to prevent or delay the progression of \ndental health problems, an estimated 47 million Americans live in areas \nlacking adequate dental services. As a consequence, these effective \ntreatment and prevention programs are not being implemented in many of \nour communities. Astoundingly, as many as 11 percent of our Nation's \nrural population has never been to a dentist.\n  The situation is exacerbated by the fact that our dental workforce is \ngraying. More than 20 percent of dentists nationwide will retire in the \nnext 10 years, and the number of dental graduates may not be enough to \nreplace their retirees. As a consequence, many states are facing a \nserious shortage of dentists, particularly in rural areas.\n  In Maine, there is one general practice dentist for every 2,300 \npeople in the Portland area. The numbers drop off dramatically, \nhowever, in other parts of our state. In Aroostook County, for example, \nwhere I am from, there is only one dentist for every 5,500 people. Of \nthe 23 dentists practicing in Aroostook County, only a few are taking \non any new cases.\n  The Collins-Feingold Dental Health Improvement Act, which is now \nSection 340G of the Public Health Service Act, authorized a State grant \nprogram administered by the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration at the Department of Health and Human services that is \ndesigned to improve access to oral health services in rural and \nunderserved areas. States can use these grants to fund a wide variety \nof programs. For example, they can use the funds for loan forgiveness \nand repayment programs for dentists practicing in underserved areas. \nThey can also use the grant funds to establish or expand community or \nschool-based dental facilities or to set up mobile or portable dental \nclinics. To assist in their recruitment and retention efforts, States \ncan use the funds for placement and support of dental students, \nresidents and advanced dentistry trainees. Or, they can use the grant \nfunds for continuing dental education, through distance-based education \nand practice support through teledentistry.\n\n  Congress appropriated $2 million for this program for fiscal year \n2006 and fiscal year 2007 and just under $5 million for fiscal year \n2008.\n  Thirty-six States have applied for grants from this program, but so \nfar, the funding available has only been sufficient to fund programs in \n18 States. Clearly there is sufficient interest and need for this \nprogram to justify its extension, particularly given all of the recent \nreports documenting the very serious need to improve access to oral \nhealth care.\n  Those 18 States that have been awarded funding under this program are \ndoing great things to improve access to oral health services. Colorado, \nGeorgia and Massachusetts are using the grant funds for loan \nforgiveness and repayment programs for dentists who practice in \nunderserved areas and who agree to provide services to patients \nregardless of their ability to pay. Arkansas, Maine, Michigan, \nMississippi and a number of other states are using the funds for \nrecruitment and retention efforts. Delaware, Rhode Island and Vermont, \nwhich, like Maine, don't have dental schools, are using the funds to \nexpand dental residency programs in their States.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will authorize an additional \n$50 million over the next 5 years for this important program. The \nAmerican Dental Association, the American Dental Education Association, \nand the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry have all endorsed the \nlegislation, and I encourage all of our colleagues to join us as \ncosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Reid, Ms. Collins, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Warner, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. \n        Lincoln, and Mr. Menendez):\n\n[[Page S4804]]\n\n  S. 3068. A bill to require equitable coverage of prescription \ncontraceptive drugs and devices, and contraceptive services under \nhealth plans; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Equity in \nPrescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act. I am pleased to \nbe joined by my colleague from Nevada, Majority Leader Reid. I \noriginally authored this legislation in 1997, and I stand today to \nresolve the issue of inequity in prescription drug coverage and to make \ncertain that all American women have access to contraception methods.\n  Without question, we have made remarkable progress in the number of \nemployer sponsored health plans covering contraception. According to a \nstudy released in 2004, between 1993 and 2002, contraceptive coverage \nin employer-purchased plans covering the full range of reversible \ncontraceptive methods tripled from 28 percent to 86 percent. \nConversely, the proportion of employer plans covering no method at all \ndropped dramatically, from 28 percent to 2 percent. Yet despite these \ngains, women of reproductive age currently spend 68 percent more in \nout-of-pocket health care costs than men. Not surprisingly, this \ndiscrepancy is due in large part to reproductive health-related costs.\n  Women whose health plans do not cover the full range of reversible \ncontraceptive methods often face high out-of-pocket costs. Yet covering \nprescription contraceptives results in cost-savings not only for women, \nbut for society as a whole. There are three million unintended \npregnancies every year in the United States, and almost half of these \npregnancies result from women who do not use contraceptives. Equal \ntreatment of prescription contraceptives will reduce costs to Americans \nby preventing these unintended pregnancies, which can range anywhere \nfrom $5,000 to almost $9,000 in medical costs.\n  The Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act \nwill eliminate the disparate treatment of prescription contraception \ncoverage. Simply put, if an employer provides insurance coverage for \nall other prescription drugs, they must also provide coverage for FDA \napproved prescription contraceptives. Our bill will ensure that women \nhave comprehensive reproductive health coverage, and lower costs to \nsociety by preventing unintended pregnancies and thus reducing the need \nfor abortion.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in fixing the inequity in \nprescription contraception coverage to make certain that all American \nwomen have access to this most basic health need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BARRASSO:\n  S. 3071. A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to \ntemporarily prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from considering \nglobal climate change as a natural or manmade factor in determining \nwhether a species is a threatened or endangered species, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \naddress the reality of the needs of species and the global nature of \nclimate change.\n  Recently, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decided to list the \npolar bear as a threatened species. The reason for the listing is the \nloss of sea ice habitat. They say the ice will be subjected to \n``increased temperatures, earlier melt periods, increased rain-snow \nevents, and shifts in atmospheric and marine surface patterns.'' \nEssentially, they are saying it is due to the effects of global climate \nchange.\n  Without the cooperation of other countries, the United States cannot \nreverse global climate change. If we are truly going to recover \nspecies--species that are being impacted by climate change--we would \nneed to have an international agreement in place, an international \nagreement among all of the major emitting countries. All of those \ncountries would have to comply with the treaty in order for species to \nreceive any tangible environmental benefit. This is what people who \ncare about the polar bear need to see happen.\n  Unfortunately, global warming activists are looking to the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service and to the Endangered Species Act as a means for \nwidespread regulation. This would be a complete departure from the \nintent of the law.\n  The Secretary of Interior, Secretary Kempthorne, has stated that he \nis providing additional guidance to ensure that there are no negative, \nunintended consequences to the legislation.\n  Unfortunately, such guidance will likely not survive judicial \nchallenge or perhaps even the next administration.\n  For the first time ever, lawsuits could be filed to block economic \ngrowth and the creation of jobs all across America.\n  It has been suggested that any economic activity that emits \ngreenhouse gases which then contributes to global warming and to the \nmelting of the polar icecaps must be stopped. Why? Because it might \ncause polar bears to become extinct.\n  Think about that for a minute: Buildings could not be expanded or \nbuilt; new roads could not be built or improved; local governments \nwould be forced up to adopt onerous new zoning requirements; energy \ndevelopment projects would be brought to a standstill; and virtually \nany economic development activity one can think of could be challenged \nby anyone. Volumes of new rules and regulations from Washington, DC, \nwould control everything we do.\n  This action would harm individual freedom, would raise energy costs, \nand would affect consumers across the board in all 50 States. This \naction would dramatically hurt our economy.\n  Frankly, when I see groups publicly stating that they intend to use \nthe polar bear listing as a hammer to stop fossil fuel use, such as \neven driving your car to work, I am skeptical about their real concern \nfor the polar bear.\n  In a recent Baltimore Sun article, the Center for Biological \nDiversity said:\n\n       Once protection for the polar bear is finalized, federal \n     agencies and other large greenhouse gas emitters will be \n     required by law to ensure that their emissions do not \n     jeopardize the species.\n\n  Some want to limit how much we drive or how we heat our homes. \nWyoming residents and Americans in general do not believe in such a \nculture of limits. That is perhaps why activists need to use and choose \nto use the courts to impose them.\n  We can provide cleaner cars and be more efficient in heating our \nhomes, but there is a line of individual liberty and personal choice \nthat we should not cross.\n  Yes, we are all concerned about protecting the environment, and as a \nSenator, I am also concerned about placing dramatic burdens on our \neconomy and on our American citizens.\n  Very soon, without legislative action by Congress, the Endangered \nSpecies Act will be transformed from a tool to recover species into a \nclimate change bill. This will not only shortchange truly endangered \nspecies, it will also impact working families who are already \nstruggling with high energy bills.\n  The beneficiaries will not be the polar bears. Instead, it will be \nenvironmental lawyers who will reap the financial windfall through \nendless lawsuits.\n  That is why today I have introduced legislation that says that the \nSecretary of Interior cannot consider global climate change as a \nnatural or a manmade factor in terms of listing species as endangered. \nUnder this bill, no species would be listed as threatened and \nendangered because of global warming until an international agreement \nis signed by all the major emitting nations.\n  The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency would have \nto certify that such an agreement is in place and that countries are in \ncompliance with the treaty for such a listing to occur. This bill \nspecifies that China and India would both have to be part of the \nagreement.\n  This is not designed to give the power of legislating or listing \nspecies into the hands of foreign nations. The bottom line is, species \nwill not receive the help they need until other countries comply. Plain \nand simple. To assert otherwise is to give false hope that those who \ncare most about protecting species actually get protection.\n  We do not need symbolic gestures in addressing climate change. While \nthe symbolism may appease some, it does not address the very real \nimpact of ordinary folks in my home State of Wyoming or anywhere across \nthe Nation.\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\nWe are saddled with high gas prices and high energy prices already.\n  Lawsuits blocking any new coal-fired powerplants can wreak havoc on \nWyoming's economy before we have had a chance to finish developing the \nclean coal technologies of the 21st century. Clean coal technologies \ntruly will address climate change.\n  Mr. President, all regions that depend on coal, particularly the \nMidwest, the South, and the Rocky Mountain West, would be the hardest \nhit. But we need real solutions to address species issues, while at the \nsame time ensuring that we protect working Americans.\n  You want to drive your family to the beach or drive them to the \nmountains? Don't be surprised that in the not too distant future you \nneed to get a government permit to do so.\n  I urge all Members of this body to consider cosponsoring this \nimportant bill.\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Allard, Mr. Craig, \n        Mrs. Dole, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Martinez, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Kyl, \n        Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Wicker, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Coleman, \n        Mr. Isakson, Mr. Bond, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 3073. A bill to amend the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act to improve procedures for the collection and delivery of \nabsentee ballots of absent overseas uniformed services voters, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the right to participate in democratic \nelections and vote for candidates of your choice is fundamental to the \nAmerican experience. That right to vote is safeguarded by our men and \nwomen in uniform, often at great personal cost to them and their loved \nones.\n  As the Global War on Terror continues, the need for overseas service \nby our troops is unlikely to let up any time soon. They routinely find \nthemselves deployed to far-away battlefields in the Middle East, on \nships at sea all across the globe, or assigned to overseas postings in \nKorea, Europe, or elsewhere.\n  What's more, the decisions of elected leaders of the Federal \nGovernment impact our troops often in a very direct and personal way. \nAs a result of decisions made by those elected leaders, our troops can \nbe called to deploy to a combat zone at virtually any time.\n  Statistics on overseas military voting in the 2006 election, compiled \nby the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, show that there is clearly \na problem of disenfranchisement of our troops. It is absolutely \ndespicable that, of our overseas troops who asked for mail-in ballots \nfor 2006, less than half, 47.6, percent of their completed ballots \nactually arrived at the local election office. Many of those arrived \ntoo late, and were therefore not even counted.\n  To me, that is an appalling failure of our current absentee voting \nsystem. We need to take action now, before the problem rears its ugly \nhead again, to safeguard the right of our troops to vote and have their \nvotes count.\n  I believe Congress has a duty to ensure these men and women in \nuniform, selflessly serving abroad, have a voice in choosing their \nelected leaders. They serve not only in the defense of freedom and the \nAmerican way of life, but also in defense of the very system of \ngovernment in which I and my Senate colleagues have the honor to serve.\n  These military service members have already given up so much for this \ncountry--often being apart from their families, living in the face of \nconstant danger, and standing on the front lines of our defense. We \nmust not allow one of their most fundamental rights as Americans to \nfall victim to an antiquated and inefficient system of absentee voting \nand slow--sometimes painfully slow--methods of delivering their marked \nballots.\n  One of the biggest problems in absentee balloting for our overseas \ntroops has been this inadequate delivery system for completed ballots.\n  The simple fact is that, for many overseas military voters, their \nmarked ballots arrived at the local election office too late to be \ncounted. There is no excuse for allowing inefficiency to disenfranchise \nour military men and women serving abroad.\n  That is why I have decided to introduce the Military Voting \nProtection Act of 2008, or MVP Act. This bill will improve the absentee \nvoting system for our overseas troops by expediting the delivery of \ntheir marked ballots to ensure they are delivered in a timely manner \nand, at the same time, electronically tracked to provide accountability \nand allow for verification that completed ballots actually arrived at \ntheir local election office.\n  First and foremost, this bill would expedite the process by directing \nthe Pentagon to make use of express delivery services, which many of us \nuse on a regular basis, to get the completed absentee ballots of our \noverseas troops to election officials here at home. At the same time, \nit would require the DOD to take a more active role in organizing the \ncollection, transportation, and tracking of these ballots.\n  We have at our disposal the tools necessary to more efficiently \ncollect and deliver our troops' ballots to help make their votes count. \nWe simply need to start utilizing more capable and expedited delivery \nmethods to ensure that our troops' voices are heard.\n  This bill also urges the DOD to make better use of modern technology \nto improve the ability of our troops to participate in elections. At \nthe same time, the bill recognizes the clear importance of preserving \nthe privacy and integrity of the voting system by calling on DOD to \nfocus its efforts on secure, efficient systems that would also achieve \nthese important goals.\n  In this day and age, it is inexcusable for our troops to be shut out \nof the democratic process merely because they are far away from their \nhomes as a result of their military service. We should not sit idly by \nand watch another election pass with a large portion of our brave \nmilitary men and women being left out of our democratic process.\n  For far too long in this country we have failed to adequately \nsafeguard the right of our troops to participate in our democratic \nprocess. We have allowed slow delivery methods, confusing absentee \nvoting procedures, and myriad other obstacles to disenfranchise many of \nour overseas troops. We must put those days behind us.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in addressing this important \nissue and protecting for our troops the very rights they fight to \nsafeguard for us. Join me in cosponsoring the MVP Act. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to pass this important bill quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4805-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4805-S4807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 574--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nGOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA SHOULD IMMEDIATELY RELEASE \nFROM CUSTODY THE CHILDREN OF REBIYA KADEER AND CANADIAN CITIZEN HUSEYIN \n  CELIL AND SHOULD REFRAIN FROM FURTHER ENGAGING IN ACTS OF CULTURAL, \n   LINGUISTIC, AND RELIGIOUS SUPPRESSION DIRECTED AGAINST THE UYGHUR \n                                 PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. BROWN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 574\n\n       Whereas the protection of the human rights of minority \n     groups is consistent with the actions of a responsible \n     stakeholder in the international community and with the role \n     of a host of a major international event such as the Olympic \n     Games;\n       Whereas recent actions taken against the Uyghur minority by \n     authorities in the People's Republic of China and, \n     specifically, by local officials in the Xinjiang Uyghur \n     Autonomous Region, have included major violations of human \n     rights and acts of cultural suppression;\n       Whereas the authorities of the People's Republic of China \n     have manipulated the strategic objectives of the \n     international war on terror to increase their cultural and \n     religious oppression of the Muslim population residing in the \n     Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;\n       Whereas an official campaign to encourage Han Chinese \n     migration into the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has \n     resulted in the Uyghur population becoming a minority in \n     their traditional homeland and has placed immense pressure on \n     those who are seeking to preserve the linguistic, cultural, \n     and religious traditions of the Uyghur people;\n       Whereas a new policy now actively recruits young Uyghur \n     women and forcibly transfers\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\n     them to work at factories in urban areas in far-off eastern \n     provinces, resulting in tens of thousands of Uyghur women \n     being separated from their families and placed into \n     substandard working conditions thousands of miles from their \n     homes;\n       Whereas the legal system of the People's Republic of China \n     is used as a tool of repression, including for the imposition \n     of arbitrary detentions and torture commonly employed against \n     any and all Uyghurs who voice discontent with the Government;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to apply charges of ``political crimes'' and the \n     death penalty to Uyghurs and other political dissidents, \n     contrary to international humanitarian standards;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China is implementing a \n     monolingual Chinese language education system that undermines \n     the linguistic basis of Uyghur culture by transitioning \n     minority students from education in their mother tongue to \n     education in Chinese, shifting dramatically away from past \n     policies that provided choice for the Uyghur people;\n       Whereas the Senate has a particular interest in the fate of \n     Uyghur human rights leader Rebiya Kadeer, a Nobel Peace Prize \n     nominee, and her family, as Ms. Kadeer was first arrested in \n     August 1999 while she was en route to meet with a delegation \n     from the Congressional Research Service and was held in \n     prison on spurious charges until her release and exile to the \n     United States in the spring of 2005;\n       Whereas upon her release, Rebiya Kadeer was warned by her \n     Chinese jailers not to advocate for human rights in Xinjiang \n     and throughout China while in the United States or elsewhere, \n     and was reminded that she had several family members residing \n     in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;\n       Whereas while residing in the United States, Rebiya Kadeer \n     founded the International Uyghur Human Rights and Democracy \n     Foundation and was elected President of the Uyghur American \n     Association and President of the World Uyghur Congress in \n     Munich, Germany;\n       Whereas 2 of Rebiya Kadeer's sons were detained and beaten \n     and one of her daughters was placed under house arrest in \n     June 2006;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush recognized the importance \n     of Rebiya Kadeer's human rights work in a June 5, 2007, \n     speech in Prague, Czech Republic, when he stated: ``Another \n     dissident I will meet here is Rebiyah Kadeer of China, whose \n     sons have been jailed in what we believe is an act of \n     retaliation for her human rights activities. The talent of \n     men and women like Rebiyah is the greatest resource of their \n     nations, far more valuable than the weapons of their army or \n     their oil under the ground.'';\n       Whereas Kahar Abdureyim, Rebiya Kadeer's eldest son, was \n     fined $12,500 for tax evasion and another son, Alim \n     Abdureyim, was sentenced to 7 years in prison and fined \n     $62,500 for tax evasion in a blatant attempt by local \n     authorities to take control of the Kadeer family's remaining \n     business assets in the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas another of Rebiya Kadeer's sons, Ablikim Abdureyim, \n     was beaten by local police to the point of requiring medical \n     attention in June 2006 and has been subjected to continued \n     physical abuse and torture while being held incommunicado in \n     custody since that time;\n       Whereas Ablikim Abdureyim was also convicted by a kangaroo \n     court on April 17, 2007, for ``instigating and engaging in \n     secessionist'' activities and was sentenced to 9 years of \n     imprisonment, this trial being held in secrecy and Mr. \n     Abdureyim reportedly being denied the right to legal \n     representation;\n       Whereas 2 days later, on April 19, 2007, another court in \n     Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, \n     sentenced Canadian citizen Huseyin Celil to life in prison \n     for ``splittism'' and also for ``being party to a terrorist \n     organization'' after having successfully sought his \n     extradition from Uzbekistan where he was visiting relatives;\n       Whereas authorities in the People's Republic of China have \n     continued to refuse to recognize Huseyin Celil's Canadian \n     citizenship, although he was naturalized in 2005, denied \n     Canadian diplomats access to the courtroom when Mr. Celil was \n     sentenced, and have refused to grant consular access to Mr. \n     Celil in prison;\n       Whereas a spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of the \n     People's Republic of China publicly warned Canada ``not to \n     interfere in China's domestic affairs'' after Huseyin Celil's \n     sentencing;\n       Whereas Huseyin Celil's case was a major topic of \n     conversation in a recent Beijing meeting between the Foreign \n     Ministers of Canada and the People's Republic of China; and\n       Whereas there have been recent armed crackdowns throughout \n     the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region against the Uyghur \n     population: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China--\n       (1) should recognize, and seek to ensure, the linguistic, \n     cultural, and religious rights of the Uyghur people of the \n     Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region;\n       (2) should immediately release the children of Rebiya \n     Kadeer from both incarceration and house arrest and cease \n     harassment and intimidation of the Kadeer family members;\n       (3) should immediately release Canadian citizen Huseyin \n     Celil and allow him to rejoin his family in Canada; and\n       (4) should immediately cease all Government-sponsored \n     violence and crackdowns against the people throughout the \n     Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, including those involved \n     in peaceful protests and political expression.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the Chinese people have endured an \nunspeakable tragedy, as we know, with the loss of tens of thousands in \na major earthquake. Those numbers continue to grow. On the radio this \nmorning, I heard it looks like more than 50,000 Chinese people have \ndied in one of the greatest tragedies of the last decade. My prayers \nare with the people of Sichuan Province and all those brave men and \nwomen who are there now providing support as volunteers, especially \nproviding support to the Chinese people in Sichuan Province.\n  I wish to focus on something else in China. This isn't the Chinese \npeople, it is the actions of a few people at the top of the Chinese \nGovernment--actions we must confront. When I say ``only a few people at \nthe top,'' the Chinese Government is called the People's Republic of \nChina for a reason. It is a Communist government, a very top-line \nhierarchical system, where a few people at the top enjoy so much of the \nbenefits and so much of the power and they wield that so unfairly and \nimmorally and, many times, against so many in their country.\n  For us to ignore the behavior of the Chinese Government, to dismiss \nthat behavior, to minimize that behavior is a reprehensible act on our \npart.\n  In a little more than 3 months, the world will witness one of its \ngreat quadrennial events--the summer Olympic Games. The games have been \nbilled as a way for the host, China, to reintroduce itself--a new \nChina, if you will--to the international community. And China has \npulled out all the stops: $38 billion in infrastructure improvements, \nincluding a brandnew 91,000-seat stadium, 300 miles of new roads, and \nan entirely new terminal at Beijing's International Airport, all \nbecause of the Olympic Games.\n  What China will not be highlighting is its human rights record. That \nis because it is abysmally disgraceful.\n  As China rolls out the red carpet to welcome hundreds of thousands of \ntourists and as Olympic-related media flock to Beijing to watch the \nevents, no one will be allowed to go to Tibet, no one will be allowed \nto go to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, no one will be allowed \nto see the hundreds of political prisons, no one will be allowed to \nvisit the areas of China where hundreds of millions live in abject \npoverty.\n  Last year, Amnesty International--a no more respected and fairminded \ngroup in the world--said of China:\n\n       An increased number of . . . journalists were harassed, \n     detained, and jailed. Thousands of people who pursued their \n     faith outside officially sanctioned churches were subjected \n     to harassment and many to detention and imprisonment. \n     Thousands of people were sentenced to death of executed. \n     Migrants from rural areas were deprived of basic rights.\n\n  The Presiding officer, from the State of Rhode Island, has talked \npassionately about the freedom of the press and journalism in countries \nwhere we have the kind of relationship we have with China and how \nimportant it is. Others in this body have talked about human rights and \nlabor rights, and now China has violated those values we hold dear and \nthat international organizations that serve all of the world hold so \ndear.\n  Beijing will continue to attempt to paint its repressive regime \nduring the Olympics in the best light possible, as we have seen in the \nlast month with the unnerving events in Tibet. The repression in Tibet, \na region similar in its treatment by the government as the Xinjiang \nUyghur Autonomous Region, is nothing new. For almost 60 years, Tibetans \nhave survived under Beijing repression. Tibet was swallowed up by China \nin 1950. The Uyghur Autonomous Region was swallowed up by China the \nyear before.\n  China's policy is straightforward: Declare war on human rights, bring \nin native Chinese for the best jobs, eradicate the indigenous culture, \nthe language, the spiritual center, disperse the population. It seems \nto have worked for China's interest every time.\n  China's policies keep import prices low by allowing inhumane \ntreatment of\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\nworkers, slave wages, and unsafe working conditions have become all too \ncommon.\n  China, the Communist regime, has become China, the world's largest \none-company town where workers are interchangeable, replaceable parts \nand where members of the Communist Party are its shareholders.\n  The United States as purportedly the world leader in human rights--we \ntalk about exporting democracy, we brag about our values, yet out \nbusiness is with encouragement and incentives--unbelievably enough, \nsometimes from our own Government--even though we say we are the world \nleader in human rights. The United States should not be endorsing in \nany way the brutal and horrific policies of the Chinese Government. \nAgain, the United States, by our actions by the Government and by \nbusiness do not seem so interested oftentimes in human rights in China \nin spite of what we say. We should not be sacrificing our moral compass \nat the altar of the dollar. We do that way too often.\n  I met with Rabiya Kadeer, the Uyghur dissident leader and head of the \nUyghur American Association. She told me of her time in prison for \npolitical advocacy on behalf of her people. She spent 6 long years in \nprison, arrested in 1999 on her way to a meeting with foreign activists \nand leaders. She told me of her children who either live in fear or \nlive in prison because of her advocacy on behalf of basic freedoms for \nthe 12 or 13 million Uyghur people. She told me of her exile. She is \nnot allowed to return to her native country.\n  We need the strength to stand up to rather than apologize for China's \nbrutal regime. This has been the systematic policy of a highly \nefficient and powerful central government.\n  The Chinese Uyghurs have long fought for more autonomy from Beijing \nand greater freedom to practice their Muslim religion.\n  This is not a new policy. We have seen the same in the Zinjiang \nUyghur Autonomous Region where ethnic Uyghur people have been \nsystematically relocated and repressed. Their Turkic language is \nprohibited, their women are placed into forced labor, especially young \nwomen taken out of the Autonomous Region to other parts of China, in \nmany cases to be slave labor, forced labor, in other cases to be sex \nslaves, and their political leaders are jailed. Yet we allow China into \nthe World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization, and made \nthem a preferred trading partner.\n  Communities across America feel the reverberations of this policy. \nNot only does it blacken our name as a country when China violates \nevery kind of human rights we care about, but then it affects our \ncountry in so many other ways.\n  We have lost more than 3 million manufacturing jobs across this \ncountry since President Bush has been President. Many of these jobs \nhave been eliminated because of government-subsidized imports from \nChina, because of cheating on currency rules, and because of direct off \nshoring to countries such as China.\n  China gives their manufacturers that unfair competitive advantage by \nmanipulating its currency and providing massive subsidies to its \nindustry. We know all that. American companies have been complicit by \nhiring Chinese subcontractors and forcing those subcontractors to \ncontinue to cut costs, meaning contaminated vitamins, contaminated \npharmaceuticals, and dangerous toxic lead-based paint on toys.\n  I am submitting a resolution today calling on the Chinese to free the \nKadeer children, free the Uyghur political prisoners, and end the \npolitical, religious, and ethnic repression in that part of China.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a look at this resolution, to meet with \nMs. Kadeer and to join me in working to bring the atrocities against \nthe Uyghur people to an end. Instead of welcoming China, celebrating \nChina, and trading with China on their terms, as we all talk about the \ngreat quadrennial events of the international Olympic Games, we should \nbe helping China's repressed. We should not indulge China its abuses. \nIt dishonors our own values.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4807-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 575--EXPRESSING THE SUPPORT OF THE SENATE FOR VETERAN \n                             ENTREPRENEURS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Craig, Ms. Snowe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Commitee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                              S.

Res. 576\n\n       Whereas, starting February 17, 2009, full-power television \n     stations will shut down their traditional analog signals and \n     will broadcast in digital only pursuant to the Digital \n     Television Transmission and Public Safety Act of 2005 (47 \n     U.S.C. 309 note);\n       Whereas some studies indicate that 64 percent of consumers \n     know about the transition to digital television, and of those \n     consumers 74 percent have major misconceptions about the \n     impact of the transition on their television services;\n       Whereas many consumers who will be left without any \n     television service after February 17, 2009, may be unaware of \n     both the transition and the Government coupon program created \n     to defray the cost of a converter box;\n       Whereas markets in the West and in Mid-West have the \n     highest percentage of consumers who rely on over-the-air \n     television signals;\n       Whereas the Salt Lake City, Utah, area has the single \n     highest percentage of consumers who rely on over-the-air \n     television signals among major cities in the United States, \n     with nearly 23 percent of all households with television \n     sets, more than 200,000 homes, relying on free analog \n     television signals;\n       Whereas more than 20 percent of homes with television sets \n     in Fresno, California, and Minneapolis, Minnesota, also rely \n     solely on free over-the-air television signals;\n       Whereas the transition to digital television is significant \n     to vulnerable populations such as senior citizens and low-\n     income and minority households; and\n       Whereas designating a ``Digital Television Transition \n     Awareness Month'' will help Congress to encourage the \n     development of local action plans focused on strategic \n     outreach to the communities most affected by the transition \n     to digital television, including senior citizens and \n     residents of rural areas: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 2008 as ``Digital Television \n     Transition Awareness Month''--\n       (A) to increase public awareness regarding the February 17, \n     2009, transition to digital television; and\n       (B) to encourage consumers to become educated about \n     participating in the Government coupon program for obtaining \n     converter boxes;\n       (2) encourages consumers to make the transition to digital \n     television well before February 17, 2009, so that consumers \n     have time to obtain and connect converter boxes; and\n       (3) encourages local nonprofit organizations, such as \n     religious congregations, scout troops, and school-based \n     community service groups--\n       (A) to assist households to apply for and obtain Government \n     coupons and converter boxes and to install converter boxes; \n     and\n       (B) to educate consumers about Internet websites and other \n     sources of valuable information regarding the transition to \n     digital television.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my good \nfriend from Minnesota, Senator Amy Klobuchar, S.

Concentrating efforts to educate consumers well in \nadvance about both the upcoming transition and their options will \nensure as smooth a transition as possible. That is why Senator \nKlobuchar and I, along with dozens of original cosponsors, have \nintroduced this resolution today.\n  I believe that the month of August is a perfect time to highlight the \nongoing educational efforts about the transition to digital television \nnext year. After all, we want to encourage those who will need to take \nsome action to do so now, rather than wait until the last moment.\n  Several studies indicate that many consumers who will be left without \nany television service after February 17, 2009, may be unaware of the \ntransition and the Government coupon program created to defray the cost \nof converter boxes. While 64 percent of consumers know about the \ntransition to digital television, 74 percent of that group has major \nmisconceptions about the impact of the transition on their television \nservices. The transition to digital television is especially \nsignificant to vulnerable populations such as senior citizen, low-\nincome, and minority households.\n  I note that television markets in the West and Midwest have the \nhighest percentage of consumers who rely on over-the-air television \nsignals. In Utah alone, Salt Lake City has the highest percentage of \nhomes in a major metropolitan area, with almost one in four relying on \nfree analog television signals.\n  The Federal Communications Commission, FCC, recently adopted a \nproposal to educate consumers about the impending transition. In \naddition, there are many sources of information on the transition, \ncoupon program and consumer options available on the Internet. These \nWeb sites are comprehensive and provide links to the Government coupon \nprogram site where consumers must register to receive the coupons. \nHowever, these sites do not reach certain populations, those most \nlikely to be affected by the transition, as effectively.\n  Congress can and should do more, not only to educate consumers, but \nalso to foster local outreach programs to assist these consumers as \nthey obtain coupons or choose and install converter boxes. Designating \nAugust 2008 as Digital Television Transition Awareness Month, timed \nspecifically to take advantage of the congressional recess, will place \nparticular emphasis on educating consumers well in advance of the \ntransition, and will be an integral part of the overall educational \nprogram endorsed by the FCC.\n  I hope that this resolution will be passed and my colleagues will \njoin me in doing all they can to make the transition from analog to \ndigital television easier for those most affected across our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4808-2", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 577--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n  USE OF GASOLINE AND OTHER FUELS BY FEDERAL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Chambliss, Ms. \nSnowe, Mr. Carper, Mr. Burr, Mr. Sununu, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Alexander, \nMr. Isakson, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Dorgan) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 578\n\n       Whereas the Congressional Club was organized in 1908 by 25 \n     women who were influential in Washington's official life and \n     who wanted to establish a nonsectarian and nonpolitical group \n     that would promote friendship and cordiality in public life;\n       Whereas those women founded the Club to bring the wives of \n     Members of Congress together in a hospitable and compatible \n     environment in the Nation's Capital;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club was officially established \n     in 1908 by a unanimous vote in both the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives and is the only club in the world to be \n     founded by an Act of Congress;\n       Whereas the Act entitled ``An Act to incorporate the \n     Congressional Club'' (35 Stat. 476, chapter 226) was signed \n     by President Theodore Roosevelt on May 30, 1908;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club's founding was secured by \n     the enactment of that Act unanimously on May 28, 1908, in \n     order to overcome the opposition of Representative John Sharp \n     Williams of Mississippi, who opposed all women's \n     organizations;\n       Whereas, when Representative Williams was called out of the \n     chamber by Mrs. Williams, the good-mannered representative \n     obliged and withdrew his opposition and request for a \n     recorded vote, saying, ``upon this particular bill there will \n     not be a roll call, because it would cause a great deal of \n     domestic unhappiness in Washington if there were'';\n       Whereas the first Congressional Clubhouse was at 1432 K \n     Street Northwest in Washington, District of Columbia, and \n     opened on December 11, 1908, with a reception for President-\n     elect and Mrs. William Taft;\n       Whereas, after Mrs. John B.

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 579\n\n       Whereas, as hurricane season approaches, National Hurricane \n     Preparedness Week provides an opportunity to raise awareness \n     of steps that can be taken to help protect citizens, their \n     communities, and property;\n       Whereas the official 2008 Atlantic hurricane season occurs \n     in the period beginning June 1, 2008, and ending November 30, \n     2008;\n       Whereas hurricanes are among the most powerful forces of \n     nature, causing destructive winds, tornadoes, floods, and \n     storm surges that can result in numerous fatalities and cost \n     billions of dollars in damage;\n       Whereas, in 2005, a record-setting Atlantic hurricane \n     season caused 28 storms, including 15 hurricanes, of which 7 \n     were major hurricanes, including Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, \n     and Wilma;\n       Whereas, for 2008, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration announced that the outlook for the hurricane \n     season was near to above normal, with a 60 to 70 percent \n     chance of 12 to 16 named storms, including 6 to 9 hurricanes \n     and 2 to 5 major hurricanes;\n       Whereas the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     reports that over 50 percent of the population of the United \n     States lives in coastal counties that are vulnerable to the \n     dangers of hurricanes;\n       Whereas, because the impact from hurricanes extends far \n     beyond coastal areas, it is vital for individuals in \n     hurricane-prone areas to prepare in advance of the hurricane \n     season;\n       Whereas cooperation between individuals and Federal, State, \n     and local officials can help increase preparedness, save \n     lives, reduce the impact of each hurricane, and provide a \n     more effective response to those storms;\n       Whereas the National Hurricane Center within the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recommends that each \n     at-risk family in the United States develop a family disaster \n     plan, create a disaster supply kit, secure their house, and \n     stay aware of current weather situations to improve \n     preparedness and help save lives, and\n       Whereas the designation of the week beginning May 26, 2008, \n     as ``National Hurricane Preparedness Week'' will help raise \n     the awareness of the people of the United States to assist \n     them in preparing for the upcoming hurricane season: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning May 26, 2008, as \n     ``National Hurricane Preparedness Week'';\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States--\n       (A) to be prepared for the upcoming hurricane season; and\n       (B) to promote awareness of the dangers of hurricanes to \n     help save lives and protect communities; and\n       (3) recognizes--\n       (A) the threats posed by hurricanes; and\n       (B) the need for the people of the United States to learn \n     more about preparedness so that they may minimize the impacts \n     of, and provide a more effective response to, hurricanes.\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 84--HONORING THE MEMORY OF ROBERT MONDAVI\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 84\n\n       Whereas Robert Mondavi, a much-loved and admired man of \n     many talents, passed away on May 16, 2008, at the age of 94;\n       Whereas Robert Mondavi will be fondly and most famously \n     remembered for his work in producing and promoting California \n     wines on an international scale;\n       Whereas Robert Gerald Mondavi was born to Italian immigrant \n     parents, Cesare and Rosa, on June 18, 1913, in Virginia, \n     Minnesota, and his family later moved to Lodi, California, \n     where he attended Lodi High School;\n       Whereas, after graduating from Stanford University in 1937 \n     with a degree in economics and business administration, \n     Robert Mondavi joined his father and younger brother Peter in \n     running the Charles Krug Winery in the Napa Valley of \n     California;\n       Whereas Robert Mondavi left Krug Winery in 1965 to \n     establish his own winery in the Napa Valley, and, in 1966, \n     motivated by his vision that California could produce world-\n     class wines, he founded the first major winery built in Napa \n     Valley since Prohibition: the Robert Mondavi Winery;\n       Whereas, in the late 1960s, the release of the Robert \n     Mondavi Winery's Cabernet Sauvignon opened the eyes of the \n     world to the potential of the Napa Valley region;\n       Whereas Robert Mondavi introduced new and innovative \n     techniques of wine production, such as the use of stainless \n     steel tanks to produce wines like his now-legendary Fume \n     Blanc;\n       Whereas, as a tireless advocate for California wine and \n     food, and the Napa Valley, Robert Mondavi was convinced that \n     California wines could compete with established European \n     brands, and his confidence in the potential of Napa Valley \n     wines was confirmed in 1976 when California wines defeated \n     some well-known French vintages at the historic Paris Wine \n     Tasting, or ``Judgment of Paris'', wine competition;\n       Whereas, in the late 1970s, Robert Mondavi created the \n     first French-American wine venture when he joined with Baron \n     Philippe de Rothschild in creating the Opus One Winery in \n     Oakville, which produced its first vintage in 1979;\n       Whereas the success of the Robert Mondavi Winery, and the \n     many international ventures Robert Mondavi pursued, allowed \n     him to donate generously to various charitable causes, \n     including the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food \n     Science and Robert and Margrit Mondavi Center for the \n     Performing Arts, both affiliated with the University of \n     California, Davis, and the establishment of the American \n     Center for Wine, Food and the Arts;\n       Whereas those who knew Robert Mondavi recognized him as a \n     uniquely passionate and brilliant man who took pride in \n     promoting causes that he held close to his heart;\n       Whereas Robert Mondavi's work as an ambassador for wine \n     will be remembered fondly by all those whose lives he \n     touched; and\n       Whereas Robert Mondavi will be deeply missed in the Napa \n     Valley, in California, and throughout the world: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress honors the life of Robert Mondavi, \n     a true pioneer and a patriarch of the California wine \n     industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4810-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 85--AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE ROTUNDA OF \nTHE CAPITOL TO HONOR FRANK W.

Educational assistance for veterans helps reduce the \n     costs of war, assist veterans in readjusting to civilian life \n     after wartime service, and boost the United States economy, \n     and has a positive effect on recruitment for the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (4) The current educational assistance program for veterans \n     is outmoded and designed for peacetime service in the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (5) The people of the United States greatly value military \n     service and recognize the difficult challenges involved in \n     readjusting to civilian life after wartime service in the \n     Armed Forces.\n       (6) It is in the national interest for the United States to \n     provide veterans who serve on active duty in the Armed Forces \n     after September 11, 2001, with enhanced educational \n     assistance benefits that are worthy of such service and are \n     commensurate with the educational assistance benefits \n     provided by a grateful Nation to veterans of World War II.\n\n     SEC. __003.

Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for their \nsupport of S. 2420, the Federal Food Donation Act of 2007, which is \nbeing passed through the Senate today. I introduced this bill, which \nwill encourage the donation of excess food from Federal agencies and \ntheir qontractors to emergency food providers, on December 6, 2007.\n  In a country as wealthy as ours it is unacceptable that anyone person \nshould go hungry, yet approximately 35.5 million Americans have \ndifficulty affording food. An estimated 732,000 households in my home \nState of New York live with hunger or the threat of hunger.\n  Food banks and pantries all across the United States are facing a \nperfect storm where as the economy suffers and food prices rise, more \nand more families are relying on their services; yet the pantries are \nstraining to keep their shelves stocked due to the increase in food \nrequests and food costs. According to America's Second Harvest, food \nbanks around the country lare reporting that an estimated 20 percent \nmore people are visiting soup kitchens and food pantries for help this \nyear than last year, and too many people are being turned away. We need \nto do everything we can to make sure that all families in all \ncommunities have enough to eat during these difficult times.\n  This bill will help make fighting hunger a national priority. In the \n1990s, the United States Department of Agriculture created an \ninitiative through which it encouraged the practice of food recovery. \nDuring just 1 year of the program, 1998, the Federal Government \nrecovered over 3 million pounds nationwide from cafeterias, farms, \nresearch centers, and military bases. For the past decade the Federal \nGovernment has strayed away from this important anti-hunger initiative, \nbut this bill would take an important step towards reengaging the \nFederal Government's involvement in food recovery.\n  Nonprofits in the business of food rescue serve millions of people, \nand I would like to thank one such nonprofit, Rock and Wrap it Up!, a \nnational food rescue organization headquartered in New York, for their \nhelp in conceiving of and promoting this bill. I commend them for their \ngreat work. It is now time for the Federal Government to join the \nnonprofit and private sectors in doing all it can to feed our Nation's \nhungry--the need for help is greater now than it has been in a very \nlong time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \nsubstitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelated to this measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2420), as amended, was ordered to be engrossed for a \nthird reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4845-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL CHILDHOOD CANCER AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we now proceed \nto S. Res. 577.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 577) to express the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the use of gasoline and other fuels by \n     Federal departments and agencies.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that hits \ndeep at the heart--and pocketbooks--of Americans nationwide: rising \ngasoline prices.\n  Each and every day, Americans contend with a rapid and inexplicable \nincrease in gasoline prices. Over the last month, the average price of \ngasoline has increased a penny a day.\n  A barrel of oil is at $133.17.\n  The impacts of these increases are staggering.\n  I have heard stories of how individual Americans are coping with the \nproblem of increased gas prices as they conduct their daily lives with \ntheir families and in their work environments.\n  They are finding ways to reduce their consumption of gasoline by \ndriving less, altering daily routines, and even changing family \nvacation plans.\n  To me, this example of changing family vacation plans is all the more \npoignant on the eve of what is usually a busy holiday weekend, a \nholiday that usually sees many Americans traveling by car out of town.\n  In fact, travel over this holiday weekend is expected to be down for \nthe first time since September 11, 2001.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is Americans are tightening their \nbelts in ways that bring hardships, but save dollars that are necessary \nto meet essential family needs. And while small in comparison to the \noverall problem of supply and demand of gasoline, these efforts do add \nup. I never dismiss the American ``can do'' spirit.\n  In one word, it is individual conservation. And in cases such as \nthis, when individuals are leading the way, the government should join.\n  The purpose of the Sense of the Senate Resolution that I am pleased \nto offer is to urge the federal government to likewise take initiatives \nto cut back--even in a small measure--its daily consumption of gasoline \nand other fuels.\n  I believe such a move would signal to Americans that their government \nis sharing the daily hardships occasioned by this turbulent, uncertain \nenergy crisis.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. Presdient, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator \nWarner's legislation that calls on the President to reduce the gasoline \nconsumption of the departments and agencies that he oversees.\n  We are seeing American consumers begin to use less gasoline, as \nprices reach new historic highs almost daily. Many Americans simply \ncannot afford to maintain their regular driving habits at the moment. \nThis is a situation that we have not experienced in this country in \nover 30 years.\n  It is important that the Federal Government show its solidarity with \nthe American people in this time of economic hardship. Just as \nindividual citizens are finding ways to use less gasoline, the U.S. \nGovernment should also be finding ways to reduce consumption.\n  Because the Executive Branch is by far the largest branch of \nGovernment, it is important that the President take the lead on this \nissue. As the Federal Government spends less money on fuel, we send \nfewer American taxpayers' hard earned dollars to oil-exporting \ncountries. That is a goal I know we can all agree is laudable under any \ncircumstance, but even more so now, as fuel costs continue to soar.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 577) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 577\n\n       Whereas each day, as Americans contend with rising gasoline \n     prices, personal stories reflect the ways in which--\n       (1) family budgets are suffering; and\n       (2) the cost of gasoline is impacting the way Americans \n     cope with that serious problem in family and work \n     environments;\n       Whereas, as a consequence of economic pressures, Americans \n     are finding ways to reduce consumption of gasoline, such as--\n       (1) driving less frequently;\n       (2) altering daily routines; and\n       (3) even changing family vacation plans;\n       Whereas those conservation efforts bring hardships but save \n     funds that can be redirected to meet essential family needs;\n       Whereas, just as individuals are reducing energy \n     consumption, the Federal Government, including Congress, \n     should take steps to conserve energy;\n       Whereas a Government-wide initiative to conserve energy \n     would send a signal to Americans that the Federal \n     Government--\n       (1) recognizes the burdens imposed by unprecedented energy \n     costs; and\n       (2) will participate in activities to reduce energy \n     consumption; and\n       Whereas an overall reduction of gasoline consumption by the \n     Federal Government by even a few percentage points would send \n     a strong signal that, as a nation, the United States is \n     joining to conserve energy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should require all Federal departments and agencies \n     to take initiatives to reduce daily consumption of gasoline \n     and other fuels by the departments and agencies.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to express on the record my \nappreciation to Senators Warner and Bingaman for this most important \nresolution that just passed. It expresses the sense of the Senate that \nAmericans are contending with rising gasoline prices. Their personal \nstories reflect the ways in which family budgets are suffering.\n  The cost of gas is impacting the way Americans cope with problems \nwithin the family and, therefore, we need to find ways to reduce \nconsumption of gasoline. This is directed toward the President. I hope \nhe will review this. We have a lot of problems with our economy, many \nof which are a direct result of the cost of a barrel of oil being $130.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4847-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4847]]\nRECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF THE CONGRESSIONAL \n                                  CLUB\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 578\n\n       Whereas the Congressional Club was organized in 1908 by 25 \n     women who were influential in Washington's official life and \n     who wanted to establish a nonsectarian and nonpolitical group \n     that would promote friendship and cordiality in public life;\n       Whereas those women founded the Club to bring the wives of \n     Members of Congress together in a hospitable and compatible \n     environment in the Nation's Capital;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club was officially established \n     in 1908 by a unanimous vote in both the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives and is the only club in the world to be \n     founded by an Act of Congress;\n       Whereas the Act entitled ``An Act to incorporate the \n     Congressional Club'' (35 Stat. 476, chapter 226) was signed \n     by President Theodore Roosevelt on May 30, 1908;\n       Whereas the Congressional Club's founding was secured by \n     the enactment of that Act unanimously on May 28, 1908, in \n     order to overcome the opposition of Representative John Sharp \n     Williams of Mississippi, who opposed all women's \n     organizations;\n       Whereas, when Representative Williams was called out of the \n     chamber by Mrs. Williams, the good-mannered representative \n     obliged and withdrew his opposition and request for a \n     recorded vote, saying, ``upon this particular bill there will \n     not be a roll call, because it would cause a great deal of \n     domestic unhappiness in Washington if there were'';\n       Whereas the first Congressional Clubhouse was at 1432 K \n     Street Northwest in Washington, District of Columbia, and \n     opened on December 11, 1908, with a reception for President-\n     elect and Mrs. William Taft;\n       Whereas, after Mrs. John B.

Mr. President, one reason we waited until 20 till 8 tonight \nto try to complete the work of the Senate is that I had a number of \nconversations today with my staff trying to work out nominations, and \nwe worked something out. I spoke with the President's Chief of Staff, \nJosh Bolten. I have always found him to be a very pleasant man to work \nwith.\n  We arrived at an agreement we would approve, for example, ambassadors \nto 18 different countries; we would approve a man to be Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development. Senator Dodd went to a great deal of \ntrouble to clear this nomination. In fact, he held a special meeting to \nget this nomination done. We were going to agree to a number of people, \nRepublicans in nature: Stephen Krasner for the Institute of Peace; J. \nRobinson West for the Corporation for National Community Service--I am \nreading the Republicans because there are so few Democrats it is hardly \nworth mentioning--Eric Tannenblatt, Corporation for National and \nCommunity Service; Layshae Ward; Hyepin Christine Im. We have a number \nof military officers we agreed to, some 50 in number. In exchange for \nthis, the Democrats were going to get three or four people.\n  I have always thought, in my dealings around here, when we work \nsomething out, that is the agreement. But at the last minute, somebody \nsteps in and says that isn't quite good enough. That is unfortunate \nbecause the arrangement was negotiated with staff and Mr. Bolten in \ngood faith.\n  Everyone should understand that people complain about the White House \nnot having sufficient staff. Why don't you approve some of these \nnominations? Tonight, we had about 80 we were going to approve--\nmilitary, ambassadors, a Cabinet Secretary. We got an objection about \nsome inconsequential appointment in comparison to all these, important \nto the person involved, I am sure. That is not the way we should be \ndoing business.\n  So here we are going into a recess. These people are not going to \nhave their jobs. There is no fault on behalf of the Democrats. This was \nall done. So I want the President's Chief of Staff and the President to \nunderstand they are missing one Cabinet Secretary that Chairman Dodd \nwent through great trouble to approve.\n  The sad part about this is we rushed through this because we wanted \none Democrat approved. It was personally important to one of our \nSenators. That is the way it is. But let this Record reflect there are \nmilitary commissions that will not be granted and advanced. There will \nbe a Cabinet Secretary not approved, there will be 18 ambassador \npositions which would not be filled, all because of the Republican \nminority.\n\n[[Page S4849]]\n\n  Is it any wonder they have lost three special elections--\ncongressional seats--in heavily Republican districts? Even the \nRepublicans out there are understanding that this is the wrong way to \nrun a country. Seven and a half years of division, not unification.\n  I am going to do my very best in the next 7 months in my position to \ndo everything I can to work with the White House to try to get things \ndone, but this is an example of what we get--no cooperation, no ability \nto try to unify us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/05/22/senate-section/article/S4849-1", "month": "05", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ORDERS OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.
