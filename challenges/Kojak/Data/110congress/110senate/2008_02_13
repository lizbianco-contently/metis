Mr. President, this morning the statement was made by the \nPresident in the Oval Office that he will refuse to sign a temporary \nextension of the current FISA law. This is a statement from the person \nwho wants to unite, not divide. This is part of the Orwellian-speak we \nhave had for 7 years out of the White House.\n  Let's be very clear. President Bush, obviously, is more interested in \npoliticizing intelligence than finding solutions to the problems we are \nfacing in this difficult situation. Today, he continues to try to bully \nCongress. Let's not forget that we would not even be discussing this \nissue if not for his actions.\n  What were some of those actions? In their unyielding efforts to \nexpand Presidential powers, President Bush and Vice President Cheney \ncreated a system to conduct wiretapping, eavesdropping--including on \nAmerican citizens--outside the bounds of longstanding Federal law. The \nPresident could easily have come to us and said: Let's change this law, \nand we would have gone along with probably little effort. But, no, he \ndid not do that. He just went around the law, and when we passed the \nlaw to try to change it, he went around that too.\n\n  Congress has repeatedly amended the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct to reflect new technology and the legitimate needs of the \nintelligence community. We have done that often and for good reason. \nBut, whether out of convenience, incompetence, or disdain for the rule \nof law, this administration chose to ignore Congress and basically \nignored the law, ignored the Constitution.\n  Congress is working updates to the FISA law as we speak. Senate \nRepublicans and the White House have spent many weeks slow-walking the \nbill as part of the Republican strategy to jam the House. We have known \nthat, we have talked about it, and they did a good job because we were \nnot able to pass this bill until last night. I believe it is wrong and \nirresponsible for the White House to do this. Due to months of White \nHouse foot-dragging, the relevant House committees have only now just \ngotten important documents related to whether the Bush administration \nfollowed the law and the Constitution. I cannot speak about those \ndocuments on the floor, but people need time to review and analyze \nthese documents. It is not four or five pages. So we must not let this \ncritical issue be\n\n[[Page S926]]\n\nresolved by the White House trying to push everybody around.\n  Let's work together on this issue. We are all working for the same \ngoal: to protect American citizens against acts of terror. Congress is \nprepared to extend current law, the Protect America Act, by any length \nfor Congress to complete the indepth analysis and negotiations \nnecessary for long-term law broadly supported by the American people. \nIf the President chooses to veto a short-term extension, as he said he \nwould this morning, the responsibility for any ensuing intelligence-\ncollecting gap lies on his shoulders and that of Vice President Cheney \nand theirs alone, no one else.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/13/senate-section/article/S926-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, with regard to the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, it passed in the Senate yesterday 68 to 29--an \noverwhelming bipartisan ratification of the Rockefeller-Bond bipartisan \ncompromise to get us a permanent Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nin place. There were a number of efforts to weaken the bill on the \nfloor of the Senate. They were all defeated on a bipartisan basis. Most \nof them were defeated by a margin of 2 to 1.\n  Over in the House, we have heard from 21 Democratic Members, the \n``Blue Dogs,'' who say the House ought to take up this overwhelmingly \nbipartisan Senate bill and pass it and send it to the President for his \nsignature.\n  We had an important bipartisan victory just last week on the stimulus \npackage. We have an opportunity to do it again this week on this \nextraordinarily important piece of legislation.\n  In thinking about how long we have been dealing with this \nlegislation, we passed a short-term extension back in August. We have \nhad 6 months to figure out what we wanted to do. We passed extremely \nimportant legislation--probably the most important piece of legislation \nwe will pass this Congress--yesterday on an overwhelming bipartisan \nvote. The House of Representatives surely has followed what we have \ndone. There is a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives \nfor what we did yesterday in the Senate. We know that. There is a \nbipartisan majority in the House of Representatives to take up and pass \nthe Senate-passed bill in the House of Representatives now. That is \nwhat we know. That is what I hope will be done. The House will have an \nopportunity over the next couple of days to make its decision. But I \nthink the President has correctly assessed the situation and decided we \nhave had ample time to deal with this legislation, to find out how we \nfelt about it, to vote on it, to make whatever changes people thought \nwere appropriate. And we know there is a bipartisan majority in the \nHouse waiting to pass it. I hope they will be given that opportunity \nlater this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/13/senate-section/article/S926-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S926-S927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   Master Sergeant Clinton W. Cubert\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a brave \nsoldier from Kentucky who was lost in the performance of his duty. On \nSeptember 11, 2005--4 years after the brutal attacks that compelled our \nNation to fight the war on terror that we still fight today--MSG \nClinton W. Cubert was on combat patrol in Samarra in Iraq. An \nimprovised explosive device set by terrorists exploded under his \nhumvee.\n  Master Sergeant Cubert, of Lawrenceburg, KY, sustained mortal \ninjuries in the blast. He survived to be transported to the Lexington \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center in Lexington, KY, and was reunited with \nhis family. He passed away on Easter Sunday, April 16, 2006, at the age \nof 38.\n  For his valor during service, Master Sergeant Cubert received \nnumerous medals and awards, including the Meritorious Service Medal, \nthe Bronze Star Medal, and the Purple Heart Medal.\n  Born in Texas, Clinton Cubert moved to Lawrenceburg with his family \nat an early age. His parents, C.D. and Virginia Cubert, raised a boy \nwho loved the outdoors. As a child, Clinton enjoyed deer hunting, \nboating, fishing, or just about anything that took him outside.\n  Clinton enjoyed country music, especially Hank Williams, Jr. He drove \nwhat family members kindly called ``beat-up'' Ford trucks and liked to \nget under the hood and tinker with them to keep them running until they \ncouldn't go anymore.\n  Family members called him ``Clinton,'' but he also earned an unusual \nnickname. Because Clinton was willing to trade his entire lunch for the \none food he loved so much, his friends called him ``Cornbread.''\n\n  Clinton met Amy, his wife, in Lawrenceburg when they were both in \ntheir early twenties. Amy thought Clinton looked very handsome in his \nuniform. Clinton and Amy raised two wonderful young women, Alisha \nDanielle and Sarah Dawn.\n  Clinton enlisted in the National Guard in 1987 and went on to serve \nwith distinction for nearly 19 years. Normally he worked in the \nCombined Support Maintenance Shop at the Guard's headquarters in \nFrankfurt, KY, the State capital. Then, in January 2005, he was \ndeployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Assigned to the 2113th \nTransportation Company, he became platoon leader of that unit's newly \ncreated 4th Platoon.\n  For Clinton's commanding officer, CPT William Serie, Clinton was his \nfirst and most obvious choice. ``[Master Sergeant Cubert] was the most \ndedicated in making sure his soldiers were trained, equipped and \nready,'' he says. ``People use the word `dedicated' and `outstanding' \nand things of that nature, but I don't think those words really express \nwhat he did for us. He was truly a person that was outside the mold.''\n  In Iraq, Master Sergeant Cubert trained with 30 members of his \nplatoon in combat tactics so that the units they protected in transit \nwould arrive at their destinations safely. Captain Serie tells us that \nClinton was innovative in devising new ways for soldiers to do their \njobs more safely and efficiently.\n  ``I believe that God puts special people in our lives to show us what \nwe are capable of,'' Captain Serie says. ``Clinton was that type of \nleader.''\n  When Clinton was injured, the Army contacted Amy, and she flew to \nGermany to see her husband. Younger daughter Sarah was the first to \nanswer the phone. At the age of 12, she wrote an essay for school about \nthe terrible day her family received the news. ``I was looking in the \nmirror thinking all questions,'' Sarah wrote. ``Like the obvious ones--\nwhy us? Why now? But also the ones that are only thought by a \ndaughter--who is going to walk me down the aisle? Who is going to give \nme hugs like him? Who is going to dress me up in camouflage flannels \nand take me hunting?''\n  We grieve today along with the Cubert family for their loss. Clinton \nleaves behind his wife Amy; his daughters, Alisha and Sarah; his \nsisters, Linda Lou Martin, Nancy Marie Robinson, Julie Ann Dent, and \nPeggy Ann Cubert; his brother Steven Wayne Cubert, and many other \nbeloved family members and friends. Clinton was predeceased by his \nparents, C.D. and Virginia Cubert.\n  Clinton was taken from his loved ones before his time, but it must \nhave been a blessing for them that he was able to come home and say \ngoodbye. I am sure they will treasure forever every moment spent with \nClinton. ``No one will forget his laughter,'' wrote his daughter Sarah, \n``like the boom of gunshots during the funeral or the bagpipes playing \nTaps.''\n  This Senate will not forget MSG Clinton Cubert's bravery and service. \nKentucky and the Nation are richer for his contributions to freedom's \ncause.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in brief response to the distinguished \nRepublican leader's remarks about the FISA extension, I acknowledge the \nbill passed yesterday. I voted against it, and I voted against cloture \non the bill, but it was a bipartisan passage. I understand that. I \ndon't dispute that. I saw what the numbers were. The bill was changed a \nlittle as it came from the committee, but it passed. It was bipartisan. \nI recognize that.\n\n[[Page S927]]\n\n  But the efforts made to extend this should be bipartisan. The House \nis going to do what they do, and they are going to send us a piece of \nlegislation. They have not had time--I have spoken to the Speaker, and \nshe has not had time, through her committees, for them to come up with \nthe necessary work to have a conference that is meaningful because they \nare not ready for that. So they are going to send us a message and we \nare going to have to act on that.\n  If we pass it, it will not be what the President wants. If we have a \nlittle more time, the House, which has been working recently with the \nWhite House quite well on the stimulus package and other things, maybe \ncould work something out. But you can't create something out of \nnothing, and that is what the President wants. He is looking for an \nexcuse to wave his banner of ``be afraid, terror.'' That is what he and \nthe Vice President have done.\n  We understand the law is important. We believe it should be extended \nfor a short period of time. If it is not extended, it is not the fault \nof the Congress, it is the fault of Bush and Cheney. We are doing \neverything we can to work this out. If it doesn't pass in the manner he \nwants, and it won't in the next few days--he wants total immunity for \nthese phone companies that have cooperated or haven't cooperated with \nhim, whatever the evidence shows. So I repeat, if we don't get an \nextension, the law will lapse. It is not the fault of the Congress, it \nis the fault of the White House.\n  Mr. President, I think we should announce what we are going to be \ndoing here today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/13/senate-section/article/S927-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday was a big day before the \nSenate. We had the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act bill. Today is \nan even bigger day because the intelligence authorization bill is going \nto be before the Senate, and today we will grapple with something that \nI think should be major in our consciousness and major in our \ndeliberations. It is central to who we are as a nation. The question is \nwhether the United States should continue to go to the ``dark side,'' \ndown the road of torture, and continue to allow the CIA and other \nintelligence agencies to practice or outsource state-sanctioned \ntorture. To me, the answer is clear, and I hope it is to everyone. The \nanswer should be no.\n  Today we are living in a legal limbo, where the rules are shrouded by \nambiguity. The time has come to change this once and for all. The way \nto do it is to support the fiscal year 2008 intelligence authorization \nbill, which would prohibit all interrogation techniques by the CIA and \nplace the intelligence community under the uniform standard of the Army \nField Manual. If that bill passes, and it has passed the House of \nRepresentatives, if it passes here today, we have a uniform standard \nfor the entire American Government with respect to coercive \ninterrogation techniques.\n  The Army Field Manual, which looks like this, has 19 interrogation \nprotocols. They are proven, they are flexible, and they are effective. \nThe CIA interrogation program, on the other hand, I believe, is \nimmoral, illegal, sometimes ineffective, and often counterproductive. I \nwish to simply read something which appeared in the newspapers, and \nwhat this says is:\n\n       The book on interrogation has been written. We just need to \n     follow it.\n\n  And they refer to this book, Mr. President.\n\n       Cruel and inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners \n     under American control makes us less safe, violates our \n     Nation's values, and damages America's reputation in the \n     world. That is why, in 2004, the bipartisan 9/11 Commission \n     called for humane treatment of those captured by the United \n     States Government and our allies in the struggle against \n     terrorism. Congress and the Pentagon responded with clear and \n     comprehensive new rules for the military so that \n     interrogation techniques practiced by the military today are \n     both humane and effective. But not all United States agencies \n     are following these rules. Congress should require the entire \n     U.S. Government and those acting on its behalf to follow the \n     Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations. \n     Doing so will make us safer while safeguarding our cherished \n     values and our vital national interests.\n\n  This was signed by Zbigniew Brzezinski, Warren Christopher, Lawrence \nEagleburger, Slade Gorton, Lee Hamilton, Gary Hart, Rita Houser, Karla \nHills, Thomas Kean, Anthony Lake, John Lehman, Richard Leon, Robert \nMcFarlane, Donald McHenry, Sam Nunn, Thomas Pickering, Ted \nSorensen, and John Whitehead. It is a bipartisan group that has come \nout with this, and I believe we should absorb it and use that \ninformation.\n\n  The Army Field Manual provision has the support of the Intelligence \nCommittees. I offered the amendment in the conference between the House \nand the Senate on the intel authorization bill. It was passed by the \nSenate and it was passed by the House, and it is part of the bill, and \nas I said, the House has passed their bill. The amendment was the \nsubject of passionate and considered debate in Congress. It has unique \nsupport--18 former security officials, as I have said--and this Army \nField Manual was issued in its current form by the Department of the \nArmy in September of 2006. It followed the requirements of the Detainee \nTreatment Act, and it applies uniformly across all elements of the \nmilitary and civilian elements of the Department of Defense.\n  The manual was published after more than 3 years of drafting and \ncoordination. This was the most scrutinized field manual the Army has \never produced, including reviews and comments by every relevant \nPentagon office, every combatant commander, the White House, the DNI, \nthe CIA, and the Defense Intelligence Agency. The Departments of \nJustice and State have also concurred with the manual's guidance. For \nthe first time ever, the Army consulted with Congress in the persons of \nSenators McCain, Warner, and Levin in drafting the manual.\n  The manual complies with the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the \nGeneva Conventions, and the Detainee Treatment Act. There is perhaps no \nmore authoritative figure on the manual than our commanding officer in \nIraq, GEN David Petraeus. In a response to a survey showing that \nAmerican troops in Iraq would consider torture in order to save their \ncomrades, Petraeus wrote to the entire multinational force on May 10, \n2007, and here is some of what he said:\n\n       Certainly, extreme physical action can make someone \n     ``talk''; however, what the individual says may be of \n     questionable value. In fact, our experience in applying the \n     interrogation standards laid out in the Army Field Manual \n     shows that the techniques in the manual work effectively and \n     humanely in eliciting information from detainees.\n\n  Now, what does the manual do? It specifically authorizes 19 \napproaches--you could call them interrogation techniques--and they are \nwell thought out and each one is several pages on how to apply it. One \nof them can only be used on unlawful army combatants with the prior \napproval of the combatant commander. These techniques describe ways to \nbuild rapport with the detainee in order to get him or her to share \ninformation.\n  GEN Michael Maples, the Director of the DIA, recently rebutted the \ncontention that the Army Field Manual wouldn't have covered the \ninterrogation method used by an FBI special agent to get Saddam Hussein \nto finally come clean that he had no weapons of mass destruction.\n  So the manual specifically prohibits eight techniques, and here is \nwhat they are:\n  Forcing a detainee to be naked, perform sexual acts, pose in a sexual \nmanner; placing hoods or sacks over the\n\n[[Page S928]]\n\nhead of a detainee; using duct tape over the eyes; beatings, electric \nshock, burns, or other forms of physical pain; waterboarding--very much \nthe talk of the Nation; use of military working dogs; inducing \nhypothermia or heat injury; conducting mock executions; depriving \ndetainee of necessary food, water, or medical care.\n  Those are the eight prohibited techniques in the Army Field Manual. \nIt also incorporates what is called the ``golden rule,'' and this is \nimportant. It is an approach to interrogation. It requires military \npersonnel to ask this question: If an interrogation technique were to \nbe used against an American soldier, would I believe the soldier had \nbeen abused?\n  Adopting this conference report would extend that ``golden rule'' to \nCIA interrogations, to station agents all across the globe, and make \nsure that no coercive technique could be used if we would not be \ncomfortable with the same technique being used against an American \ncitizen.\n  Now, here are some facts about the CIA program. The CIA has used \ncoercive techniques on detainees since September 11, 2001, under the \nPresident's authorization and approval of the Department of Justice. \nThe CIA has waterboarded three detainees--Abu Zubaydah, Abd al-Rahim \nal-Nashiri, and Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.\n  The White House believes that waterboarding could be used in the \nfuture, even though General Hayden has recently publicly questioned its \nlegality. The CIA has used contractors for interrogations, as General \nHayden admitted in an open, public hearing this past week. So the CIA \nhas outsourced what is an inherently governmental function of \nquestionable legality and morality.\n  More importantly, the CIA's interrogation techniques change. There is \nno uniform standard. There is no standard as to how they are to be \ncombined, what the circumstances are. Think about this. Done with cold \ncalculation, any interrogation technique, when applied over the course \nof hours or days or months, and in combination with other techniques, \ncan cross the line into illegality. An interrogator can choose from a \nmenu of coercive approaches, pick several of them, and go to work. So \ndon't be fooled. Even the least coercive-sounding technique, when used \nrelentlessly or in combination, can be torture.\n  Now, in addition to being immoral, I believe the CIA interrogation \nprogram is illegal.\n  I say this as a member of the Intelligence Committee, and I say this \nas one who has been briefed several times on these techniques. These \ntechniques have violated the Convention Against Torture and the U.S. \ntorture statute by inflicting severe physical or mental pain or \nsuffering to others. It has violated Geneva Convention common article \nIII, which prohibits outrages upon personal dignity, in particular \nhumiliating and degrading treatment.\n  The medical research is clear. Coercive techniques cause severe pain \nand suffering. That is why both the AMA and the American Psychological \nAssociation have passed resolutions against their members participating \nin such interrogations.\n  In a letter dated September 13, 2006, retired General and former \nSecretary of State Powell wrote this:\n\n       The world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our \n     fight against terrorism.\n\n  I think that says it in a nutshell. As every Member knows, we will \nnever win the war on terror by capturing or killing or torturing all \nour enemies. We will only win the war by our ideals and by removing any \npublic support for al-Qaida's vision.\n  Using torture cuts away from our moral high ground. It takes America \ninto the ``dark side,'' and thus it reduces our ability to win this \nwar. I believe we should end this now.\n  The military is the segment of the U.S. population most likely to be \ncaptured and interrogated by our enemies. They know any technique we \nauthorize can be used against them, and that is the point. If the \nUnited States uses waterboarding, you can be sure that waterboarding \nwill be used against our station agents, against our military. It is a \nmistake to do so.\n  That is why 43 retired generals and admirals, including 10 four-star \nofficers, have signed a letter to Congress denouncing coercive \ntechniques and supporting the single unified uniform standard for the \nentire Government, the Army Field Manual.\n  Here is what they wrote:\n\n       We believe that it is vital to the safety of our men and \n     women in uniform that the United States not sanction the use \n     of interrogation methods it would find unacceptable if \n     inflicted by the enemy against captured Americans. That \n     principle, embedded in the Army Field Manual, has guided \n     generations of military personnel in combat.\n\n  And the letter goes on.\n  I have listened to the experts such as FBI Director Mueller and DIA \nDirector General Maples. They all insist that even with hardened \nterrorists you get more and better intelligence with the gloves on than \nwhen you take them off.\n  The CIA cannot show that coercive techniques are more effective than \nnoncoercive techniques. And I wish I could say what I know from a \nclassified setting, but I cannot. They point to the anecdotes they have \ndeclassified, while the counterexamples remain classified.\n  So I can only summarize and say this: This is the moment where the \nSenate stands up. The House has stood up. They have passed a bill. If \nwe want to ban waterboarding, if we want to ban the eight techniques \nbanned by the Army Field Manual, this is our moment to do so. I think \nwe should stand tall. I think we should adhere to our principles. I \nthink we should raise what we say internally and once again regain the \nworld's credibility. I hope we maintain the Senate bill as it is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, action on the fiscal year 2008 \nauthorization bill for intelligence is so long overdue I do not even \nknow how to explain it. It is over 2 years overdue. It is a very \nimportant bill.\n  Beginning in 1978, after the two congressional intelligence \ncommittees were established, the Congress passed an annual intelligence \nauthorization bill every year. It does not sound interesting, but it \nhas a great deal to do with how the intelligence community operates. We \npassed it for 27 consecutive years. And there was no exception to that. \nThis legislation was one of very few nonappropriations measures that \nCongress has always considered ``must pass.'' Yet we have failed to \npass it for the last number of years, and it is a matter of \nconsternation.\n  The importance of our intelligence programs to our national security \nhas always been very obvious. The importance of strong congressional \noversight of the intelligence activities has been equally obvious; \nalthough it has been spottier in the recent past, it no longer is.\n  Then in 2005 and 2006, the bills reported out of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee were never brought to the Senate for \nconsideration. There were internal reasons for that. I will spare the \nPresiding Officer from a discussion of those matters, and it is no \nlonger important why.\n  But we have to do this bill. The intelligence authorization bill is \nthe tool the Congress uses to provide direction, specific direction, \nand to enforce the oversight that we do. It involves many of the most \nsensitive national security programs conducted by the U.S. Government.\n  The 2008 authorization bill includes provisions to improve the \nefficiency of the intelligence community. It is a bland statement, but \nit is a very important series of parts. The bill produces better \nintelligence. We provided flexibility and authority to the DNI. We gave \nhim a tremendous responsibility and then did not give him enough \nflexibility to exercise that responsibility. We do that in this bill.\n\n  We require much greater accountability from the intelligence \ncommunity. That is oversight. We require greater accountability from \nthe intelligence community and its managers. We improve the mechanisms \nfor conducting oversight of intelligence programs and we reform \nintelligence program acquisition procedures. All of that is oversight.\n  Many of the provisions were included at the request of the National \nIntelligence Director in this bill. I always believe in reaching out to \nthe professionals in doing this.\n  The creation of the DNI position was the result of the most \nsignificant reform of the intelligence community in 50 years. And the \ncurrent DNI, ADM\n\n[[Page S929]]\n\nMike McConnell, is absolutely superb. The Office of Director of \nNational Intelligence has now existed for 2\\1/2\\ years, and we have \nbegun identifying ways to help the DNI better coordinate the 16 \nelements of the intelligence community, which are scattered around the \nGovernment, some of which do a very good job and some of which do not. \nNow he is pulling all of this together and he is doing a good job.\n  Starting with personnel authority, this bill uses a much more \nflexible approach to authorizing personnel levels. Those are very \ndelicate. We also give the DNI the ability to exceed personnel ceilings \nby as much as 3 percent because he needs to have that. He is in the \nprocess of trying to figure out how to adjust all of this and work it \nright. He needs flexibility. It also provides additional flexibility to \nencourage the DNI to convert contractor positions to Government \nemployees when appropriate.\n  Every Member knows the real power is the power of the purse. It is \nthe same with the DNI. And this bill changes reprogramming requirements \nto make it easier to address, as they say, emerging needs in critical \nsituations, a crisis. We give him the financial flexibility to do that. \nHe needs that flexibility, and he now will have it if we pass this \nbill.\n  It authorizes the DNI to use interagency funding amongst his various \nagencies that he oversees to establish national intelligence centers if \nhe so chooses. The bill also allows the DNI to fund information-sharing \nefforts across the intelligence community. That was the whole point of \nthe 9/11 Commission. That is the whole point of reducing stovepipes.\n  Finally, it repeals several unneeded and burdensome reporting \nrequirements. Frankly, we can use up a lot of people's time on \nsomething that we no longer need. We reduce some reporting requirements \nwithout in any way compromising accountability because oversight is the \nwhole point of this bill.\n  As it increases the authority of the DNI, the bill also improves \noversight of the intelligence community in other ways. The bill creates \na strong independent inspector general in the office of the DNI. It has \nto be confirmed by the Senate. That is called oversight. Confirmed by \nthe Senate. That means it has to report to the committee. Accountable \nto the committee. It has to tell us the truth. Confirmation allows \ninspectors general to do very difficult things within their own \ndepartments that maybe some of the leaders will not do.\n  It establishes statutory inspectors general in the National Security \nAgency, the NRO, the NGA and the Defense Intelligence Agency. So these \nare all there. They are all accountable. They are all oversight tools \nthat we want.\n  The bill also gives the Congress more oversight of the major \nintelligence agencies by requiring Senate confirmation of the Directors \nof NSA and NRO. Right now we do not have to confirm them. If we do not \nconfirm, that means they do not have the same relationship with the \nSenate. We confirm the CIA, but we do not confirm the NSA.\n  You tell me, particularly after we passed the FISA bill yesterday, \nhow is it possible that we would not be able to confirm the head of the \nNational Security Agency as well under this bill? We can, which makes \nhim accountable to us, which means he reports to us, which means we can \ndo oversight over him much more aggressively.\n  As we describe in our conference report:\n\n       . . . of the need for NSA's authorized collection to be \n     consistent with the protection of the civil liberties and \n     private interests of U.S. persons.\n\n  Through confirmation of the NSA Director, we can ensure that \ncontinues or starts to be so.\n  As we increase the DNI's flexibility to manage personnel, we require \nan annual assessment. That sounds boring, but, no, it is not. It is \nvery important--an annual assessment of personnel levels across the \nintelligence community: How are they distributed? Are they in the right \nplace? Are people protecting their turf? The DNI is in charge of this. \nWe want to give him all the support, and we want this all reported to \nus in our committee so we can watch it.\n  We also required the inclusion of a statement that those levels are \nsupported by adequate infrastructure, training, funding, and a review \nof the appropriate use of contractors, which has become a very \ninteresting subject in these months and years.\n  This bill also addresses an issue that has concerned the committee \nfor a long time, the lack of accountability for failures and \nprogrammatic blunders. That is called oversight.\n  We want accountability. We want it in front of us. We want our hands \non it. The bill gives the DNI the authority to conduct accountability \nreviews across the intelligence community if he deems it necessary or \nif we request it in our committee. It is called oversight.\n  This also improves financial management by requiring a variety of \nactions related to the production of auditable financial statements. \nThat sounds pretty boring, but, no, it is not. When you get into the \nintelligence community, when you get to classified numbers, things of \nthat sort, it is very important to have someone watching. That is \noversight. We will have that if this bill passes.\n  The final major theme in the bill is the reform of the acquisition \nprocess. The bill requires a vulnerability assessment of all major \nacquisition programs. Well, acquisition is a very large word in \nintelligence and a very expensive word. We have made some very big \nmistakes, we have not been able to correct them.\n  But that is a discussion for another day. So we have a classified \nannex. Any Senator who wants to look at what is behind all of those \nnumbers can do that very easily.\n  I have other things I wish to talk about, particularly the Army Field \nManual. But I have a whole different speech awaiting my colleagues on \nthat later in the day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague with whom I have worked \nclosely on this and many other matters.\n  One of the most important means that Congress has for conducting \noversight of the intelligence community is through the annual \nauthorization bill for the intelligence agency. Regrettably, we can't \ncall it an annual Intelligence Authorization bill because Congress was \nunable to pass a bill in 2006 and 2007. Unfortunately, it appears we \nare on a path that may prevent us from getting an authorization bill \nsigned for fiscal year 2008.\n  When I assumed the duties as vice chairman of the select committee at \nthe beginning of this Congress, one of my top priorities--and that of \nthe committee--was to get an Intelligence Authorization bill signed \ninto law. During the first month of our tenure, we tried to resuscitate \nthe fiscal year 2007 bill but could not get it out of the Senate. When \nthe time came to fashion a bill for fiscal year 2008, we had better \nluck. But as Louis Pasteur once said, ``Chance favors the prepared \nmind.'' The committee worked hard to include in the chairman and vice \nchairman's mark only those provisions that had strong bipartisan \nsupport. Our rule was if either side objected to a provision, it would \nnot be included. After our markup, we added a number of other good \ngovernment provisions that had strong bipartisan support. \nUnfortunately, the committee also added a number of problematic \nprovisions that caused our bill to stall on the floor.\n  I believed we had largely succeeded in our process of accomplishing \nthe goals of a bipartisan bill. We worked closely with the \nadministration to address some of their concerns. Some were easier to \nresolve than others. We all know there is one very problematic \namendment relating to the Army Field Manual that was added during the \nconference between the House and the Senate. I will address that later. \nBut now I wish to talk about some of the good things in this conference \nreport.\n  First, I have often said--and I believe responsible observers now \nagree--that in creating the Director of National Intelligence, we gave \nhim a tremendous amount of responsibility but darn little authority to \nget the job done. This conference report attempts to address that \nproblem by giving the DNI clearer authority and greater flexibility to \noversee the intelligence community. For example, section 410 gives the \nDNI statutory authority to use national intelligence program funds \nquickly to address deficiencies or needs relating to\n\n[[Page S930]]\n\nintelligence information or access or sharing capabilities. The DNI may \nalso use funds to pay for non-NIP--national intelligence program--\nactivities and to address critical gaps in those areas.\n  Section 409 expands the number of officials in the office of the DNI \nwho can protect sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure. This \nauthority may now be delegated to the Principal Deputy Director of \nNational Intelligence and the chief information officer of the \nintelligence community. These are all good things, all things the \nadministration needs. We also included provisions that will ensure that \nthe men and women of our intelligence community who must work \nundercover may do so at less risk of disclosure and, consequently, less \nrisk to their personal safety.\n  Section 305 allows the DNI to delegate the authority to authorize \ntravel on any common carrier for purposes of preserving cover of \ncertain employees. Section 325 extends to the head of each intelligence \ncommunity element the authority to exempt certain gifts from otherwise \napplicable reporting requirements. Without this exemption, detailed \ninformation about the receipt of gifts from foreign governments must be \npublished in the Federal Register. Imagine if an undercover agent \nreceives a gift from one of the targets he is working and has to report \nit in the Federal Register. That not only blows his cover, it probably \nends his life. That is a great national security concern to operatives \nwho have received such gifts as part of their covert actions.\n  One particular provision will reduce the personnel and resources used \nto respond to many congressional reporting requirements. In section \n330--again, in response to a request of the DNI--we eliminated a number \nof reporting requirements. It is a small step but an important one, as \neach reporting requirement diverts valuable resources from the intended \npurpose. I hope, within the 2009 Intelligence Authorization bill, we \ncan make even greater progress in reducing unnecessary and duplicative \nreporting requirements that burden the intelligence community.\n  There are a number of provisions in this conference report that are \nessential for promoting good government. Too often we have seen \nprograms or acquisitions of major systems balloon in cost and decrease \nin performance. That is unacceptable. We as taxpayers are spending \nsubstantial sums of money to ensure that the intelligence community has \nthe tools it needs to keep us safe. If we don't demand accountability \nin how these tools are operated or created, then we are failing the \ntaxpayers. We are failing the intelligence community. We are failing \nthe mission I would hope we all agree is essential.\n  I sponsored several amendments that require the intelligence \ncommunity to perform vulnerability assessments of major systems and to \nkeep track of excessive cost growth of major systems. This latter \nprovision is modeled on the Nunn-McCurdy provision which has guided \nDefense Department acquisitions for years. I believe these provisions \nwill encourage earlier identification, the solving of problems relating \nto the acquisition of major systems. Too often such problems have not \nbeen identified until exorbitant sums of money have been spent. In some \ncases, several billions of dollars have been blown before the waste \nstopped. Unfortunately, too often, once they have sunk a bunch of money \ninto a project, they refuse to cancel it, even though they are \ncontinuing to throw good money after bad.\n  Similarly, the intelligence community must get a handle on their \npersonnel. I don't share the belief some have that the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence is too large. In fact, I think we \nneed to make sure our National Counterterrorism Center and National \nCounterproliferation Center have more resources, not less. They are the \nultimate idea for creating a centralized intelligence community, \nbringing analysts and collectors together from all of the 16 different \nelements of the community.\n  I am concerned about the number of contractors used by the \nintelligence community to perform functions better left to Government \nemployees. There are some jobs that demand the use of contractors--for \nexample, certain technical jobs or short-term functions--but too often \nthe quick fix is to hire contractors, not long-term support. So this \nconference report includes a provision calling for an annual personnel \nlevel assessment for the intelligence community. These assessments will \nensure that before more people are brought in, there are adequate \nresources to support them and enough work to keep them busy.\n\n  Finally, we have included section 312, which requires the DNI to \ncreate a business enterprise architecture that defines all intelligence \ncommunity business systems. The endgame is to encourage implementation \nof interoperable intelligence community business systems, getting \neveryone on the same page; in sum, making sure everybody is talking to \neach other and everybody who needs to know can listen in, a simple but \nnot-yet-achieved objective. Given the substantial sums of money we are \nspending on these systems, we should be making certain the systems are \nefficiently and effectively coordinated; again, a good government \nprovision.\n  There were a number of adjustments we had to make. We responded to \nconcerns of the administration, and I worked particularly with my \nDemocratic colleagues--and I thank them for their support--to make \nadjustments that would allow the bill to clear the Senate for the first \ntime in 2 years. Let me highlight some of those adjustments because it \nis important to remember how much effort it took to return the bill to \na bipartisan state.\n  No. 1, we struck a section that would have required the President to \nprovide Congress with any President's daily brief involving Iraq during \na certain time period. The PDBs have not been disclosed. As a matter of \nfact, they only came to light when a former official in the previous \nadministration put some PDBs in his BVDs and stuck them out at the \narchives for reasons no one has adequately explained.\n  We struck two sections that contained controversial notification and \nfunding restrictions. We struck a provision requiring declassification \nof the budgetary top line of the national intelligence program because \nit had already passed Congress in S. 4, the so-called 9/11 bill. We \nstruck a section that required the CIA Director to make available to \nthe public a declassified version of a CIA inspector general report on \nCIA accountability related to the terrorist attacks. That was also \nrequired by S. 4. It was about time the CIA internal IG report be made \navailable. Everybody else had to air their failings, and it was time \nthe CIA did so as well.\n  We struck a section that would have allowed the public interest \ndeclassification board to conduct declassification reviews at the \nrequest of Congress, regardless of whether the review is requested by \nthe President. We also struck a provision that would have required a \nnational intelligence estimate on global climate change, largely \nbecause the DNI, which is not equipped to conduct an NIE on climate \nchange, had outsourced the responsibility for putting together an \nassessment, and there was no need to mandate this in law.\n  Finally, we made modifications to at least seven other provisions to \naddress concerns raised by the administration and by our Senate \ncolleagues. The end result was, we get a fiscal year 2008 Intelligence \nAuthorization bill passed out of the Senate by unanimous consent in \nearly October 2007. I thank my colleagues for allowing us to do that. \nIt was long overdue, and it was a badly needed action. Then, however, \nwe went to conference.\n  I urged my conferees to avoid inclusion of controversial provisions. \nWe kept our negotiations to the base text of both bills. Given that we \nhadn't had an intel bill during the past 2 years, there were a lot \nprovisions to negotiate. I guess you could say there was a lot of pent-\nup oversight. After a lot of hard work, we were able to merge the two \nbills in a manner we believed would receive strong bipartisan support. \nUnfortunately, despite my warnings, history again repeated itself. \nDuring the conference markup, the Senate adopted, by a one-vote margin, \na controversial provision that limits the intelligence community to \nusing only those interrogation techniques authorized by the U.S. Army \nField Manual on human intelligence collector operations. As I will \ndiscuss later, to adopt that provision and put it into law\n\n[[Page S931]]\n\nwould, according to the Director of the CIA, shut down the most \nvaluable intelligence collection program the CIA has, a program that \nhas protected our homeland and our troops abroad from terrorist \nattacks. Because it was adopted, I couldn't sign the conference report \nthat I and my colleagues worked so hard to enact.\n  Another consequence of that vote was it caused the conference report \nto languish in the Senate for more than 2 months now. Shortly after the \npassage of the conference report, the administration released a \nstatement of administration policy and--certainly not to my surprise--\nat the top of their list of objectionable provisions was the limitation \non interrogation techniques provisions. We have heard some \nmisstatements on this floor about interrogation and the techniques \nused. Frankly, I share some of the same concerns raised by the \nadministration with respect to this provision. Statements made about \nthe interrogation program of the CIA are not accurate. They have been \nblown totally out of context, and they deserve a response. This \nsection, if it were enacted in law--and it will not be--would prevent \nthe intelligence community from conducting the interrogation of senior \nal-Qaida terrorists to obtain intelligence needed to protect the \ncountry from attack.\n  During its consideration of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, \nCongress wisely decided that while the Army Field Manual was a good \nstandard for military interrogators who number in the tens of \nthousands, with limited supervision and limited training, it was not \nthe standard that should be used by the CIA.\n  CIA interrogators are highly trained, operate under tremendous \noversight and rules and supervision in interrogating those top hardened \nterrorist leaders, who have information on how the system operates and \nwho the major players are. They do not outsource this job to \ncontractors such as Blackwater or others. It is my understanding if \nthey use contractors, it is former interrogators who are brought back \nin because of their experience. They are subject to the supervision of \nthe CIA, with multiple layers of supervision and oversight by video \ncameras. It is highly irresponsible to say the CIA has outsourced \ntorture. We do not do torture.\n  Now, a lot of people say we have lost a lot because of our inhumane \ntreatment. They are referring to Abu Ghraib. We all agree that what was \ndone at Abu Ghraib was inhuman and degrading. But it was not done by \nanybody in the intelligence field or for intelligence purposes. It was \ndone by renegade troops who have been prosecuted, punished, and \nimprisoned for the violations of basic decency. Yes, that has hurt us \nworldwide, but that is not the standard which is allowable, \npermissible, or acceptable by any of our interrogators.\n  Mention has been made of eight techniques that are banned in the Army \nField Manual. I agree, those techniques that are banned in the Army \nField Manual should be banned. Those are not techniques that should be \nused. The Army Field Manual was meant for the Army in limiting the \nnumber of techniques that can be used. It applies to them only for the \nArmy, for the Army's use. There are quite a number of techniques that \nfall within the same category that are not torture, inhuman, degrading, \nor cruel. If they are not included in the Army Field Manual, then they \nwould not be permitted to be used, if this were made law, by the CIA, \nthe FBI, or anybody else.\n  But to apply the Army Field Manual--it says you can only use these \ninterrogation techniques if you get authorization from ``the first 0-6 \nin the interrogator's chain-of-command''--well, that would mean the CIA \nwould have to go over to the Army and say: Do you have an 0-6 who can \ncome over and look over the shoulders of our interrogators? Well, you \ndo not have to worry about that because the CIA program would be \nending.\n  It allows the Army to set the interrogation standards for the entire \nintelligence community. It is important that my colleagues recognize \nthis interrogation provision is not an antitorture provision. The \nprevious speakers have said we need to pass this law to outlaw torture. \nIt is outlawed. The law prohibits the United States from using torture. \nThis provision prevents the intelligence community from engaging in \nother lawful interrogation techniques that fall outside the scope of \nthe Army Field Manual.\n  Why is that important? Because everything in the Army Field Manual \nhas been published in the al-Qaida manuals. The top officials of al-\nQaida know those techniques better than the interrogators know them. \nThey know how to resist them, and they are ineffective.\n  Now, some on the other side of the aisle would like to frame this \nprovision as being about waterboarding. It is not.\n  The Attorney General has publicly stated that the CIA no longer uses \nwaterboarding. The technique is not one of the approved techniques. The \nDirector of the CIA has publicly stated that there were only three \nindividuals waterboarded and the technique has not been used since \n2003. It was used in the crisis right after 2001, when tremendous \namounts of valuable information were gained from the three individuals \nwaterboarded.\n  What we are talking about here is not waterboarding. Some of my \ncolleagues have said that the EITs are not effective--enhanced \ninterrogation techniques. Well, that is absolutely not true. That is \nprecisely the opposite of what the CIA Director has told us in our \nclassified hearings and explained it.\n  Now, the CIA Director has said they have held less than 100 people in \ntheir custody, and less than one-third of those have been submitted to \nenhanced interrogation techniques.\n  These are the hardened terrorists who have the most information that \nis needed to protect our troops, our allies abroad, and those of us \nhere at home.\n  Those techniques--which are different from but no harsher than the \ntechniques that are in the Army Field Manual--are unknown to the \ndetainees. Those detainees on whom the EITs--not including \nwaterboarding--have been used have produced the most productive \ninformation and intelligence. Literally thousands upon thousands of the \nmost important intelligent collections have come from the cooperating \ndetainees who did not know what was going to happen to them, even \nthough no torture, cruel, inhuman, or degrading techniques were used on \nthem.\n  Many of the techniques that are used--and I have reviewed them--are \nfar less coercive or strenuous than what we apply to our military \nvolunteers: young men and women of America who join the Marines, the \nSEALs, the Special Operations Forces, or pilots who go through \nthe survival, evasion, resistance, and escape training, or the SERE \ntraining. We do not even use the most strenuous of those techniques on \nour detainees.\n\n  Those who say we do not want our enemies to use any more harsh \ntechniques than we use on them--well, good luck. You have seen Abu \nMusab al-Zarqawi beheading people. Those are not techniques that \nanybody would suggest. A beheading probably eliminates a source of \nfurther information.\n  But the problem is, the techniques that are used would be banned. The \ntechniques--that are not cruel, that are not inhuman, that are used on \nour own voluntary military enlistees--are prohibited because they are \nnot included in the Army Field Manual. One good reason they are not is \nbecause we do not want to publicize them or they would no longer be \neffective in use against those high-value detainees who will not \ncooperate otherwise. I cannot support a bill that contains that \nprovision.\n  So here we are on the floor--the farthest we have gotten in 3 years. \nIt looks as though history is going to repeat itself. No wonder \ncongressional ratings are at an all-time low. I believe our inability \nto work in a bipartisan fashion on a consistent basis may be harming \nus. Yesterday's success with the FISA Amendments Act is a model example \nof what can be accomplished when we work together. For the most part, \nthe committee's work on the Intel bill followed that model, although we \nwere unable to protect the bipartisan compromise in the end.\n  As the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have \ninvested a very significant amount of time and effort to provide \nmeaningful\n\n[[Page S932]]\n\noversight of the intelligence community through this bill. I know my \ndistinguished chairman, Senator Rockefeller, has made those same \nefforts and shares the goal.\n  However, I have often said that no bill is better than a bad bill. \nRight now, with this provision in it, this is a bad bill because what \nit would do, according to the Director of National Intelligence, is to \nshut down the most effective interrogation program the CIA has to use \nto induce cooperation from those leaders of al-Qaida and other \nterrorist organizations who know about the plots to attack the United \nStates and to attack our allies.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support cloture so we can move \nforward on the process on this legislation, but the President has \nstated he will veto the bill and, regrettably, I must say that despite \nall the good things in the bill, he is correct. We cannot afford the \nrisk to this country, to our personal safety, to our desire to avoid \nanother 9/11, by saying we can no longer allow the CIA to use the \nacceptable techniques that are not published but that are very \neffective in assuring cooperation of high-value detainees whom we in \nthis country capture through the CIA. Regrettably, while I urge my \ncolleagues to support cloture, I cannot urge them to pass this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining at this \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave my time--you said I have 3 minutes; I see my friend on the floor--\nto have my time extended by 3 minutes so I would have a total of 6 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOND. That is acceptable. No objection.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes after \nthat, if that could be part of the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, thank you, and I thank my friend from \nMissouri as well.\n  I especially want to express my appreciation for the outstanding work \nof Senator Feinstein, my seatmate on the Intelligence Committee, who I \nthink understands it is possible in this country to fight terrorism \nferociously and still be sensitive to American values and the rule of \nlaw. That is what I want to spend a few minutes talking about because I \nthink under the approach developed by Senator Feinstein this \nlegislation does that.\n  I start by responding to the point my friend from Missouri has made \nabout the most dangerous terrorists whom we are involved in \ninterrogating. It seems to me these individuals are literally human \nticking timebombs. They have information, for example, about operations \nwe absolutely must have information on in order to protect the American \npeople. But I have come to the conclusion it is possible to get this \nessential information we need from these human ticking timebombs--the \ntime-sensitive threat information--without practices that violate our \nvalues and violate the rule of law.\n  The reason I have come to that conclusion--and why I so strongly \nsupport what Senator Feinstein is doing--that is what some of our key \nofficials tell us in the executive branch. For example, this week, I \nasked FBI Director Mueller about whether it was possible to use \nnoncoercive techniques effectively in terms of getting this information \nfrom human ticking timebombs, and the Director said, to his credit, \nyes, it was possible to use noncoercive techniques to get the \ninformation necessary to protect the United States of America. The fact \nis, the military has said it as well.\n  It is that core principle Senator Feinstein has picked up in her \nwork. She believes, as I do, we will take no backseat to anyone in \nterms of fighting the terrorists relentlessly, but we can do it, as \nDirector Mueller and the military have said, in line with the rule of \nlaw and in line with American values.\n  With respect to the role of the military, they already abide by \ninterrogation rules that are flexible and effective. They have been \nused by professional military interrogators with many years of \nexperience, and they are clearly effective.\n  Some have suggested, incorrectly in my view, that the military rules \nmake better interrogators, follow the same rules as new recruits, but \nthat is not right. The Army Field Manual actually makes it quite clear \nwhich techniques are authorized for all servicemembers and which \nrequire special permission to use.\n  It is my view that our country has paid dearly for this secret \ninterrogation program. My friend from Missouri has indicated, in his \nview, you cannot torture, but the case was strong for the Feinstein \namendment a couple months ago, and it is even stronger today because \nGeneral Hayden has said that in the past, waterboarding has been used \nand, in fact, my view is that the need for this legislation, just on \nthe basis of the developments over the last few weeks, is even more \nimportant than it was because these practices that have come to light \nin the last few weeks have damaged our relations, damaged our moral \nauthority.\n  The tragic part of this, on the basis of the answers from Mr. Mueller \nin open session this week and the military is that these coercive \ntechniques are not effective or even necessary. I share the view of my \nfriend from Missouri about how important it is to get this time-\nsensitive threat information.\n  He and I have talked about this on many occasions. Of course, we \ncannot get into any of the matters that are classified. I share his \nview, but it is possible, I say to my colleagues, to get that \ninformation without breaching the values Americans hold dearly and the \nrule of law.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the important work by the Senator \nfrom California. This is an issue we have looked at. It has had \nbipartisan support in the past.\n  I am very appreciative of what Senator McCain, who knows a little bit \nabout this, has had to say in the past about fighting terrorism \nrelentlessly and protecting our values.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the efforts of the Senator from \nCalifornia. If her case was strong several months ago, I think it is \neven stronger today on the basis of what we have learned in open \nsession.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I support the intelligence authorization \nconference report, which is so important to Congress's efforts to \nconduct oversight of the intelligence community. The administration's \nillegal actions and its relentless efforts to obtain vast new \neavesdropping authorities make oversight more important than ever. I \nparticularly support the provision limiting interrogation techniques to \nthose authorized by the Army Field Manual. I was a cosponsor of this \namendment when it was offered in conference, and I am pleased that it \nhas the support of bipartisan majorities of both the Senate and House \nIntelligence Committees. It represents, at long last, an important step \ntoward bringing this administration into conformity with the law and \nwith our national principles. It also represents a clear decision by \nthe very Members of Congress who have been briefed on the CIA's \ninterrogation program that the use of so-called enhanced interrogation \ntechniques is not in our country's best interests.\n  When the intelligence authorization bill was marked up by the \ncommittee in May, I made my position clear. I could not support the \nCIA's program on moral, legal, or national security grounds. When I was \nfinally fully briefed on the program, it was clear that what was going \non was profoundly wrong. It did not represent what we, as a nation, \nstand for, or what we are fighting for in this global struggle against \nal-Qaida. And it was not making our country any safer. I also concluded \nthat if the American people knew what we in the Intelligence Committee \nknew, they would agree.\n  The program also cannot stand up to any serious legal scrutiny. To \ntake just one interrogation technique that the administration has \nacknowledged using in the past, waterboarding is torture, pure and \nsimple. Everyone knows this. The rest of the world knows this. And, in \nevery other context, our own government knows this. What Orwellian\n\n[[Page S933]]\n\nworld do we inhabit in which the administration attempts to argue \notherwise? And in what world does waterboarding not ``shock the \nconscience,'' the test required by the Detainee Treatment Act? I \nsuspect that the administration knows full well that its legal \njustifications for the program are empty, and that is why the Attorney \nGeneral has refused to tell Congress why he believes the program is \nlegal and has instead referenced Justice Department analyses that have \nalso been withheld from Congress.\n  The CIA's interrogation policy is undermining our ability to fight \nal-Qaida. It has diminished our standing in the world, precisely when \nwe should be providing global leadership against this growing threat. \nAnd it has denied us the moral high ground that is so critical if we \nare to reach out to parts of the world in which al-Qaida seeks to \noperate and recruit. By passing this conference report, we can begin to \nreverse this damage. We can also, finally, reassure our troops that \ntorture is torture and that if you are captured by the enemy, the \nAmerican government will not equivocate about the Geneva Conventions \nprotections to which you are entitled.\n  The administration has repeatedly attempted to sell this program by \narguing that Members of Congress have been briefed, as if the mere fact \nof telling members of Congress means that the program must be legal. \nThe President made this argument last fall. And the Director of the CIA \ndid so again last week. But, what the administration always fails to \nmention is that as members of the Intelligence Committees have learned \nabout the program, opposition has steadily increased. I have sent a \nclassified letter detailing my serious concerns and so, too, have \nothers. And now, we have bipartisan majorities of both intelligence \ncommittees saying ``enough is enough.''\n  It has long been my position that interrogation techniques should be \nlimited to those authorized by the Army Field Manual. This approach \nbrings the CIA into conformity with the rules by which our men and \nwomen in uniform defend our nation and themselves. We fought Nazi \nGermany and the battles of the Cold War without resorting to \ngovernment-sanctioned torture. We can surely defend America and defend \nour principles now. It is time to bring an end to this stain on our \nNation, and to make the American people proud again.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, this Report contains a provision that \nreinforces the prohibition against our Government engaging in torture. \nIt expressly prohibits interrogation techniques that are not authorized \nby the United States Army Field Manual. By passing this bill, we will \nnot only respond to this administration's ambiguity about torture by \nreiterating that it is off the table, we will be sending a message to \nthe world that the United States is a country that does not tolerate \ntorture. Whether waterboarding is torture and illegal does not depend \non the circumstances.\n  When it comes to our core values--that which makes our country great \nand defines America's place in the world--it does not depend on the \ncircumstances. America, the great and good Nation that has been a \nbeacon to the world on human rights, does not torture and should stand \nagainst torture.\n  Let me be clear. This provision should not be necessary. \nWaterboarding, and other forms of torture, are already clearly illegal. \nWaterboarding has been recognized as torture for the last 500 years. \nPresident Teddy Roosevelt prosecuted American soldiers for \nwaterboarding more than 100 years ago. We prosecuted Japanese soldiers \nfor waterboarding Americans during World War II.\n  I support this provision, despite the fact that there is no question \nthat waterboarding is already illegal, because this administration has \nchosen to ignore the law. They have admitted they have engaged in \nwaterboarding, otherwise known as water torture, and they refuse to say \nthey will not do it again. The positions they have taken publicly on \nthis subject are, I believe, so destructive to the core values of this \nNation and our standing in the world, that this Congress should say, \nagain--very clearly--that our Government is not permitted to engage in \nthese shameful practices.\n  Tragically, this administration has so twisted America's role, laws \nand values that our own State Department and high-ranking officials in \nour Department of Justice cannot say that waterboarding of an American \nis illegal. If an enemy decided to waterboard an American soldier, they \ncan now quote statements from high officials in our own Government to \nsupport their argument that the technique breaks no laws. That is how \nlow we have sunk.\n  Our top military lawyers and our generals and admirals understand \nthis issue. They have said consistently that waterboarding is torture \nand is illegal. They have told us again and again at hearings and in \nletters that intelligence gathered through cruel techniques like \nwaterboarding is not reliable, and that our use and endorsement of \nthese techniques puts our brave men and women serving in the armed \nforces at risk. That is why they have so explicitly prohibited such \ntechniques in their own Army Field Manual, and it is an example that \nthe rest of the Government should follow.\n  So, despite the fact that the law is already clear, I urge the Senate \nto pass this provision, and I urge the President to promptly sign it \ninto law, making the policy of our Nation clear. Our values cannot \npermit this to be an open question. We must put an end to the damage \nthat this administration's positions have caused to our standing and \nthe risks that they have taken with the safety of American citizens and \nsoldiers around the world.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nintelligence authorization conference report which includes a \nrequirement that all Government agencies, including the CIA, comply \nwith the Army Field Manual on Interrogations in the treatment and \ninterrogation of detainees.\n  The result will be a single standard of treatment for detainees, a \nstandard consistent with American values and international standards. \nThe Army Field Manual is consistent with our obligations under Common \nArticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which prohibits subjecting \ndetainees to ``cruel treatment and torture.'' This is the standard to \nwhich our soldiers are trained and which they live by.\n  Consistent with this standard, the Army Field Manual specifically \nprohibits certain interrogation techniques. These include: forced \nnudity; ``waterboarding,'' that is, inducing the sensation of drowning; \nusing military working dogs in interrogations; subjecting detainees to \nextreme temperatures; and mock executions.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration has insisted that it reserves \nthe right for the CIA to engage in certain ``enhanced interrogation \ntechniques.'' It has been reported that these CIA techniques include \n``waterboarding.'' While this Justice Department continues to refuse to \nsay one way or the other, let there be no doubt: waterboarding is \ntorture.\n  The Judge Advocates General of all four services have told us \nunequivocally that waterboarding is illegal.\n  Requiring that all Government agencies comply with the standards of \nthe Army Field Manual is not mushy intellectualism. It is hard-headed \npragmatism. When we fail to live up to our own standards for humane \ntreatment, we compromise our moral authority. Our security depends on \nthe willingness of others to work with us and share information, \ninformation which could prevent the next attack. When we project moral \nhypocrisy, we lose the support of the world in the fight against the \nextremists.\n  Requiring a single standard for the treatment of detainees consistent \nwith the Army Field Manual protects our men and women in uniform, \nshould they be captured. It strengthens our hand in demanding that \nAmerican prisoners be treated humanely, consistent with values embodied \nin the Field Manual.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the intelligence authorization \nconference report with the provision that standards in the Army Field \nManual for treatment of detainees will apply to all elements of the \nintelligence community.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I oppose the conference report on the \nintelligence authorization bill.\n  I was troubled to learn the Intelligence Committees inserted in the \nconference report a provision to apply\n\n[[Page S934]]\n\nthe Army Field Manual to the CIA program. This was done without any \nhearing or vote in either the House or the Senate.\n  I strongly regret the committee chose this course of action since it \ndenies the Senate the opportunity to fully appreciate the implications \nof such a restriction on the CIA program.\n  It would be a colossal mistake for us to apply the Army Field Manual \nto the operations of the CIA. I have been briefed on the current CIA \nprogram to interrogate high value targets. It is aggressive, effective, \nlawful and in compliance with our legal obligations. Unfortunately, the \nintelligence authorization bill as currently drafted will destroy the \nCIA program.\n  I believe in flexibility for the CIA program within the boundaries of \ncurrent law. The CIA must have the ability to gather intelligence for \nthe war on terror. In this new war, knowledge of the enemy and its plan \nis vitally important and the Army Field Manual provision will weaken \nour intelligence gathering operations.\n  It is regrettable that the debate on the intelligence authorization \nbill has become a debate about waterboarding. Waterboarding is not part \nof the CIA program.\n  However, waterboarding, under any circumstances, represents a clear \nviolation of U.S. law and it was the clear intent of Congress to \nprohibit this practice. In 2005 and 2006, the Senate overwhelmingly and \nin a bipartisan fashion stood up against cruel, inhuman and degrading \ntreatment and abided by the Supreme Court's decision in the Hamdan case \nthat that those in our custody are protected by the Geneva Conventions. \nIndeed, senior administration officials assured us that the language \ncontained in the Military Commissions Act clearly outlawed \nwaterboarding.\n  Imagine my surprise when the Attorney General and Director of \nNational Intelligence stated that waterboarding may be legal in certain \ncircumstances. I cannot understand what legal reasoning could possibly \nlead them to this conclusion.\n  Given the Attorney General's recognition during his nomination \nhearing that the President cannot waive congressionally mandated \nrestrictions on interrogation techniques, including those included in \nthe McCain amendment and the Military Commissions Act, it is \ninexplicable that the administration not only has failed to publicly \ndeclare waterboarding illegal, but has actually indicated that it may \nbe legal.\n  During the past several weeks we have heard many justifications for \nthe administration's incomprehensible legal analysis. At the end of the \nday, it appears it is the view of the administration is that the ends \njustify the means and that adhering to our values, laws, and treaty \nobligations will weaken our nation. I strongly disagree.\n  I support aggressive interrogation of detainees in the in the war on \nterror. And the CIA program is a vital component in securing our \nNation. As we interrogate and detain those who are intent on \ndestruction of our country and all those who fight for liberty, we can \nnever forget that we are, first and foremost, Americans. The laws and \nvalues that have built our Nation are a source of strength, not \nweakness, and we will win the war on terror not in spite of devotion to \nour cherished values but because we have held fast to them.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I oppose passage of the intelligence \nauthorization conference report in its current form.\n  During conference proceedings, conferees voted by a narrow margin to \ninclude a provision that would apply the Army Field Manual to the \ninterrogation activities of the Central Intelligence Agency. The \nsponsors of that provision have stated that their goal is to ensure \nthat detainees under American control are not subject to torture. I \nstrongly share this goal, and believe that only by ensuring that the \nUnited States adheres to our international obligations and our deepest \nvalues can we maintain the moral credibility that is our greatest asset \nin the war on terror.\n  That is why I fought for passage of the Detainee Treatment Act, DTA, \nwhich applied the Army Field Manual on interrogation to all military \ndetainees and barred cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment of any \ndetainee held by any agency. In 2006, I insisted that the Military \nCommissions Act, MCA, preserve the undiluted protections of Common \nArticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions for our personnel in the field. And \nI have expressed repeatedly my view that the controversial technique \nknown as ``waterboarding'' constitutes nothing less than illegal \ntorture.\n  Throughout these debates, I have said that it was not my intent to \neliminate the CIA interrogation program, but rather to ensure that the \ntechniques it employs are humane and do not include such extreme \ntechniques as waterboarding. I said on the Senate floor during the \ndebate over the Military Commissions Act, ``Let me state this flatly: \nit was never our purpose to prevent the CIA from detaining and \ninterrogating terrorists. On the contrary, it is important to the war \non terror that the CIA have the ability to do so. At the same time, the \nCIA's interrogation program has to abide by the rules, including the \nstandards of the Detainee Treatment Act.'' This remains my view today.\n  When, in 2005, the Congress voted to apply the field manual to the \nDepartment of Defense, it deliberately excluded the CIA. The field \nmanual, a public document written for military use, is not always \ndirectly translatable to use by intelligence officers. In view of this, \nthe legislation allowed the CIA to retain the capacity to employ \nalternative interrogation techniques. I would emphasize that the DTA \npermits the CIA to use different techniques than the military employs \nbut that it is not intended to permit the CIA to use unduly coercive \ntechniques--indeed, the same act prohibits the use of any cruel, \ninhumane, or degrading treatment.\n  Similarly, as I stated after passage of the Military Commissions Act \nin 2006, nothing contained in that bill would require the closure of \nthe CIA's detainee program; the only requirement was that any such \nprogram be in accordance with law and our treaty obligations, including \nGeneva Common Article 3.\n  The conference report would go beyond any of the recent laws that I \njust mentioned--laws that were extensively debated and considered--by \nbringing the CIA under the Army Field Manual, extinguishing thereby the \nability of that agency to employ any interrogation technique beyond \nthose publicly listed and formulated for military use. I cannot support \nsuch a step because I have not been convinced that the Congress erred \nby deliberately excluding the CIA. I believe that our energies are \nbetter directed at ensuring that all techniques, whether used by the \nmilitary or the CIA, are in full compliance with our international \nobligations and in accordance with our deepest values. What we need is \nnot to tie the CIA to the Army Field Manual but rather to have a good \nfaith interpretation of the statutes that guide what is permissible in \nthe CIA program.\n  This necessarily brings us to the question of waterboarding. \nAdministration officials have stated in recent days that this technique \nis no longer in use, but they have declined to say that it is illegal \nunder current law. I believe that it is clearly illegal and that we \nshould publicly recognize this fact.\n  In assessing the legality of waterboarding, the administration has \nchosen to apply a ``shocks the conscience'' analysis to its \ninterpretation of the DTA. I stated during the passage of that law that \na fair reading of the prohibition on cruel, inhumane, and degrading \ntreatment outlaws waterboarding and other extreme techniques. It is, or \nshould be, beyond dispute that waterboarding ``shocks the conscience.''\n  It is also incontestable that waterboarding is outlawed by the \nMilitary Commissions Act, and it was the clear intent of Congress to \nprohibit the practice. The MCA enumerates grave breaches of Common \nArticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions that constitute offenses under the \nWar Crimes Act. Among these is an explicit prohibition on acts that \ninflict ``serious and non-transitory mental harm,'' which the MCA \nstates ``need not be prolonged.'' Staging a mock execution by inducing \nthe misperception of drowning is a clear violation of this standard. \nIndeed, during the negotiations, we were personally assured by \nadministration officials that this language, which applies to all \nagencies of the U.S. Government, prohibited waterboarding.\n\n[[Page S935]]\n\n  It is unfortunate that the reluctance of officials to stand by this \nstraightforward conclusion has produced in the Congress such \nfrustration that we are today debating whether to apply a military \nfield manual to nonmilitary intelligence activities. It would be far \nbetter, I believe, for the administration to state forthrightly what is \nclear in current law--that anyone who engages in waterboarding, on \nbehalf of any U.S. Government agency, puts himself at risk of criminal \nprosecution and civil liability.\n  We have come a long way in the fight against violent extremists, and \nthe road to victory will be longer still. I support a robust offensive \nto wage and prevail in this struggle. But as we confront those \ncommitted to our destruction, it is vital that we never forget that we \nare, first and foremost, Americans. The laws and values that have built \nour Nation are a source of strength, not weakness, and we will win the \nwar on terror not in spite of devotion to our cherished values but \nbecause we have held fast to them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have enjoyed a good working relationship \nwith my good friend, the Senator from Oregon, but, unfortunately, he \ndid not listen to all the testimony we had from the leaders of the \nintelligence community.\n  While he suggests we must fight terrorism and uphold our values, that \nis precisely what the CIA program is designed to do. Going forward, \nthat is the program that will comport with all our values and our \nviews, but it will be necessary.\n  The CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques, on which he and I have \nhad the opportunity to be briefed, are different from but not outside \nthe scope of those included for use in the Army Field Manual.\n  As I stated previously, the difference is that since they are not \npublished, as the Army Field Manual is, they are not included in the \nal-Qaida handbook, they are not known to high-value targets with whom \nwe may come in contact and be able to capture. We are talking only of a \ncouple or three dozen at the most who require those techniques.\n  He said the FBI Director does not use any harsh techniques. But if \nyou recall, in answer to one of my questions describing one of the \ntechniques one of the FBI interrogators used, it is not in the Army \nField Manual. They use different techniques. They use different \ntechniques, but they would be limited to the Army Field Manual.\n  I suggest that when they are dealing with the criminals who may not \nbe part of an organized terrorist conspiracy, they would not \nnecessarily need to use them.\n  General Hayden did say that waterboarding was used three times in the \npast. He has stated clearly it is not being used now. He stated the \ndifferent enhanced interrogation techniques that are similar to, but \ndifferent from, the Army Field Manual are only used in very limited \ncircumstances, and those circumstances are the circumstances in which \nhigh-value detainees, with knowledge of the organization, the threats \nthey pose, the plots they are planning to undertake, will not talk as \nlong as they are subjected only to techniques they are familiar with in \nthe Army Field Manual.\n  Yes, the CIA, a couple, three dozen, somewhere in there, may have \nused enhanced interrogation techniques. Almost 10,000 valuable pieces \nof information have come from the CIA's program. We are safer in the \nUnited States because we have disrupted plots from Fort Dix to \nLackawanna to Chicago to Torrance, CA--across this Nation--because of \ngood intelligence--electronic surveillance and enhanced interrogation \nof high-value detainees.\n  If we take this step in the Congress, I believe the President will \nveto it, as he should, because to say that the CIA should be fitted \ninto the Army Field Manual standard is, I believe, a real threat to the \neffectiveness of our collection.\n  Regrettably, discussions that imply on this floor that we continue to \nuse or will continue to use any techniques that are cruel, inhumane, \ndegrading or torture is not only simply wrong--flat wrong--but it is \nirresponsible because there are ears and eyes out there in the world, \nAl-Jazeera's and others, who will be picking them up, who will be \ntransmitting them, and who will use that to tar the reputation of our \nintelligence collectors. They do not deserve that. Our security does \nnot deserve that.\n  Let's be clear, we are not talking about any cruel, inhumane, \ndegrading or torture techniques. They are different than what is \npublished in the Army Field Manual. That is the only reason they are \neffective.\n  I regret the measure before us has this ban that will shut down the \nmost valuable source of information our intelligence community has.\n  I cannot urge my colleagues to support final passage of this \nconference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time to make a statement.\n  We are going to vote in a few moments whether to invoke cloture on \nthe intelligence authorization conference report. It is my \nunderstanding the minority is going to support us on this vote. I \nappreciate that very much.\n  America has been without an intelligence authorization bill for \nalmost 3 years. That is certainly long enough. The bill before us \ncontains many important provisions that will strengthen our \nintelligence capabilities to fight terrorism and keep our country safe. \nThe bill includes a number of provisions that will begin to restore \nproper congressional oversight and includes a provision sponsored by \nSenator Feinstein that will require all intelligence professionals in \nthe U.S. Government to adhere to the interrogation standards included \nin the Army Field Manual.\n  I appreciate the work of Senator Feinstein, who has dedicated much of \nher life to making our country safer. She spends untold hours, along \nwith other Intelligence Committee members, in the Hart Building, \nlistening to and evaluating what is happening in the intelligence \ncommunity in our country and around the world. She is a good Senator, \nand her insight into what needs to be done in this instance speaks \nvolumes. I underline and underscore my appreciation for her work. I \nurge all my colleagues to join with me in voting to support her in this \neffort. We will have that opportunity because cloture is going to be \ninvoked.\n  It is my understanding a Republican or a Democrat will raise a point \nof order regarding the Feinstein amendment. The reason a Democrat would \ndo it is to move this along, to get this over with. There is no reason \nto wait 30 hours postcloture, with everyone wondering when it will come \nup. We should do it, get it out of the way, work out some agreeable \ntime with my colleagues, or we will go ahead and do it ourselves. There \nis an hour under the rule to debate the motion. There will be an effort \nto waive this point of order which, under the rules, requires 60 votes. \nShould Republicans force a vote to waive the point of order, I urge all \nmy colleagues to waive the point of order.\n\n  This is a question of moral authority. The Senate should stand as one \nto declare that America has one standard of interrogation. We are \nliving as Americans in a world where everything we do is watched and \nwatched very closely. We are asking other countries to follow our moral \nlead, to embrace our way of life, to aspire to the American standard of \nliberty. Yet I fear too often this administration's actions betray \nthose goals.\n  A couple weeks ago, Attorney General Mukasey refused to say that \nwaterboarding is legal. What is waterboarding? We know what it is. It \ncame from the Inquisition and King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. That \nis where it originated. It is nothing new. It has been going on for \ncenturies, and it is torture at its worst where you, in effect, drown \nsomebody and revive them after they can no longer breathe.\n  Last week, CIA Director Hayden publicly confirmed the United States \nhad waterboarded individuals who were in our custody. The next day, the \nWhite House affirmatively declared waterboarding is legal and President \nBush is free to authorize our intelligence agencies to resume its use.\n  President Bush may not care much what we in Congress, Democrats or \nRepublicans, think. For 6 years, he had carte blanche to do what he \nwanted.\n\n[[Page S936]]\n\nThe last year has not been that way. We are an equal branch of \nGovernment, and it is time we made him understand this.\n  The administration can develop as many novel and convoluted legal \ntheories as it wishes, but they cannot change the simple fact that has \nlong been settled law, that waterboarding is torture and it is illegal. \nIt is illegal in America, and it is illegal throughout the world. In \ndecades past, America has prosecuted our enemies and even our own \ntroops for waterboarding.\n  This debate is not just about one kind of torture. It is not just \nabout waterboarding. It is about ensuring that no form of torture, \ncruel or inhumane interrogation techniques that are illegal under the \nGeneva Conventions and prohibited by the Army Field Manual, are used. \nThis includes beating prisoners. This includes sexually humiliating \nprisoners. It includes threatening them with dogs, depriving them of \nfood and water, performing mock executions, putting electricity charges \non various parts of their body, burning them.\n  These techniques are repugnant. They are repugnant to every American. \nThey fly in the face of our most basic values. They should be \ncompletely off limits to the U.S. Government. We have already seen the \ndamage these torture efforts can cause. The world saw it in the Abu \nGhraib prison situation. The revelation that American personnel had \nengaged in such terrible behavior, behavior we have always strongly \ncondemned when used by others, caused tremendous damage to our Nation's \nmoral authority. The recruiting opportunity it provided our terrorist \nenemies cannot be understated and cannot be undone.\n  This is not a Senator saying this. Forty-three retired military \nleaders of the U.S. Armed Forces have written us a letter strongly \nstating that all U.S. personnel, military and civilian, should be held \nto a single standard. These honored leaders wrote:\n\n       We believe it is vital to the safety of our men and women \n     in uniform that the United States not sanction the use of \n     interrogation methods it would find unacceptable if inflicted \n     by the enemy against captured Americans.\n\n  They stated the interrogation methods in the Army Field Manual ``have \nproven effective'' and that they ``are sophisticated and flexible.''\n  My friend, the ranking member of this committee, says these horrible \ntechniques are necessary. They are not. They are not necessary. There \nare many things that have been used and can be used, as indicated by \nthese 43 leading military experts. They say present interrogation \ntechniques, setting these others aside, are sophisticated and flexible \nand they work. They explicitly reject the argument that the field \nmanual is too simplistic for civilian interrogators.\n  Our commander in Iraq, General Petraeus, a four-star general, whom we \nlike to throw around here as knowing all and has done a wonderful job \nin Iraq, wrote an open letter to the troops in May. He had this to say:\n\n       Some may argue that we would be more effective if we \n     sanctioned torture and other expedient methods to obtain \n     information from the enemy.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       They would be wrong. . . . [H]istory shows that [such \n     actions] are frequently neither useful nor necessary.\n       Certainly, extreme physical action can make someone \n     ``talk;'' however, what the individual says may be of \n     questionable value.\n\n  We all know that.\n\n       In fact, our experience in applying the interrogation \n     standards laid out in the Army Field Manual . . . shows that \n     the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in \n     eliciting information from detainees.\n\n  So says General Petraeus.\n  Mr. President, just yesterday, a bipartisan group of foreign policy \nexperts joined to call upon Congress to endorse the application of the \nArmy Field Manual standards across all U.S. agencies.\n  The group included, but was not limited to, the Chairman and Vice \nChairman of the 9/11 Commission, Governor Keane and Congressman \nHamilton; two former Secretaries of State; three former national \nsecurity advisers; a former Secretary of the Navy; and other highly \nregarded officials from both parties.\n  The Bush administration's continued insistence on its right to use \nabusive techniques gives license to our enemies abroad, puts at risk \nour soldiers and citizens who may fall into enemy hands, and serves as \nan ongoing recruiting tool for militant extremists.\n  Meanwhile, the widespread belief that our country uses abusive \ninterrogation methods has weakened our ability to create coalitions of \nour allies to fight our enemies because other countries have at times \nrefused to join us.\n  Mr. President, many of us thought the Congress had addressed the \nissue of torture once and for all when we overwhelmingly passed the \nMcCain amendment in 2005.\n  But President Bush immediately issued a signing statement casting \ndoubt on his willingness to enforce a ban on torture, and his \nadministration has worked ever since to undermine what Senator McCain \noffered and was passed here overwhelmingly.\n  This vote today gives Congress the chance to show President Bush that \nwe meant what we said 3 years ago when we passed the McCain amendment.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to begin to rebuild America's precious \nand diminished moral authority. Today, we can strengthen the war on \nterror.\n  I urge us to stand together to support cloture and, if necessary, to \nvote to waive the point of order on the Feinstein amendment, which is \npart of the very good conference report dealing with intelligence \nauthorization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 23 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, regrettably, the record doesn't meet the \nissue before us. Waterboarding is not an issue here. Waterboarding is \nnot banned. The techniques that are being used are in compliance with \nall of the convention. They are not torture, cruel, or humanly \ndegrading.\n  The only reason to have a separate program, which Congress recognized \nin the 2005 Military Detainee Act, for having a different standard was \nfor a few high-value targets who needed different techniques--not more \nharsh techniques but techniques that are less severe than the training \ntechniques we put our enlisted Marines, SEALs, Special Forces, and the \npilots through. If they are not published in the Army Field Manual, \nthey don't know about them, and that leads them to cooperate.\n  The most successful intelligence collection program that the CIA has \ndoes not involve torture or any kind of unlawful conduct. It is \nunfortunate--and I regret to say very harmful--to the United States to \nsuggest that it does. I strongly believe we cannot afford to shut down \nthe CIA's interrogation of high-value detainees.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, don't you think this great country of ours--\nthe moral authority of the world--can continue our work, our \ninterrogation of prisoners, both military and civilian, by not beating \nthem, sexually humiliating them, bringing dogs and having dogs chomp at \nthem, like at Abu Ghraib? Do we need to deprive them of food and water, \nprovide mock executions, shock them with electricity, as was done \nduring the first gulf war to American prisoners who were captured by \nthe Iraqis, one of whom was from Nevada? We don't need to do that. We \ndon't need to burn them. We don't need to cause them other types of \npain that are listed in field manuals.\n  Mr. President, we have 43 leading military experts who have told us \nthat. We have had the two people who led the 9/11 Commission who have \ntold us that you don't need that, along with former Secretaries of \nState and national security advisers to various Presidents, Democrats \nand Republicans.\n  America is better than this. We don't need to do this. The CIA can \nget along without having to do all these terrible things. We are told \nby General Petraeus that these techniques don't work anyway and that \nany of the information you get is unreliable. Listen to General \nPetraeus. Let's do the right thing on this issue when it comes up, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/13/senate-section/article/S937-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S937]]\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while we are waiting here for \nsome of the determination of a time agreement with regards to the \nconsideration of the conference report, I want to go ahead and lend my \nsupport and acknowledge to the rest of the Senate that this is a bill \nthat is very necessary to pass. Because, what this bill does, by \nauthorizing the activities of the intelligence community, it continues \nto make the oversight function of the Congress--in particular, the \nSenate and the House Intelligence Committees--poignant and relevant to \na community that is not accustomed to having oversight.\n  Our committee leadership, chairman and vice chairman, Senators \nRockefeller and Bond, as we say in the South, they have cracked the \nwhip with the intelligence community to get them to realize that this \nis a constitutional government of shared powers; that the executive \nbranch doesn't just run the show--particularly on something as \nsensitive as the collection of intelligence. Rather, it needs to be \ndone within the law, and one of the ways of ensuring that is through \nthe sharing of powers between two different branches of Government who \nhave checks and balances upon each other. We in the legislative branch \noversee the activities of the executive branch--in this case, all of \nthe intelligence community and their activities, which are absolutely \nessential to the protection of our country. This conference report is a \nvery important bipartisan document, which increases the accountability \nin the intelligence community, and it authorizes dozens of critical \nintelligence programs to keep us safe every day.\n  The conference report includes a new, strong inspector general in the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence. Inspectors general are \nincreasingly important in the intelligence community, where billions of \ndollars are spent outside of public view. Our committee, as well as the \nAmerican public, has to rely on the inspector general as an important \npart of the oversight of the intelligence community.\n  As we look back, several years ago, we completely reorganized the \nintelligence community. A Director of National Intelligence was set up \nto integrate the disparate elements of the intelligence community. But \nthere is a lot more that needs to be done, and a strong inspector \ngeneral at the DNI is another step in the right direction.\n  The conference report also includes a provision that makes the \nDirector of the NRO--the National Reconnaissance Office--and the NSA--\nthe National Security Agency--subject to Senate confirmation. Now, why \nis that important? That is important because, again, it is part of the \nchecks and balances of the separate branches of Government. Both of \nthese agencies, outside of the public view because of the top-secret \nnature of this work, oversee large programs that cost vast amounts of \nmoney, and not every program has been a success. So by having the \nconfirmations of the Directors of the NRO and the NSA come to the \nSenate, it improves that accountability and responsiveness to the \nlegislative branch of Government.\n  The authorization bill also requires an assessment of the \nvulnerability of the intelligence community's major acquisition \nprograms. We have to assess that the program is going to stay on track \nand that it is not going off the rails with regard to cost. We are \ntalking about billions of dollars on some of these programs. By keeping \nthem on track, by knowing what to anticipate, it is much easier to plan \nahead.\n  This bill also provides an annual reporting system which will help us \nkeep in focus, curbing these cost overruns and these schedule delays. \nIf you don't do that, things are going to get out of control. As the \nintelligence community continues to be more and more sophisticated \nbecause of the technical means it employs, it is more and more \nimportant that our oversight tools be in place and effective.\n  Now, that is enough alone to pass this bill, but we have an area of \ndisagreement coming up. We are expecting the minority to offer a point \nof order that would remove a provision in the conference report. This \nprovision requires the Army Field Manual to be used as the standard for \ninterrogation methods. This Army Field Manual was released over a year \nago. It specifically prohibits cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.\n  There are eight techniques in the Army Field Manual that are \nspecifically prohibited from being used in conjunction with \nintelligence interrogations: forcing the detainee to be naked, perform \nsexual acts, or pose in a sexual manner; placing hoods or sacks over \nthe head of a detainee; using\n\n[[Page S938]]\n\nduct tape on the eyes; applying beatings, electric shock, burns, or \nother forms of physical pain. The fourth is waterboarding. That is \nprohibited. The fifth is using military working dogs. The sixth is \ninducing hypothermia or heat energy. The seventh is conducting a mock \nexecution. The eighth is depriving the detainee of necessary food, \nwater, and medical care.\n  Now, haven't I just described what America is all about? Is that not \nthe standard by which we, as the leader of the world, have to announce \nto the world what we believe in and how we are going to conduct \nourselves, and that is how we are going to conduct ourselves not only \namong our own people and how we treat them but how we are going to \ntreat others?\n  The manual provides that three interrogation techniques may only be \nused with higher level approval. The good cop-bad cop interrogation \ntactic; the false flag tactic, where a detainee is made to believe he \nis being held by another country; or separation, by which the detainee \nis separated so he can't coordinate with other detainees on his story--\nthose techniques can be used, but it has to be approved at a higher \nlevel.\n  Mr. President, there is something that is going to worry everybody, \nand it has worried this Senator personally and as a member of the \nIntelligence Committee. What if all of this doesn't work and the \ncountry is in imminent peril? Well, along with the standards we are \ngoing to set, which I hope we are going to pass into law--these \nstandards in the Army Field Manual which will state clearly what the \nstandards are for our country and how we are going to conduct \nourselves--there is always the constitutional authority under article \nII.\n  As Commander in Chief, the President can act when the country is in \nimmediate peril. And if he so chooses, as Commander in Chief, to \nauthorize activities other than what the Army Field Manual allows, then \nthe President would be accountable directly to the American people \nunder the circumstances with which he invoked that article II authority \nas Commander in Chief.\n  What we are saying today does not relate to the President's article \nII power. We are setting statutory power. It is important that we tell \nthe rest of the world the standards of how we interrogate detainees. We \nare putting these standards into law and we will ensure that these \ntechniques are in compliance with the humane treatment that we would \nexpect and hope our Americans would also receive.\n  I think there should be no confusion. We have an obligation to set \nthese standards into law. If that dire emergency ever occurred in the \nfuture, the President has his own authority under article II of the \nConstitution. But that is not the question here today before us. The \nquestion is: What do we set as the standard of interrogation, and that \nhas to be that there is no torture allowed under this statutory law.\n  Therefore, when the point of order is raised that would take the Army \nField Manual standards for interrogation techniques out of the \nconference report, I urge the Senators not to take this provision out \nof this important intelligence reauthorization bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on the \nintelligence authorization bill, which contains a provision requiring \nall U.S. governmental agencies, including the CIA, to comply with the \nArmy Field Manual's prohibition on torture. This reform is urgently \nneeded. I commend the Intelligence Committee for adopting this \nprovision. Its enactment will ensure that the Government uses only \ninterrogation techniques that are lawful and those provisions should be \nretained.\n  In the Detainee Treatment Act passed in 2005, Congress attempted to \nreaffirm our commitment to the basic rights enshrined in the Geneva \nConventions and restore America's standing in the eyes of the world as \na nation that treats detainees with dignity and respect.\n  These rights reflect the values we cherish as a free society, and \nalso protects the lives of our service men and women. Today, however, \nwe know that the 2005 act has fallen short of our goals. By not \nexplicitly applying the Army Field Manual standards to all Government \nagencies, we have left open a loophole that the Bush administration \npromptly drove a Mack truck through.\n  The so-called enhanced interrogation program carried out in secret \nsites became an international scandal and a profound stain on America \nin the eyes of the world. The administration issued an executive order \nlast year to try to minimize the outcry, but the order failed to \nrenounce abuses such as waterboarding, mock executions, use of attack \ndogs, beatings, and electric shocks.\n  The disclosure of secret opinions by the Office of Legal Counsel gave \nfurther evidence that the administration had interpreted the Detainee \nTreatment Act and other antitorture laws in an unacceptable, narrow \nmanner.\n  Attorney General Mukasey's refusal at his confirmation hearings to \nsay whether waterboarding is illegal gave us even more reason for \nconcern. The outrages do not end there. Two months ago, the New York \nTimes reported that in 2005 the CIA had destroyed at least two \nvideotapes documenting the use of abusive techniques on detainees in \nits custody. These videotapes have been withheld from Federal courts, \nthe 9/11 Commission, and congressional committees. Two weeks ago in his \ntestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Attorney General \nflat out refused to consider investigating possible past acts of \ntorture or to brief congressional committees on why he believed the \nCIA's enhanced interrogation program is lawful.\n  Last week, we received official confirmation that the CIA had used \nwaterboarding on three detainees. At the same time, the White House \nmade the reckless claim that waterboarding is legal, and that the \nPresident can authorize its use under certain circumstances.\n  The White House position is directly contrary to the findings of \ncourts, military tribunals, and legal experts that waterboarding is a \nviolation of U.S. law and a crime against humanity.\n  In the words of a former master instructor for U.S. Navy SEALs:\n\n       Waterboarding is slow motion suffocation with enough time \n     to contemplate the inevitability of blackout and expiration. \n     Usually the person goes into hysterics on the board. For the \n     uninitiated it is horrifying to watch and if it goes wrong, \n     it can lead straight to terminal hypoxia. When done right it \n     is controlled death.\n\n  Waterboarding has a long and brutal history. It is an ancient \ntechnique of tyrants. In the 15th and 16th centuries, it was used in \nthe Spanish Inquisition. In the 19th century, it was used against \nslaves in this country. In World War II, it was used against our troops \nby Japan. We prosecuted Japanese officers for using it and sent them to \nyears and years of jail for following that procedure.\n  In the 1970s, it was used against political opponents by the Khmer \nRouge in Cambodia and military dictatorships in Chile and Argentina. \nToday it is being used against pro-democracy activists in Burma. That \nis the company we keep when we fail to reject waterboarding.\n  In fact, Attorney General Mukasey could not even bring himself to \nreject the legal reasoning behind the infamous Bybee torture memo of \nthe Office of Legal Counsel which stated that physical pain amounts to \ntorture only if it is:\n\n       equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious \n     physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily \n     function, or even death.\n\n  According to that memo, anything that fell short of that standard \nwould not be torture. This Bybee memorandum was in effect for 2\\1/2\\ \nyears before it was ever effectively suspended. It was suspended then \nby Attorney General Alberto Gonzales for the Judiciary Committee, quite \nfrankly, in order that his nomination could be favorably considered.\n  Included in the Bybee memoranda was a provision that was an absolute \ndefense for any of those who would be involved in this kind of torture, \nunless prosecutors could prove a specific intent that the purpose of \nthe torture was to harm the individuals rather than to gain \ninformation, therefore effectively giving carte blanche to any of those \nwho would be involved in torture.\n\n  When Attorney General Gonzales appeared before the Judiciary \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S939]]\n\nand effectively repealed the Bybee memoranda, he did so for the \nDepartment of Defense but not for the Central Intelligence Agency, even \nat that time a clear indication of what the administration was \nintending to do with the Central Intelligence Agency. It should not be \nany surprise to anyone that this has been ongoing and continuous.\n  According to that memo, again the Bybee memorandum, anything that \nfell short of this standard would not be torture. CIA interrogators \ncalled the memo their ``golden shield'' because it allowed them to use \nvirtually any interrogation method they wanted.\n  When the memo--this is the Bybee memo--became public, its flaws were \nobvious. Dean Harold Koh of Yale Law School testified that in his \nprofessional opinion as a law professor and a law dean, the Bybee \nmemoranda is ``perhaps the most clearly legal erroneous opinion I have \never read [because of all of the previous statutes and laws that have \nbeen passed to prohibit torture by the Congress of the United States \nand those initiated and supported by Republican presidents, by Ronald \nReagan, as well as Democratic presidents''.]\n  This was not a partisan series of statements about what the United \nStates position has historically been. The Bush administration was \nembarrassed into withdrawing the memo. To this day, no one in the \nadministration has repudiated its content. The torture memo continues \nto haunt this country. I have asked the Attorney General several times \nto reject its legal reasoning, but he continues to refuse to do so. The \nonly solution is for Congress to apply the Army Field Manual's \nstandards to the entire Government. There has rarely if ever been a \ngreater need to restore the rule of law to America's interrogation \npractices.\n  The field manual represents our best effort to develop the most \neffective interrogation standards. The manual clearly states that: Use \nof torture is not only illegal but also it is a poor technique that \nyields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, \nand can induce the source to say what he thinks the interrogator wants \nto hear.\n  We have on trial in military courts six of those who are going to be \ntried because of 9/11. There is no question there is going to be a \nwhole series of appeals because of the use of various techniques \nagainst them. It may very well be that some turn out--because of the \nviolations of basic and fundamental, some constitutional rights, there \nwill be a question about what the outcome is going to be with regard to \nthose individuals.\n  Why not get it right from the start? The manual gives our \ninterrogators great flexibility, provides all the techniques necessary \nto effectively question detainees, but it makes clear that illegal and \ninhumane methods are not permitted.\n  In a letter to our troops dated May 7, 2007, General Petraeus stated:\n\n       Our experience in applying the interrogation standards laid \n     out in the Army Field Manual . . . shows that the techniques \n     in the Manual work effectively and humanely in eliciting the \n     information from detainees.\n\n  Applying the field manual's standards throughout our Government will \nmove us closer to repairing the damage to our international reputation \nin the wake of the Abu Ghraib scandal. It will once again commit the \nUnited States to be the world's beacon for human rights and fair \ntreatment. It will improve the quality of intelligence gathering, and \nprotect own personnel from facing punishment, condemnation, or \nmistreatment anywhere in the world. It will make us more, not less, \nsafe.\n  Torture is a defining issue. It is clear that under the Bush \nadministration we have lost our way. By applying the field manual \nstandards to all U.S. Government interrogations, Congress will bring \nAmerica back from the brink, back to our values, back to basic decency, \nback to the rule of law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, today's debate goes to the heart of \nwhat our country is and what we wish it to be, by asking this: Will the \nUnited States of America condone torture? Is there, at America's heart, \na heart of darkness? This authorization bill for America's intelligence \ncommunity offers us the opportunity to answer that question decisively. \nIt contains provisions for which I have fought from my initial \namendment in committee, and which I am proud to support today, that \nwould prohibit members of the intelligence community from using \ninterrogation techniques beyond those authorized in the Army Field \nManual.\n  By adopting this amendment, the two Intelligence Committees, \nCongress's experts on these matters, have sent a clear signal to \nAmerica and to the world that in this country the rule of law is our \nstrongest bulwark against those who would do us harm.\n  I hope that today the Senate will have the confidence in our values \nto reaffirm that signal and pass this legislation with the Army Field \nManual provision included.\n  Over the past several months, the American people have become all too \nfamiliar with the issue of torture. I want to discuss one technique in \nparticular today, waterboarding, or water torture, or the water cure, \nwhich dates back to the Spanish Inquisition of the 14th century.\n  Waterboarding was a favorite of torturers, because its terrible \neffects could be generated without the visible damage accompanying the \nrack, the screw, the iron, the whip, or the gouge. It could be done \nover and over.\n\n  In the 20th century, waterboarding was done in the Philippines, where \ncolonizers wielded it against indigenous peoples. It has been used in \nSri Lanka, in Tunisia, by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia--we are in the \ntradition of Pol Pot--by the French in Algeria, by the Japanese in \nWorld War II, and by military dictatorships in Latin America. The \ntechnique ordinarily involves strapping a captive in a reclining \nposition, heels above head, putting a cloth over his face and pouring \nwater over the cloth to create the feeling of suffocation and drowning. \nIt leaves no marks on the body, but it causes extreme physical and \npsychological suffering.\n  A French journalist, Henri Alleg, was subjected to this method of \ninterrogation during the struggle for Algerian independence. He wrote \nin his 1958 book ``The Question'':\n\n       I tried, by contracting my throat, to take in as little \n     water as possible and to resist suffocation by keeping air in \n     my lungs for as long as I could. But I couldn't hold on for \n     more than a few moments. I had the impression of drowning, \n     and a terrible agony, that of death itself, took possession \n     of me.\n\n  Waterboarding is associated with criminal, tyrant, and repressive \nregimes, with rulers who sought from their captives not information but \npropaganda, meant for broadcast to friends or enemies whether true or \nfalse. Regimes that employed the technique of waterboarding generally \ndid not do so to obtain information; rather, to obtain compliance. But \nno matter the purpose or the reason, its use was and is indefensible.\n  Water torture was not unknown to Americans. A 1953 article in the New \nYork Times quotes LTC William Harrison of the U.S. Air Force, who said \nhe was ``tortured with the `water treatment' by Communist North \nKoreans.'' In testimony before a U.S. military tribunal, CAPT Chase Jay \nNielsen described being waterboarded by his Japanese captors following \nthe 1942 Doolittle raid by U.S. aviators. From all this, America's \nmilitary knew there was a chance our servicemen and servicewomen would \nbe subjected to water torture.\n  The Defense Department established the SERE program--survive, evade, \nresist, and escape--to train select military personnel who are at high \nrisk of capture by enemy forces or isolation within enemy territory. \nThe program has also subjected certain service personnel to extreme \ninterrogation techniques, including waterboarding, in an effort to \nprepare them for the worst--the possibility of capture and torture at \nthe hands of a depraved or tyrannical enemy.\n  According to Malcolm Nance, a former master instructor and chief of \ntraining, at the U.S. Navy SERE school in San Diego:\n\n       [O]ur training was designed to show how an evil \n     totalitarian enemy would use torture at the slightest whim.\n\n  Those who have experienced this technique, even at the hands of their \nown brothers in arms, are unequivocal about its effect. Former Deputy \nSecretary of State Richard Armitage, who underwent waterboarding during \nSERE training, said this:\n\n\n[[Page S940]]\n\n\n       As a human being, fear and helplessness are pretty \n     overwhelming. . . . this is not a discussion that Americans \n     should even be having. It is torture.\n\n  Our colleague in this body, Senator John McCain, has said the same. \nYet it was to this relic of the dungeons of the inquisition, of the \nCambodian killing fields, and of the huntas of the Southern Hemisphere \nthat the Bush administration turned for guidance. I will speak later \nabout how our Department of Justice came to approve this. But for now, \nwe know that last week, in a stunning public admission, the CIA \nDirector General, Michael Hayden, admitted the United States \nwaterboarded three detainees following the September 11 attacks. The \nvirus of waterboarding had traveled from tyrant regimes, through the \nSERE program, and infected America's body politic.\n  Retired BG David Irvin, of the U.S. Army Reserve, a former \nintelligence officer and instructor in interrogation, and Joe Navarro, \ninterrogator with the FBI, recently wrote:\n\n       [T]here is considerable evidence that the CIA had to \n     scramble after 9/11 to develop an interrogation program and \n     turned to individuals with no professional experience in the \n     field. . . . Given the crisis atmosphere of the day, it is \n     all too easy to believe the comment of an intelligence \n     insider who said of the secret program to detain and \n     interrogate al Qaeda suspects that ``quality control went out \n     the window.''\n\n  Don't let us jump out the window after it.\n  America's military is expressly prohibited from using torture because \nintelligence experts in our Armed Forces know torture is an ineffective \nmethod of obtaining actionable intelligence. Again, I will speak later \nabout the false assertion that this program was designed for 18-year-\nold novices. Some of the most sophisticated intelligence interrogations \nare done by our military after intense training. Our military adheres \nto the Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence Collector Operations. At \na hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on which \nI serve, I asked COL Steven Kleinman, a 22-year veteran of \ninterrogations, a senior intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force \nReserves, and a veteran interrogator with plenty of experience overseas \nin the Middle East, about his experience conducting interrogations \nusing the Army Field Manual.\n  He said:\n\n       I am not at all limited by the Army Field Manual in terms \n     of what I need to do to generate useful information. . . . \n     I've never felt any necessity or operational requirement to \n     bring physical, psychological or emotional pressure on a \n     source to win their cooperation.\n\n  A significant number of retired military leaders have written to the \nchairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee saying:\n\n       interrogation methods authorized by the field manual have \n     proven effective in eliciting vital intelligence from \n     dangerous enemy prisoners. . . . And the principles reflected \n     in the Field Manual are values that no U.S. agency should \n     violate.\n\n  And GEN David Petraeus, commander of U.S. forces serving in Iraq, \nreiterated this point when he wrote last year to every soldier serving \nin the Iraq theater:\n\n       Some may argue that we would be more effective if we \n     sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain \n     information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the \n     basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows that \n     they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary. . . . \n     our experience in applying the interrogation standards \n     laid out in the Army Field Manual on Human Intelligence \n     Collector Operations that was published last year shows \n     that the techniques in the manual work effectively and \n     humanely in eliciting information from detainees.\n\n  The cochairs of the 9/11 Commission emphatically agree. On Monday, \nthe chairmen, together with two former Secretaries of State, three \nformer National Security Advisors, and other national security experts, \nwrote that ``[c]ruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners \nunder American control makes us less safe, violates our national \nvalues, and damages America's reputation in the world.''\n  Torture is ineffective. It is wrong. It is dangerous to all those who \nserve the United States of America in harm's way. It should never, ever \nbe used by any person who represents the United States of America or \nany agency that flies the American flag.\n  I was proud last July to introduce an amendment in the Intelligence \nCommittee that would write this rule into law. When that effort did not \nsucceed, I was proud again last winter to support Senator Feinstein's \namendment in conference.\n  I call on all my colleagues to support this legislation. We can \njourney no longer down Winston Churchill's stairway which leads to a \ndark gulf. As Winston Churchill said:\n\n       It is a fine broad stairway at the beginning, but after a \n     bit, the carpet ends. A little farther on, there are only \n     flagstones, and a little farther on still these break beneath \n     your feet.\n\n  The United States of America--the city on a hill, the light of the \nworld, the promise of generations--must not ever condone torture. \nTorture breaks that promise. Torture extinguishes that light. Torture \ndarkens that city. I hope by our actions today, we in the Senate will \nhelp turn this country back toward our centuries-old promise. I hope we \nwill turn toward the light.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I almost have no words to praise the \nSenator from Rhode Island for the eloquence and strength of his speech, \nwhich was not only grounded in very deep substance but was delivered \nwith elegiac nature that both culled the human spirit as well as \ngrounded the futility of torture. I congratulate him.\n  I also rise strongly in support of section 327 of the intelligence \nauthorization conference report. I recognize it will be controversial. \nI don't care. It is important that some background on this section be \nprovided. Some of it has been this morning. During the conference on \nthe authorization bill, the conferees adopted an amendment that would \nrequire the intelligence community to conduct its interrogation in \naccordance with the terms of the U.S. Army Field Manual. The full \nmembership of the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate \nIntelligence Committee served on the conference committee. So it was a \nmajority of those two committees that came to that conclusion.\n  Section 327 of the intelligence authorization conference report \ndirectly parallels the provision in the Detainee Treatment Act that \nforbids subjecting anyone in Department of Defense custody to any \ntreatment or technique of interrogation not authorized by and listed in \nthe U.S. Army Field Manual on intelligence interrogation. Section 327 \napplies these same restrictions to the intelligence community at large.\n  The effect of section 327 is, therefore, to require all of the U.S. \nGovernment operate their interrogation programs under a single \ninterrogation standard, the standard set by the U.S. military. Adopting \nthe military standard for interrogation as the universal standard makes \nsense, and I hope some of my colleagues are listening. It is the \nmembers of the military who most benefit from reciprocal obligations of \nthe Geneva Convention requiring humane treatment of prisoners and who \nare most likely to be subjected to retaliation based on the failure of \nthe United States to follow those obligations. That statement is \nfrequently made, and then it is frequently absorbed and discarded. \nThink about it. Retaliation is the way of the world, and it will be no \ndifferent here. What we do to others, they will do to us.\n  The U.S. Army Field Manual on interrogation was revised in September \n2006 after significant interagency review. This included a review by \nthe Central Intelligence Agency. By providing a number of approach \nstrategies such as the incentive approach, emotional approach, and the \nMutt-and-Jeff approach, the Army Field Manual gives interrogators \nsignificant flexibility to shape the interrogation. It doesn't \ndelineate exactly how. It gives them a lot of flexibility.\n  The Army Field Manual also explicitly prohibits, as we know, \nwaterboarding, forcing detainees to be naked, inducing hypothermia or \nheat injury or subjecting a detainee to beatings, as well as a number \nof other things. All this raises the question at the heart of this \ndebate: Should the Central Intelligence Agency, the well-known CIA, be \nallowed to use coercive interrogation techniques to obtain information \nfrom al-Qaida detainees?\n  This debate is about more than legality. It is about more than \nensuring\n\n[[Page S941]]\n\nthat the intelligence community has the tools it needs to protect us. \nIt is also about morality, the way we see ourselves, who we are, who we \nwant to be as a nation, and what we represent to the world. What we \nrepresent to the world has a direct effect on the number of people who \ndetermine they want to join the jihadists movement and come after us.\n  It is a decision that can and should be left to Members of Congress \nwho are the representatives of the American people. In the early period \nof the CIA program's existence, I repeatedly called--and I am extremely \nfrustrated by this, extremely frustrated--for an Intelligence Committee \ninvestigation into the Agency's detention interrogation practices.\n  That was in the committee. I was, at that point, vice chairman and \ncould not control, obviously, the vote. So on vote margins of one, we \nlost. We could not get anything going in the way of studying the \nsubject and investigation of the subject. Then I moved to the floor and \nonce again could not get the committee to investigate the subject. I \nalso tried to have the CIA brief all the members of the committee on \nthe interrogation program. That also did not happen.\n  I recognized that assessing the need for the CIA's enhanced \ninterrogation techniques, the intelligence obtained from detainees, and \nthe importance of maintaining America's position in the world were \nissues that we in Congress needed to debate and discuss, and, \nunfortunately, we did not.\n  About a year and a half ago, the full membership of the Intelligence \nCommittee was finally provided information about CIA's interrogation \nprogram. It is the whole point of oversight. They are not accustomed to \nus doing that--not just the CIA, but the intelligence community--having \nrepresentatives of the people asking questions. They think it is an \nelite field for them. They are proud of their traditions. They fight \namong themselves, and they do not build into their thinking what it is \nthat the Congress might feel about this.\n  About a year and a half ago, as I say, we were brought into their \ninterrogation program. Since that time, our committee has held multiple \nhearings on that subject. We have done our best to learn as much as \npossible about the basis for and the consequences of CIA's program, as \nwell as interrogation in more general terms.\n  These briefings and hearings have led the committee to conclude that \nall agencies of the U.S. Government should be required to comply with a \nsingle standard for interrogation of detainees. The Army Field Manual \nprovides a standard of humane treatment that indisputably complies with \nour international obligations under the Geneva Conventions, as well as \nwith U.S. laws.\n  The CIA has briefed the committee on several occasions about its \ninterrogation of al-Qaida detainees. The CIA has described the basis \nfor the program, and why they think it should be allowed to continue.\n  Although the CIA has described the information obtained from its \nprogram, I have heard nothing--nothing--that leads me to believe that \ninformation obtained from interrogation using coercive interrogation \ntechniques has prevented an imminent terrorist attack.\n  This is true for a very simple reason. Once a terrorist is captured, \nhis fellow plotters, understandably, change their plans. In other \nwords, I do not believe the CIA has ever been in an actual ``ticking \ntimebomb'' scenario, nor do I think it is ever likely to be placed in \nthat situation. That does not mean the information obtained from the \nprogram has not been valuable. Of course information about al-Qaida is \nexceedingly valuable from an intelligence standpoint. It is bits and \npieces of information that allow our intelligence professionals to \nassess al-Qaida's capabilities and to determine how best to protect \nourselves as a nation. But, more to the point, I have not heard nor \nhave I seen any evidence that supports the intelligence community's \nclaim that using enhanced interrogation techniques is the only way to \nobtain this type of intelligence; that is, to get what they need to \nget.\n  After 9/11, the intelligence community decided that coercive \ninterrogation tactics were the best way to obtain intelligence. It was \nperhaps a little bit understandable then in terms of the general panic \nof the Nation. But the intelligence community--I say this gravely--did \nnot take the time to research what interrogation techniques might be \nmost effective to come to this conclusion, nor did they reach out to \nthe interrogators with experience, particularly those questioning \nIslamic terrorists. They did not do that. They were going to do it \ntheir way. They simply assumed--and they simply still assume--that \ncoercive interrogation techniques were the best way to obtain \ninformation.\n  To this Senator, this was clearly a flawed approach. But at this \npoint, the administration is so invested in the use of these techniques \nthey can no longer psychologically or otherwise step back to assess \nwhat methods are most effective to obtain intelligence. They go by the \nmantra, they go by what has been done before.\n  To address this question, the committee explored how other Government \nagencies conduct interrogation. The committee considered critical \ninterrogations of individuals who do not want to disclose information--\npeople who are hardheaded and do not want to talk--interrogations where \nobtaining information can prevent widespread injury or death.\n  Every day, military interrogators in Iraq and Afghanistan question \nindividuals with information that can save lives--every single day--\nquestions about where explosive devices are hidden, where captured \nsoldiers have been taken, or where caches of weapons are stored, and a \nlot more.\n  Now, the CIA loves to argue: Oh, but they are just 18- to 20-year-old \nkids. They don't have the experience. We have experience. We have \nexperience. We have been at it. We are the professionals. They did that \nat our public, open threats hearing a week or so ago.\n  Now, there is something called the FBI. They deal with pretty bad \npeople, too. Their agents face life-and-death situations in both the \nworld of terrorism and every-day criminality. Some of the individuals \nthe FBI interrogate are senior leaders, individuals who are committed \nto staying silent and not sharing the information they possess. In \nfact, FBI agents recently questioned the top al-Qaida leaders who were \nformerly in CIA custody, gathering enough information from those al-\nQaida leaders to build cases for trial, which we have recently read \nabout.\n  Some of these FBI agents have been conducting interrogations for two \nor three decades. That does not sound like 18- to 20-year-olds. They \nare, without question, recognized experts in their field, and they are \nremarkably effective at obtaining the information they need. Yet both \nthe FBI and the military have told us they do not need enhanced \ninterrogation techniques. Are these naive organizations? Are these \npeople who do not know what they are talking about? Are these people \nwho do not have stakes at hand? They are out on the battlefield. They \nare not only at Guantanamo. They are out on the battlefield. They have \ntold the committee the interrogation techniques included in the Army \nField Manual provide them with flexibility they need to obtain the \ninformation they need.\n  Indeed, representatives from both the military and the FBI--both--\nstated emphatically they have the tools they need to obtain necessary \nand reliable intelligence.\n  After considering the CIA's arguments, and those of the FBI and the \nU.S. military, I am simply not convinced that harsh CIA tactics are \nnecessary to obtain intelligence information.\n  We also had people who were neutral who had experience in \ninterrogation but were not currently in the practice of it. Their \ninformation to us also was that to terrorize, to torture, to manhandle, \nto do whatever, does not work. Human beings are human beings, and there \nare ways to get at them. In fact, coercive interrogation techniques can \nlead prisoners--and probably will in many cases--to say anything at all \nfor the purpose of stopping the interrogation. As a result, coercive \ntechniques can produce information that is fabricated and ultimately \nlead to flawed and misleading intelligence reports. This is not \nacademic or hypothetical. Bad intelligence is a real danger.\n\n[[Page S942]]\n\n  In the early years and months after 2001, we were awash with bad \nintelligence in Washington, DC, not all of it coming out of coercive \ntechniques, but out of a complete misunderstanding of what intelligence \nis all about. In fact, there was a condescension from the \nadministration about the role of intelligence in providing reliable \ninformation. So this is not an academic or hypothetical point. Bad \nintelligence is a real danger when employing coercive interrogation \ntechniques.\n\n  Intelligence reporting from an al-Qaida detainee--a very famous one \nnamed al-Libi he said Iraq was providing al-Qaida training in chemical \nand biological weapons prior to the war, which was publicly trumpeted \nby the President of the United States, by the Secretary of Defense, by \nthe Secretary of State, and other senior administration officials as \nproof of operating links between Iraq and al-Qaida and, therefore, as a \nbasis for going in to invade Iraq.\n  Of course, basically all of us feel now that what the President said \non March 23 in the other body, in his speech which gave him the \nauthority to go to war, was based on intelligence which was almost \nentirely incorrect, and virtually everything he said, other than some \nrhetoric here and there--everything he said turned out to be wrong, \nand, therefore, was one of the most extraordinary disservices to the \nAmerican people, not to speak of the dead and the wounded, that I can \nremember in my lifetime. But the Nation was inspired by the thought of \nfighting terror, and so on they went.\n  Ultimately, al-Libi, who said these things, recanted. He recanted, \nand it was determined by the CIA that he had fabricated this central \nallegation of this link between al-Qaida and Iraq and other information \nbased on his claim of mistreatment during the interrogations.\n  So this is not an academic point. America went to war based on an \nalleged threat that was partially based on fabricated information \nproduced under coercive interrogation.\n  Apart from the question of efficacy and the risk of bad intelligence, \nthe committee has explored the consequences of having a different, \nsecret standard of interrogation for the intelligence community. This \nis where the need for section 327 becomes clear.\n  Since the disclosure of information about the existence of secret \nprisons, and the use of harsh interrogation techniques, the reputation \nand moral authority of the United States have suffered dramatically. It \nis not a casual statement. One can say, yes, a lot of people have said \nthat. But when that is true, that means that in Africa and Southeast \nAsia and South America and in the Middle East it becomes much easier \nfor al-Qaida and those who would do us ill--and people within the \nUnited States who may belong to no formal organization like that at \nall--to develop anger, to develop a search for meaning to their lives \nbecause they do not see hope in their lives, and so they join. They \njoin a group that will do damage. Some of our techniques have \nsignificantly increased the likelihood of that happening.\n  Rather than being a world leader in human rights, we have become \nknown for the unapologetic use of aggressive interrogation techniques. \nIndeed, even Canada has included us on a list of countries that engage \nin torture.\n  Allowing the CIA to continue to use coercive interrogation techniques \nthat are not part of the Army Field Manual is another piece of fodder \nfor terrorist propaganda that cannot be underestimated. It is not just \na rhetorical statement. It cannot be underestimated. It is no way to \nwin the hearts and minds of the Muslim world. Ultimately, the war on \nterrorism is a war of ideas. Without a public standard of humane \ntreatment, it is impossible to convince the world that we take our \ninternational obligations seriously, that we treat people humanely, and \nthat we are a country of laws and we adhere to these laws.\n  We must uphold those standards that differentiate us from the \nterrorists whom we are fighting. If our Government continues to use \nsecret interrogation techniques that many are convinced constitute \ntorture, America's standing in the world will continue to go down even \nmore. Every time it goes down, there are more people who sign up to do \nus harm.\n\n  The Israeli Supreme Court concluded, when it forbade the use of harsh \ninterrogation techniques, the following:\n\n       This is the destiny of democracy, as not all means are \n     acceptable to it and not all practices employed by its \n     enemies are open before it. Although a democracy must often \n     fight with one hand tied behind its back, it nonetheless has \n     the upper hand. Preserving the rule of law, and recognition \n     of an individual's liberty, constitutes an important \n     component in its understanding of security. At the end of the \n     day, they strengthen its spirit and its strength and allow it \n     to overcome its difficulties.\n\n  So in closing, passing section 327 is critical to regaining our moral \nauthority in the world--which is a little bit too easy to say; it is \ngoing to take a lot more than that but it is a start--and convincing \npeople that the United States believes in due process and human rights \nrather than fear. Having a separate standard of interrogations for the \nCIA--as much as it may want to have it, as much as it may have pride in \nhaving their secret standard, as much as they talk about 18- to 20-\nyear-olds--is simply not worth the cost. I, therefore, urge my \ncolleagues to support section 327.\n  But no matter how the Senate votes on this motion, if it comes up, \nthe CIA should very carefully consider the actions of the House and \nSenate Intelligence Committee. All Members need to consider what this \nlarge group concluded. The members of our committees are the only \nMembers of Congress who have been briefed on the program and who are \nprivy to the administration's best arguments in support of the program. \nThat has to be said from time to time, and it sounds a bit arrogant, \nbut there are people on the Intelligence Committees, both in the House \nand the Senate, who get briefings, and they know things that are not \nnecessarily known to the rest of the Congress. Yet despite those \nbriefings, a bipartisan majority of both the House and the Senate \nIntelligence Committees have determined that it is in the Nation's best \ninterest to have only one standard of interrogation, a standard that \ncan be publicly judged by the entire world, and this judgment by the \nrepresentatives of the American people--that is, what we did in the \nconference committee--cannot be ignored.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment my distinguished friend from \nWest Virginia. He has been a very bipartisan worker on the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence. I have been on that committee for an \nawfully long time, and I have a lot of respect for him. I just want to \nmake that point for the record. I know he spends a lot of time trying \nto do his job well. We don't always agree, but we do agree on an awful \nlot. I particularly appreciate his work on the FISA bill. I know it is \na very difficult position for him to be in. It is a very technical, \nvery difficult bill, a complex bill, with a lot of matters conducted in \npublic. I think he did a terrific job in seeing this bill through to \nthe Senate floor.\n  I also would like to take a moment to thank my colleague and friend \nwho works with me, Jesse Baker. He is a Secret Service detailee on my \nstaff who has been invaluable in helping me prepare for the important \nFISA debate.\n  I also thank the very able counsel of the Intelligence Committee, \nKathleen Rice, along with Jack Livingston, Mike Davidson, and Chris \nHealey, all of whom I think played a significant role in the FISA bill, \namong so many other things as well. I also would like to pay tribute to \nmy colleague on the Intelligence Committee, my staffer who works with \nme, Paul Matulic, who is one of the most articulate and knowledgeable \nforeign policy people in government today. I am very grateful for his \nwork and the effort he has put forth to try to assist me in these very \ndifficult times and very difficult jobs.\n  This might be a historic week for the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, at least in comparison with the last 3 years. Last night, \nwe passed, after over a year of work and preparation, including the 6-\nmonth interim Protect America Act, the FISA modernization bill. I truly \nhope our House colleagues can expedite this bill and get it to the \nPresident for his signature before the legal regime governing our \nessential technical capabilities expires this weekend.\n  I wish to congratulate both the chairman, as I have said here \nearlier,\n\n[[Page S943]]\n\nand vice chairman, Senator Bond, for their sustained efforts on this \nissue. It wouldn't have been passed without their sterling leadership \nand their willingness to make some tough calls and to stick to them.\n  I have often said I am metagrobolized--confounded, you might say--\nthat we have heard about the asymmetrical advantages that our terrorist \nenemies have, while we are reluctant to use our own significant \nasymmetrical advantages to defend ourselves from these terrorists' \nintentions. The terrorists do have asymmetrical advantages, to be sure: \nThey are substate actors, and they do not operate according to any \nnational or international law, including the law of war. They hide \namong civilians, target civilians, and terrorize civilization. If al-\nQaida could get its hands on a weapon of mass destruction, everything \nwe know about them suggests they would use it against the West.\n  But we in the West also have asymmetrical advantages as well. Two \nsignificant advantages are our technological prowess and our adherence \nto the rule of law. Our technology, as we have revealed in more ways \nthan I think prudent in our open debate, provides us unparalleled \nadvantages in tracking the enemy. Our collection has prevented \nterrorist attacks against us, and our continued collection makes the \nenemy dedicate a significant amount of its time to avoiding us--time \nthat it would use plotting against us. In this sense, our technological \ncollection is not just a defensive tool but an offensive tool as well. \nAmericans and their leaders are right to expect that all of this \nNation's activities should adhere to the rule of law, and this long \ndebate over FISA modernization should, at the very least, assure \neveryone that we adhere to a legal regime, even when it seems \naggravatingly slow to adjust it to modern technology and threats \nunimagined in the 1970s when the original FISA Act was enacted.\n\n  So I again wish to congratulate the chairman and the vice chairman \nfor their leadership in getting this important piece of legislation \npassed, finally, last night. It was a major banner day for us. This \nbill was long overdue, and I give credit to those who have worked so \nhard--long and hard--to see that it was done.\n  The passage of an intelligence authorization bill is also an \nimportant measure of how we advance the rule of law. The balance of \npowers so beautifully articulated in our system of government requires \nan active role for this body and, since the 1970s, we have \ninstitutionalized a role of oversight for intelligence in the two \ncommittees of the Senate and the House.\n  Our principal vehicle is the authorization bill. This process has \nbeen derailed for several years now, as Members operating with \nindividualized agendas have created a dynamic that has thwarted the \ninstitutional need for authorization. It is a fact that, if some \nconcede that an authorization bill is not essential, the self-\nmoderating dynamic that keeps one from offering controversial \namendments on a bill is removed. We have seen this with the foreign \nrelations authorization bills. I don't want to see it happen with the \nintelligence authorization bill.\n  This year's bill has some very important measures in it, most of them \nin the classified annex and therefore not subject to discussion now. It \nis, after all, an authorization for the intelligence community--or IC--\nwhich does, after all, require a minimum of secrecy to function \neffectively. The bill does have measures in the unclassified annex \nworthy of passage, however, to include additional and needed \nauthorities for the Director of National Intelligence, directions on \npersonnel level assessments for the IC, directions on business \nenterprise architecture modernization, and limits on excessive cost \ngrowths of certain systems.\n  The bill, however, has been strapped by a provision added during \nconference that was not a part of either the House or Senate bills \ngoing into conference that would in this case limit all IC \ninterrogation techniques to the Army Field Manual. Now, this provision \nis widely seen as a prophylactic against the use of torture, and there \nbegins the misconceptions.\n  The United States does not torture. Whether the process known as \nwaterboarding constituted torture when it was used in three cases in \nthe past--and we cannot discuss exactly how it was used here--is a \ndebate to be held among historians and scholars of the law. I do not \nwish to inhibit that debate. I also do not wish to violate U.S. \ndomestic law or international law to which we are committed as a \nnation. The rule of law serves our advantage.\n  But the conflict over what was lawful in interpretation in the first \n2 years after the 9/11 attacks recognizes, to the honest analyst, that \nthere is murkiness at the intersection of law, policy, and legal \ninterpretation. That has always been the case. As I say, I do not want \nto inhibit this debate.\n  I also do not wish that historic debate to inhibit any techniques we \nneed to use for interrogation today. Last week, in an open session of \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Director Mike Hayden--\nGeneral Hayden--spoke forcefully, openly, and articulately about the \nissue of waterboarding. He said in public that, No. 1, less than one-\nthird of less than 100 detainees held by the CIA since 9/11 have ever \nbeen subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques. No. 2, of that \nsmall sample, only three have been subjected to waterboarding. No. 3, \nwaterboarding has not been used for almost 5 years. Yet we have heard \nnothing but screaming about this issue, as though it was relevant \ntoday.\n  As Director Hayden went on to state, there is a universe of lawful \ninterrogation techniques. This includes FBI procedures, the Army Field \nManual, and the enhanced interrogation techniques used by the CIA, but \nwhich, I repeat, does not include waterboarding today. The DCI made it \nplain--the Director of Central Intelligence made it plain that the CIA \nwill play to ``the edges that the American political process allows us. \nIt is our duty to play to that edge.'' The DCI also made it clear that \nif the Congress directs that line is set by the Army Field Manual, then \nthat will be the line in law that CIA officers will respect and adhere \nto.\n  So Congress must act soberly and responsibly in addressing the \nquestion of enhanced interrogation techniques. As the hearing last week \nmade clear to anyone listening, the various approaches--FBI techniques, \nDOD's Army Field Manual, and CIA's enhanced techniques--address various \nsubjects under different circumstances with different sets of goals. \nDirector Maples told me he could not imagine that anyone would have \nobjected to the use of current enhanced techniques if they could have \ngained the intelligence that would have prevented the attack on the USS \nCole.\n\n  In my mind, the greatest advantage of the enhanced interrogation \ntechniques is the public ambiguity surrounding the fact that they are \nclassified. I don't want an al-Qaida operative we have just wrapped up \nto know what is in our playbook. But I want to make clear, ambiguity is \nnot--I repeat, not--a cloak for torture.\n  I can't go into details here, but I can say I have been constantly \namazed as I have studied this issue in the Intelligence Committee over \nsome of the sanctimony that has been used by some people on the Senate \nfloor addressing this issue, and off the Senate floor as well. I can \nquite comfortably say there are actions the American public has \nroutinely witnessed on some of our most popular television police shows \nover the past two decades that would exceed anything in the enhanced \ninterrogation techniques allowed by the CIA. I find this to be ironic.\n  I cannot support this conference report if it has the language \nlimiting interrogation to the Army Field Manual. This is a manual \nwritten for our soldiers, all of whom I think we all agree are brave, \ndedicated warriors, but most of whom are young and inexperienced in the \nneeds of interrogation. They should have their manual. I must point \nout, however, that Army Field Manuals are subject to revision by the \nExecutive at any time, so that we in Congress are acting a little too \nself-satisfied by this simple gesture if we actually believe we are \nrectifying the rule of law.\n  I say, let's have this debate and let's really define what it is we \nwish to proscribe, and let's understand the needs of our intelligence \nand the consequences for our actions--consequences that could be very \ngrave if we keep playing games with these issues--or should I say \npolitical games. Both would be wrong, in my opinion.\n\n[[Page S944]]\n\nMuch of this debate must be classified, but the Senate has procedures \nfor closed sessions, and, after all, the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence was created for just this need. I serve on that august \ncommittee, and I have served on it for a long time.\n  Sometimes I feel as if I am on the corner of sanctimony and \nrighteousness. Sanctimony has popular appeal--it gains the approving \ntut-tutting of the chattering masses. Often it is more bombast than \nsubstance, more Babbittry than bravery. Righteousness is not always a \nfunction of the approval of the masses. Those who go to war to defend \ndo things that are lawful but sometimes unpleasant--sometimes very \nunpleasant. In the choice between sanctimony and righteousness, I will \nchoose the latter.\n  I do not wish to calumniate anyone in this debate. I presume that \npeople are motivated by the purest of motives, as is always the case in \nthe Senate--or should I say I hope it is always the case in the Senate. \nI wish, however, that we had more substantive debate on some of these \ndifficult questions.\n  So because this conference report includes a measure limiting \ninterrogation techniques for our intelligence professionals in the Army \nField Manual--a measure added at the last minute in conference, \nsomething that was in neither bill, the House's or the Senate's--I will \nvote against the conference report and urge us all to reengage in this \ndebate so that the lines of law we draw, that our intelligence \nprofessionals will respect, are lines that also maintain our best \ndefenses within the rule of law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak for 15 minutes as in morning business and to yield \nsome of that time to the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania who \njoins me on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Nomination of David Dugas\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the floor with welcome support \nof the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, who serves so ably on \nthe Judiciary Committee, to talk about the pending nomination of David \nDugas to fill a vacancy in the Middle District of Louisiana.\n  This is a vacancy that has existed for over a year, and, in fact, \ncoming up very soon in March will unfortunately, if we do not act \nbefore then, will be noting the 1-year anniversary of the nomination of \nDavid Dugas to fill this vacancy in the Middle District of Louisiana, \nof course nominated by President Bush.\n  Mr. Dugas is currently U.S. attorney in that same district. In that \ncapacity, of course, he had to come before this Senate and be \nconfirmed; and he was by unanimous consent. So that was a very \nresounding confirmation of him, which included support by my colleague \nfrom Louisiana, Senator Landrieu.\n  In terms of this judicial nomination, Mr. Dugas has received the \nhighest rating possible by the American Bar Association. He is \neminently qualified. There is nothing in his background or his dealings \nor his job as a U.S. attorney that remotely suggests otherwise.\n  Yet there has been great delay and obstructionism, in my opinion, in \nterms of considering this worthy nomination. In fact, even though we \nare coming up on the 1-year mark of President Bush's nomination of him, \nhe has yet to receive a hearing before the Judiciary Committee because \nmy colleague, Senator Landrieu, has not turned in her so-called blue \nslip.\n  I rise to make note of this, and in a few minutes I will have a \nunanimous consent to propose to the Senate to remedy this situation. I \nhave also specifically invited Senator Leahy, Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and Senator Landrieu, my colleague from Louisiana, to join \nus on the floor for an appropriate colloquy.\n  With that introduction, I yield such time as he would consume to my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Louisiana in his \nrequest to have a hearing and then proceed with an up-or-down vote. I \nhave reviewed the record of the nominee. It appears to me that the \nnominee is qualified for the position.\n  In his service as a U.S. attorney, he has already had Senate \nconfirmation. But the basic proposition of having a hearing and a vote, \nI think, is very fundamental to so many pending nominees beyond the \nnominee addressed by the Senator from Louisiana today.\n  I have discussed this issue on a number of occasions with the senior \nSenator from Louisiana, and she has been of the view that she ought not \nto return the blue slip, and I respect her decision. But I also respect \nthe position of Senator Vitter in trying to move forward.\n  It would be my hope that we could come to some accommodation, that we \ncould find some way to set a timetable for a hearing, at least on that.\n  Senator Vitter has advised me that he has written to both the \ndistinguished chairman and the senior Senator from Louisiana and that \nthere is to be a unanimous consent request. I know Senator Vitter will \nawait the arrival of someone who can object because my expectation is a \nunanimous consent request will be objected to. But the issue involved \nis to raise the issue and to make the point as to what has happened and \nto try to see if there can be some accommodation, as noted by the floor \ndiscussion today.\n  I see Senator Vitter nodding in the affirmative. In my capacity as \nranking member on the Judiciary Committee, I would like to get these \nnominations to move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, \nfirst for his service on the Judiciary Committee; it has been very \ndistinguished, to serve there as many years very ably, now-ranking \nmember, and specifically for his support on this nomination and others \nto try to break through the gridlock, break through the partisanship, \nmove forward in a positive way for the country.\n  I believe that is absolutely necessary in a number of cases, but the \none that surely hits closest to home for me is this nomination of David \nDugas to a judgeship in the Middle District of Louisiana. So I thank \nthe ranking member for all his help and support; I know it will \ncontinue.\n  Again, let me note I wrote to Chairman Leahy that I would be taking \nthe floor this week to make the upcoming unanimous consent request. I \ndid the same to my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu. As soon \nas we figured out the time that would be available, we sent them word, \nand I sincerely hope they can both join me on the floor because I think \nit would be very useful and very informative to have an appropriate \ndiscussion and colloquy about this case. So I certainly invite that. I \nwould encourage them to accept the invitation to join me on the floor.\n  Let me point out and reiterate some very important points about this \nnomination. President Bush made the nomination some time ago. That was \nMarch of last year. We are coming up quickly on the 1-year mark of this \nnomination. The vacancy in the Middle District has been open even a \nlittle bit longer, over a year.\n  Because of that, a backlog of cases is quickly mounting in the Middle \nDistrict. The Middle District is an area surrounding Baton Rouge, LA, \nthe capital of the State. It has felt a huge influx of people, of \nresidents, and of litigation, largely because of Hurricane Katrina.\n\n  Because of that, because of this vacancy, judicial backlogs have been \nmounting and mounting. We are not quite to the point--and this is \ndefined in law and by rules of the court--we are not quite to the point \nthat it is defined as a ``judicial emergency,'' but we are quickly \ncoming up to that line.\n  So the people of Louisiana, the people of the Middle District are not \nbeing served well and properly and as quickly as they should be. This \nvacancy needs to be filled for that reason.\n  Now, let us look at the man who President Bush has chosen to fill the\n\n[[Page S945]]\n\nvacancy. By all accounts, he is eminently qualified. Mr. Dugas is the \nsitting U.S. attorney in the Middle District. He has done a very fine \njob in that position, has won praise from many different quarters, \nparticularly from law enforcement.\n  He has many admirers and allies in the law enforcement community: \nSheriffs across the State, chiefs of police, district attorneys, many \nothers. They have written in to many of us about this nomination in \nstrong support.\n  Mr. Dugas was already considered by the Senate, of course he had to \nbe, for his present job of U.S. attorney. He was considered very \nfavorably. In fact, it was considered completely noncontroversial, and \nhe was confirmed swiftly by unanimous consent. In that process, of \ncourse, my colleague, Senator Landrieu, was here at the time and was \npart of that very positive sweeping confirmation.\n  As I said, for this judicial vacancy, Mr. Dugas has received the \nhighest rating possible by the American Bar Association. That is a \ndistinguished professional organization, it is not political, it is \ncertainly not leaning to the right. Nobody would think that. They have \nrated this nominee of President Bush with their highest rating possible \nfor a judicial nomination.\n  Yet this languishes and languishes. In another month's time, we are \ngoing to be on the 1-year mark of the nomination, with this backlog of \ncases mounting, as we near a judicial emergency in the district.\n  I do not think that is right. I do not think that is serving the \npeople of Louisiana at all. I do not think that is serving the people \nof the country at all.\n  Mr. Dugas deserves better. More importantly, the people of Louisiana \ndeserve better. The people of Louisiana and of the country want us to \nact as grownups and to come together and do our work in a timely, \nrespectful way. They don't think this sort of partisanship and \nobstructionism, particularly over judgeships, falls into that \ndefinition.\n  This got particularly bad a few years ago. I was hopeful. Since I \nhave been here, not because of my influence but just in general, since \nI got here, the Senate has become more responsive and more responsible \nabout nominations, particularly judicial nominations. Unfortunately, \nthis is a clear example in the other direction. Let's clear up this \nexample. Let's move it off the list of those examples of partisanship \nand obstruction. Let's act in a reasonable--late, by now, but \nreasonable way, finally moving forward with this highly qualified \nnominee before this district gets to a state of judicial emergency, \nwhich is looming.\n  That is my simple and reasonable request. With all that background, I \nwill now propound a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that if the Committee on the Judiciary has \nnot held a hearing on PN 349, the nomination of David Dugas of \nLouisiana to be U.S. district judge for the Middle District of \nLouisiana, and reported the nomination to the Senate by March 19, 2008, \nwhich would be the 1-year anniversary of his nomination being \ntransmitted, that on the next calendar day the Senate is in session, \nthe Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration \nof the nomination; that the Senate proceed to executive session to \nconsider the nomination; that there be 1 hour of debate equally divided \nbetween the chairman and the ranking member of the Committee on the \nJudiciary or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of \nsuch time, the Senate immediately proceed to a rollcall vote on the \nnomination; that if the nomination is confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's actions; and that the \nSenate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in my capacity as a Senator from \nthe State of New Jersey and on behalf of the majority leader, objects.\n  Mr. VITTER. Of course, I am disappointed--not surprised but \ndisappointed--at the objection.\n  I resume my plea specifically to Senator Leahy, chairman of the \ncommittee, and to Senator Landrieu, who has not turned in her blue slip \nand is thus the reason for the committee not even holding a hearing, \nthat we move beyond this, that we have a hearing on this eminently \nqualified nominee. If there is a reason to stop the nomination, surely \na hearing is the best venue and the best vehicle to illustrate that and \ntalk about it. I hope we move beyond the pure obstructionism and \npartisanship that has us stuck in the mud with a judicial emergency in \nthe Middle District looming.\n  This is exactly the sort of obstruction the American people are tired \nof. They spoke clearly to this over the last several years about \njudicial nominees. Maybe we got a little better, but here we are again \nin terms of this matter and this case which is surely important to \nLouisiana. I urge all of my colleagues to work beyond this. \nSpecifically, I urge the chairman of the Judiciary and Senator Landrieu \nto work beyond this. It is unfortunate that they couldn't accept my \ninvitation to have a useful, informative dialog and colloquy on the \nissue on the floor. There has been no good explanation for inaction \nthat I have ever heard. A lot of people would like to hear some \ndiscussion and explanation. I hope we will hear that soon. I hope in \nthe very near future we will move toward an appropriate resolution of \nthis matter, which is a hearing and a vote in Judiciary and then on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lautenberg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are considering the intelligence \nauthorization bill. My understanding is later this afternoon we will \nhave, perhaps, a final vote on the bill. There are many important \nprovisions in the bill. Many of us who have been here for some while--\nfrom the destruction of the World Trade Center and the murder of \nthousands of innocent Americans on 9/11, where terrorists used \nairplanes loaded with fuel as guided missiles to bring down the World \nTrade Center and attacked the Pentagon and through the subsequent \nperiod leading up to the Iraq war--know we have had all kinds of \ndifficulties with the intelligence community.\n  We have a lot of men and women risking their lives all around the \nworld every day collecting intelligence, and yet most of us have been \nthrough top secret briefings that we later find out to have been \nabsolutely false, wrong, just standing facts on their head.\n  So it is critically important for this country to have a good system \nof intelligence gathering and good analysis of intelligence if we are \ngoing to prevent the next terrorist attack against our country.\n  It is a difficult world out there. We have terrorists who would like \nnothing more than to kill Americans and attack our country. So passing \nan intelligence authorization bill that provides the resources, \nprovides a structure for a good system of intelligence is very \nimportant to the safety and the security of this great country. That is \nwhat the debate is about. That is what the upcoming vote is about.\n\n  But there is one provision that has caused a special concern for some \nin this Intelligence reauthorization bill, and I want to talk about it \na bit. That is the provision that deals with the subject of torture.\n  One of the most important provisions in this legislation is one that \nmakes the Army Field Manual provisions on interrogations applicable to \nall U.S. Government personnel. Right now, those provisions which forbid \ntorture apply only to the military. Those provisions do not apply to \nsome others that are conducting interrogations on behalf of our \nGovernment. That means that some others who work for the U.S. \nGovernment--the CIA, for example; contractors, for example--may use \ninterrogation techniques which may constitute torture and which are \nforbidden in the Army Field Manual. This legislation incorporates the \nArmy Field Manual provisions on interrogations and says it applies to \nall personnel from the United States.\n  Now, why is that important? Because it makes a vote for this bill a \nvote\n\n[[Page S946]]\n\nagainst torture. It is a vote that says American values and torture are \nnot in any way compatible. Voting for this bill is a vote for a country \nthat has been looked up to throughout the world because of our system \nof values. It is that simple, and it is that important.\n  Let me say that I acknowledge today there are tyrants and despots and \ndictators and a lot of evil people in this world and throughout history \nwho have used and have always justified the use of torture--but not \nthis country. We have not done that, with the exception of some recent \ndisclosures I will talk about.\n  Some people argue that this issue of torture is especially about \nwaterboarding. Waterboarding is a more antiseptic term. It should be \ndescribed as water torture. Some people say that: Well, we have \nwaterboarded. In fact, it has been disclosed by administration \nofficials that we have waterboarded--which is water tortured--three of \nthe most dangerous, despicable terrorists who attacked this United \nStates, and we only did it at a time when we thought they would provide \ninformation or had information that would allow us to avoid other \ncatastrophic attacks, and we need to be able to do that again in the \nfuture, if necessary, if some despicable terrorist is planning an \nattack on this country.\n  Let me talk a little bit about what we are describing here. \nwaterboarding is a practice that has been around for centuries, and it \nhas been known--widely known--as torture for a long time. In fact, \nwaterboarding has been prosecuted as torture and as a war crime on many \noccasions in history. Trying now to claim it is legal, that it is not \ntorture, or that it is something other than torture doesn't square with \nthe facts. Second, history teaches us that torture is not effective. \nAside from the question of morality, it is not effective. Those who \nknow tell us that those being tortured will often tell you anything \nthey think you want to hear in order to have the torture stopped.\n  The provisions in the Army Field Manual set forth the many approved \nmethods to get reliable information, but those methods do not include \nwhat is defined as torture.\n  The question about torture is: If you decide that torture is \nappropriate and available as a tool for our country to use, why stop at \nwaterboarding? There are many other forms of torture that are even more \nheinous, more abusive: putting people in boiling water, pulling out \ntheir fingernails, amputations, electric shock. Justifying torture is a \nvery slippery slope that doesn't have a pleasant end for a country that \ncares about its system of values. We don't do that and haven't done \nthat. We haven't been engaged in torture as a country for a couple of \ncenturies because we don't belong to that group of people in the world \nwho want to do damage and want to commit mayhem and want to kill \nothers. We hold ourselves to a higher standard in this country--always \nhave--a higher standard, a standard that all of us can be proud of.\n  It is interesting when you think back to the Cold War. We won the \nCold War, but we didn't win it with bombs and bullets; we won it with \nAmerican values and American standards, and American rights. The other \nevening I saw a very large portion of the Berlin Wall that had been \ntransported to the United States of America. It was a wall that kept \nthe free world out and it was a wall that kept those in East Germany \nbehind it, living in oppression, living in a circumstance where they \nwere denied freedom. I was thinking again about the Cold War and the \nfact that we didn't win the war with bombs.\n  I have in my desk something I have had there for a long period of \ntime, if I might show it by unanimous consent. This is a piece of a \nwing from a Soviet Backfire bomber. This bomber very likely carried a \nnuclear weapon that would have been used against the United States. \nActually, we sawed part of the wing off this Soviet bomber because when \nthe Cold War was over, we reached an agreement to destroy delivery \nsystems. I have also in my desk a hinge. This hinge used to be on a \nmissile silo that held a missile with a nuclear warhead on its tip \naimed at a U.S. city. It was in Ukraine. Where that missile used to \nsit, there are now sunflowers growing. It is now a sunflower field. The \nmissile is gone, the warhead is gone. This bomber is now in pieces.\n  We won the Cold War. And we have agreements with Russia, Ukraine and \nother former Soviet republics under which we help destroy their Cold \nWar weapons and delivery systems. But we didn't win the Cold War with \nbombs; we didn't blow up that Backfire bomber. We didn't blow up the \nSoviet missile silo with one of our missiles. We won the Cold War \nbecause of our values. American values won the Cold War.\n  What are those values? Well, people are free. They believed what they \nsaid. They believed what they wanted. The Government had to respect the \nrights of everyone in this country. We were a country that had a \ngovernment based on a Constitution that had a Bill of Rights that \napplies to all Americans. Our country stood for liberty, human rights, \nhuman dignity, the rule of law. That is what won the Cold War. Those \nvalues were so strong that in the middle of the Cold War with the \nSoviet Union, those values shone a light of hope into the darkest cells \nand the deepest part of the Soviet Union. In the gulag prisons, in the \noutermost reaches of Siberia, those values reached those cells. \nMillions of prisoners had been held, often in solitary confinement, \nsimply for thinking and speaking freely. Many were there for years; \nsome swept off the streets, never to reappear again; many tortured into \nfalse confessions, and many murdered. Some survived, however, and \ntalked about their experience, and about how important the idea of \nAmerica was to them, how important the idea of freedom was to those who \nhad been detained and had not been able to experience freedom, and to \nthose who had been tortured by a country that didn't want them to be \nfree. It was a clear and vast difference between America and the Soviet \nUnion. As imperfect as we are, the basic foundation and bedrock of \nvalues in this country is what shined so brightly in the middle of the \nCold War. It wasn't the amount of bombs and bullets each country had; \nit was what we stood for.\n\n  When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Iron Curtain was lifted, all \nof those police states crumbled, and every single one of them became \nfree countries that provided freedom to their citizens. Every single \none chose freedom and democracy. That is how powerful the idea and the \nvalues of this country have been.\n  What I say today is we have to regain the moral high ground and \ndescribe our values in circumstances that make it clear that we do not \nsubscribe to some things others might. We do not support torture. We \nwill not support torture. It is not what our country is about. From the \nvery beginning in this country, America has held itself to a higher \nstandard. George Washington, leading the Continental Army--think about \nit: 5,000 soldiers in the Continental Army going up against a British \nArmy of 50,000 soldiers, and our 5,000 were shopkeepers and farmers; \n5,000 against 50,000, and we prevailed over time. George Washington, \nafter a large number of his troops were captured and slaughtered--he \nsaw the Hessian mercenaries kill unarmed prisoners. After that, George \nWashington and his troops captured a large number of British soldiers, \nand many of the troops justifiably wanted revenge. They sought to \nexecute them just as they had seen done to unarmed American prisoners. \nGeorge Washington refused. He refused to treat the prisoners as his \nsoldiers had been treated. He insisted America was different. He said: \nWe are different, and we are going to treat people the way they should \nbe treated, not the way they treated us, and that has been our \nbirthright.\n  That is why this discussion right now is so very important. It goes \nto the core of what we are and who we are as a nation. Quite simply, we \nhave to say unequivocally: We are against torture. We, the Congress of \nthe United States, must say that torture is un-American, simply because \nit is. No hair splitting, no fancy words, no legal distinction about \nwhat might or might not be torture. That will begin to restore, I \nthink, our rightful place if we say we are against torture.\n  Let me briefly continue to say that being against torture is being \nfor an America that is better than its enemies. It is that simple. I \nsaid we fought and won the Cold War after many decades. We faced \nnuclear annihilation during that period. We faced a\n\n[[Page S947]]\n\nruthless enemy all around the world, and yet we won that war. We did \nthat with our reputation, our values, and our moral authority intact. \nIt was and still is, I think, a beacon of hope around the world.\n  Those values and that moral authority, I believe, are what is going \nto allow us to prevail in the battle against the terrorists who wish to \ndo harm--not just here but in other parts of the world as well. We \nneed--and I believe the world needs--an America that people respect and \nadmire, an America that is different, that begins in a manner that is \nloud and clear saying: We do not torture. This will empower our country \nand make us stronger.\n  I was very disappointed last week to hear the head of our \nintelligence service, and then to hear a spokesperson for the White \nHouse, say: Yes, we have waterboarded. They used the term--the right \nterm--water torture; yes, we have done that. We did it because we must, \nand we reserve the right to do it again. It is exactly the wrong thing \nfor this country. It is not just me saying that. I am not just quoting \nGeorge Washington who has established the higher standard, and God \nbless him for doing so. Let me read what General Petraeus said, who \nleads the American troops in Iraq right now. Our most senior commander \nin Iraq, GEN David Petraeus, sent a letter to every Soldier, every \nSailor, every Airman, Marine, and Coast Guardsman serving in Iraq. He \nsaid this:\n\n       Our values and the laws governing warfare teach us to \n     respect human dignity, maintain our integrity, and do what is \n     right. Adherence to our values distinguishes us from our \n     enemy.\n       This fight depends on securing the population, which must \n     understand that we--not our enemies--occupy the high ground.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Some may argue that we would be more effective if we \n     sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain \n     information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the \n     basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows us \n     that they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary.\n\n  That is General Petraeus, who leads our troops in Iraq, and says \nthose who believe that torture is appropriate would be wrong.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for his comments, and I thank Senator \nFeinstein for the support language. Some argue that this language was \nnot necessary, that the McCain amendment, which passed 90 to 9, made it \nclear that whether you are in uniform or not torture is not the policy \nof the United States. Others argue that the Geneva Conventions had \nalready made that clear for decades before it was brought into question \nby this administration.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota if he struggles with the same \nthought that I do. At some point after World War II, we prosecuted \nJapanese soldiers who tortured American prisoners of war using \nwaterboarding and charged them with war crimes; and we are now at a \npoint in our history, some 60 years later, where General Hayden \ntestifies under oath before Congress that our Nation engaged in the \nsame conduct, at least three times previously, when it came to \nwaterboarding. I wonder if the Senator from North Dakota struggles with \nthe same concept of justice as was applied after World War II and as it \nappears to be applied by this administration?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that is a significant contradiction for \nour country. I was as surprised and disappointed as the Senator from \nIllinois was to have one of the leading officials in this \nadministration testify under oath that, yes, in fact, waterboarding had \nbeen used. It was in fact legal, they said, and it would be used again, \nif necessary, and could be sanctioned by the President of the United \nStates.\n  The Senator is correct that this Congress passed a piece of \nlegislation that defined waterboarding as torture and prohibits it, and \nthe President at the White House, in a signing statement accompanying \nthe legislation, essentially said: It doesn't matter so much what the \nlegislation says; what matters is what I will decide to do.\n  Now, we have a disclosure--a public disclosure--to the world that \nthis country has employed a technique that has, for hundreds of years, \nbeen described as torture.\n  I know and understand the passions that exist. I understand what I \nwould like to see done to Osama bin Laden when he is captured. I \nunderstand the passions. But I also understand that what has given this \ncountry a different standing in the world is our value system.\n  Again, let me, if I might, for the Senator from Illinois, refer back \nto George Washington, which I described earlier before the Senator came \non the Senate floor. When I think of the odds facing the Revolutionary \nArmy, it is pretty unbelievable. The Senator from Illinois and I were \nat Mount Vernon recently, and we saw a display describing that at one \npoint there were 5,000 soldiers in the Continental Army and 50,000 \nBritish soldiers. That was the fight. Our soldiers were shopkeepers and \nfarmers, ordinary folks off the street. Theirs were trained British \nsoldiers. So it was 5,000 to 50,000. George Washington and his soldiers \nsaw members of the Continental Army captured and then, unarmed, \nmurdered, executed by the British soldiers and the Hessians.\n  Washington's soldiers, when capturing some British soldiers, wanted \nto do the same thing. But he said, nothing doing, we are not going to \ndo that. George Washington said that we are different and we are going \nto treat people the way they should be treated, not the way they \ntreated us.\n  When you think of that set of standards and values and then wind your \nway through the discussion in recent days, and to have a top U.S. \nofficial say, yes, we have used waterboarding--and it is widely \nacknowledged as torture--we used it and it was legal and we intend to \nuse it again if it is necessary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sure the Senator is aware that this questionable \nchapter in American history--which I think will haunt us for \ngenerations to come--also involves people other than the general who \ntestified. There is an individual who has been nominated by the \nPresident to be head of the Office of Legal Counsel, Steven Bradbury. \nHe has been rejected four times by the Senate. The President said last \nweek that he was the most important appointment. A month or two before, \nhe told the majority leader he didn't want to talk about any other \nappointments until Mr. Bradbury was approved. Bradbury's tenure in the \nOffice of Legal Counsel goes back to the period of time when this \nadministration was rewriting torture policy in America--a policy which \nthey at one point accepted and later rejected. Many of us have said if \nMr. Bradbury is coming before us for consideration, we want to see \nthose memos written--memos which James Comey, former Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, said the United States would be ashamed if they ever became \npublic.\n  I say to the Senator from North Dakota that not only do we have to do \nour part, but this administration has to do its part as well. Those who \nwere engaged in this questionable--if not embarrassing, if not \nshameful--conduct involving torture policy must be held accountable to \nthe administration. They are certainly not deserving of a promotion, \nwhich is what they are suggesting for Mr. Bradbury.\n\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota, reflecting on what this \nadministration has been through, the many times they have told us \ntorture was not being used, that waterboarding was not being used, and \nnow with this disclosure of at least three instances admitted under \noath, I wonder if even this legislation--including the Feinstein \namendment--would restrain this President in the future, in the next few \nmonths, as we face challenges that we cannot even imagine at this \nmoment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it is far more than disappointing to me, \nand I think to a lot of people in this Chamber and across the country, \nthat the President received advice from people who work for him in the \nWhite House and have said this under oath and on television and in \nevery other venue that under the Commander in Chief powers, the \nPresident has the power to do almost anything. He can put out a drift-\nnet and collect every communication under every condition--e-mails and \ntelephone calls. Go to the documentary recently done, entitled ``No Way \nOut'' and view the interviews by this administration's officials, who \ntake the position that this President has the authority as Commander in \nChief to do almost anything. That includes this issue of torture.\n\n[[Page S948]]\n\n  The point I make is that we have a piece of legislation that we will \nvote on later this afternoon. Included in that legislation is a \nprovision that says the Army Field Manual will describe the conditions \nof interrogation of enemy combatants. I just read what General Petraeus \nsaid to all of his soldiers--that torture is inappropriate and will not \nbe allowed. The Army Field Manual prevents torture. What we are saying \nin the conference report that we will vote on in an hour or two is that \nthe Army Field Manual's restrictions on torture apply to all U.S. \nGovernment officials and contractors doing interrogation.\n  My concern about this administration--and I think it is echoed by the \nSenator from Illinois--is that they have decided they are not bound by \nthe law, they are not bound by what the Congress enacts. They are doing \nother sorts of dances with signing statements and interpretations of \nthe Constitution to say that under the Commander in Chief powers they \ncan do almost anything if they believe there is some kind of a threat. \nThat is a very dangerous mind set, in my judgment, for any \nadministration at any time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for one last question, I thank \nhim for that quote from President Washington which talked about the \nterrible circumstances the Continental Army faced and how, in those \ndays before there even was an America, they would establish a different \nset of values in this part of the world. He admonished his troops to \nlive by those values.\n  I am sure the Senator knows that each year our State Department \npublishes a report card on human rights of nations around the world. We \nare critical of nations that engage in torture. We are critical of \nnations that engage in conduct that is inconsistent with our values. I \nsay to the Senator from North Dakota, how can we maintain that moral \nstatus and moral authority if we are found compromising something as \nfundamental as torture and waterboarding and the Geneva Conventions, \nwhich guided us for decades?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator answers the question by phrasing the \nquestion. Let me conclude by saying this: We have 43 top retired \nmilitary leaders of the U.S. Armed Forces who have written a letter. As \none, they say:\n\n       We believe it is vital to the safety of our men and women \n     in the uniform of the United States not to sanction the use \n     of interrogation methods it would find unacceptable if \n     inflicted on our captured Americans.\n\n  Today there are men and women fighting for this country. If captured, \nhow would we react if the leader of a group that captured them says: We \nare torturing them because we feel we can get information, and we can \nonly get it by torturing them, and we believe torture is legal. We are \ngoing to waterboard them, we believe it is legal. We have already done \nit, and we intend to do it again if we need to.\n  How would we feel if that were somebody else talking about how they \nare going to treat American soldiers? That is unacceptable. We have a \ncountry with a higher moral purpose and standards that have served us \nfor two centuries, and we should not obliterate that just because we \nhave some people in this administration who believe it is appropriate. \nIt is not.\n  John McCain knows that. He led the fight to put a provision in law \nthat prohibits torture. This President did a signing statement next to \nthe legislation he signed, saying: I don't have to abide by it if I \ndon't feel like it.\n  That is a scary thought in a democracy. I hope this afternoon we will \nregister a very strong vote in support of this conference report and \nagainst the concept of our country engaging in torture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nadoption of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2082, the \nIntelligence Authorization Act, occur at 4:30 p.m. today; that no \npoints of order be in order; and that the time until then be equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. So there is an equal balance of time in the next--we have 2 \nhours. I think it should work out fine. Either side will have \napproximately an hour, so that should work out well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I want to follow the lead of the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota and my friend, the Senator from \nIllinois, and continue on this question with the determination the \nGovernment has made that waterboarding is legal.\n  It is a question that matters so much to wary and watchful nations, \ndisheartened and distrustful in the wake of 7 years of failed \nleadership and broken promises. It is also a question that matters \nimmensely to the billions of men, women, and children around the globe \nwho look to this country, the United States of America, as a beacon of \nlight that shows the way nations ought to act and the way the world \nought to be. It is a question that matters to the American people who \nare sick of asking: Is it wrong? and being told: Well, it depends.\n  The people of America still do not know how this came about--in \nparticular, how the Department of Justice came to approve this sordid \ntechnique. I believe we are in a position where the concerns we have \nabout torture overlap with some of the concerns we have had in this \nChamber about the independence and integrity of the Department of \nJustice. Here is what we know.\n  We know that Attorney General Michael Mukasey has said that ``the CIA \nsought advice from the Department of Justice, and the Department \ninformed the CIA that [waterboarding's] use would be lawful under the \ncircumstances and within the limits and safeguards of the program.'' We \nknow in 2002, John Yoo of the Office of Legal Counsel drafted a memo, \nlater approved by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee, which reads, in \npart:\n\n       There is a significant range of acts that, though they \n     might constitute cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or \n     punishment, failed to rise to the level of torture.\n\n  As Evan Wallach of the Columbia Journal of Transnational Law has \nwritten:\n\n       None of the Memo's analysis explains why waterboarding does \n     not cause physical or psychological pain sufficient to meet \n     the criminalization standards it enunciates.\n\n  We have asked for further clarification, but in a hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee, Attorney General Mukasey refused to comment on the \nlegality of waterboarding because the technique was not currently in \nuse and because of what he described as ``the absence of concrete facts \nand circumstances.'' Even though the Department of Justice is now \nconducting an investigation into whether tape recordings of alleged \nwaterboarding sessions were improperly destroyed, they would not look \ninto whether the conduct on the tape was in and of itself improper.\n  The argument is that no one who relies in good faith on the \nDepartment's past advice should be subject to criminal investigations \nfor actions taken in reliance on that advice, which raises the question \nwithin the question: How did that advice come to be given in the first \nplace?\n  How did the best and brightest of the Department of Justice overlook \nthe facts of the history of waterboarding prosecutions in which the \nUnited States was directly involved, and why was such guidance approved \nwhen contravening precedents appear clearly to be in evidence?\n  Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues the article written by Evan \nWallach, Columbia Journal of Transnational Law, entitled ``Drop by \nDrop: Forgetting the History of Water Torture in U.S. Courts.'' The \nfull cite is 45 Columbia Journal of Transnational Law 468 (2007).\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Government long considered waterboarding a \nform of torture, prosecutable as a war crime and punishable \naccordingly. This history includes war crimes prosecutions against \nJapanese soldiers who waterboarded American aviators in World War II, \nthe use of water torture by U.S. soldiers in the Philippines, and even \nan incident of waterboarding by a local sheriff prosecuted by the \nDepartment of Justice itself. Let me start with that.\n  I am reading from the Wallach law review article in which it reports:\n\n       In 1983, the Department of Justice affirmed that the use of \n     water torture techniques was indeed criminal conduct under \n     U.S. law.\n\n\n[[Page S949]]\n\n\n  A sheriff in a Texas county waterboarded prisoners in order to \nextract confessions. Count one of the indictment asserted that the \ndefendants conspired to--and this is a quote from the Department's own \nindictment--``subject prisoners to a suffocating `water torture' ordeal \nin order to coerce confessions. This generally included the placement \nof a towel over the nose and mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of \nwater in the towel until the prisoner began to move, jerk, or otherwise \nindicate he was suffocating and/or drowning.''\n  The sheriff and his deputies were all convicted by a jury under count \none. It didn't end there. The case then went up on appeal, and the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit rendered a \ndecision. I have in my hands United States of America v. Lee, 744 F.2d \n1124, decided in 1984, in which they gave appellate review of these \nconvictions.\n  Finally, at sentencing, U.S. District Judge James DeAnda's comments, \naccording to the article, were ``He told the former Sheriff that he had \nallowed law enforcement to fall into `the hands of a bunch of thugs. \nThe operation down there would embarrass the dictator of a country.' '' \nThat is the opinion of a U.S. district court judge at a sentencing on \nwaterboarding.\n  How is it that when the Department of Justice, the Office of Legal \nCounsel were asked for their opinion, they were able to write this \nopinion? I have it in my hand. This is the unclassified version. It has \nbeen substantially redacted. Even so, it is 50 pages long--50 pages \nlong. They did 50 pages of legal research and could not find a U.S. \nCourt of Appeals case in which the Department of Justice itself had \nbrought the charges? Here is the case, United States v. Lee. It \ndescribes the facts:\n\n       Lee was indicted along with two other deputies, Floyd Baker \n     and James Glover, and the County Sheriff James Parker, based \n     on a number of incidents in which prisoners were subjected to \n     a ``water torture'' in order to prompt confessions to various \n     crimes.\n\n  Throughout the rest of the opinion, these are referred to as \n``torture'' and ``torture incidents.''\n  All one has to have is Lexus or Westlaw and plug in the words ``water \ntorture'' and find this case. How is it possible that the Office of \nLegal Counsel could not have found this? How is it possible that they \ncould have also missed what the Columbia Law School was able to find--a \ntelegram from Secretary of State Cordell Hull to the Japanese \nGovernment objecting to the mistreatment of American prisoners, which \nincluded specifically waterboarding and describing the ``brutal and \nbestial methods of extorting alleged confessions''? That is our \nSecretary of State in an official communication to the Japanese \nGovernment describing, among other tortures, water tortures as brutal \nand bestial methods to extort alleged confessions. How could they not \nhave found that? How could they not have found the charges the Senator \nfrom North Dakota referred to in which Japanese soldiers were brought \nup on charges in front of military tribunals--military tribunals \nstaffed with American judges, military tribunals staffed with American \nprosecutors--for waterboarding American prisoners?\n  Here are some examples. One of the Japanese officers was named Hata \nand the article describes the charges and specifications against \nOfficer Hata, which included this:\n\n        . . . Hata did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally \n     mistreat and torture Morris O. Killough, an American Prisoner \n     of War, by beating and kicking him, by fastening him on a \n     stretcher and pouring water up his nostrils.\n       Similarly, Hata did willfully and unlawfully, brutally \n     mistreat and torture Thomas B. Armitage, William O. Cash and \n     Monroe Dave Woodall, American Prisoners of War, by beating \n     and kicking them, by forcing water into their mouths and \n     noses. . . .\n\n  The charge and specifications against Officer Asano were:\n\n       Asano did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and \n     torture Morris O. Killough, an American Prisoner of War, by \n     beating and kicking him, by fastening him on a stretcher and \n     pouring water up his nostrils. . . .\n       Asano did, willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and \n     torture Thomas B. Armitage, William O Cash and Munroe Dave \n     Woodall, American Prisoners of War, by beating and kicking \n     them, by forcing water into their mouths and noses. . . .\n\n  The charge and specifications against Officer Kita were again, \n``willfully and unlawfully, brutally mistreat and torture John Henry \nBurton, an American Prisoner of War, by beating him and by forcing \nwater into his nose.''\n  Over and over the testimony describes exactly what we know as \nwaterboarding. The charges and specifications by this tribunal staffed \nby American officers describe that they did willfully and unlawfully \ncommit cruel, inhuman, and brutal acts and atrocities and other \noffenses, including strapping them to a stretcher and pouring water \ndown their nostrils, by holding the prisoner's head back and forcing \nhim to swallow a bucketful of sea water over and over and over.\n  How could they have missed it? How could they have missed it? How \ncould they miss the decision on point by the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fifth Circuit?\n  What else do we know about the Office of Legal Counsel? We know that \nthe conditions there were pretty ripe for abuse. We know they were \ndoing this in secret, protected from public scrutiny, protected from \npeer review, protected from critical analysis under the veil of \nsecrecy, deep secrecy in which they were operating, coming up with the \ntheories as they pleased, thinking they would never see the light of \nday. So they did not have to do their homework. Somebody might have \ndone a little research and found the Fifth Circuit decision on point, \nbut, no, they did not need to.\n  It is part of a pattern because, as the Presiding Officer will \nrecall, when I was offered the chance to read the secret Office of \nLegal Counsel opinions related to the warrantless wiretapping program, \nI went and took some notes, and when I got back here, I eventually was \nable to get them declassified. They described other interesting \ntheories that grew in that hothouse of legal ideology, protected from \nthe glare of public scrutiny, ideas such as the President is not \nobliged to follow Executive orders. He is not obliged to give anybody \nnotice that he is violating Executive orders. He can live in a parallel \nuniverse in constant violation of his own Executive orders and nothing \nis wrong with that, other than, of course, the fact that it completely \ndegrades and destroys the entire structure of Executive orders as a law \nfunction of the United States of America.\n  Another argument is that under article II, the President's power as \nCommander in Chief, he has the authority to determine what his powers \nare. Think about that for a moment. They assert article II gives them \nthe authority to decide what the scope of his article II powers are. I \nseem to remember a decision called Marbury v. Madison saying it is \n``emphatically the province of the judicial department to decide what \nthe law is.''\n  The last one, my personal favorite, is that the Department of Justice \nis bound by the legal determinations of the President. It is a good \nthing that was not the case when President Nixon was the President and \nmade the legal determination if the President does it, it doesn't \nviolate the law.\n  So what on Earth has been going on at the Office of Legal Counsel, an \noffice that used to be distinguished for its probity, for its analysis, \nfor its scholarship, an office on which the Department of Justice \nrelies?\n  Just as Americans rely on the Department of Justice to provide \nguidance in our Government, to provide a moral compass within the \nDepartment of Justice, the Office of Legal Counsel is supposed to be \nthe place where they try to get it right. How could they try to get it \nright when they cannot even find a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals \ndecision on water torture when you are looking up whether it is \nillegal? If I were a partner in a law firm and a junior associate came \nto me with a memo such as this that had missed the case on point, do \nyou think he would have much of a career? I don't think so. It is a \nfatal failure of legal analysis. And yet, where there is supposed to be \nthe very best at the legal counsel of the Department of Justice, they \nmissed all of it. If there has been a systematic breakdown in this \ninstitution of Government long known for probity and scholarship, if it \nhas been captured and behind a veil of secrecy rendered a political \nideological tool, that is a matter of very legitimate public concern.\n  I am pleased to say Senator Durbin and myself have written to the \ninspector general of the Department of Justice and to the Office of \nProfessional\n\n[[Page S950]]\n\nResponsibility of the Department of Justice to look into exactly that \nmatter.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his patience with me. I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida for his patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have heard one of the best--\nI cannot use ``oration'' because it was far superior. It was one of the \nbest explanations of how the Department of Justice has gone awry by the \nSenator from Rhode Island. I commend the Senator from Rhode Island. I \nthank him for his legal analysis, and I wish to underscore what he has \nsaid, that the reason the Department of Justice was ignoring that Court \nof Appeals decision, the reason the Department of Justice was ignoring \nall of the history of the record that has been built over time, of \nwhich the Senator cited the statements from World War II, the reason \nall of that has been ignored or purposely missed is because the \nDepartment of Justice became politicized so that politics became the \nrule of the day instead of the rule of law.\n  In a nation that recognizes it is a nation of law, not a rule of men, \nwhen politics is inserted for law, then we get into the trouble we have \ngotten into. That is what brings us here.\n  I have already addressed this subject of why my conclusion, a long \ndeliberative process of coming to the question, that we ought to etch \ninto law the Army Field Manual as the standard by which the \nintelligence community will carry out their interrogations. That ought \nto be the law.\n  I thank the Senators who have spoken in favor of this legislation. We \nare going to have a chance to vote on it pretty soon. Each of us can \ndetermine what we think ought to be representative of America, if it \nought to be torture or not. We are clearly going to have an opportunity \nto say that because we are going to vote on a proposed law that says: \nIs torture going to be the standard for America?\n  I wish to speak on another subject, so I guess the appropriate \nparliamentary procedure is for me to ask consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Rape and Sexual Assault Investigations\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, thus far, the Department of the \nArmy has acknowledged that there have been 124 incidents of sexual \nassault against contractor and military personnel in Iraq which are \ncurrently under investigation. We know of only three of those cases \nthat are now being considered by the Department of Justice and, \ntherefore, the Department of Justice will not respond to my entreaties \nabout this investigation because they say it is an ongoing criminal \ninvestigation.\n\n  However, in other cases, we have gathered some facts, and these facts \nhave been quite telling. There does not seem to be a standard to \nprotect female contractors or military personnel from sexual assault in \nIraq under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army. The 124 cases of sexual \nassaults of both contractors and military personnel have been \nacknowledged just under the Department of the Army. The question is, \nunder the other branches of the service whose contracts are being \nadministered by civilian contractors, how many are there; and are there \nsimilar cases in the other theater of operations--Afghanistan as well \nas in Iraq?\n  What we also know from the facts we have gathered thus far is the \nproblem is not within the U.S. military nearly so much as it is among \ncontractor personnel because there is a nebulous set of regulations as \nto how it is to be handled on the reporting of a rape. Untold numbers \nof sexual assaults have been committed in Iraq, and the Departments of \nJustice, Defense, and State are providing very little information on \nwhether they have been prosecuted. It is time we have this information.\n  Last December, I wrote to the Secretary of Defense asking him to \nlaunch an investigation by DOD's inspector general into the rape and \nsexual assault cases in both Iraq and Afghanistan. I sent similar \nletters to the Secretary of State regarding the investigations carried \nout under the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, and I requested that the \nAttorney General update me on the status of the related criminal \ninvestigations. I asked whether and why evidence in the sexual assault \ncases was turned over to the private firms.\n  I got into this when one of my constituents in Tampa, FL, came forth \nand told about the assault case. This had followed a Texas case that \nhad been elevated to the public sphere. Apparently, one of these women \nwas assaulted, then went to see the doctor, and a rape kit was prepared \nby the military doctors. That kit would have the evidence of the rape, \nand it was turned over to the civilian contractor. Suddenly, the rape \nkit disappeared.\n  So the question is, what steps has the Department of Defense taken to \nensure the full investigation and prosecution of these cases?\n  In the meantime, the Department of State has told our office that \ndiplomatic security has investigated four cases. One of them was the \nTexas lady, and that was where a contractor personnel assaulted another \ncontractor personnel. Another involved a State Department employee who \nallegedly assaulted a woman employed by a contractor--in this case KBR. \nThen another case involved two State Department employees. According to \nthe State Department, three of the cases were referred to the \nDepartment of Justice for investigation and possible prosecution.\n  Recently, our Senate staff met with representatives of the Department \nof Defense IG's office, and we asked them to brief us because of the \nresponse received from the Department of Defense, which certainly did \nnot answer my questions. The inspector general's office stated that, \nand this is what blew our mind, the Army Criminal Investigation Command \nhas investigated 124 cases of sexual assault. Now, that is just the \nArmy, and that is just in Iraq. And that is just in the 3 years of \n2005, 2006, and 2007. So what about the other services and what about \nAfghanistan?\n  So this naturally leads me to question whether there could be \nhundreds of additional investigations going on about contractor \npersonnel--specifically in the ones that have come to us, it was the \ncontractor KBR--and it suggests that perhaps there could be many \nassaults that have not been investigated at all. And because the \ninspector general's office would not provide information on the \ndisposition of these investigations, it certainly is unclear whether \nthere has been any prosecution of these within the military or the \ncriminal justice systems, or whether it has been dealt with \nadministratively.\n  Now, one of my Florida constituents was, and I will use the word \nadvisedly, allegedly sexually battered in Iraq in 2005. And although \nthe Naval Criminal Investigative Service was supposed to be \ninvestigating her case, they will not even say anything about the basic \nmatters of the case because, the Navy says:\n\n       Law enforcement records are exempt from disclosure at the \n     time requested if it can be reasonably expected to interfere \n     with the enforcement proceedings.\n\n  I think we in this Congress, we in the Senate, and those of us on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, certainly have an obligation to investigate. Because cases \nsuch as this can languish far too long without any information from the \nGovernment coming forth in order to protect these individuals.\n  So I have asked that our office follow up with the Defense \nDepartment, with the following detailed questions: The actual numbers \nof the sexual assault cases reported since 2001 in Afghanistan and \nsince 2003 in Iraq and the disposition of each case. I have asked to \nhave the information of the service components or the Government \nagencies involved in each resulting investigation. I have asked for the \nstatus of the persons involved in each case--in other words, I want to \nknow whether they are Active military, U.S. Government civilian \nemployees, contractor employees or are they an Iraqi or Afghani \nnational.\n  I have asked for an explanation of the U.S. jurisdiction or the \ninvestigative authority for sexual assault allegations in both those \nareas in which we are engaged--Iraq and Afghanistan. And I have asked \nfor a clear explanation of the rules, regulations, policies, and \nprocesses under which sexual assaults are investigated, evidence is \nobtained, and responsible individuals are held accountable. I have also \nasked\n\n[[Page S951]]\n\nfor a clear explanation of how the Department of Defense divides \nauthority among all its various investigative arms in these sexual \nassault cases.\n  I have had to ask these questions because DOD and the Department of \nState have not been forthcoming. Yet what is being told by some of \nthese assault victims is absolutely horrifying. For example: One female \ncontractor employee, during cocktail conversation, suddenly, totally, \npassed out. Apparently, her drink had been spiked. She awoke to find \nout she had been assaulted many times. Upon seeing a military doctor, \nin fact, that was confirmed and the rape kit was prepared. But when the \nrape kit was turned over to the contractor, it amazingly disappeared. \nThe evidence disappeared. That contract employee then, upon asking \nquestions, was locked in a container and could not get out of the \ncontainer to go and tell her story to other personnel of her \ncontractor, and she only got out because she was able to persuade \nsomeone to let her use a cell phone to call her father back in the \nUnited States. That is how she got out of her confinement.\n  Now, if all of that is true, there is simply no excuse for this. But \nwhat we need to determine is the truth. It is a shame that the senior \nSenator from Florida has to come to the floor of the Senate to elevate \nthis issue in order to say to the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of State that we want the answers to our questions.\n  I have asked the questions. I expect, on behalf of the Congress of \nthe United States, that we will get the answers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time during the \nquorum be equally divided between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I spoke earlier this morning, so I will be brief.\n  It would appear that the Senate is poised to pass a measure that \nwould end the debate over torture in our Nation. It would require the \nCIA to follow the Army Field Manual when it comes to interrogations of \ndetainees, and it would create a uniform standard for interrogation \nacross the Government. It would prohibit waterboarding and certain \nother coercive interrogation techniques. I deeply believe it will go a \nlong way toward restoring our Nation's credibility.\n  I have spoken with experts on interrogation, numerous retired three \nand four star generals, and human rights leaders. From our discussions, \nI am absolutely convinced that we must have a uniform standard for \ninterrogation of detainees across the Government. That is what putting \nthe CIA under the Army Field Manual would do.\n  This debate is about values. We are a nation of values, and we \nbelieve in the rule of law. It is fair to say that America has been \ndiminished around the world. Our standing is at an all-time low, not \nonly among our allies but also our enemies. This comes from Abu Ghraib. \nIt comes from Guantanamo. It comes from renditions, and it comes from \nblack sites. It comes from waterboarding, a technique used during the \nSpanish Inquisition to get religious dissenters to publicly disavow \ntheir beliefs.\n  Let me give one example of why a clear, single standard for all \ndetainee interrogation is needed.\n  Until a couple of weeks ago, the executive branch refused to admit \nthat it had waterboarded anyone.\n  Then last week, at a public hearing, General Hayden stated that the \nCIA has waterboarded three detainees: Abu Zubaydah, Abd al-Rahim al-\nNashiri, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. General Hayden said this was done \nin the past and would not be used in the future.\n  In fact, General Hayden said that waterboarding itself was no longer \nnecessary. These were two major revelations. The U.S. Government had, \nin fact, authorized waterboarding, and we weren't going to do it again.\n  The very next day, a White House spokesman, Tony Fratto, said the \nPresident could reauthorize the use of waterboarding at any time. At \nthis point, we had returned to a state of confusion. The CIA was saying \nwaterboarding was not authorized and not needed. The White House was \nsaying waterboarding was still on the table.\n\n  That was not the end. The very next day, General Hayden testified in \nopen session again, this time in front of the House Intelligence \nCommittee. Here is what he said:\n\n       In my own view, the view of my lawyers and the Department \n     of Justice, it is not certain that that technique--\n\n  Meaning waterboarding--\n\n     would be considered lawful under current statute. . . .\n\n  So here you have a mix of views. Here you have unclear American \npolicy.\n  The bill which we have before us today clears up that confusion, and \nit states once and for all what the U.S. Government would do; that \nthere would be 19 specific approaches documented over many pages for \neach approach in this volume, and 8 specific techniques that are \nbanned, one of which is waterboarding.\n  So we have the opportunity today to take a stand--to clear the air \nand to say that the U.S. Government follows uniform specific standards \nfor interrogation of detainees as put forward by the Army Field Manual.\n  I would like to quote a statement the President of the United \nStates--President Bush--made on June 22, 2004. Here is his quote:\n\n       We do not condone torture. I have never ordered torture. I \n     will never order torture. The values of this country are such \n     that torture is not a part of our soul and our being.\n\n  President Bush, if you stand by these words, you will sign this \nintelligence authorization bill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have left out of \nthe 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute and a half.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may, I very much would like to \nthank a few people who have been very helpful in this whole thing. The \nfirst is David Grannis, my intelligence liaison, who has been with me \nall the way. I thank the Partnership for a Secure America and the 18 \nformer national security officials who wrote in support of the Army \nField Manual.\n  I thank Senators Hagel and Snowe for taking a stand for what is right \nfor America in the Intelligence Committee. I thank our chairman, \nSenator Rockefeller, for being willing to risk the passage of this \nlegislation by supporting this very important amendment.\n  I also thank Senator Whitehouse. He offered this amendment when it \nwas in the Senate Intelligence Committee. I thank him for his tireless \nefforts in support of this conference report. I have seen him on the \nSenate floor at least twice today. He was a cosponsor of the amendment \nI offered in the conference, and I know his staff has been very \neffective in working on this amendment.\n  I thank Senator Tom Carper of Delaware who has done a lot of work on \nthis issue on the telephone.\n  I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Ron Wyden, who came earlier \nto the floor to speak on this issue.\n  So there have been many people working toward this vote, and it looks \nas if it may just happen. I would like them to know that we are very \ngrateful for their support.\n  Oh, one more: Senator Feingold. Senator Feingold was a cosponsor\n\n[[Page S952]]\n\nwhen I offered the amendment in the Intelligence Committee. I very much \nthank him for his steadfastness.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, we are going to be voting in about an hour or \nso on the conference report on the Intelligence Authorization Act. I \nwould like to explain briefly the reasons I think we should vote \nagainst that reauthorization.\n  There are two primary reasons. First has to do with the additional \nprovision that was passed neither by the House nor by the Senate but \nwas dropped into the conference report without Republican involvement; \nthat is, the provision that Senator Feinstein authored that would \nsubstitute for the authority that agencies of the United States \ncurrently have--agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency--to \ninterrogate foreign terrorists. It would substitute for the current \nrules under which they operate the U.S. Army Field Manual.\n  The U.S. Army Field Manual is a document that is prepared for use for \nall of our military Armed Forces, to provide rules of the road for them \nin interrogating enemy prisoners of war. So when they capture someone \non the battlefield, in order to ensure that the Geneva Conventions are \nadhered to, there is a set of guidelines set out in the Army Field \nManual that very explicitly explain to our soldiers exactly how they \nneed to treat these prisoners and what kind of interrogation in which \nthey can engage.\n  A couple of years ago, when the Congress and the administration got \ntogether and revised our procedures and the statute dealing with this \nsubject, the explicit decision was made to not have the Army Field \nManual govern the interrogations by other Government agencies. That was \na wise decision then, and it is a wise decision now.\n  There are reasons the U.S. Army would want to have a set of rules for \nsoldiers capturing enemies on the battlefield. But there is quite a \ndifferent situation presented when you have captured a terrorist and \nyou want to interrogate that terrorist and you have at your disposal \nCentral Intelligence Agency trained personnel or other special \npersonnel who are trained in interrogation techniques that comply with \nthe Geneva Conventions accords, are not torture, are authorized by law, \nbut may be outside the particular scope of the Army Field Manual.\n  This is a gross oversimplification, but for people to generally \nappreciate what I am talking about, you have all seen movies where a \nprisoner of war is captured, and they say: Give me your name, rank, and \nserial number, and that is pretty much all an enemy soldier is required \nto provide. You cannot torture them to get them to tell you anything \nbeyond those three pieces of information, and that is as it should be.\n  Interestingly, our terrorist adversaries know well the Army Field \nManual, and if they are captured as enemy POWs on the battle ground by \nU.S. Army personnel, they know precisely what kind of interrogation to \nexpect. In fact, we know they are trained on how to resist the \ninterrogation techniques and not provide information. It would be a \nhorrible mistake for us to assume that the techniques that are \nappropriate for Army battlefield capture interrogation should apply as \nwell to situations in which a CIA person is interrogating a terrorist--\nsomeone who is not fighting for another country in a uniform captured \non the battlefield.\n  That is the essence of the Feinstein proposal, and it is one of the \nreasons the President has made it very clear that were this conference \nreport to pass, he will veto the bill; indeed, he should.\n  There are other reasons for the President's decision to veto the bill \nas well. Let me just mention a couple of them. One of the things that \nrelates to this interrogation matter is a requirement in the bill that \na report to Congress must be made of the identity of each and every \nofficial who has determined that any interrogation method complies with \nspecific Federal statutes, why the official reached the conclusion, and \nthe related legal advice of the Department of Justice.\n  This may seem benign on the surface but, I submit, is in the nature \nof harassment of officials who are trying to make decisions about the \napplication of law. They come to judgments. They advise the people who \nare asking for the advice, and then action is taken on that basis. If \nCongress needs a report every time a Government official makes a \ndecision, clearly that agency cannot function.\n  Secondly, there are too many opportunities for second guessing, too \nmuch of an incentive for the people who are doing the work we ask them \nto do to not make any decisions, not engage in that work because they \nmight make a mistake. This is exactly the kind of ethos we do not want \nin our intelligence community.\n  Another requirement of the bill is the creation of another inspector \ngeneral. We already have inspectors general for each of the elements of \nthe intelligence community, but there would be a new one under the DNI. \nBut his primary responsibility would be to report to Congress rather \nthan the DNI.\n  There are other requirements for reports that have already occupied \nfar too much attention of our intelligence community. There are \nrequirements for congressional confirmation of several new positions, \npositions that currently do not require congressional confirmation \nbecause they are not political offices. It is the head of the NRO, for \nexample, the head of NSA. These are agencies that have been peopled \nwith professionals, people who do not have anything to do with \npolitics. They should not have to come to the Senate and get grilled by \nSenators--more importantly, Senators who then might hold them up.\n  You have heard about the holds Senators place on nominees. I do not \nknow how many executive nominees and judges we have waiting \nconfirmation by the Senate right now, but there are a lot. What happens \nis, because Senator X does not like the administration's position on \nsomething, they decide to put a hold on an important executive branch \nnominee. As a result, too many positions are vacant today because of \nunrelated holds by Senators. It just presents the Senate with an \nadditional way to hold up action on people, in effect, to blackmail an \nadministration into doing what it wants.\n  There are a variety of other problems the President has pointed to in \nthis legislation that will require the President to veto it. But I want \nto conclude by simply saying that a great deal of credit goes to \nSenators Rockefeller and Bond for their work in trying to create an \nauthorization bill for the intelligence community against great odds. \nThere is a lot of disagreement among people on the Intelligence \nCommittee itself, as well as others in this body, about what ought to \nbe done, and they came to, in effect, an agreement that except for the \nFeinstein proposal--that, as I said, was added in the conference; it \nwas not passed by either the Senate or the House--they came to an \nagreement on a bill that Senator Bond has described as pretty \neffective.\n\n  Hopefully, with the President now indicating he will veto the \nlegislation over the provisions I have identified, and some others, the \nother side will recognize it is important to fix those problems, clean \nit up, get a bill back to the President he can sign, and we can move \nforward.\n\n\n                                  FISA\n\n  Now, the last thing, Mr. President, I want to do is change the \nsubject very slightly because we just had a conversation with the \nPresident, who reiterated his deep concern about the apparent \nunwillingness of the House of Representatives to reauthorize the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act so that we can engage in \nintelligence collection against this country's worst enemies: al-Qaida \nand other terrorists.\n  This body, with a vote of 68 to 29--a very bipartisan vote--agreed on \na Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act reauthorization for a period of \n6 years. The key feature of it--different from the current law--is \nretroactive immunity for those telecommunications companies that might \nhave assisted the United States in gathering this intelligence. That \nwas following the Intelligence Committee's work--again, great work; 13 \nto 2 was the vote in the Intelligence Committee, bipartisan--supporting \nthat legislation. It has now been sent to the House of Representatives. \nAll the House of Representatives needs to do is to take this bill, \nwhich has bipartisan support in the Senate, pass it, and send it to the \nPresident for his signature.\n\n[[Page S953]]\n\n  The President's point, just a few moments ago, to us was it would be \nan abdication of responsibility for the Congress not to accomplish this \nresult before it leaves on a recess on Friday.\n  This intelligence collection is critical to the security of the \nUnited States. The point of the most recent legislation is to provide \nretroactive liability protection for those companies that have aided \nthe United States pursuant to its request.\n  In effect, what happened was the President and the Attorney General \nrequested various telecommunications companies to help us collect \nelectronic information on people we have targeted as necessary for \ncollection purposes. They did not have to do it. They volunteered to \nhelp us. They understood the threat to the United States and, like any \ngood citizen would do when called upon by the Commander in Chief, they \nagreed to assist. Now, some of them have been sued. They are, of \ncourse, accountable to their boards of directors who have a \nresponsibility under Federal law to protect shareholder interests.\n\n  What some of these companies are finding is an increasing difficulty \nof assisting the United States and continuing to stay in business. They \nhave their own business responsibilities. They have to engage in \nactivities both in this country and in other countries sometimes. They \nhave to get customers. They have to make business agreements with other \nparties. When too many other folks say: We don't want to do business \nwith you because of the potential that you are going to be sued or that \nyou have been sued, and then there is the question of whether we are \ngoing to be drawn into all that, then it makes it impossible for those \ncompanies to assist the United States.\n  The point is this: There is an increasing concern that some of these \ncompanies are not going to be able to provide this assistance to us if \nwe don't solve this retroactive immunity issue. Some people have said: \nWell, we will simply temporarily extend the existing law. The reason \nthat doesn't solve the problem is because the existing law doesn't \nprovide that retroactive immunity. That is the point of this \nlegislation, and if this legislation doesn't provide that retroactive \nimmunity pretty soon, there could well come a point in time when we \ndon't have any telecommunications companies left doing this work for us \nto matter.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I am delighted to yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am delighted the Senator from Arizona \nbrought this up because I have participated in a number of debates with \nour distinguished colleague from Missouri. What we always have to \nremind our colleagues of, as well as the American public, is that these \ncompanies have volunteered. They are not in this for a profit motive. \nThere is some compensation for expenses. They are not unlike the men \nand women of the Armed Forces, all of whom today are in uniform because \nthey raised their right arm and volunteered. We cannot ask these \ncompanies to subject themselves to the uncertainty and the threats \nassociated with legal processes. We are going to lose a very important \ncomponent of what I call the American spirit: voluntarism. Whether it \nis in the corporate world, whether it is in the Armed Forces or any \nother number of activities, we are a Nation known for people who step \nforward and volunteer.\n  This is a clear example of how these companies cannot continue under \nthe situation that persists today, because the directors of those \ncompanies, their corporate boards, have an obligation to their \nstockholders. It is a stretch to say to the stockholders, who are part \nof the voluntarism they are doing to serve the cause of freedom in the \nUnited States, that they should be subjected to a lot of court suits.\n  So I appreciate the Senator bringing this up. It is important. We \nhave to remind our colleagues about it. I am proud of what this Chamber \ndid. They voted it through, very clearly.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, if I could say to the Senator from \nVirginia, I hadn't thought of putting it quite the way he did. He is, \nexactly right. We have thousands of young men and women who volunteer \nto serve their country. What would we think if part of that service \nmeans getting sued by somebody? Wouldn't we provide them protection \nfrom those kinds of lawsuits? Obviously, we would. The companies that \nserve us every day when we pick up the phone to make a phone call--we \nwant them to be there to help us--they step forward when the President \nasks them to volunteer to serve their country, at no profit, as the \nSenator makes clear, and then they get sued and we are not willing to \nprovide protection to them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I couldn't agree more. Furthermore, the \nservice they are doing by virtue of this voluntarism directly \ncontributes to the safety and the welfare of the men and women in the \nArmed Forces who are engaged in harm's way beyond our shores.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, that is another very good point.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this point, we have about run out of time, and I wish \nto say a few words about the pending matter.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me conclude these remarks then. The key point I am \ntrying to make is we have related activities. We have the Intelligence \nAuthorization bill on the floor, but we also have a couple of days \nbefore this recess to see that the great work the Senate did is adopted \nby the House of Representatives so the President can sign it.\n  Having just come from the White House, the President asked us to \nplease convey his sense of concern for the people of this country, for \nthe security of those soldiers whom we sent to do a mission, if we \ncan't get good intelligence on this terrorist enemy, and the only way--\nthe best way we can do that is through the interception of these \ncommunications. It cannot be done if there are no telecommunications \ncompanies willing to assist us. There could well come a point in time \nwhen, because we haven't done our job of providing them liability \nprotection, there is nobody there to provide the help to us.\n  So I thank the Senator from Virginia, and again I get back to my \noriginal point, which was I hope that in a few moments, knowing the \nPresident is going to veto this piece of legislation, we will support \nhis position and vote no on the authorization conference report.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Virginia has \n23 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. That is under the control of the distinguished \nSenator from Missouri, and I will ask for such time as I may need at \nthis point.\n  I have always considered myself, here in the Senate, to be most \nfortunate for the various assignments I have had through this being my \n30th year. There have been periods when I have served on the \nIntelligence Committee. I was once the ranking member of the \nIntelligence Committee. Then, fortunately, I was selected to go back on \nthe Intelligence Committee several years ago. It has been a part of my \noverall service to the Senate, and indeed to the Nation, to be on that \ncommittee.\n  I was at first introduced to the world of intelligence in 1969 when I \nwas fortunate enough to go to the U.S. Department of Defense at the \nPentagon and serve the Navy, first as Under Secretary and then \nSecretary. So I have actively been involved in the work of the \nintelligence community for some many years.\n  I am greatly concerned that we have before us today a piece of \nlegislation which, even though a member of the committee and even \nthough I worked with my colleagues to frame this legislation, I will \nhave to vote against because of the actions that took place in the \nconference committee where an out-of-scope provision was put in--for \nthe best of intentions, I am sure, but it wasn't carefully thought \nthrough, in my judgment, because this provision would say that \nhenceforth, the CIA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation would have \nto conduct their interrogation procedures in accordance with the Army \nField Manual.\n  I was privileged again to be one of a group of a small number of \nSenators who, in the year 2005, worked on the Detainee Act and then \nsubsequently, in 2006, worked on other legislation to try to delineate \ncarefully the responsibilities of various agencies and departments of \nour Government as it related to the all-important collection of our \nintelligence and a part of that collection procedure being the \ninterrogation\n\n[[Page S954]]\n\nof detainees. Now, we decided, after a lot of careful deliberation of \nthe 2005 act, that we would restrict that to the men and women in the \nArmed Forces.\n  There was a very good reason for that. In the course of our conflicts \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, detainees came into the possession of our \nfield forces, operating in combat conditions most of the times when \nthese detainees were caught, and relatively, so to speak, while the \nmilitary people are magnificently trained throughout their careers to \ndeal with these situations of combat and the like, very few of them \nhave had the opportunity to get into the profession of interrogation. \nIn order to give them the protection they needed in performing \ninterrogation at what we call the field and tactical level, it was \nimportant to draw up this act and to prescribe very clearly for the men \nand women in uniform--I repeat that: only for the men and women in \nuniform--very clearly the procedures they must follow to accord the \nvalues of our framework of laws, the fact that this is not a nation \nthat stands for torture, and to also give them protection in the event \nthat somehow they were challenged in a court of law, be it a military \ncourt or other courts, as to their performance by virtue of their \ninterrogating activities of certain detainees. So there were many \nreasons to put it all down and say that this is the Army Field Manual, \nprescribe the authorized techniques, and therefore allow the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces to continue their operations militarily, \ntactically, and to follow that field manual in such instances where it \nis necessary to interrogate detainees.\n  But in the course of that debate--and understandably and I think \nquite properly--attention was given to whether we should have this type \nof procedure applicable to all the Government agencies and departments \nof our Federal Government. The decision was made, and the answer was \nno--not quickly, no; it was a deliberate no reached after a lot of \ncareful consideration--that this Detainee Act should be for the purpose \nof our military people, and we purposely did not include the CIA and \nthe FBI. As time evolved into 2006, when we had that legislation, once \nagain we reiterated we would not include either the CIA or the DIA and \nthen in any way at that time legislate their program, other than to say \nthat the conduct of the CIA program and the FBI program has to be in \ntotal compliance with all the laws of our land, which in no way \nsanctioned abusive treatment, torture or those sorts of things. It is \nnot a part of it.\n  Furthermore, that both the procedures by the CIA and the FBI had to \nbe in compliance with the treaties, the treaty obligations we have, \nparticularly article 3, common article 3, which has been debated so \ncarefully on the floor of the Senate.\n  So, in effect, what we have before us momentarily in this vote is \noverruling the decisions that were made by this body in the context of \ndrawing up those two statutes, one in 2005 and one in 2006. So I, for \nthat reason, feel very strongly that I cannot support this. I think it \nhas been indicated that the President doesn't support it and that if \nthis were to arrive at his desk, in all probability, we would have a \nveto, and that would be regrettable because a lot of work has been put \ninto this bill. There are portions of it that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. Kyl, talked about which hopefully can be corrected. \nBut we need an Intelligence bill. We have marvelous staff in the Senate \nand others who work on this problem of legislation year after year, and \nwe are long overdue to have an Intelligence bill. It is unfortunate \nthat in the last throes of the legislative process, in a conference, \nthis provision, which we clearly know to be out of scope, was put into \nthe bill, and it is for that reason that I will have to oppose the \nbill.\n  There is another reason I would have to oppose it, and that is that \nthe Army Field Manual, again, was for the military, but it is a manual. \nCertainly, under the current way it is framed and put together in the \nlaw, a manual can be changed. So while there are some 19 techniques \nthat are detailed as approved for the use of our troops in the field \nand elsewhere, who is to say they couldn't add some more and that at \nthat point Congress is not involved. So I am not sure people thought \nthrough the technical aspects of this thing, and to me, it is a very \nunwise decision.\n  But I wish to reiterate to our colleagues that by virtue of taking \nthe stance I take--and I presume a goodly number of individuals will \njoin in this, unfortunately, and vote against this bill--this is not to \nsay, in any way, that we are sanctioning that the Agency, the CIA, \nemploy techniques which are in any way constituted as abusive treatment \nof human beings or torture or degrading.\n  All of that is carefully spelled out in the framework of the laws of \n2005 and 2006, and it cannot be done by the agency, nor the FBI--nor \nare they doing it. The Intelligence Committee has had a series of \nhearings. We have had the DNI, the Director of the CIA, the head of the \nFBI, and all of them have been carefully questioned and are on record \nsaying that these procedures, which would be tantamount and \nantithetical to our laws of 2005 and 2006 are not employed now, and \nthey will not be in the future.\n  It is for that reason that I will have to oppose this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to do likewise because we will be taking away from the \nagencies the ability to perform a very limited number of \ninterrogations, a very limited number--but they do them in an entirely \ndifferent framework of circumstances, environment, than does the Army \nor other military members of our Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine \nCorps under the Army Field Manual.\n  The techniques applied by the CIA are in compliance with the laws, \nbut they are not all written up so that a detainee knows full well that \nif they are apprehended, they will be subjected to the interrogation \nprocedures of the agencies; he would know all about it if it is written \nup as it is in the Army Field Manual. That would take away a good deal \nof the psychological impact of highly skilled interrogating procedures. \nWe are about to throw those away, abandon them.\n  This is a very dangerous and complex world. I sometimes think, in the \ncourse of this political campaign, as I listen to my good friends--\nthree of them Members of this Chamber--vying for the Presidency of the \nUnited States, the awesome framework of complex situations that is \ngoing to face the next President of the United States. I must say, I \nhave a few years behind me, and I have seen a good bit of history in \nthis country, but never before has the next President, whoever it may \nbe--never before have they faced such an awesome, complex situation in \nthe world that is so fraught with hatred and terrorism and threats to \nthe basic freedoms of our Nation and many other nations.\n  It is going to be a real challenge for that next President to \nshoulder the responsibilities of Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces \nof the United States. And this set of procedures that we presently have \nin place, which complies with the law of our land, which complies with \ninternational treaties, must be left intact to enable the Intelligence \nCommittee to conduct their interrogations and do so to produce facts \nwhich could very well save this Nation and facts that are, every day, \nhelping to save the men and women of the Armed Forces in uniform \nwherever they are in the world--primarily in Iraq and Afghanistan--as \nthey pursue their courageous responsibilities on behalf of us here at \nhome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I believe it is important to clear up for \nthe record, for the benefit of my colleagues and the American people, \nsome statements that were made earlier today about waterboarding, \ninterrogation techniques and the Army Field Manual.\n  During the House and Senate conference for the fiscal year 2008 \nintelligence authorization bill, an amendment--section 327--was adopted \nthat would prevent any element of the intelligence community from using \nany interrogation technique not authorized by the Army Field Manual.\n  Earlier today, we heard that the full membership of the conference \ncommittee, the full membership of the House Intelligence Committee and \nSenate Intelligence Committee all came to the conclusion that all \ninterrogations should be conducted within the terms of the U.S. Army \nField Manual.\n\n[[Page S955]]\n\n  Let's be clear: this particular amendment only passed by a one-vote \nmargin. The conference was sharply divided on this issue, as reflected \nby the fact that no House Republicans signed the conference report and \nonly two Senate Republicans signed the report.\n  The problem with this provision is not that it says that \ninterrogators cannot use certain techniques. Most of the techniques \nprohibited by the field manual are so repugnant that I think we can all \nagree they should never be used.\n  In fact, this vote is not about torture, and it is not about \nwaterboarding. We all think that torture is repugnant. And whether one \nbelieves that waterboarding is torture is really irrelevant because \nwaterboarding is not in the CIA's interrogation program.\n  The problem is that the provision in the conference report \nestablishes a very limited set of techniques, and these are the only \ntechniques that any interrogator may use.\n  So the vote is really about whether the FBI and CIA should be \nrestricted to a set of 19 unclassified techniques, designed for the \nArmy, which have not been examined fully by some agencies.\n  If this legislation passes and is signed into law, all of us need to \nunderstand fully that FBI and CIA interrogators may only use the 19 \ntechniques authorized in the field manual. And all of us need to \nunderstand that no one can say for sure that this will not impact our \nfuture intelligence collection.\n  As CIA Director Hayden has said: ``I don't know of anyone who has \nlooked at the Army Field Manual who could make the claim that what's \ncontained in there exhausts the universe of lawful interrogation \ntechniques consistent with the Geneva Convention.''\n  If we are going to demand that all Government agencies must use only \nthese techniques, we must make sure that the field manual does not \nleave out other moral and legal techniques needed by these agencies. \nAnd I don't believe that the Intelligence Committee has adequately \npursued this issue.\n  Having a single interrogation standard does not account for the \nsignificant differences in why and how intelligence is collected by the \nmilitary, CIA, and FBI.\n  Much has been made of the FBI saying that they do not use coercive \ntechniques. That is accurate. The FBI operates in a different world--\nwhere confessions are usually admitted into evidence during a \nprosecution. This means that they have to satisfy standards of \nvoluntariness that do not bind either the military or the CIA.\n  But significant concerns have been raised about whether the FBI would \neven be able to conduct ordinary interrogations using only those \ntechniques authorized by the field manual.\n  A time-honored technique, one that has led to countless successful \nprosecutions, is deception--for example, telling a suspect that his \nassociate has confessed even though the associate has refused to \ncooperate. But, it's unclear where this type of deception is authorized \nin the field manual. So, under this amendment, the FBI could be barred \nfrom using this simple, yet invaluable, technique.\n  FBI lawyers have told us that they need more time to conduct a full \nlegal review of the field manual and determine along with their \ncounterintelligence and counterterrorism divisions what impact using \nonly the field manual would have on interrogations. We should give them \ntime to do this review before we pass a bill that could severely \nundermine their interrogation practices.\n\n  Aside from these concerns, the Army Field Manual on Interrogation was \ndesigned as a training document. It is changeable, which means the \nCongress--and the CIA and FBI have no idea what techniques may be \nadded--or subtracted--tomorrow, next month, or next year. A moving \ndocument is not a sound basis for good legislation.\n  There are also practical consequences to applying this unclassified \nmilitary training manual to civilian agencies; as we heard earlier, \nhaving one standard that can be publicly judged by the entire world. We \nare talking about intelligence interrogations. We should not broadcast \nto the world, to our enemies, exactly what techniques our intelligence \nprofessionals may use when seeking information from terrorists.\n  The wide availability of the field manual on the internet makes it \nalmost certain that al-Qaida is training its operatives to resist the \nauthorized techniques.\n  Supporters of this provision also argue that the Army Field Manual \ngives interrogators sufficient flexibility to shape the interrogation. \nYet, some of the techniques in the field manual are allowed only if the \ninterrogator obtains permission from ``the first O-6 in the \ninterrogator's chain of command.'' What that means is that an \ninterrogator has to get permission from an Army or Marine Corps colonel \nor a Navy captain before proceeding. So in order to have any \nflexibility, will the CIA and FBI have to bring colonels and captains \nto all of their interrogations? These interrogations will get awfully \ncrowded pretty quickly.\n  We have been told that the field manual incorporates the Golden rule. \nDo unto others as you would have them do to unto you is an admirable \nstandard. But when dealing with terrorists who have shown no regard for \nmorality, humanity, and decency, it is somewhat out of place.\n  Do we really expect that if we restrict ourselves to techniques in \nthe Field Manual that al-Qaida will do the same? While we are arguing \nabout whether waterboarding is torture, they are chopping off heads and \nusing women and children to conduct their suicide bombings. Now, I am \nnot suggesting that we resort to their barbaric tactics. I am simply \nsaying that we should not base this important decision that will bind \nall of our intelligence interrogations on the hope that al-Qaida will \ndiscover civility.\n  Let me also clarify a comment from our distinguished committee \nchairman about the interrogation of Ibn Shaykh al-Libi. It was \nsuggested that al-Libi lied to interrogators because of the CIA's \n``coercive'' techniques. However, al-Libi was not in CIA custody--or \nforeign custody for that matter--when he made claims about Iraq \ntraining al-Qaida members in poisons and gases.\n  In fact, it was only when al-Libi was interviewed by CIA officers \nthat he recanted his earlier statements.\n  I believe we still have a lot of work to do before we impose \nrestrictions on CIA and FBI interrogations that could have severe \nconsequences for our intelligence collection.\n  Now, I want to make clear what my position is here today. For the \npast several months, I have worked hard to put together a reasonable \nbill that allows the Intelligence Committees to conduct necessary \noversight, while cognizant of the administration's concerns about \nresources and executive branch prerogatives.\n  I understand that no administration likes oversight. But oversight is \nessential to what Congress does: We have an obligation to the taxpayers \nto make laws and appropriate funds responsibly. And in order to do \nthis, we have to know how the money is being spent and what activities \nare being conducted.\n  I have reviewed closely the Statement of Administration Policy on \nthis bill and I am confident that we have addressed or resolved all but \none of the concerns listed there. One provision remains that merits a \nveto and that is the amendment before us: the Army Field Manual \ninterrogation techniques.\n  At the end of the day, if this provision is removed, I will support \nthis bill. But in its current form, I cannot support it and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia, who \nhas played the lead in so many things, such as the Detainee Treatment \nAct and other major pieces of legislation, for his very thoughtful \ndiscussion of these issues.\n  It has been very troubling to me to hear on the floor today some \nthings about what the CIA does that are absolutely not true. We have \nheard all kinds of descriptions of techniques that are barred by the \nArmy Field Manual. The techniques barred by the Army Field Manual, the \nhorrors that were outlined, are not tactics the CIA uses. They do not \nuse them. They would probably violate the Geneva Conventions and many \nother laws, which absolutely do cover interrogations by the CIA. When \none raises the spectrum that the CIA may be torturing detainees, No. 1, \nit is not true; No. 2, for those who know what is going on, it is \nirresponsible; No. 3, it is the kind of thing\n\n[[Page S956]]\n\nthat fuels the media of our enemies. I would not be surprised to see \nsome of these comments reported in Al-Jazeera.\n  What happened at Abu Ghraib was tragic. There were criminal acts by \nAmerican troops. We punished them, but nobody talks about the fact that \nwe punished them and sent them to prison. They went to the brig, as \nthey should. Now we have heard discussions attributing to the CIA all \nmanner of activities that are wrong, improper, not usable, and are not \nused.\n  I think it is important we clear the record. I wish some of the \npeople who know better would say I didn't mean to say that the CIA does \nthese things, because the people on the Intelligence Committee know \nprecisely what is done and what is not done.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to.\n  Mr. WARNER. As a Senator from Virginia, I am proud to have the CIA \nprincipal office in my State. I have been working with them for 30-\nsome-odd years. I have gotten to know many of them through the years. \nThey are not people who would set out to violate the laws of our \nNation. They are just like you and me. They have families and the same \nvalues we share in the Senate and in our neighborhoods. They do go \nabroad and assume an awful lot of personal risk on a number of \nmissions. But in terms of following the laws of our Nation, and the \ninternational laws, I think they stand head and shoulders, and they are \nto be commended.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nVirginia. He is one of the real experts in this body on military and \nintelligence affairs. I can tell you that having talked with General \nHayden and the other top officers of the Agency, getting to know \nAttorney General Mike Mukasey and those other responsible, high-\nprincipled officials who are overseeing it, it is not a danger that we \nare going to see torture or inhumane or degrading treatment used.\n  Now, again, during the House-Senate conference for the fiscal year \n2008 Intelligence authorization bill, an amendment--section 327--was \nadopted that would prevent any element of the intelligence community \nfrom using an interrogation technique not authorized by the Army Field \nManual.\n  Earlier today, it was stated on the floor that the full membership of \nthe conference committee, the full membership of the House Intelligence \nCommittee, and the Senate Intelligence Committee came to the conclusion \nthat interrogations should be conducted within the terms of the U.S. \nArmy Field Manual.\n  Let me be particularly clear that this amendment only passed by a \none-vote margin. The conference was sharply divided on the issue, as \nreflected by the fact that no House Republicans signed the conference \nreport and only two Senate Republicans signed the report.\n  The problem with this provision is not that it says the interrogators \ncannot use certain techniques. Most of the techniques prohibited by the \nArmy Field Manual are so repugnant that I think we can all agree they \nshould not be and would never be used.\n  In fact, this vote is not about torture or about waterboarding. \nDespite what you have heard on the floor, it is not about \nwaterboarding. Torture is repugnant. We have stated that time and time \nagain--in the Detainee Treatment Act and in other laws we passed. \nWhether one believes it is torture is irrelevant because waterboarding \nis not in the CIA's interrogation program.\n  The problem is the provision in the conference report establishes a \nvery limited set of techniques, and these are the only techniques any \ninterrogator may use. So the vote is about whether the FBI and CIA \nshould be restricted to a set of 19 unclassified techniques, designed \nfor the Army, which have not been examined fully by some agencies. I \nsay ``19 unclassified techniques'' because those techniques not only \nhave been published widely, but they are included in al-Qaida training \nmanuals. So the al-Qaida high-value leaders--the people with the \ninformation--know precisely what it is all about.\n  If this legislation passes, and were it to be signed into law--which \nall of us know it will not--we all need to understand fully that the \nFBI and CIA interrogators may only use the 19 techniques authorized in \nthe field manual. According to the field manual, they would have to get \na clearance from an OC-6, a military officer. That was designed for the \nmilitary, not for the CIA, not for the FBI. When my distinguished \ncolleague from Virginia passed the Detainee Treatment Act, he and the \nSenator from Arizona, Senator McCain, expressly left the CIA out of the \nlimitations to the Army Field Manual.\n  As CIA Director Michael Hayden has said:\n\n       I don't know anyone who has looked at the Army Field Manual \n     who could make the claim that what's contained in there \n     exhausts the universe of lawful interrogation techniques \n     consistent with the Geneva Conventions.\n\n  He described a whole area of techniques. There are a whole group of \ntechniques that we use on the volunteers who join our Marines, Special \nForces, our SEALs, our pilots, which I described earlier today. Many \ntactics are far more difficult to withstand than the techniques that \nare used by the CIA in its interrogation.\n  If we are going to demand that all Government agencies must use only \nthese techniques, we must make sure the Army Field Manual doesn't leave \nout other moral and legal techniques needed by these agencies. I don't \nbelieve the Intelligence Committee has adequately pursued this issue.\n  How many of those techniques do we want to publish so our al-Qaida \ntargets will know how to resist them? Having a single interrogation \nstandard does not account for the significant differences in why and \nhow intelligence is collected by the military, CIA and FBI, and from \nwhom it is collected.\n\n  Much has been made of the FBI saying they do not use coercive \ntechniques. That is accurate. The FBI operates in a different world--\nwhere confessions are usually admitted into evidence during a \nprosecution. This means they have to satisfy standards of voluntariness \nthat do not bind either the military or CIA. When they question \nsomebody, they are trying to stop a terrorist attack from happening in \nthe future. They are in the field. The FBI is investigating a crime \nthat has been committed in the hopes of punishing those people. There \nare significant concerns about whether the FBI would even be able to \nconduct ordinary interrogations using the techniques in the Army Field \nManual.\n  A time-honored technique, one that has led to countless successful \nprosecutions, is deception--for example, telling a suspect that his \nassociate has confessed even though the associate has refused to \ncooperate. But as I read the Army Field Manual, I don't see that that \nis authorized. So under this amendment, the FBI could be barred from \nusing this simple, yet invaluable, technique.\n  FBI lawyers have told us they need more time to conduct a full legal \nreview of the Army Field Manual to determine, along with their \ncounterintelligence and counterterrorism divisions, what impact using \nonly the field manual would have on interrogations. We should give them \ntime to do this review before we pass a bill that could severely \nundermine their interrogation practices.\n  Aside from these concerns, the Army Field Manual on Interrogation was \ndesigned as a training document. It is changeable, which means the \nCongress--and the CIA and FBI--has no idea what techniques may be added \nor subtracted tomorrow, next month or next year.\n  Are we really ready in this body to define something as a standard, a \nchanging field manual? When do we ever do that, saying everybody has to \nfollow the Army Field Manual, and the Army Field Manual can be changed \nwhen and if it is ready. There are practical consequences. The \nunclassified military training level is not applicable to questioning \nhigh-value detainees.\n  This is, I suggest, a very bad measure. I believe the bill without \nthis amendment would have been a very good one. I cannot urge my \ncolleagues to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the conference report to accompany H.R. 2082.\n  Mr. WARNER. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n\n[[Page S957]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I believe the regular order now is Indian \nHealth. I would ask the Chair to report if that is in fact the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1200) to amend the Indian Health Care \n     Improvement Act to revise and extend that Act.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Bingaman-Thune amendment No. 3894 (to amendment No. 3899), \n     to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide \n     for a limitation on the charges for contract health services \n     provided to Indians by Medicare providers.\n       Vitter amendment No. 3896 (to amendment No. 3899), to \n     modify a section relating to limitation on use of funds \n     appropriated to the Service.\n       Brownback amendment No. 3893 (to amendment No. 3899), to \n     acknowledge a long history of official depredations and ill-\n     conceived policies by the Federal Government regarding Indian \n     tribes and offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf \n     of the United States.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 3899, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Sanders amendment No. 3900 (to amendment No. 3899), to \n     provide for payments under subsections (a) through (e) of \n     section 2604 of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of \n     1981.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Tester has indicated to me that he \nhas an amendment to work on. There are a number of people who want to \noffer amendments, and I think it would be to our advantage--it is not \nas if it is the middle of the night; it is still in the 4s--if there \ncould be some amendments offered. We are going to work on this all day \ntomorrow and hopefully we can finish it Friday. If not, we are going to \nstay here until we finish it.\n  Indian health deserves this. There is no group of people in America \nwho deserves our attention more than Indians. It is that way with the \n22 different organizations in Nevada and all over the country. So I \nwould hope we can work together.\n  I think we have had some success during these first few weeks of this \nyear of Congress. We were at the White House with the President signing \nthe stimulus bill. It is time to celebrate that. Was it everything we \nwanted? No. But it is good work, and we should all be proud of that.\n  We passed this conference report on intelligence, and the President \nwill have to make a decision on that in the future, as to what he wants \nto do, but it is out of this body.\n  I hope we could move forward on Indian health. We have been waiting \nyears to direct the attention to them. The attention is now directed, \nand with the result of what has happened here, we can spend some \nquality time on this matter. I hope those who wanted to offer \namendments will do so. We can work into the night. I hope we can have \nsome votes tonight. Senator Dorgan and Senator Murkowski are anxious to \nmove forward.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3900\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I wish to call up amendment No. 3900, \nand I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is a pending amendment.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, this tripartisan amendment is being \ncosponsored by Senators Clinton, Obama, Snowe, Collins, Leahy, Sununu, \nKennedy, Gordon Smith, Coleman, Kerry, Stabenow, Schumer, Lautenberg, \nLincoln, Klobuchar, Murray, Cantwell, Menendez, and Durbin.\n  This amendment is simple and straightforward. At a time when home \nheating prices are going through the roof--and I think every Member who \ngoes back to his or her State understands that the cost of home heating \noil is soaring--people understand that in areas around this country, \nincluding the State of Vermont, the weather has been well below zero. \nWhat this amendment would do is provide real relief to millions of \nsenior citizens on fixed incomes, low-income families with children, \nand people with disabilities.\n  Specifically, this amendment would provide $800 million in emergency \nfunding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program--otherwise \nknown as LIHEAP--a program that has won bipartisan support year after \nyear here in Congress because people know it works.\n  Its goal is simply stated: to keep Americans from going cold in the \nwintertime. It has done this for years, and we have to appropriate more \nmoney to make sure we do that again this year. Specifically, $400 \nmillion of the $800 million would be distributed under the regular \nLIHEAP formula, while the other $400 million would be used under the \nemergency LIHEAP program.\n  This amendment has strong support not only from many Members of the \nSenate and Members of the House, but it has strong support from the \nNational Governors Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislators, the AARP, the National Energy Assistance Directors \nAssociation, and many other groups.\n  Let me very briefly quote from a letter I received from the National \nGovernors Association in support of this amendment.\n\n       Additional funding distributed equitably under this \n     amendment will support critically needed heating and cooling \n     assistance to millions of our most vulnerable, including the \n     elderly, disabled and families who often have to choose \n     between paying their heating or cooling bills and food, \n     medicine and other essential needs.\n\n  According to the National Governors Association, this amendment will \nprovide much needed energy assistance to at least 1 million American \nfamilies--1 million. Others already receiving LIHEAP will receive more \nhelp due to the skyrocketing costs of home heating fuel.\n  Let me very briefly quote from a letter I recently received from the \nAARP. This is what the AARP says:\n\n\n[[Page S958]]\n\n\n       People should not have to choose between heating and \n     eating. Older Americans who are more susceptible to \n     hypothermia and heat stroke know the importance of heating \n     and cooling their homes. They pay their utility bills and \n     skimp on other necessities to get by. However, no one in \n     America should be forced to skip their medications or cut \n     back on essential nutritional needs in order to keep their \n     heat on.\n\n  That is from the AARP.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2008.\n     Hon. Bernard Sanders\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sanders: AARP applauds you for your continued \n     efforts to increase funding for the Low Income Energy \n     Assistance (LIHEAP) program. We thank you for offering an \n     amendment to increase LIHEAP funding for FY 2008 by $800 \n     million on S. 1200, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act \n     Amendments of 2007. We are pleased to support your amendment.\n       People should not have to choose between heating and \n     eating. Older Americans, who are more susceptible to \n     hypothermia and heat stroke, know the importance of heating \n     and cooling their homes; they pay their utility bills and \n     skimp on other necessities to get by. However, no one in \n     America should be forced to skip their medications or cut \n     back on essential nutritional needs in order to keep their \n     heat on.\n       LIHEAP helps the poorest of the poor. Nearly three out of \n     four families receiving LIHEAP assistance have incomes of \n     less than 100% of the federal poverty level ($16,600 for a \n     family of three) and almost one in two have incomes less than \n     75% of the federal poverty level ($12,225 for a family of \n     three).\n       LIHEAP is serving more households than ever before, but \n     still cannot meet the need. Since 2002, an additional 1.5 \n     million households are receiving LIHEAP assistance. At the \n     same time, requests for LIHEAP assistance in 2006 soared to \n     the highest level in 12 years.\n       Additional funding is needed now. High energy prices have \n     not gone away and the weather has proven very unpredictable--\n     additional funding is needed now and in the future to protect \n     some of the most vulnerable populations in America. Should \n     you have any questions regarding this request, please contact \n     me or Timothy Gearan of our Federal Affairs staff.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             David P. Sloane, \n\n                                         Senior Managing Director,\n     Government Relations and Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 24, 2008.\n     Hon. Bernie Sanders,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sanders: On behalf of the nation's governors, \n     we write to express our support for the Sanders-Snowe \n     amendment to add $800 million in emergency funding to the \n     Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) for FY \n     2008. We commend you and your colleagues for working in \n     partnership to build bipartisan support for this proposal, \n     and we believe the compromise of splitting this funding \n     equitably between the LIHEAP base formula grant under the \n     ``Tier II'' formula and the contingency fund is a step in the \n     right direction.\n       Additional funding distributed equitably under this \n     amendment will support critically needed heating and cooling \n     assistance to millions of our most vulnerable, including the \n     elderly, disabled, and families that often have to choose \n     between paying their heating or cooling bills and food, \n     medicine and other essential needs. With greater financial \n     support, states will be better able to increase benefit \n     levels in correspondence with rising energy costs, and to \n     reach at least a million other federally-eligible households \n     who currently do not receive assistance due to funding \n     limitations.\n       The National Governors Association applauds the bipartisan \n     efforts of you and your colleagues in reaching this \n     compromise, and fully supports adding $800 million to FY 2008 \n     to help LIHEAP respond to the current emergency energy \n     situation.\n           Sincerely,\n     James H. Douglas,\n       Chair, Health and Human Services Committee.\n     Jon S. Corzine,\n       Vice Chair, Health and Human Services Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 23, 2008.\n       Dear Senator, I am writing on behalf of the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) to strongly urge you \n     to support the amendment offered by Senator Sanders and \n     Senator Snowe that would add an additional $800 million to \n     the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) \n     funding for FY 2008. The amendment would divide the \n     additional funding equally between the formula and emergency \n     contingency portions of the program.\n       LIHEAP is a highly efficient federal block grant program \n     that helps our most vulnerable low-income households pay \n     their heating bills in the winter and cooling bills in the \n     summer. LIHEAP prioritizes at-risk households that shelter \n     America's elderly, disabled, and very young and protects \n     public health and safety by helping low-income families cover \n     energy costs. By leveraging private dollars to supplement \n     federal dollars, LIHEAP has nurtured positive, effective \n     partnerships between the private sector and both federal and \n     our state governments.\n       Millions of low-income families are burdened with the \n     hardship of paying arrearage from both last winter's heating \n     bills and summer's cooling bills, in addition to grappling \n     with impending and actual shut-off situations. At a time of \n     heightened need and with energy prices expected to continue \n     to climb, state legislatures do not want our citizens \n     choosing between paying an energy bill and putting food on \n     the table, or purchasing necessary medications. For \n     individuals and households facing these difficult choices, \n     funding from LIHEAP makes an intrinsic difference in their \n     ability to address such formidable challenges.\n       Since LIHEAP's inception, the number of eligible households \n     has increased by 78 per cent, yet in FY 2006, states were \n     only able to serve less than a quarter of the 24.4 million \n     eligible households. An increase in funding for LIHEAP will \n     help ensure that households in all regions are prepared to \n     handle both the cold and warm, and in the past few years \n     unpredictable, weather. NCSL believes that increased LIHEAP \n     funding should be a top priority to help low-income families, \n     senior citizens, and disabled individuals maintain economic \n     stability while addressing ever-increasing energy prices.\n       We urge you to support the Sanders-Snowe LIHEAP amendment, \n     and to continue the fight for full funding of LIHEAP.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Pete Hershberger,\n           Arizona Representative, Chair, NCSL Committee on Human \n     Services & Welfare.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Southern Governors' Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 18, 2007.\n\n   Statement on Additional FY 2008 Low Income Home Energy Assistance \n                        Program (LIHEAP) Funding\n\n       Due to high and rising energy costs, efforts are underway \n     in Congress to allocate an additional $800 million to the \n     LIHEAP program for FY 2008. Senator Dole has worked with her \n     colleagues from cold weather states on a compromise agreement \n     that would equitably distribute these additional funds by \n     splitting them equally between the LIHEAP base formula grant \n     and the contingency fund. The additional $400 million in the \n     base formula grant would be distributed by the LIHEAP ``tier \n     II'' formula, which bases funding to states on the actual \n     energy needs of low-income households, and therefore provides \n     for equitable distribution to Southern slates.\n       Recognizing the increasing need for LIHEAP funds and the \n     interest of the Congress in providing these funds, the \n     Southern Governors' Association supports this compromise. SGA \n     supported a similar compromise in FY 2006 when Congress made \n     an additional $1 billion available for LIHEAP, split equally \n     between the base formula grant and the contingency fund.\n       This compromise is an important step towards the long-term \n     goal of a more equitable distribution of LIHEAP funding among \n     all states. SGA urges Congress to move immediately to address \n     equity as a priority as part of LIHEAP reauthorization.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I commend subcommittee chairman Senator Harkin, \nsubcommittee ranking member Senator Specter, Appropriations chairman \nSenator Byrd, and ranking member Senator Cochran for providing a total \nof about $2.6 billion in funding for LIHEAP in the Omnibus \nappropriations bill. Their job was a difficult one. There was not \nenough money available to do all that needed to be done, but they did \ntheir best for LIHEAP and for our critical needs.\n  Unfortunately, this $2.6 billion in funding for LIHEAP, while an 18-\npercent increase from last year, is still 23 percent below what was \nprovided for LIHEAP just 2 years ago. That 23 percent reduction is not \neven adjusting for inflation. We are talking here about nominal \ndollars.\n  Two years ago, the price of heating oil was less than $2.50 a gallon; \ntoday, it is over $3.30 a gallon. In central Vermont, we have seen \nprices as high as $3.73 a gallon this winter for heating oil.\n  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, \ndue to insufficient funding, the average LIHEAP grant only pays for 18 \npercent of the total cost of heating a home with heating oil this \nwinter, 21 percent of residential propane costs, 41 percent of natural \ngas costs, and 43 percent of electricity costs. What this means, in \nplain English, is that low-income families with children, senior \ncitizens on\n\n[[Page S959]]\n\nfixed incomes, and people with disabilities will have to make up the \nremaining cost out of their own pockets. The problem is that millions \nof those people simply do not have the money to make up the difference.\n  In addition, only 16 percent of eligible LIHEAP recipients currently \nreceive assistance with their home heating bills, and 84 percent of \neligible low-income families with children, seniors on fixed incomes, \nand people with disabilities do not receive any LIHEAP assistance \nwhatsoever due to a lack of funding.\n  In my State of Vermont, it has been reported that outrageously high \nhome heating costs are pushing families into homelessness. In fact, it \nis not uncommon for families with two working parents to receive help \nfrom homeless shelters in the State of Vermont because they cannot find \nanyplace else to live in winter.\n  But this is a national energy emergency certainly well beyond Vermont \nand well beyond the Northeast. On January 17, 1 day after the President \nreleased $450 million in emergency LIHEAP funding, the National Energy \nAssistance Directors Association testified in front of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee field hearing chaired by \nSenator Kennedy. Here is what the national energy directors reported on \njust a few of the States:\n  In Arkansas, the number of families receiving LIHEAP assistance is \nexpected to be reduced by up to 20 percent from last year unless we get \nmore funding.\n  The State of Arizona estimates they will have to cut the number of \nfamilies receiving LIHEAP assistance by 10,000 as compared to last \nyear.\n  In Delaware, the number of families receiving LIHEAP assistance will \nbe reduced by up to 20 percent.\n  In Iowa, regular LIHEAP grants have been cut by 7 percent from last \nyear.\n  In Maine, the average LIHEAP grant will only pay for about 2 to 3 \nweeks of home heating costs in most homes in that State.\n  The State of Kentucky could run out of LIHEAP funds in the near \nfuture.\n  In Massachusetts, the spike in energy costs means that the purchasing \ncost for LIHEAP has declined by 39 percent since 2006.\n  The State of Minnesota could run out of LIHEAP funding as well.\n  On and on it goes. In New York State, in Ohio, in Rhode Island, in \nTexas, in Washington, in State after State the simple arithmetic works \nout that if the cost of heating fuel is soaring, in order to provide \nthe same benefits to the same number of people, we need to \nsignificantly increase our funding for LIHEAP, and we are not doing \nthat. That is what this amendment is about.\n  There is a lot of discussion on this floor about emergencies. This is \nan emergency. There is a lot of discussion on this floor about moral \nvalues. This is a moral issue. In the United States of America, the \nwealthiest Nation in the history of the world, millions of senior \ncitizens and low-income parents with kids should not be forced to worry \nabout whether their homes will be warm this winter. People should not \nhave to make the choice between keeping warm or paying for other basic \nnecessities of life. This is an emergency situation. This is a moral \nsituation.\n  I wish to thank all of the cosponsors who have come on board this \nlegislation. I ask my colleagues to strongly support this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There does not appear to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4020 to Amendment No. 3899\n\n  Mr. TESTER. I send amendment No. 4020 to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Tester] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4020 to amendment No. 3899.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding law enforcement \n             and methamphetamine issues in Indian country)\n\n         On page 336, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 815. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND \n                   METHAMPHETAMINE ISSUES IN INDIAN COUNTRY.\n\n         ``It is the sense of Congress that Congress encourages \n     State, local, and Indian tribal law enforcement agencies to \n     enter into memoranda of agreement between and among those \n     agencies for purposes of streamlining law enforcement \n     activities and maximizing the use of limited resources--\n     ``(1) to improve law enforcement services provided to Indian \n     tribal communities; and\n     ``(2) to increase the effectiveness of measures to address \n     problems relating to methamphetamine use in Indian Country \n     (as defined in section 1151 of title 18, United States Code).\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to encourage \nlaw enforcement in Indian country--at the local, State, and Federal \nlevel--to work together to combat methamphetamine issues. It encourages \nlocal, State, and Federal police to enter into memorandums of \nunderstanding with tribal law enforcement to pool resources to fight \nmeth addiction. It does not require it; it just encourages it. All four \nlaw enforcement entities should collaborate to ensure that all can be \ndone to beat back the meth problems that plague Indian country.\n  Methamphetamine abuse is an American problem. It infiltrates and \ndevastates communities across the country. Unfortunately, it is a \nproblem that disproportionately impacts tribal communities. American \nIndians now experience the highest meth usage rates of any ethnic \ngroup.\n  I will give one example. American Indians use methamphetamines 17 \ntimes higher than African Americans. The list goes on and on. They are \nthe highest meth usage ethnic group. Beyond the high rate of meth use \namong American Indians, Alaska natives, and native Hawaiians \nnationwide, individual Indian tries have been struggling with the \nimpact of meth use on their communities. For example, on the Northern \nCheyenne reservation in Montana in 2005, 16 out of 64 babies, or 25 \npercent, were born to meth-addicted mothers. This number has increased \nin 2006. We must do everything possible to address this epidemic and \nprotect our children from this scourge of modern society.\n  In hearings before the Indian Affairs Committee, we heard testimony \nabout Mexican drug cartels targeting rural reservations. They are \ntargeting these vulnerable areas both for the sale of meth and for \ndistribution hubs. Drug smugglers target Indian communities for several \nreasons: the complex nature of their criminal jurisdiction on Indian \nreservations and because tribal police forces have been historically \nunderfunded and understaffed. This is a big problem. It is a huge \nproblem in Indian country. We need to encourage Indian tribes, Federal \npolice, local police to sign memorandums of understanding by each of \nthese four different entities--Indian government, State government, \nlocal government, and Federal law enforcement agencies. These \nmemorandums will identify specific law enforcement activity and \nestablish exactly what each agency is responsible for.\n  The feedback we hear is that the memorandums that are in place are \nworking and that the agencies participating in these agreements report \na significant increase in communication and a decrease in traffic. This \namendment simply asks law enforcement and agencies at every level to \nwork together to beat the meth problem and improve quality of life in \nIndian country.\n  By signing memorandums of understanding, our communities will be \nbetter prepared to tackle this meth problem. At the same time we foster \nIndian self-determination and strengthen government-to-government \nrelationships. The amendment will improve Indian\n\n[[Page S960]]\n\ncountry and, in effect, every community in this country. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in voting for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, for the information of colleagues, with \nthe agreement of the minority, I ask unanimous consent that we have the \nvote scheduled at 5:25 and that we have consent that there not be other \namendments in order prior to the vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the issue of methamphetamine on Indian \nreservations is a dilemma. It is devastating scourge to Indian \nreservations. The Senator from Montana asks for cooperation of law \nenforcement jurisdictions to form opportunities to work together. It \nmakes a lot of sense. It is not a mandate. He is not requiring it. But \nhe is shining a spotlight on one of the significant health problems on \nIndian reservations. If I spent the time to talk to you about the \ntestimony we received in committee hearings about what methamphetamine \naddiction has done, it is almost unbelievable. I won't describe that in \ndetail here.\n  I support the sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It makes a great deal \nof sense.\n  My colleague from Alaska will no doubt want to give her thoughts. I \nbelieve the Senator from Montana will ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment and \nof the Senator from Montana in this effort. We are using a pretty \ndevastating word here--scourge--but that is what we are talking about \nwhen we talk about methamphetamine use as it has come into this country \nand, more particularly, how it has devastated the American Indian and \nthe Alaska native populations. What more can we be doing? What else can \nwe do to shine the spotlight, to activate those who need to be \nactivated in how do we make a difference? Some would suggest a sense of \nthe Senate that encourages this action entering into a memorandum of \nunderstanding between agencies, they should be doing that anyway. They \nshould be. They should be doing it. They should be working to \nstreamline. They should be working to better coordinate. They should be \nmaking that difference. Let's encourage them even further by a \nstatement such as the Senator from Montana has suggested. We need to do \nfar more when it comes to meth use and abuse. We need to do far more \nwhen it comes to drug abuse in general. I appreciate the focus and \nattention to this particularly deadly scourge, that of methamphetamine. \nI will stand with the Senator from Montana and support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I thank the chairman of the committee as well as the \nranking member for their support. Anything we can do to help limit the \nimpact of methamphetamine in Indian country and throughout society is a \nstep in the right direction.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4020. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, this amendment is simply an attempt to \nrecognize the need for expanding the LIHEAP program in the face of the \ndramatic increase in oil prices, but also recognizing that in extending \nthe LIHEAP program for today, we shouldn't send the heating bill for \nthat to our children to pay tomorrow, which is exactly how the Sanders \namendment works. It is essentially borrowing money today. That is \nobviously not good policy.\n  Clearly, if we have extra heating bills in this country today which \nshould be paid for--and we do--the LIHEAP program does need to be \nincreased because the cost of heating oil has gone up so significantly. \nWe should pay for those costs today. So this amendment takes the \nSanders language and pays for it. The Sanders language represents about \nan $800,000 increase in the LIHEAP program. This would be about a two-\ntenths-of-1-percent cut across the board in nondefense appropriations \nin order to pay for that amendment.\n  It is very simple. It is obviously an attempt to bring some fiscal \ndiscipline\n\n[[Page S961]]\n\nbut, more importantly, to reflect the fact that if these heating bills \nare going to be paid for--and they should be paid for--we shouldn't \nborrow the money to do it. We shouldn't ask our children 10 years, 15 \nyears from now to pay those heating bills, with interest, when the \nbills are incurred today.\n  So that is all it does. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senate in \nallowing me to proceed to offer this amendment. I especially appreciate \nthe courtesy of the Senator from Wyoming.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3898 to Amendment No. 3899\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be temporarily set aside, and I call up amendment No. \n3898.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Barrasso] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3898 to amendment No. 3899.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To require the Comptroller General to report on the \n   effectiveness of coordination of health care services provided to \n         Indians using Federal, State, local, and tribal funds)\n\n       The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (as amended by \n     section 101(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating sections 816 and 817 as sections 817 \n     and 818, respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after section 815 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 816. GAO REPORT ON COORDINATION OF SERVICES.\n\n       ``(a) Study and Evaluation.--The Comptroller General of the \n     United States shall conduct a study, and evaluate the \n     effectiveness, of coordination of health care services \n     provided to Indians--\n       ``(1) through Medicare, Medicaid, or SCHIP;\n       ``(2) by the Service; or\n       ``(3) using funds provided by--\n       ``(A) State or local governments; or\n       ``(B) Indian Tribes.\n       ``(b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act \n     Amendments of 2007, the Comptroller General shall submit to \n     Congress a report--\n       ``(1) describing the results of the evaluation under \n     subsection (a); and\n       ``(2) containing recommendations of the Comptroller General \n     regarding measures to support and increase coordination of \n     the provision of health care services to Indians as described \n     in subsection (a).''.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, as a physician I have worked for over \ntwo decades to help people stay healthy and to help keep down the costs \nof their medical care. But health issues go way beyond that of a \ntwisted knee or a painful shoulder.\n  In my practice I have seen firsthand the obstacles that families face \nto obtain medical care. Rural hospitals and rural providers must \novercome significant challenges to deliver high-quality care in an \nenvironment with limited resources.\n  Our unique circumstances require us to work together to share \nresources and to develop networks. I think everyone can agree that \nthese same principles are critical to support and modernize the Indian \nhealth care delivery system.\n  The Wind River Reservation, located near Riverton, WY, is the home of \n10,415 members of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho Tribes. It \nis the third largest reservation in the United States, covering more \nthan 2.2 million acres.\n  I recently visited with my friends on the Wind River Reservation. The \ntribal leaders told me of the hopes they have for their families, their \ncommunities, for Wyoming, and for our great Nation. We spent much of \nthe time discussing health care.\n  Individuals living on the Wind River Reservation have worse than \naverage rates for infant mortality, for suicide, for substance abuse, \nfor unintentional injuries, for lung cancer, for heart disease, and for \ndiabetes. They shared with me how difficult it can be for them to \nrecruit and retain health professionals, to respond effectively to \ncultural barriers, and to help individuals make better lifestyle \nchanges and choices.\n  We talked about reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct, and that is the bill that is now in front of the Senate. This \nlegislation is important. It is important to give Native Americans the \nquality care they deserve, but it is also important to support critical \nhealth facilities that can help drive economic development and job \ncreation.\n  When Congress debates improving the Indian health care system, the \nfirst instinct is to allocate more financial resources or to create new \ninitiatives. Now, this stems from a strong desire from all of us to \nhelp. Yet this same helping hand can produce overlapping government \nprograms, and these will be overlapping programs that are all trying to \nachieve the same goals.\n  For example, today, neither the government nor Indian advocacy groups \ncan explain exactly how funds are used to coordinate medical services. \nThe Indian Health Service is not like other Federal health care \nprograms. Congress has only limited access to the research data that is \nneeded to improve Indian health care. If we do not know where the \nresources are being spent, if we do not know the number of programs \ndedicated to provide various health care services, and if we do not \nknow how health care services are coordinated, then how can we be \ncertain that we are maximizing our ability to help Native Americans and \nAlaska Natives?\n  That is why I have offered amendment No. 3898 today. This amendment \nrequires the Government Accountability Office--the GAO--to submit a \nreport to Congress. The report would lay out how these various \ngovernment and local programs coordinate health care services in Indian \ncountry.\n  The GAO study would focus on programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, \nchildren's health insurance programs, and the Indian Health Service. It \nalso would require the GAO to research how these Federal programs \ninteract with efforts by State, local, and tribal groups to deliver the \nessential health care services that are so vital to these citizens. By \nidentifying any overlaps in spending, as well as pinpointing the \nservice gaps, then we can develop reasonable, commonsense solutions \nthat streamline and improve Indian health care. This way, we can target \nFederal funds to programs that are making the greatest impact. Then we \ncan focus on additional areas where Native Americans and Alaska Natives \nneed our support and need more support.\n  The GAO is well known as the investigative arm of Congress, and it is \nalso known as the congressional watchdog. GAO helps Congress improve \nthe Federal Government's performance and ensures programs meet strict \naccountability standards.\n  Now, all of that they do for the benefit of the American people. We \nrely on their expert recommendations, which are unbiased and are set up \nto make sound policy decisions. This oversight shows us ways to make \ngovernment more efficient, more effective, ethical, and equitable. It \nuncovers what is working and what is not working, and it offers \nvaluable advice on how to fix it. But, most importantly, this oversight \nhelps us plan for the future.\n  Over the years, the GAO has submitted a few reports dealing with \nspecific Indian health issues. Do any of my colleagues recall the last \ntime the GAO completed a comprehensive Indian health care report?\n  I am certainly unaware of any recent efforts in this area. How many \nGAO reports have been released regarding Medicare, Medicaid, and the \ndifferent health professional programs? I think we all know the answer.\n  We owe it to Native Americans, to Alaska Natives, and to the American \ntaxpayers to adopt this amendment.\n  Madam President, I wish to make sure that people of the Wind River \nReservation in Wyoming, and all Native American people across America, \nhave equal access to quality, affordable medical care.\n  The Indian Affairs Committee, of which I am a member, will continue \nfocusing on this issue long after this Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct is reauthorized.\n\n[[Page S962]]\n\n  It is essential that our committee have the information it needs to \nevaluate the current delivery system--exposing barriers that prevent \ncollaboration, that prevent networking, that prevent innovation, and \nthat prevent the sharing of resources.\n  It is my hope that this GAO report will help all policymakers begin \nto understand where the delivery system is working, where it is not, \nand offer the recommendations that are so important and so needed to \nstreamline and to modernize it.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JAMES ALBERT YOUNG\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, today I want to recognize and honor an \nindividual who has committed much of his life to the preservation of \nWestern rangeland and its ecosystems. Dr. James Albert Young retired on \nJanuary 3, 2008, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural \nResearch Service after 33 years of dedicated work on issues important \nto the environmental health of the Great Basin.\n  The Great Basin is North America's largest desert, encompassing 135 \nmillion acres of land between the Rocky and Sierra Nevada Mountains in \nwestern North America. It includes parts of Nevada, Utah, Idaho, \nOregon, and California. Land in the Great Basin is arid, receiving less \nthan 12 inches of rain annually. Today, population growth, wildfires, \nand invasive species are reducing the quality of native rangelands at \nan accelerating rate. Recent studies by the U.S. Geological Survey and \nothers predict that climate change could well be expected to accelerate \nthese changes and associated impacts. Dr. Young's professional life was \nfocused on understanding the specific challenges facing the Great \nBasin, finding ways to reverse the trends that threaten its \nenvironmental health, and educating people about the uniqueness of this \nbeautiful land.\n  In 1965, Dr. Young started his career with USDA's Agricultural \nResearch Service as a range scientist for the range and pasture unit in \nReno, NV. He served as research leader of that unit from 1986 to 1998 \nand was known by many as the ``Encyclopedia of Western Rangelands.'' \nOver the years his expertise and commitment to rangeland issues was \nrecognized through various awards, such as United States Department of \nAgriculture Scientist of the Year, Weed Science Society of America \nAward of Excellence, Society for Range Management W. R. Chapline \nResearch Award, Outstanding Achievement Award, and Fellow Award, as \nwell as the Society for Range Management Nevada Section Researcher of \nthe Year Award.\n  The State of Nevada awarded Dr. Young with the very first Nevada Weed \nManagement Award, which they named the ``James A. Young Award,'' for \nhis tireless work on invasive weed management issues. Dr. Young has \nauthored and co-authored over 700 scientific articles, including many \nbooks. His books have received national recognition, some of which \ninclude ``Collecting, Processing, and Germinating Seeds of Wildland \nPlants;'' ``Endless Tracks in the Woods''; ``Purshia: The Wild and \nBitter Roses''; and ``Cattle in the Cold Desert.'' Dr. Young recently \nfinished a book, ``Cheatgrass: Fire and Forage on the Range,'' which is \nan illustration of the breadth of knowledge that he has on the most \npopular weed in the Intermountain West. It is often stated that Dr. \nYoung has probably forgotten more information on the ecology of Western \nrangelands that most people in resource management will ever learn.\n  Early in Dr. Young's career he developed the hypothesis that the \nnature and structure of a wildland plant community is largely \ncontrolled by the process that eliminated the previous plant community \nthat occupied the site. Now known as the stand renewal process, this \nhypothesis is one of his ecological trademarks.\n  Dr. Young was also an outstanding educator. Over the years, he \nintroduced dozens of high school and college students to the field of \nrange science, some of whom became Area Directors for the Agricultural \nResearch Service. His continued interest in educating natural resource \nspecialists, as well as the general public, on science based management \nof Natural Resources has been a tremendous achievement over his career.\n  We owe a great debt to individuals like Dr. Young who, make their \nlife's work protecting our natural world. Thank you, Dr. Young, for all \nyou have done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/13/senate-section/article/S962-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GOLD MEDAL FOR AUNG SAN SUU KYI\n\n  Mr. McCONNEL. Madam President, I am proud once again to join my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Feinstein, on a matter involving the \npromotion of freedom and reconciliation in Burma. Today, we join \ntogether in support of awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Burma's \nAung San Suu Kyi.\n  When first established in 1776, the Congressional Gold Medal was \ngiven to military leaders for their achievements in battle. Since that \ntime, it has become America's highest civilian honor, having been \nbestowed upon great friends of freedom such as Winston Churchill, \nNelson Mandela, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Granting Suu Kyi the Gold \nMedal would continue that same tradition of honoring heroism in the \ndefense of liberty.\n  For more than 20 years, Aung San Suu Kyi's support for justice and \ndemocracy has placed her at odds with the tyranny and oppression of the \nBurmese junta. She and her supporters have combated the brutality of \nthe junta with peaceful protest and resistance. She has chosen dignity \nas her weapon, and she has found allies in democracy-loving people \naround the world to aid her in her struggle.\n  Even as I speak, Suu Kyi's nonviolent fight for democracy continues. \nJust last week, the Burmese junta announced that it would hold a \ngeneral election in 2010. However, under the regime's sham plan for \ndemocracy, it would not even permit the country's foremost democracy \nactivist, Suu Kyi, to hold public office.\n  The military junta is fooling no one with its false promises of \nreform, least of all, Suu Kyi and her allies. After all, she remains \nunder house arrest, as she has for 12 of the last 18 years. That said, \nas the regime continues to suppress the voices of freedom and peace, it \ncan be sure that there will be those of us who will stand with Suu Kyi \nand the people of Burma as they continue their struggle for democracy \nand justice.\n  By awarding Suu Kyi the Congressional Gold Medal, we are letting the \nBurmese military junta and the world know that the people of America \nwill continue to speak out in favor of meaningful reform in her \ncountry.\n  It is particularly fitting that today, February 13 is the birthday of \nSuu Kyi's father. Aung San helped lead the struggle for Burmese \nindependence after World War II, but was assassinated just before its \nachievement. What could be a more fitting way to honor the memory of a \nman who fought for freedom than by rewarding his noble daughter for \ncontinuing his legacy? In so doing, we reward them both with the \npromise that the United States will remain committed to the same cause, \nthat of a peaceful and free Burma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/13/senate-section/article/S962-4", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S962-S964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FISA AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, we have had a lengthy debate, and in the \nend I decided to vote against final passage of S. 2248, the FISA \nAmendments Act of 2007.\n  First, I commend Senators Rockefeller and Bond for recognizing \nimmediately that the Protect America\n\n[[Page S963]]\n\nAct, passed in August, needed modifications. S. 2248 does improve FISA \nprocedures. The bill increases the role of the FISA Court with respect \nto targeting. It mandates FISA Court review and approval of the \nminimization procedures governing the protection of identities and \nnonpublic information about U.S. persons. This bill also provides \nstatutory rules for the use of information acquired under it.\n  However, when S. 2248 came before the full Senate for debate, I, and \nmany of my colleagues, believed that additional protections and \nclarifications could and should be added. But it soon became clear that \nall such measures would be defeated.\n  I was particularly disappointed that Senator Feinstein's amendment on \nexclusivity did not pass. I believe it is very important to reiterate \nthat FISA is the exclusive means for conducting surveillance on \nAmericans for foreign intelligence purposes. I would have thought that \nevery member of the Senate would have been interested in clarifying \nwhat the administration was authorized to do under the laws that \nCongress passes rather than allowing the administration to boldly and \nerroneously assert authorities from the Authorization for the Use of \nMilitary Force against al-Qaida and the Taliban. But unfortunately I \nwas wrong.\n  I also admit that I had serious concerns about granting retroactive \nimmunity to telecommunications companies for actions they may or may \nnot have taken in response to administration requests that may or may \nnot have been legal. One of my concerns is regarding the accessibility \nof information. First, my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee and \nIntelligence Committee were allowed to read the necessary documents \nonly after extensive negotiations with the administration. I, and the \nrest of my Senate colleagues who are not on those committees, were \ndenied access to those documents. In addition, the telecommunications \ncompanies who have been named in several lawsuits have been prohibited \nby the Government from providing any information regarding this issue \nto the courts, to the plaintiffs, to Members of Congress, or to the \npublic. Yet we were asked to blindly vote for retroactive immunity, \nwhich is something I simply could not do. Therefore I supported Senator \nDodd's amendment to strike immunity, but it did not pass.\n  I was then willing to consider some compromise approaches, such as \nthe Specter and Whitehouse amendment, which would have substituted the \nGovernment for the telecommunications companies in civil suits, or \nSenator Feinstein's amendment, which would have provided for the FISA \nCourt's review of the telecommunications companies to determine if \nimmunity should apply. However, neither of these amendments was able to \nsecure enough votes to pass. At the end of day, retroactive immunity \nremained in the bill, setting what I believe could be a dangerous \nprecedent.\n  S. 2248 is indeed an improvement over the Protect America Act. But in \nmy judgment, it still did not provide enough protections to American \ncitizens and did not provide ample justification for retroactive \nimmunity for telecommunications companies. I therefore voted to oppose \nthe bill. I hope to continue to work with my colleagues to pass the \nmodifications I believe are needed.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to final \npassage of S. 2248, the FISA, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, \nAmendments Act. I am disappointed that the Senate has failed to \nadequately improve the Protect America Act, PAA, which Congress enacted \nin August 2007 and which I voted against.\n  The President should have the necessary authority to track \nterrorists, intercept their communications, and disrupt their plots. \nCongress should make needed changes to FISA to account for changes in \ntechnology and rulings from the FISA Court involving purely \ninternational communications that pass through telecommunications \nroutes in the United States. While we have a solemn obligation to \nprotect the American people, we must simultaneously uphold the \nConstitution and protect our civil liberties.\n  After learning about executive branch abuses in the 1960s and 1970s, \nCongress passed very specific laws which authorize electronic \nsurveillance. Congress has regularly updated these measures over the \nyears to provide the executive branch the tools it needs to investigate \nterrorists, while preserving essential oversight mechanisms for the \ncourts and the Congress. FISA requires the Government to seek an order \nor warrant from the FISA Court before conducting electronic \nsurveillance that may involve U.S. persons. The act also provides for \npostsurveillance notice to the FISA Court by the Attorney General in an \nemergency.\n  I am very concerned that the FISA law was disregarded by the \nadministration and want to ensure that we put an end to this type of \nabuse. We are a nation of laws, and no one is above the law, including \nthe President and Attorney General. Congress has the right to know the \nextent of the warrantless wiretapping program and how it was initiated \nand changed over the years by this administration.\n  I voted in favor of the Judiciary Committee substitute to the \nIntelligence Committee bill. The Judiciary Committee version \nstrengthened congressional and judicial review, including increasing \nthe oversight by the FISA Court of the administration's wiretapping \nprogram. I am therefore very disappointed that the Senate rejected the \nJudiciary Committee substitute and that the Senate has rejected \nnumerous amendments--including an amendment that I had offered--to \nimprove this legislation.\n  I am hopeful that the House will make much needed improvements in \nthis legislation during conference and that I can support balanced \nlegislation that gives the intelligence community the tools it needs to \ntrack terrorists and prevent attacks, while maintaining safeguards \nagainst the abuse of power by the executive branch. I will continue to \nwork to ensure the safety and security of the American people, as well \nas their civil liberties. Domestic eavesdropping raises serious and \nfundamental questions regarding the conduct of the war against \nterrorism, the privacy rights of Americans, and the separation of \npowers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. \nCongress must continue to work to strike the right balance, and we have \nnot achieved that goal today.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I believe the FISA bill that passed the \nSenate yesterday could have and should have been a better bill. There \nis no charitable explanation for why the U.S. Senate failed to pass a \nbill that demonstrates at once that we can protect our national \nsecurity and protect the Constitution of the United States and the \nrights of law-abiding American citizens at the same time.\n  September 11 was a wakeup call for millions about a global struggle \nagainst extremism--and the need to modernize our Government to win that \nstruggle. September 11 also began a debate in our country over how we \ncan win the struggle against extremists without losing sight of who we \nare and what we value as Americans. Former Supreme Court Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor described the challenge best:\n\n       We must preserve our commitment at home to the principles \n     for which we fight abroad.\n\n  Congress has a duty to protect the American people--and to protect \nthe Constitution. That is the oath we take. It is a solemn pledge. That \nis why this debate, and this vote in the Senate is so disappointing: \nThis latest FISA law does not live up to the words we speak when we \ntake that oath in the Senate. Instead, rather than produce a bill that \nmade us stronger in the fight against extremism, colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle summarily rejected every effort this week to \ngive the President of the United States the added flexibility needed to \nhunt down and capture terrorists while protecting the rights of law-\nabiding Americans.\n  More than 6 years after 9/11, we are still searching to strike this \nproper balance. Once again, in the latest rushed effort in the face of \npartisan fear-mongering, the world's greatest deliberate body missed an \nopportunity to get it right.\n  Make no mistake, today's bill is a marked improvement over the \nProtect America Act. But this issue is far too critical to settle for \nhalf-measures and insufficient improvements. This bill doesn't do \nenough to protect independent judicial oversight by the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court,\n\n[[Page S964]]\n\nFISC, of sweeping Government powers. It doesn't provide the FISC the \nauthority to assess the Government's ongoing compliance with its \nwiretapping procedures, and doesn't set limits on the way the \nGovernment uses information acquired about Americans.\n  Instead, this bill leaves Americans vulnerable to continued \noverreaching by the executive branch. It allows the President to rely \non other statutory authorities to circumvent the will of the people and \nconduct warrantless foreign intelligence surveillance, permits \nlimitless ``fishing expeditions''--so-called bulk collection of all \ncommunications between the United States and overseas--and lets the \ngovernment eavesdrop on Americans under the guise of targeting \nforeigners--what is known as ``reverse targeting.'' If we have learned \nanything from over 7 years of the Bush administration, it is that we \ncannot simply hand them a blank check and trust that they will not \nabuse it.\n  The Judiciary Committee's FISA bill recognized the need for this type \nof robust judicial and congressional oversight in the face of ever-\nexpanding Executive power. It systematically sought to create all of \nthe aforementioned safeguards on liberty, while making sure to give the \nPresident the expanded set of tools required to fight terrorism in the \ndigital age. That is the bill we should have passed.\n  Most importantly, unlike the FISA bill that passed the Senate \nyesterday, the Judiciary Committee's version did not grant amnesty to \ntelecommunications providers that were complicit in the \nAdministration's warrantless spying program. The administration may \nwell be deliberately stonewalling to avoid a judgment day in court. \nYet, today, the Senate rewarded the President's obstructionism, \nproviding him cover to seek political security under the guise of \nnational security. That is wrong. It is also a slap in the face to \ntelecommunications providers like QWEST, which in the difficult days \nafter 9/11, courageously refused to aid the administration's \nwarrantless wiretapping efforts and questioned their legality.\n  Americans, who are deeply concerned about the secrecy and abuses of \npower that have marked this administration's years in office, and who \nare tired of learning information after the fact in our newspapers when \nwhistleblowers leak it, deserve much better. This bill shreds the \nbipartisan principle that Americans should have their day in court--\nthat accountability should be preserved to adjudicate competing claims \nand at last shed light on the administration's secret surveillance \nprogram. It is for these reasons, after all, that Senator Specter, the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, refused to grant blanket \namnesty and, as he put it, ``undercut[] a major avenue of redress.'' If \nthese lawsuits are shielded by Congress, the courts may never rule on \nwhether the administration's surveillance activities were lawful.\n  An impartial court of law insulated from political pressure is the \nmost appropriate setting in which to receive a fair hearing. That is a \nfar cry from the U.S. Senate wiping the slate clean for the Bush \nadministration. Everyone agrees, if the telecoms followed the law, they \nshould get immunity, as Congress explicitly provided under the original \nFISA law. But our courts should decide, not Congress--and that is a \nmatter of principle protected in the House's FISA bill.\n  There is today, as divided as we are, very much that we agree upon: \nWe all want to prevent terrorist attacks, we all want to gather \neffectively as much intelligence as possible, and we all want to bring \nthose who would attack us to justice before they strike us. But we \nundermine--not strengthen--our cause when we subvert our Constitution, \nthrow away our system of checks and balances, and disregard human \ndignity.

Madam President, I would like to take a moment to note \nthe violent attacks which took place earlier this week on the President \nand Prime Minster of East Timor, or Timor-Leste as it is also called. \nThe people of East Timor have experienced far too much violence for \nsuch a small nation and it is time, once again, for the world to \nrenounce violence as a means to achieving any political agenda. I \ncondemn such acts and urge all parties to seek legitimate peaceful--and \npolitical--means to ensure their voices are heard.\n  Earlier this week, President Jose Ramos Horta was shot by rebel \nsoldiers. This band of rebels, led by the infamous Alfredo Reinado, \nattacked President Ramos-Horta outside his house. As a longstanding \nadvocate of East Timor's self-determination, I have met President \nRamos-Horta and am very troubled by this attempt to take his life and \nto undermine East Timorese stability and independence. President Ramos \nHorta is a Nobel Peace Prize winner and is known for his leadership of \na nonviolent struggle against the Indonesian occupation. It is \nprecisely because of these honorable principles that he has espoused, \nin the face of repeated violence, that I am doubly concerned by this \nrecent attack. I am also worried that this violent act could affect the \nstability and progress of this young country and am pleased that \nAustralia has agreed to send additional soldiers and police officers to \naddress any unrest that might occur in the aftermath of this heinous \nattack.\n  I have followed East Timor's ongoing transformation very closely \nsince the disastrous crisis in the late 1990s and have been so pleased \nto see its successful transition from Indonesian occupation to a U.N. \nadministration to an independent nation over the years. Certainly East \nTimor's path forward has not been free from challenges but it has moved \nconsistently in the right direction. I have long supported a robust \nU.N. peacekeeping mission there, I pressed the administration to take a \nhard line with the Indonesia military as a result, in part, of its \nactions in East Timor, and I spoke out against the renewed unrest in \n2006 which led to a collapse of many key institutions and once again \nrequired the international community to step in and play a key role in \nsecurity reform.\n  We cannot overlook the significance of these attacks in East Timor as \nthe country stands to chart a course for emerging democracies around \nthe world. A stable East Timor sends a signal that the international \ncommunity can work collaboratively and consistently for the betterment \nof a nation--and a people. East Timor has received significant \nmultilateral support over the years and if it fails to develop into a \nfully functioning and stable democracy, we will need to reexamine what \nkinds of commitment our nation truly makes to young democracies \nstriving to succeed. For these reasons, I hope this incident is little \nmore than a blip on the radar for Ramos-Horta and that his recovery is \na speedy one so he can return to the helm of leadership and finish his \nterm as President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/13/senate-section/article/S964-2", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S964-S965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CELEBRATING OREGON'S BLACK HISTORY\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, each Congress I rise to honor February as \nBlack History Month. Each February since 1926, we have recognized the \ncontributions of Black Americans to the history of our Nation. This \nmonth I want to celebrate some of the contributions made by Black \nAmericans in my home State of Oregon.\n  The story of Abner Hunt Francis, a merchant from Buffalo, NY, is \nparticularly moving. Francis, a man who gravitated to leadership, co-\nfounded the Buffalo City Anti-Slavery Society in 1838 and organized \nlocal colored conventions throughout the 1830s and '40s in his native \nstate. In 1851 he left the East Coast for the City of Portland in the \nOregon Territory, expecting to encounter freer country on the American \nfrontier.\n  Francis was disappointed to discover that despite the progressive \nattitude of its settlers, racist laws still encumbered Oregon \nTerritory. It was not long after opening a boardinghouse that Francis's \nbrother, O. H. Francis, was arrested. O. H. was detained in Portland on \nthe grounds that men and women of color were not legally allowed in \nOregon Territory, pursuant to an existing ``exclusion'' law. The case \nwent immediately before a lower court, where it was decided that O. H. \nwould\n\n[[Page S965]]\n\nhave 6 months to vacate the territory. Unsatisfied that the judge had \ngiven O. H. ample time to leave, the complainant in the case appealed \nand the matter was elevated to the Territorial Supreme Court.\n  Abner Francis was incensed by the fact that such a law existed in the \nso-called free territory of Oregon. He described the plight of his \nbrother and detailed the case made before the Supreme Court in a letter \nto his friend and fellow civil rights advocate, Frederick Douglass. \nWhen Judge Orville Pratt ruled against the defense, giving O. H. 4 \nmonths to leave the territory, Abner engaged Col. William M. King, then \nthe representative of Portland's district in the State legislature. \nRepresentative King agreed to try to repeal the law outright. The law \nwas not repealed until 1926, but a group of outraged Portlanders, led \nby Abner, successfully petitioned for an exemption for O. H.\n  Douglass wasted no time in publishing Francis's letter. Many \nabolitionists and civil rights leaders were learning of racial \ninjustices in the undeveloped West for the first time when they read of \nO. H. Francis's case.\n  Outspoken men and women like Abner Francis forced Oregonians and the \nNation to acknowledge that the bitter struggle for equality was to be \nfought not just in the East, but also in the farthest reaches of the \nAmerican West. Francis must be recognized as one of the first vocal \nadvocates for racial equality in Oregon. Today, I honor Abner Hunt \nFrancis for his contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/13/senate-section/article/S965-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL.

Madam President, today I want to recognize the \naccomplishments of Ms. Debra Brown Steinberg. Last year, Ms. Steinberg \nreceived the Ellis Island Medal of Honor from the National Ethnic \nCoalition of Organizations for her services in representing the \nfamilies of noncitizen victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \nattacks on the World Trade Center. With this award, she joins past \nnotable recipients such as former Presidents Gerald Ford, George H.W. \nBush, and Bill Clinton.\n  Ms. Steinberg has worked tirelessly to help the families of 9/11 \nvictims. She played a leading role in the creation of the New York \nLawyers for the Public Interest 9/11 Project shortly after the attacks. \nMs. Steinberg was a driving force in the creation of the 9/11 Victims \nCompensation Fund, which provided a total of $7 billion to the families \nof those killed in the attacks, and she drafted a substantial portion \nof the New York 9/11 Victims and Families Relief Act. Over the 6 years \nfollowing that tragic day, her selfless service to these families has \nnever ceased.\n  The Ellis Island Medal of Honor is only the latest in a series of \nhonors that have been appropriately awarded to Ms. Steinberg. In 2006, \nshe received the American Bar Association's Pro Bono Publico award for \nher many extraordinary efforts on behalf of the families of 9/11 \nvictims, which she performed without compensation. Her public services \nhave also been honored twice by the U.S. House of Representatives, in a \nNew York State Senate resolution, and by New York City mayor Michael \nBloomberg. Ms. Steinberg's work was also featured in the documentary \nfilm entitled ``The Legal Community's Response to September 11th'' and \nin a similar study entitled ``Public Service in a Time of Crisis.''\n  Ms. Steinberg's service should serve as an inspiration not only her \npeers in the legal profession but to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/13/senate-section/article/S965-3", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE GARFIELD-PALOUSE HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mrs. MURRAY.

These outstanding young students and their \nteacher, Mr. Jim Stewart, are finalists in the National Engineering and \nDesign Challenge.\n  The Garfield-Palouse JETS team researched and built a prototype \nparaplegic agricultural lift to meet this year's National Engineering \nand Design Challenge to design a device to assist disabled people in \nthe workplace. Their work to build this lift was inspired by their \ndesire to help a classmate and will allow access to agriculture \nequipment for individuals with a disability. Agriculture is an \nimportant part of Washington State's economy, and I am pleased these \nstudents worked on a project that highlights a local industry and will \nhelp individuals with disabilities attain greater independence.\n  The JETS program at Garfield-Palouse High School is an integral tool \nto empower students to take a deeper look at understanding and \naddressing problems that many individuals with disabilities face.\n  I would like to commend Colby Cocking, Beau Fisher, Spencer Gray, \nAnna Iverson, Travis Mallett, Sean Neal, Miles Pfaff, Aaron Rager, \nKatie Redman, Steven Tronsen, and Jim Stewart for their \naccomplishments.

Madam President, today I honor Mr. Jim White, who \nis being recognized by the Wellspring Treatment Center in Rapid City, \nSD, for his many years of service to the local community, his \noutstanding generosity, and his dedication to encouraging local small \nbusinesses. It is people like Jim who make up the backbone of South \nDakota's communities.\n\n[[Page S966]]\n\n  Jim White is the owner and founder of Sound Pro, a small business \nthat he has operated for the past 32 years. He began the business as a \nyoung man and through hard work and dedication, grew the business into \nan establishment that is both customer and employee friendly. He has \nbeen a shining example of a hard-working and reliable businessman.\n  In addition to his dedication to the local business community, Mr. \nWhite has a special concern for the local young people. After reading a \nnewspaper article about a local girl in need of a kidney transplant, he \ndidn't hesitate to get tested as a potential donor. Upon hearing that \nhe was a perfect match, Mr. White generously and selflessly gave his \nkidney to the young girl in order to save her life.\n  Mr. White is not only a generous local businessman, he also actively \ngives his time as a volunteer for many community organizations. He \ncurrently serves as a board member and also participates as a Big \nBrother mentor himself. Jim is a positive influence and great role \nmodel for these boys as well as the rest of his community.\n  Outside of Big Brothers and Big Sisters, Mr. White also willingly \ndonates his time to mentor those in the community struggling with \nsubstance abuse and addiction. Despite his extremely busy schedule, he \nputs a high priority on encouraging and supporting people in the \ncommunity from all walks of life. This support is also shown by his \nservice as a member of the board of directors of the Wellspring \nTreatment Center, a local nonprofit agency that provides treatment and \nservices to young people struggling with behavioral, emotional and \nchemical dependency problems.\n  In addition to all of his other commitments, Mr. White is the \nchairman of the Military Affairs Committee for the Rapid City Chamber \nof Commerce. He is extremely dedicated to this position and has even \nbeen given the title of ``Honorary Commander'' for the Ellsworth AFB \nWing Commander.\n  This honorable recognition is clearly well-deserved. It is dedicated \nfolks like Jim who make up the backbone of South Dakota's communities \nand it gives me great pleasure to commemorate Jim White on this special \noccasion and to wish him continued success in the years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/13/senate-section/article/S966-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT OF AN EXECUTIVE ORDER BLOCKING THE PROPERTY AND INTERESTS IN \nPROPERTY OF PERSONS DETERMINED TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CORRUPTION \n         OF SENIOR OFFICIALS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SYRIA--PM 38\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as \namended (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA), I hereby report that I have \nissued an Executive Order taking additional steps with respect to the \nGovernment of Syria's continued engagement in certain conduct that \nformed the basis for the national emergency declared in Executive Order \n13338 of May 11, 2004, including but not limited to its efforts to \nundermine the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq.\n  This order will block the property and interests in property of \npersons determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, to be responsible for, to have engaged in, \nto have facilitated, or to have secured improper advantage as a result \nof, public corruption by senior officials within the Government of \nSyria.

A bill to provide for a biennial budget process and a \nbiennial appropriations process and to enhance oversight and the \nperformance of the Federal Government; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Lieberman, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, I rise to introduce the Biennial Budgeting and \nAppropriations Act, a bill to convert the annual budget and \nappropriations process to a 2-year cycle and to enhance oversight of \nFederal programs.\n  Mr. President, our most recent experience with the fiscal year 2008 \nOmnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act shows the need for a biennial \nappropriations and budget process. That one bill clearly demonstrated \nCongress is incapable of completing the budget, authorizing, and \nappropriations process on an annual basis and unfortunantly, this is \nnot the first time.\n\n[[Page S972]]\n\n  Congress should now act to streamline the system by moving to a 2-\nyear, or biennial, budget process. This is the most important reform we \ncan enact to streamline the budget process, to make the Senate a more \ndeliberative and effective institution, and to make us more accountable \nto the American people.\n  Moving to a biennial budget and appropriations process enjoys very \nbroad support. President George W. Bush has supported a biennial \nbudgeting process. Presidents Clinton, Reagan, and Bush also proposed a \nbiennial appropriations and budget cycle. Leon Panetta, who served as \nWhite House Chief of Staff, OMB Director, and House Budget Committee \nchairman, has advocated a biennial budget since the late 1970s. Former \nOMB and CBO Director Alice Rivlin has called for a biennial budget the \npast two decades. Vice President Gore's National Performance Review and \nthe 1993 Joint Committee on the Reorganization of Congress both \nrecommended a biennial appropriations and budget cycle.\n  A biennial budget will dramatically improve the current budget \nprocess. The current annual budget process is redundant, inefficient, \nand destined for failure each year. Look at what we struggle to \ncomplete each year under the current annual process. The annual budget \nprocess consumes 3 years: 1 year for the administration to prepare the \nPresident's budget, another year for the Congress to put the budget \ninto law, and the final year to actually execute the budget.\n  Today, I want to focus just on the congressional budget process, the \nprocess of annually passing a budget resolution, authorization \nlegislation, and multiple appropriation bills. The record clearly shows \nthat last year's experience was nothing new. Under the annual process, \nwe consistently fail to complete action on multiple appropriations \nbills, to authorize programs, and to meet our deadlines.\n  While we have made a number of improvements in the budget process, \nthe current annual process is redundant and inefficient. The Senate has \nthe same debate, amendments and votes on the same issue three or four \ntimes a year--once on the budget resolution, again on the authorization \nbill, and finally on the appropriations bill.\n  Several years ago, I asked the Congressional Research Service, CRS, \nto update and expand upon an analysis of the amount of time we spend on \nthe budget. CRS looked at all votes on appropriations, revenue, \nreconciliation, and debt limit measures as well as budget resolutions. \nCRS then examined any other vote dealing with budgetary levels, Budget \nAct waivers, or votes pertaining to the budget process. Beginning with \n1980, budget related votes started dominating the work of the Senate. \nIn 1996, 73 percent of the votes the Senate took were related to the \nbudget.\n  If we cannot adequately focus on our duties because we are constantly \ndebating the budget throughout the authorizing, budgeting, and \nappropriations process, just imagine how confused the American public \nis about what we are doing. The result is that the public does not \nunderstand what we are doing and it breeds cynicism about our \nGovernment.\n  Under the legislation we are introducing today, the President would \nsubmit a 2-year budget and Congress would consider a 2-year budget \nresolution and 2-year appropriation bills during the first session of a \nCongress. The second session of the Congress would be devoted to \nconsideration of authorization bills and for oversight of Government \nagencies.\n  Most of the arguments against a biennial budget process will come \nfrom those who claim we cannot predict or plan on a 2-year basis. For \nmost of the budget, we do not actually budget on an annual basis. Our \nentitlement and revenue laws are under permanent law, and Congress does \nnot change these laws on an annual basis. The only component of the \nbudget that is set in law annually are the appropriated, or \ndiscretionary, accounts.\n  The most predictable category of the budget are these appropriated, \nor discretionary, accounts of the Federal Government. Much of this \nspending is associated with international activities or emergencies. \nBecause most of this funding cannot be predicted on an annual basis, a \nbiennial budget is no less deficient than the current annual process. \nMy bill does not preclude supplemental appropriations necessary to meet \nthese emergency or unanticipated requirements.\n  In 1993 I had the honor to serve as cochairman on a joint committee \nthat studied the operations of the Congress. Senator Byrd testified \nbefore that committee that the increasing demands put on us as Senators \nhas led to our ``fractured attention.'' We simply are too busy to \nadequately focus on the people's business. This legislation is designed \nto free up time and focus our attention, particularly with respect to \nthe oversight of Federal programs and activities.\n  Frankly, the limited oversight we are now doing is not as good as it \nshould be. Our authorizing committees are increasingly crowded out of \nthe legislative process. Under a biennial budget, the second year of \nthe biennium will be exclusively devoted to examining Federal programs \nand developing authorization legislation. The calendar will be free of \nthe budget and appropriations process, giving these committees the time \nand opportunity to provide oversight, review, and legislate changes to \nFederal programs. Oversight and the authorization should be an ongoing \nprocess, but a biennial appropriations process will provide greater \nopportunity for legislators to concentrate on programs and policies in \nthe second year.\n  A biennial budget cannot make the difficult decisions that must be \nmade in budgeting, but it can provide the tools necessary to make much \nbetter decisions. Under the current annual budget process, we are \nconstantly spending the taxpayers' money instead of focusing on how \nbest and most efficiently we should spend the taxpayers' money. By \nmoving to a biennial budget cycle, we can plan, budget, and appropriate \nmore effectively, strengthen oversight and watchdog functions, and \nimprove the efficiency of government agencies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 2627\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide Medicaid coverage of drugs prescribed for certain research \nstudy child participants; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce Nino's Act, to provide for the continuance of successful \ntreatment for children who are required to leave National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH, research studies. The NIH provides the greatest medical \nresearch in the world on innumerable diseases, including cancer, \nAlzheimer's, Parkinson's. The NIH also conducts excellent research on \ndiseases that affect children. To conduct that research many brave \nchildren must partake in research studies including observational, or \nnatural history, studies and clinical trials to test experimental \ntherapies. This participation is critical to understanding diseases and \nultimately finding cures at the NIH.\n  To participate in the trials and studies, children and their families \noften make considerable sacrifices. Families will travel great \ndistances to receive treatment that may provide relief from the child's \nillness. In many cases, parents and doctors will have tried many \ntreatments for the child's disease about which little may be known or \nunderstood. The NIH studies represent an opportunity for both the \nmedical community to learn more about the disease and the child to be \nstudied and potentially treated by the best researchers in the world.\n  When the experimental treatments are successful, it is cause for \ngreat celebration for the child. The joy, however, can end quickly as \nthe studies come to end but the children who have been part of them \ncontinue to be stricken by these terrible illnesses.\n  Nino's Act seeks to transition children out of the NIH studies as \nthey end so they don't experience a gap in their important treatment. \nThis legislation continues the successful treatment initiated in NIH \nstudies by providing access to the same prescription drugs for children \nwho are required to leave NIH clinical studies due to the studies \nending, researcher leaving, or other reason. Often drugs that are used \nsuccessfully in these studies have not yet been approved by the Food \nand Drug Administration or have not been approved for treatment of the \nchild's specific disease. As such, it is nearly impossible for children \nto get access or insurance coverage for these drugs. This bill makes \nthat access possible by requiring Medicaid to cover the cost of \ntreatment in the event that the children's health insurance does not.\n  On occasion, insurers will cover the cost of the treatment for these \nchildren if they have adequate insurance and the FDA has approved the \ndrug for off-label uses. More often then not, however, children do not \nhave health insurance, or have insufficient insurance to obtain these \ndrugs. As a result, children suffer their diseases without relief from \nthe treatment as established in the clinical NIH studies. To ensure \nthat these children have access to successful care post-study, Nino's \nAct requires Medicaid to cover the cost of treatment for these \nchildren. While Medicaid access is traditionally based on income, due \nto the importance of these drugs to the child's well-being the income \ncomponent will be waived. To ensure Medicaid is not unnecessarily \ncovering medication, Nino's Act requires the physicians participating \nin the research to certify the treatment as successful and essential.\n  This important issue was introduced to me by Lori Todaro of Newville, \nPA. Lori's son Nino suffers from Undifferentiated Auto-Inflammatory \nPeriodic Fever Syndrome. This disease takes a devastating toll on those \nwho suffer from it. The auto-inflammatory\n\n[[Page S976]]\n\ndisease can cause joint inflammation arthritis, Crohns, colitis, \nirritable bowel syndrome, and cyclical high fevers. Treatment for \nPeriodic Fever Syndrome is experimental at best; Lori and Nino have \nvisited a number of doctors and tried many medications in an effort to \ncontrol the disease.\n  In 2003, Nino was fortunate to be selected to take part in an \nobservational study at NIH in Bethesda, Maryland for Undifferentiated \nAuto-inflammatory Periodic Fever Syndrome. During the course of the \nstudy, Nino was given a new medication and his condition greatly \nimproved. Before he participated in the study he was being fitted for \nwheelchairs and was home schooled because his symptoms were so \ndisruptive and unpredictable. The NIH treatment allowed him to resume a \nnormal life and enabled him to attend school and play soccer. While \nNino's treatment was successful he could not remain part of the study \nindefinitely and was encouraged to seek coverage for his treatments \nthrough his private insurer. Initially, the Todaro's insurer would not \nagree to cover the cost of the experimental drug and only after an \nintense lobbying effort by Lori, did the insurer agree to cover Nino's \nprescriptions.\n  Nino's story is a successful one, but also serves to highlight the \nissue that children and their families are facing as they transition \nout of NIH studies. For many, NIH trials are a source of hope for \nrelief from the worst diseases known to man. The excellent doctors and \nresearch teams at NIH make invaluable contributions to our \nunderstanding of complex and debilitating diseases. This legislation \nseeks to amplify the NIH's contributions by allowing America's sickest \nchildren to continue their successful treatment under Medicaid \ncoverage. I encourage my colleagues to work with Senator Casey and me \nto move this legislation forward promptly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2629\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a critical \nhealth issue affecting thousands of our children every day but about \nwhich few people have ever even heard. All across this country, \nthousands of children suffer from rare genetic diseases called ``orphan \ndiseases,'' thus named because\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\nof the relatively small number of people these diseases strike.\n  An orphan disease is defined as affecting fewer than 200,000 people. \nThe National Institutes of Health, NIH, estimate that there are \napproximately 6,000 of these orphan diseases, affecting about 25 \nmillion Americans on the whole. Most of these rare diseases are genetic \nand many affect children.\n  Last spring, I met with a group of mothers who shared their struggles \nand frustrations in getting ongoing and consistent treatment for their \nchildren, each of whom suffers from an orphan disease. Many of these \nparents had been able to enroll their children in clinical trials at \nthe NIH and had found experimental treatments for their children that \nhad proven extremely successful. The doctors at NIH do miraculous work \nin finding treatments for children with rare genetic diseases. But \noftentimes, when the trial ends, these children and parents are left on \ntheir own, with no access to the previously free and effective \ntreatment that their children were getting.\n  Imagine if you can, for one moment, the predicament of these children \nand their parents? After months and sometimes years of first not \nknowing what was ailing their sick children, desperately seeking help, \nthen finally getting a diagnosis, only to find out that there was no \nFDA approved treatment. Then after searching for some kind of treatment \nand then finally, finally finding--and being admitted to--a clinical \ntrial on medication that miraculously gave their children the ability \nto function like other kids--to be able to play soccer and go to school \nand have friends over and just have the energy to be a child. For all \nof us who are parents, you can imagine the joy of seeing your child \nfinally alleviated from the suffering he or she has been going through, \nfinally able to enjoy him- or herself and do all the things that \nchildren are supposed to do.\n\n  Then imagine, if you can, what it would be like to suddenly have that \ntaken away. The clinical trial ends, or funding for the trial ends. \nSuddenly, you no longer have access to this drug that your child needs \nto be able to function, to do their homework, eat well and have fun. If \nit is a drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration or specifically approved for a child's particular \ndisease, then insurance companies typically will not cover it because \nthe treatment is considered ``experimental.'' In some cases, a drug has \nbeen approved for other uses than the orphan disease, known as ``off-\nlabel'' use. If a family has enough insurance, and there is off-label \nFDA approval, sometimes families can get coverage of the drugs. If not, \nthe resulting cost to families is astronomical--ranging anywhere from \n$10,000 to $30,000 per month.\n  This is what happened to Nino Todaro, a young boy from Newville, \nPennsylvania, and that is why Senator Specter and I are today \nintroducing Nino's Act. Nino suffers from Periodic Fever Syndrome, an \nunpredictable genetic condition that can cause uncontrolled \ninflammation throughout the body. When this disease acts up, Nino has \ndays where he cannot do much more than lie on the couch. Left \nuntreated, this condition could leave Nino unable to walk and even be \nlife-threatening. Fortunately Nino found help through an NIH clinical \ntrial, but funding ran out last year. The drug that returned Nino to a \njoyous soccer-playing kid was approved for arthritis and Crohn's \ndisease, but not Periodic Fever Syndrome. Facing costs of $12,000 a \nmonth, and initial rejections from their insurance company, Nino's \nparents turned to Congress.\n  Nino's Act will allow children to transition out of successful \ntreatment in NIH studies without a gap in treatment. There are \nthousands of children like Nino across this country who desperately \nneed the continuity of ongoing successful treatment for their rare \ndisorders. These are children who have been very ill, sometimes \nincapacitated, and have been able to resume normal childhoods through \nsuccessful drug treatment. Parents advocating for their children \nunderstandably refuse to accept that their children have no choice but \nto regress because their insurance company will not cover humongous \nmedical bills that no middle class family could even begin to absorb.\n\n  No parent should ever have to face a situation in which the care they \nneed for their seriously ill child is too expensive or held up by \nregulatory red tape. It is unthinkable to me that any ill child in this \ncountry, the richest nation on earth, with all our medical \nadvancements, should ever be denied medical treatment that is available \nand proven successful. Our bill will give these children and their \nparents peace of mind that when a study ends, their children's \nsuccessful ongoing treatment will not be threatened. To address this, \nNino's Act will require Medicaid to cover the cost of treatment of in \nthe event that a child's health insurance does not.\n  This is the least we can do for these children and families. No child \nfor whom treatment is available should have to forego that treatment to \nthe serious detriment of their health. That is just plain wrong. \nSenator Specter and I share the belief that ensuring ongoing treatment \nfor children with rare disorders is something this Congress should get \nbehind. I urge my colleagues to support Nino's Act and I will work hard \nfor its passage. My hope is it will go a long way toward ensuring that \nchildren with orphan diseases can get the successful treatment they \ndeserve, freeing them and their families to focus on what is truly \nimportant--keeping them well, and living out happy and productive \nlives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Kerry, and Ms. \n        Murkowski):\n  S. 2630.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to support the \nCommercial Fishing Industry Healthcare Coverage Act of 2008. My good \nfriend Senator Kennedy and I, along with Senators Kerry and Murkowski, \nare introducing this bill to improve healthcare options for our \nNation's fishermen and fishing families.\n  Few things are more Alaskan than fishing. Long before Alaska was even \na U.S territory, our people were fishing for their livelihood. The \nfirst Alaskans, Alaska Natives depended on subsistence fishing, as many \ndo today. Russian settlers built salteries to preserve their catch \nthrough our long, harsh winters. In the 1800s, the first canneries were \nbuilt in Sitka and Klawock, marking the birth of Alaska's modern \ncommercial fishing industry.\n  Today, Alaska's seafood industry is the State's largest private \nemployer and a fundamental part of Alaskan culture. All around our \nState, from Ketchikan, at the Southern end of the panhandle, to \nKotzebue, above the Arctic Circle, fishermen brave the elements so all \nAmericans may enjoy the bounty of Alaskan waters. Their work is vital \nto the economies of numerous communities in our State.\n\n[[Page S979]]\n\n  While Alaskans have fishing in their blood, skyrocketing costs have \nmade it increasingly difficult for these hard-working men and women to \nearn a living. One of the major challenges our commercial fishermen \nface is obtaining affordable healthcare.\n  The problem is not unique to my State. Lack of health coverage is a \ndilemma for fishermen in other coastal States. Surveys conducted in \ndifferent parts of the country show fishing families are significantly \nmore likely to be uninsured than other Americans.\n  The commercial fishing industry produces billions of dollars for the \nU.S. economy each year. Despite their contributions, the seasonal and \ndangerous nature of their profession bars many commercial fishermen \nfrom obtaining health insurance; most work for themselves or for small \nemployers. Fishermen are forced to pay high premiums and deductibles, \nwhich can effectively put health insurance out of reach.\n  In my State, fishermen face additional complications when looking for \naffordable health insurance. A study by the United Fishermen of Alaska \nfound that our fishermen are more likely to work and live in \ncommunities without a hospital. Also, fewer private insurance companies \noffer individual or small business medical coverage in Alaska than in \nother States. And, most fishermen simply cannot afford the rates \ncharged by these providers.\n  That lack of basic health services impacts everyone in our fishing \nfleet, from our older fishermen, who may be most in need of health \ncoverage, to the younger generation of fishermen, who find the lack of \naffordable healthcare a barrier to entering the profession.\n  As one fisherman from Juneau put it:\n\n       I've applied with two different major health insurance \n     providers, and both have declined me coverage because of my \n     occupation . . . living and working without health insurance \n     is like living on borrowed time. I constantly feel I am \n     pushing my luck, and a single illness or injury could mean \n     bankruptcy for me.\n\n  With the high cost of individual health insurance and the lack of \nproximity to healthcare facilities in Alaska families are less likely \nto seek preventive care, resulting in medical emergencies that could \nhave been avoided. When uninsured fishermen end up in emergency rooms \nwith serious diseases and injuries, taxpayers often absorb the costs.\n  Our bill is inspired by the successful fishermen's healthcare plan \nadopted by Senator Kennedy's home State of Massachusetts, which has \nproven that health insurance can be made affordable for fishing \nfamilies. This legislation will establish a grant program to help \nStates and fishing organizations create and administer group health \ninsurance programs for fishermen and fishing families.\n  Americans are consuming more and more seafood as they discover its \ngreat taste and considerable health benefits. We cannot forget where \nthese fish come from. They come from the labor of men and women working \nup and down the coasts of this country, many struggling to earn a \nliving and preserve a tradition that has spanned generations.\n  This measure would help put affordable medical care within their \nreach. I encourage my fellow Senators to support the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \n        Alexander, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \n        Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burr, Mr. Byrd, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n        Cardin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coburn, Mr. \n        Coleman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Craig, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. \n        Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \n        Martinez, Mr. McCain, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Menendez, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Obama, Mr. Pryor, Mr. \n        Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \n        Sununu, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 2631. A bill to award a congressional gold medal to Daw Aung San \nSuu Kyi in recognition of her courageous and unwavering commitment to \npeace, nonviolence, human rights, and democracy in Burma; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator McConnell, to introduce the Aung San Suu Kyi \nCongressional Gold Medal Act of 2008.\n  We are proud to be joined by 73 of our colleagues in sponsoring this \nmeasure to award the Congressional Gold Medal to a woman who has \ninspired us all with her commitment to nonviolence, democracy, human \nrights, and the rule of law for the people of Burma. On December 17, \n2007, the House voted 400-0 to award Suu Kyi this honor and we urge the \nSenate to promptly follow suit.\n  Last September we witnessed the largest democratic demonstrations in \nBurma in almost 20 years. Tens of thousands of Burmese citizens took to \nthe streets in peaceful demonstrations to speak out against the \ncountry's oppressive military regime, and to cry out for democracy.\n  I watched these courageous people with a deep sense of admiration and \nrespect.\n  Led by respected Buddhist monks, the people of the ``Saffron \nRevolution'' called on the military junta to release all political \nprisoners, including Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, and \nengage in a true dialogue on national reconciliation. Yet, as it had in \nthe past, the military junta responded to the recent peaceful protests \nwith violence and bloodshed. Soldiers used brutal force to break up the \nprotests, beating and sometimes killing innocent civilians.\n  No amount of force, however, can crush the spirit of Aung San Suu Kyi \nand her peaceful quest for democracy and human rights. Indeed, she is a \nwoman of unrivaled courage. In the face of threats, intimidation, \nharassment, and an assassination attempt, she has never wavered from \nher principles and continues to support national reconciliation for all \nthe people of Burma.\n  By introducing this legislation, we seek not only to honor a \nremarkable woman who embodies the values and standards of the \nCongressional Gold Medal, but also to raise our voices once again in \nsupport of her cause which is our cause: a free and democratic Burma.\n  By now, her story is well known. Aung San Suu Kyi was born on June \n19, 1945, in Rangoon to Aung San, commander of the Burma Independence \nArmy, and Ma Khin Kyi. In August 1988, Suu Kyi, in her first political \naction, sent an open letter to the military-controlled government, \nasking for free, open and multi-party elections. The following month, \nshe founded the National League for Democracy, which remains dedicated \nto a policy of nonviolence and civil disobedience. Suu Kyi was named \nits general-secretary.\n  Recognizing the threat Suu Kyi posted to their grip on power, the \nBurmese junta had her placed under house arrest and held without \ncharges or trial. Yet, despite the best efforts of the military junta \nto suppress the growing democratic movement, in 1990 the National \nLeague for Democracy won 82 percent of the seats in parliamentary \nelections. But the junta annulled the election results and refused to \nrelease Suu Kyi.\n  Since then, the Burmese regime--now called the State Peace and \nDevelopment Council--has refused to engage in a national dialogue with \nSuu Kyi and the democratic opposition, and intensified its campaign of \noppression and abuse. In 2003, pro-government thugs attempted to \nassassinate Su Kyi and other members of the National League for \nDemocracy as they rode in a motorcade in the northern city of Depayin.\n  Last May, the military junta renewed her house arrest for another \nyear. In fact, for most of the past 18 years, she has remained \nimprisoned or under house arrest, alone without\n\n[[Page S980]]\n\nminimal contact with the outside world.\n  Yet, as in 1990, the regime has once again failed to stamp out Suu \nKyi's message of democracy, human rights, non-violence and the rule of \nlaw. She continues to inspire not only the people of Burma but the \nentire world. Indeed, Suu Kyi's commitment to freedom and democracy has \nbeen widely recognized.\n  In 1990, Suu Kyi was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of \nThought by the European Parliament. The prize honors efforts on behalf \nof human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in opposition to \ninjustice and oppression. It is named for the late Andrei Sakharov, the \nSoviet dissident and Nobel Peace Prize winner.\n  In 1991, Suu Kyi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her commitment \nto nonviolence and support for freedom and democracy for Burma. She was \nnot allowed to attend the ceremony. In its recommendation, the Nobel \nCommittee wrote:\n\n       In the good fight for peace and reconciliation, we are \n     dependent on persons who set examples, persons who can \n     symbolize what we are seeking and mobilize the best in us. \n     Aung San Suu Kyi is just such a person. She unites deep \n     commitment and tenacity with a vision in which the end and \n     the means form a single unit. Its most important elements \n     are: democracy, respect for human rights, reconciliation \n     between groups, non-violence, and personal and collective \n     discipline.\n\n  Suu Kyi donated her $1.3 million in prize money to establish a health \nand education fund for Burma. She is the world's only imprisoned Nobel \nPeace Prize recipient.\n  In 2000, Suu Kyi was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the \nNation's highest civilian award, by President Bill Clinton.\n  Last year, 45 U.S. Senators signed a letter to United Nations \nSecretary General Ban ki-Moon urging him to get personally involved in \npressing for Suu Kyi's release.\n  In letter addressed to the State Peace and Development Council, a \ndistinguished group of 59 former heads of state--including former \nFilipino president Corazon Aquino, former Czech president Vaclav Havel, \nformer British prime minister John Major and former Presidents Bill \nClinton, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush--called for the regime to \nrelease Aung San Suu Kyi. They correctly noted that ``Aung San Suu Kyi \nis not calling for revolution in Burma, but rather peaceful, nonviolent \ndialogue between the military, National League for Democracy, and \nBurma's ethnic groups.''\n  It is only fitting, that Congress join this international chorus in \nsupport of Aung San Suu Kyi and award her the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I have worked hard to raise awareness about the \nsituation in Burma and pass legislation to put pressure on the military \njunta to release Suu Kyi and begin a true dialogue on national \nreconciliation. In 1997, former Senator Bill Cohen and I authored \nlegislation requiring the President to ban new U.S. investment in Burma \nif he determined that the Government of Burma had physically harmed, \nrearrested or exiled Aung San Suu Kyi or committed large-scale \nrepression or violence against the Democratic opposition. President \nClinton issued the Executive Order in 1997 and the ban remains on the \nbooks today.\n  In 2003, after the regime attempted to assassinate Aung San Suu Kyi, \nSenator McConnell and I introduced the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \nAct of 2003 which placed a complete ban on imports from Burma. It \nallowed that ban to be renewed one year at a time for up to 3 years. It \nwas signed into law and has been renewed one year at a time for each of \nthe past 4 years.\n  Last year, the women of the United States Senate came together to \nform the Women's Caucus on Burma to express our solidarity with Suu \nKyi, call for her immediate release, urge the United Nations to pass a \nbinding resolution on Burma. At our inaugural event, we were pleased to \nbe joined by First Lady Laura Bush who added her own voice to those \ncalling for peace and democracy in Burma. Our message is clear: We will \nnot remain silent, we will not stand still until Aung San Suu Kyi and \nall political prisoners are released and democratic government is \nrestored in Burma.\n  This legislation is but one small step on the path to that goal. I \nremain hopeful that the military regime will heed the will of its \npeople and the international community and we will be able to present \nAung San Suu Kyi with this honor in person.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2631\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Aung San Suu Kyi was born on June 19, 1945, in Rangoon, \n     Burma, to Aung San, commander of the Burma Independence Army, \n     and Ma Khin Kyi.\n       (2) On August 15, 1988, Ms. Suu Kyi, in her first political \n     action, sent an open letter to the military controlled \n     government asking for free, open, and multi-party elections.\n       (3) On September 24, 1988, the National League for \n     Democracy (NLD) was formed, with Ms. Suu Kyi as the general-\n     secretary, and it was, and remains, dedicated to a policy of \n     non-violence and civil disobedience.\n       (4) Ms. Suu Kyi was subsequently placed under house arrest, \n     where she remained for the next 6 years--without being \n     charged or put on trial--and has been imprisoned twice more; \n     she currently remains under house arrest.\n       (5) Despite her detention, the National League for \n     Democracy won an open election with an overwhelming 82 \n     percent of the vote--which the military junta nullified.\n       (6) While under house arrest, she has bravely refused \n     offers to leave the country to continue to promote freedom \n     and democracy in Burma.\n       (7) For her efforts on behalf of the Burmese people, she \n     has been awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in \n     1990, the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2000, and the \n     Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.\n       (8) Ms. Suu Kyi continues to fight on behalf of the Burmese \n     people, even donating her $1.3 million from her Nobel Prize \n     to establish a health and education fund for Burma.\n       (9) She is the world's only imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize \n     recipient, spending more than 12 of the past 17 years under \n     house arrest.\n       (10) Despite an assassination attempt against her life, her \n     prolonged illegal imprisonment, the constant public \n     vilification of her character, and her inability to see her \n     children or to see her husband before his death, Ms. Suu Kyi \n     remains committed to peaceful dialogue with her captors, \n     Burma's military regime, and Burma's ethnic nationalities \n     towards bringing democracy, human rights, and national \n     reconciliation to Burma.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n     behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate \n     design, to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi in recognition of her \n     courageous and unwavering commitment to peace, nonviolence, \n     human rights, and democracy in Burma.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a \n     gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions \n     to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2 under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price \n     sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n       (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this \n     Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and \n     5136 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under \n     this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORITY TO USE FUND AMOUNTS; PROCEEDS OF SALE.\n\n       (a) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to \n     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise \n     Fund such amounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs of \n     the medals struck pursuant to this Act.\n       (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of \n     duplicate bronze medals authorized under section 3 shall be \n     deposited into the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 2632. A bill to ensure that the Sex Offender Registration and \nNotification Act is applied retroactively; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today, I introduce legislation to close a \nseries of statutory loopholes setting free convicted sex offenders who \nfailed to register and notify their communities of\n\n[[Page S981]]\n\ntheir status as required by Federal law. I was outraged recently to \nlearn this was going on and I am sure you will agree that we must end \nthis injustice. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n  Under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, SORNA, \npassed as part of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of \n2006, sex of-fenders are required to register with local authorities \nand notify those authorities when they move or change jobs. However, \njudges in Michigan and Pennsylvania have freed sex offenders arrested \nfor failing to register because of doubts over whether the statute \napplies to sex offenses committed prior to SORNA's implementation. A \nMissouri judge freed a noncomplying sex offender questioning whether \nprovisions extending Federal jurisdiction operated retroactively.\n  In the Missouri case, a Federal judge released convicted sex-offender \nTerry L. Rich after his arrest for failure to register as a sex \noffender upon moving to Kansas City 20 months ago. Mr. Rich arrived \nafter a prison stint in Iowa for failing to register there based on his \nprevious convictions for felony sexual abuse of a child, kidnaping, \nindecency, child molestation and felony sexual battery of a young girl. \nSORNA extends Federal jurisdiction to State sex offenders by applying \nto those who ``travel'' in interstate commerce, and Mr. Rich seemed to \nqualify by moving from Iowa to Missouri in March 2006. However, the \njudge ruled that since Mr. Rich ``traveled'' prior to SORNA's enactment \nin July 2006, he was not covered by the law's present tense ``travel'' \nrequirement.\n  The Pennsylvania court freed persons hiding convictions of sexual \nassault, rape, statutory rape, indecent assault and corruption of the \nmorals of a 6-year-old girl. The Michigan court freed a sex offender \nwho failed to register after convictions of first-degree rape and \nsodomy.\n  The bill I propose closes the loopholes cited by the Missouri, \nMichigan, and Pennsylvania courts to ensure that SORNA's registration \nrequirement applies to sex offenders irrespective of the date of their \noffense or date of interstate travel. These are simple fixes to the \ncode, but vital to ensure that no more convicted sex offenders can hide \nin our neighborhoods.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2636.

Mr. President, I am proud to introduce a resolution today \nhonoring the men and women known as ``cowboys.'' My late colleague, \nSenator Craig Thomas began the tradition of introducing a Senate \nresolution designating the fourth Saturday of July as the National Day \nof the Cowboy. I am so proud to carry on that tradition. The national \nday celebrates the history of cowboys in America and recognizes the \nimportant work today's cowboys are doing in the United States. The \ncowboy spirit is about honesty, integrity, courage, and patriotism, and \ncowboys are models of strong character, sound family values, and good \ncommon sense.\n  Cowboys were some of the first men and women to settle in the \nAmerican West, and they continue to make important contributions to our \neconomy, Western culture and my home State of Wyoming today. This \nyear's resolution designates July 26, 2008, as the National Day of the \nCowboy.

Mr. President, I seek recognition to congratulate the \nfirm of Rawle and Henderson LLP on its 225th anniversary, and on being \nrecognized as the oldest law firm in continuous practice in the U.S.\n  Five generations of the Rawle family have established and maintained \na firm that has expanded to over a hundred attorneys in eight offices \nand five States. Rawle and Henderson attorneys have served as elected \nofficials in both the civic and legal community throughout the past 225 \nyears, and have served as appointed and elected judges on the Federal \nand State benches.\n  Inspired by Benjamin Franklin's accomplishments, William Rawle \nfounded his practice in Philadelphia in 1783. His two sons followed \ntheir father's example, joining the practice in 1810. Joseph W. \nHenderson, a graduate of Harvard Law School, joined the firm in 1917, \nexpanding the firm's reputation for legal excellence, and arguing \nnumerous landmark cases before the Supreme Court. The Rawle and \nHenderson firm continues to prosper in 2008, employing a\n\n[[Page S985]]\n\nracially and socioeconomically diverse staff.\n  The exceptional individuals who have founded and expanded the Rawle \nand Henderson firm into the prestigious organization it is today should \nbe honored for their achievements. Their service has greatly benefited \nthe civic and legal community of Pennsylvania and the U.S. I am \nconfident that the Rawle and Henderson firm will continue to match \ntheir predecessors' commendable accomplishments for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/13/senate-section/article/S985-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 452--COMMEMORATING THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n NAMING OF PITTSBURGH AS THE CULMINATION OF THE FORBES CAMPAIGN ACROSS \n PENNSYLVANIA AND THE SIGNIFICANCE THIS EVENT PLAYED IN THE MAKING OF \n   AMERICA, IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE CONTINENT, AND IN SPREADING THE \n          IDEALS OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Casey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5270, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5270) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to extend the funding and expenditure authority of the \n     Airport and Airway Trust Fund, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise today to support a short-\nterm extension of the Federal Aviation Administration's contract \nauthority and its collection and expenditure authority through to June \n30, 2008. Because of the urgent need to extend the current aviation \ntaxes and related budget provisions, I am supporting this legislation.\n  But I am becoming convinced that Congress cannot pass S. 1300, the \nAviation Investment and Modernization Act, authored by then-Senator \nLott and myself. I believe that Congress should pass a long-term \nextension of the existing aviation taxes in order to give the FAA the \nfunding stability it needs while Congress moves forward with a \ncomprehensive review of how the agency is funded. I cannot support the \ncurrent funding regime, as it will not provide the agency with the \nresources it needs to build the Next Generation Air Traffic Control \nSystem. In lieu of a long-term extension, I would have preferred an \nextension until the end of this fiscal year, September 30, 2008, as it \nwould have given the FAA and our Nation's airports a greater degree of \nreassurance that they will receive the full $3.5 billion in airport \nfunding that Congress approved last year.\n  The short-term extension before us today is not only crucial to the \nongoing functioning of the FAA, it is necessary because without it the \nagency faces a potential crisis. Without adopting this legislation, the \nFAA would not be able to pay 4,000 employees after February 29, 2008. \nAnd that is an unacceptable action. The last thing the agency needs \nright now is to endure a potentially debilitating staffing crisis. To \npreserve these jobs this short-term extension must be passed today.\n  This country's aviation system is the safest in the world. However, \nin remaining vigilant to maintain this standard we must ensure the FAA \nhas the resources to continue its efforts in modernizing our air \ntraffic control system and in updating the more antiquated parts of our \naviation infrastructure. The passing of this extension today will allow \nthese vital investments to continue.\n  I look forward to working with my friend and distinguished colleague, \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison, and members of the Senate's Finance and\n\n[[Page S991]]\n\nCommerce Committees in making sure the FAA has the resources and tools \nit needs to continue making our aviation system the safest in the \nworld. It is crucial we work together to provide the FAA with the \ncertainty it needs in these challenging times for the aviation sector. \nThis will not only benefit the FAA but the industry generally and the \nmany millions of Americans it serves each year.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues \nto vote for a short-term extension of FAA collection, expenditure \nauthority, and Airport Improvement Program, or AIP, contract authority \nthrough June 30, 2008.\n  The previous extension was scheduled to expire on February 29, 2008. \nShort of congressional action, hundreds of airports across the Nation \nwere at risk of losing an entire construction season and hindering much \nneeded improvements to our aviation system. In addition, the FAA was at \nrisk of not being able to fund this year's planned critical investments \nin the Next Generation Air Traffic Control System, NEXTGEN. Now, \nbecause of our efforts, those improvements can continue as planned.\n  While I am pleased with our work today, I am disappointed we could \nnot provide more stability in the system by completing a longer term \nextension through September 30, 2008, which is the end of the fiscal \nyear.\n  As legislators, it is our responsibility to create stability and \npredictability in our infrastructure system. We cannot allow our lack \nof action to disturb the modernization efforts and the flow of funds to \nour aviation system.\n  Thankfully, the extension we passed today will provide immediate \nfunding and spending authority as well as a valuable cushion for the \nSenate to work on the overarching FAA reauthorization bill.\n  I am looking forward to working with my friend and distinguished \ncolleague Senator Jay Rockefeller to complete a multi-year FAA \nreauthorization bill. We have several challenges ahead of us, and we \nwill attempt to come together in a bipartisan way to meet those \nchallenges. The extension we passed today is just the first step in \nwhat will be a very important year for aviation policy.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 5270) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/02/13/senate-section/article/S991-1", "month": "02", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMEMORATING THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NAMING OF PITTSBURGH\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.
