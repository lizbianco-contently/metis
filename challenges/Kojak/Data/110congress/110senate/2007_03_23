Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. Con. Res. 21, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 21) setting forth the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for the \n     fiscal year 2008 and including the appropriate budgetary \n     levels for fiscal years 2007 and 2009 through 2012.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Kyl/Thune amendment No. 583, to reform the death tax by \n     setting the exemption at $5 million per estate, indexed for \n     inflation, and the top death tax rate at no more than 35 \n     percent beginning in 2010, to avoid subjecting an estimated \n     119,200 families, family businesses, and family farms to the \n     death tax each and every year, to promote continued economic \n     growth and job creation, and to make the enhanced teacher \n     deduction permanent.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 30 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled between \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first, I thank the Chaplain for the most \nexcellent prayer that he offered today. I think it set the right tone \nfor today's discussions. I hope very much that while we may disagree \nstrenuously, we can do so in a civil way. I thank especially the \nranking member, Senator Gregg, for the way he has conducted this debate \non the other side throughout. As is always the case with him, it has \nbeen thoroughly professional. It has set an excellent tone. We have \nvigorous disagreements on policy from time to time, but there are many \nareas where we actually agree. With him in leadership, it has always \nbeen done in a professional way. We especially appreciate the \ncooperation from all of our colleagues and especially from the ranking \nmember and his outstanding staff.\n  The budget, as it stands at this moment, takes us in a new direction. \nIt takes us back to fiscal responsibility. It takes us toward a \nbalanced budget by 2012. Here is where the budget stands as of the \nlatest numbers that we have after action last night. Every year of the \n5-year budget the deficits will be reduced until we are in balance in \n2012, albeit just barely.\n  The next chart. The debt under the budget resolution, the gross debt \nof the United States as a percentage of GDP, will finally start to head \ndown instead of increasing year after year after year.\n\n[[Page S3660]]\n\nUnder this budget resolution, the gross debt of the United States as a \nshare of GDP will start going down in 2009. We will see a slight \nreduction in 2010. It is somewhat improved, in terms of reduction, in \n2011 and 2012.\n  Spending under this budget resolution is going down as a share of \ngross domestic product--from 20.5 percent in 2008 down to 18.8 percent \nin 2012. So we have spending going in the right direction.\n  The budget resolution is only slightly above baseline for nondefense \ndiscretionary funding. The baseline is $438.8 billion. The spending in \nthe 2008 budget resolution is $445 billion, a 1.4-percent difference. \nThat is spending in dollar terms. I was talking about spending \npreviously as a share of GDP. The previous chart showed spending as a \nshare of GDP actually going down.\n\n  We do have a number of very significant priorities addressed in this \nbudget. First and foremost is children's health care. We have up to $50 \nbillion allocated over 5 years for children's health care to make \npossible the coverage for every child who would be eligible in the \ncountry. That is 25 times as much as in the President's budget for that \nsame period.\n  We have also improved on the President's education numbers by 2008. \nIn 2008, the budget resolution provides $62.3 billion compared to the \nPresident's budget for education of $56.2 billion for that year.\n  Another key priority is veterans health care. I am especially proud \nof what we have done. We have matched, or exceeded, the independent \nbudget prepared by the Nation's veterans organizations. We have matched \nor exceeded it in every single category except construction, where the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee tells us they could not spend the amount of \nmoney in the independent budget because they simply could not let the \ncontracts in time. In comparison to the President, we are at $43.1 \nbillion for veterans funded, compared to the President's number of \n$39.6 billion.\n  On the alternative minimum tax, the old millionaires' tax that is \nrapidly becoming a middle-class tax trap, we prevent the number of \npeople being swept up into the AMT from increasing from 3.8 million \nlast year. If we didn't take action, that would increase to over 23 \nmillion in 2007. We prevent that increase from 3.8 million to over 23 \nmillion.\n  Similarly, in 2008, we prevent an increase to over 25 million \npeople--largely the middle class--and to the upper side of the middle \nclass from being caught up in the alternative minimum tax. That, by the \nway, is completely offset. Key priorities are the child health and \nfamily tax relief amendment. There is $15 billion in the budget \nresolution itself for children's health care. There is up to $35 \nbillion in a deficit-neutral reserve fund. We also now in the \nresolution, after the Baucus amendment, extend middle-class tax relief.\n  We fully provide for marriage penalty tax relief, child tax credit, \nand the 10-percent bracket. We also provide for estate tax reform. \nMembers will recall that we have this anomalous situation where we are \ngoing to go from $3.5 million of exemption per person under the estate \ntax in 2009--in 2011 it goes back to a million. We prevent that from \noccurring. So under the budget resolution, a couple could shield $7 \nmillion in assets without paying a penny of tax, and it is indexed for \ninflation.\n  The revenues in this resolution now, compared to the President's, are \ndepicted on this chart. The green line is our revenues; the red line is \nthe President's revenues. There is a difference of 1.8 percent now.\n  Seen in a different way, if you look back at what the President \ninitially proposed for revenue, the President proposed $14.826 trillion \nof revenue. We have in this resolution almost the identical amount; we \nhave $14.827 trillion.\n  So let me make clear that there is almost no difference in the \nrevenue in this proposal compared to what the President initially \nproposed. Where would we get that slight difference in revenue? In the \nfirst place, there is no tax increase. We don't propose any tax \nincrease in this budget resolution at all. I read some of the stories \nsaying we have all these tax increases. We do not.\n  We do believe more revenue can be gained. The first place to go is \nthe tax gap. That is the difference between what is owed and what is \npaid. In 2001 alone, the Internal Revenue Service tells us the tax gap \nwas $345 billion.\n  Also, offshore tax havens. I have shown this picture many times. \nThere is a five-story building in the Cayman Islands that is the home \nto 12,748 companies. Mr. President, this is a tax dodge. There are not \nover 12,000 companies doing business out of this building. They are \ndoing monkey business out of this building. They are engaged in a \nmassive tax evasion. This is the kind of thing we ought to shut down.\n  Another committee of Congress has told us that there is $100 billion \na year--over $500 billion over 5 years--being lost to the U.S. Treasury \nto these offshore tax haven scams. We suggest cutting that off, \nstopping it, recovering that revenue. In fact, that would more than \ncover, by a substantial amount, the revenue difference between us and \nwhat is in the President's proposal.\n  Here is another example. This is a picture of a sewer system in \nEurope. What does a sewer system in Europe have to do with the budget \nof the United States? Unfortunately, a lot because wealthy investors \nand companies bought this sewer system in Europe, depreciated it on the \nbooks in the United States to reduce their tax in America, and then \nthey leased the sewer system back to the European city that built it in \nthe first place.\n  There are hundreds of billions of dollars involved in these tax \nscams. It is growing, and it is a cancer that has to be stopped.\n  This budget resolution also makes a beginning at addressing our long-\nterm fiscal challenges. We have $15 billion in Medicare savings. We \nhave major program initiatives to crack down on waste, fraud, and \nabuse. We have a requirement that tax cuts and new mandatory spending \nbe paid for with a tough pay-go provision. We have a long-term deficit \nincrease point of order. We have a ``save Social Security first'' point \nof order. We have a health information technology reserve fund. The \nRand Corporation told us that alone could save $81 billion a year.\n  Finally, we have a comparative effectiveness reserve fund so that we \ngo out and look at what are the most effective technologies and \ntreatments in the medical area that work in one part of the country but \nhave not yet been applied elsewhere. Health experts tell us massive \nsavings could come from that initiative.\n  Let me end as I began. This budget resolution takes us in a new \ndirection, a better direction. This is a budget resolution which \nrestores fiscal discipline. It will balance the books by 2012; it will \nmeet the high-priority needs of the United States; it fully funds the \nPresident's defense request and his request for war costs; it has major \ntax reductions for those in the middle class so that we assure that \nmiddle-class tax breaks continue. It also provides for estate tax \nreform and, at the same time, begins to address the long-term fiscal \nchallenges facing our Nation.\n  I don't assert that this is a perfect budget. If I had a totally free \nhand, I am certain it would be different. But at the end of the day, \nthe test for us is, can we write a budget for our country? In 3 of the \nlast 5 years, there has not been a budget for the United States of \nAmerica. Let me repeat that. In 3 of the last 5 years, there has not \nbeen a budget for the United States. It is our obligation and our \nresponsibility to put a budget in place to begin the difficult task of \nbalancing the books while meeting the priority needs of our Nation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I begin by returning the courtesies of the \nchairman and doing it with sincerity. The chairman and his staff have \nbeen gracious and fair with us and, obviously, they are always \nprofessional. It is a pleasure to work with him and his staff.\n  We do, obviously, have philosophical differences, but hopefully it is \na reflection of how this place should work, which is we do it \nprofessionally, we don't game each other, we don't yell at each other--\nsometimes we yell at each other--we basically air our views, make our \npoints, go to our votes, and allow everybody to get their 2 cents in. \nThat is the way this place should work, and it works because the \nchairman is courteous enough to allow us to accomplish that. I thank \nhim for that and his\n\n[[Page S3661]]\n\nstaff. They have done a great job here, as well as mine.\n  I do agree the country needs a budget. That is critical. But \nregrettably, the budget he has brought forward is not a good budget for \nthis country. It is a budget that is inconsistent in many areas, but at \nits essence is the fact that it spends a lot more money, grows the size \nof the Government, increases taxes a great deal, increases the debt a \ngreat deal and, regrettably, does not address the most essential issue \nwe face today, which is the fiscal meltdown this country is going to \nface when we put on our children the cost of the Government as we head \ninto the retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  This chart reflects that situation. It is a little outdated because \nit was done earlier, and we don't have a chart machine like the \nchairman, but it essentially captures the concept that this budget has \n$700 billion in tax increases. That is the one number which is wrong on \nthis chart because of the Baucus amendment being adopted--$700 billion \nof tax increases. That is the largest tax increase in the history of \nthe country. There is $144 billion minimum in nondefense discretionary \nspending, $2 trillion of new debt, and it does nothing in the \nentitlement area.\n  The inconsistencies in this budget are palpable. In the tax area, for \nexample, this budget, as I mentioned, will be the largest tax increase \nin the history of the country and will take us down the road toward \nwhat is essentially a European tax system where essentially we are \ngoing to be looking at a total tax burden on the American people that \nwill head toward the tax burden of the nation of France. When this \nbudget reaches its end, it will be about a 19-percent to 19.5-percent \ntax burden on the American people. Historically, the Federal Government \ntax burden has been about 18.2 percent. That is a huge increase.\n  The chairman holds up these charts which show the lines are very \nclose between the President's tax increases and his tax increases. But \nhis tax increases, as he says, recalculated now are about 2 percent \nhigher than the President. Two percent is real money when you are \ntalking a base of $3 trillion. In fact, 2 percent represents \napproximately a little more than a quarter of a trillion dollars in new \ntaxes above what the President would have suggested.\n  Those are huge tax increases which the American people are going to \nhave to bear. The concept that keeps being put out here, that these are \nnot going to be tax increases, that they are going to be found behind a \ncurtain somewhere, is simply not defensible. It doesn't pass what I \ncall the duck test. It is ducking the issue, basically. But it doesn't \npass the duck test; that is, if it looks like a duck, walks like a \nduck, and talks like a duck, it must be a duck. When you put $700 \nbillion of new taxes into a budget, you are talking about raising taxes \ndramatically, you are talking about increasing taxes on working \nAmericans dramatically, and that is what this budget does.\n  In the pay-go area, this budget is also totally inconsistent. It says \nwe are for pay-go. In fact, pay-go has become a solemn oath of the \nother side of the aisle. I read a New York Times editorial the other \nday that says pay-go is wonderful. Somebody tell the New York Times \nthat the Democratic leadership, under this budget, has exempted most of \ntheir favorite programs from pay-go. They have pay-go for programs that \nmaybe the Republican side of the aisle would support, such as not \nallowing taxes to increase--yes, they apply pay-go to that issue. But \nwhen they have their programs they think are important, they don't \napply pay-go to it. In fact, they specifically exempt it. For example, \nthe agriculture language is exempted from pay-go. It looks as if SCHIP \nmay be exempted from pay-go. The Baucus tax proposal which came to the \nfloor was exempted from pay-go. The AMT amount in this bill is exempted \nfrom pay-go. The simple fact is, pay-go has become Swiss cheese-go \nunder this bill. There is no relevance at all because it is an \narbitrary effort to keep one side from doing what they philosophically \nagree with while the other side ignores it or basically overrules it \nfor what they like to do.\n  The argument is that they haven't increased spending that much. Well, \n$144 billion in nondefense discretionary spending is a lot of money \nwhen you put it on top of the base. That is a big number. At least in \nNew Hampshire it is a big number. I mean, $144 billion would run the \nState of New Hampshire for probably 20 years. Yet they claim it is not \na big number.\n  Then there is no talk again of the inconsistency in this, there is no \ntalk about the fact that there are over 27 reserve funds representing a \n$200 billion cost in new programs should they be instituted. That is a \ngrowth of the Government--which, I am sure, not all of those will be \ninstituted, but the game plan is there to institute them--$200 billion \nof potential expansion in the size of the Government.\n  They take the position that they have added other programs by using \nthe 920 account. There was an interesting debate yesterday where the \nchairman of the committee said to the Senator from Minnesota: We can't \nuse 920 to address the extension of renewable tax credits relative to \nwind energy and issues such as that because that would cut veterans and \nit would cut health care and education. But he failed to mention to the \nSenator from Minnesota that there was already about $38 billion of the \n920 account in here. Mr. President, 920 is a euphemism for, well, we \nreally don't know how we are going to pay for this, so we are going to \nuse the 920 account, and that is allegedly a cut across the board. So \nthere is another $40 billion of spending in this bill that probably, in \nthe end, is going to occur and not get paid for.\n  There are huge expenditures, huge expansion in the size of the \nGovernment, tremendous growth in the size of the Government in this \nbill.\n  Then we have entitlement accounts. The chairman of the committee \ncontinues to allege he has $15 billion in entitlement savings in this \nbill. That is an impossible statement to make unless you are only \nwilling to look at one part of the bill because in the other section of \nthe bill, they spend $50 billion in new entitlement programs. So you \ncan't claim you are saving money when you are expanding entitlement \nprograms and not net the two out. It is totally inconsistent.\n  This bill expands entitlement spending. It does not restrict \nentitlement growth. Ironically, it does it in a way that makes those \nprograms probably not subject to pay-go when they are expanded.\n  This is the biggest failure of this bill. The spending is pretty bad \nand the taxes have improved a little, but basically this is the biggest \nfailure of this bill, the failure to address what the chairman has \ntalked about--I agree with his discussions, I agree with his hearings--\nhas talked about the most severe problem we face as a nation; that is, \nthe fact that when this baby boom generation retires, this Government \nbecomes unaffordable for our children. The cost of three major \nentitlement programs--Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--will \nactually exceed the total Federal Government cost as a percentage of \ngross national product by 2025, and we will have nothing available to \ndo anything else or, alternatively, will have to tax our children into \noblivion so they cannot enjoy a quality lifestyle. Yet this bill does \nnothing on that.\n  We offered a reasonable amendment on this subject. We suggested that \npeople earning more than $80,000 as individuals and $160,000 jointly \nshould not be subsidized in their drug benefit by people working in \nrestaurants across this country or working at gas stations or working \non assembly lines, and it was rejected by the other side of the aisle.\n  We suggested that hospitals and provider groups that are getting an \ninflated payment under the COLA by about 1.2 percent should have that \ninflated COLA payment reduced by about half. They will still be getting \nan extra half a percent, six-tenths of a percent in benefits, and that \nwas rejected.\n  If either of those had been accepted, we would have moved toward some \nsemblance of getting under control this outyear instability in our \nMedicare fund. Those two amendments would have done more to make \nMedicare solvent than anything else we could do around here and thus \nmake it available to seniors when they retire and have our children \nable to afford it. But that was rejected. There was no action at all in \nthat area.\n  The tax issue--have to come back to this issue. The idea that there \nis not a\n\n[[Page S3662]]\n\ntax increase in this bill is so patently absurd on its face that the \nfirst amendment out of the box offered by the Democratic leadership was \nto extend the tax cuts for certain tax cuts they felt they didn't want \nto have go up, and the reverse of that, of course, is they are willing \nto let the other tax cuts go up. That is obvious. That is just A \nfollows B or 1 and 1 makes 2. So there is no question they are taxing.\n  This idea that there is a comparison between the President's numbers \nand their numbers in tax increases, again is a total inconsistency. \nThey use OMB to score the President's numbers and they use CBO to score \ntheir numbers. But if we score it apples to apples and oranges to \noranges, we see the difference is significant. This was calculated \nbefore the Baucus amendment was adjusted, so these would be adjusted \ndown somewhat, but the differences are still significant, somewhere in \nthe range of $250 billion of difference if we compare apples to apples \nand oranges to oranges.\n  When we peel everything away from this bill--I understand we are \ngoing to start voting at 9:30--all these inconsistencies, the fact that \nthey don't use pay-go for programs they like but they do apply to \npositions which the Republicans might take, the fact that the tax \nincrease in this budget is the largest in history and yet they claim \nthere is no tax increase, the fact that the spending goes up \ndramatically and they claim spending doesn't go up, the fact that there \nis virtually--there are no savings in entitlements on a net basis and \nthere is actually significant aggravation of the cost of entitlements \nfor our children in this bill as a result of new programs which they \nanticipate, this bill is going to do significant damage to our economy, \nand it is going to grow the Government and make us larger.\n  It comes down to a very simple fact, really, when we take everything \naway: This bill essentially is a classic Democratic tax-and-spend bill. \nThat is all it is. Bigger taxes, bigger spending, bigger debt, larger \nGovernment, and as a practical matter, it is not going to be a \nconstructive event for us as a nation. So I hope my colleagues, when we \nget to final passage, will vote against it. We are going to have a lot \nof votes here, but in the end, what is going to pass, if this bill \npasses, is your classic tax-and-spend bill.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe we are supposed to start voting at this \ntime.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I say the Senator now has hurt my \nfeelings. Would the Senator's staff put up the caveman chart? That now \nhas hurt my feelings. I don't know how I am going to be able to get \nthrough the day after the caveman chart. I don't think that is even a \ngood likeness of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think this is actually the likeness of somebody from \nNevada.\n  Mr. CONRAD. OK.\n  Mr. President, I think we now need to establish the order of the \nvotes, or at least the first several votes, and for that purpose, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 622\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask \nthat it be reported.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 622.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: Point of order against using reconciliation to create new \n   mandatory programs and 20% limitation on spending reconciliation)\n\n     SEC.  . POINT OF ORDER--20% LIMIT ON NEW DIRECT SPENDING IN \n                   RECONCILIATION LEGISLATION.\n\n       (a)(1) In the Senate, it shall not be in order to consider \n     any reconciliation bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, \n     or any conference report on, or an amendment between the \n     Houses in relation to, a reconciliation bill pursuant to \n     section 310 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, that \n     produces an increase in outlays, if--\n       (A) the effect of all the provisions in the jurisdiction of \n     any committee is to create gross new direct spending that \n     exceeds 20% of the total savings instruction to the \n     committee; or\n       (B) the effect of the adoption of an amendment would result \n     in gross new direct spending that exceeds 20% of the total \n     savings instruction to the committee.\n       (2)(A) A point of order under paragraph (1) may be raised \n     by a Senator as provided in section 313( e) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n       (B) Paragraph (1) may be waived or suspended only by an \n     affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen \n     and sworn. An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members \n     of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to \n     sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of \n     order raised under paragraph (1).\n       (C) If a point of order is sustained under paragraph (1) \n     against a conference report in the Senate, the report shall \n     be disposed of as provided in section 313(d) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe accepted.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will not object. This, frankly, is a \ncomplicated amendment. I am not sure I fully understand all the \nimplications or ramifications of it, but the basic notion that we try \nto make certain that reconciliation is used for deficit reduction is \none I embrace and, in fact, one that is in the budget resolution before \nus.\n  We have a requirement in this budget resolution that reconciliation \nonly be used for deficit reduction. The amendment of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire is an attempt to send that signal even more clearly, if I \nunderstand it correctly, and the Senator can correct me if I \nmisinterpret it. That is my interpretation, and on that basis I would \naccept the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from North Dakota the \npurpose of this amendment is to make it absolutely clear we do not make \nreconciliation a stalking-horse to spend money. You have to use it to \nreduce the deficit.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Maybe we should explain what the term means. \nReconciliation is a special process here in the Senate that gets around \nthe regular order. It creates a superhighway to pass something. \nReconciliation was designed and implemented to permit a fast-track \nbasis for reducing deficits. Unfortunately, it can be abused and it has \nbeen abused in the past and used to actually increase deficits. That \nwas never the intention.\n  We have prevented that from occurring in the budget resolution. So \nthis is an attempt to prevent something that would have minimal deficit \nreduction from being used as a stalking-horse for a significant \nexpansion of spending.\n  On that basis, I accept the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the amendment is \nadopted.\n  The amendment (No. 622) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas has an \namendment, but do we have an order that indicates on every amendment \nthat there be 2 minutes evenly divided and that there be no second \ndegrees?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The order provides that once voting \nbegins, there is 2 minutes between each amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And do we have an agreement that there be no second \ndegrees, but that we would reserve the right, based on the managers' \ndecision, to have side-by-sides in any case where that is required? Do \nwe have that as an order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The order is not for second \ndegrees.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both those \nprovisions be in order, that we have 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on a vote, that there be no second degrees, that at the \ndiscretion of the managers there be the opportunity for side-by-sides, \nand that we order rollcall votes at this juncture on all those votes \nthat are presented.\n\n[[Page S3663]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 601\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I believe I am limited to 1 minute; is that \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is the Senator offering an \namendment?\n  Mr. PRYOR. Yes, I offer amendment No. 601.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor], for himself, and Mr. \n     Nelson of Florida, proposes an amendment numbered 601.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund to provide additional training \n   for physicians and attract more physicians in States that face a \n                  shortage of physicians in training)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESERVE FUND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRAINING FOR \n                   PHYSICIANS AND ATTRACT MORE PHYSICIANS IN \n                   STATES THAT FACE A SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS IN \n                   TRAINING.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee may revise the \n     aggregates, allocations, and other appropriate levels in this \n     resolution for a bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, \n     or conference report that provides additional training for \n     physicians and attracts more physicians in States that face a \n     shortage of physicians in training, provided that the \n     legislation would not increase the deficit over the total of \n     fiscal years 2007 through 2012.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer amendment No. 601, \nand I encourage my colleagues to look at it and vote for it.\n  The statistics are that by the year 2020 this country will be tens of \nthousands--tens of thousands--short on doctors providing the medical \ncare we need around this country. What this amendment does is it \ncreates a reserve fund that would provide additional training for \nphysicians and help to attract more physicians in States that face a \nshortage of physicians for training. It does not impose a prescriptive \nsolution but creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund the Finance \nCommittee can use to find the best way to help ensure citizens and \nStates will have the number of physicians they need over the long term.\n  I thank Senator Bill Nelson for cosponsoring the amendment, and also \nthe majority leader and the chairman of the Finance Committee for \nsupporting this amendment. This goes back to the mid 1990s, where there \nwere some caps imposed. This doesn't change that, but it allows the \nFinance Committee the room during this budget cycle to try to help \nresolve that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who requests time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest we do this amendment on a voice \nvote, and I ask unanimous consent that be the case.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 601.\n  The amendment (No. 601) was agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 581\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the bill that \ncreates a BRAC-type process for the rest of Government. I think this is \none where we have a lot of priorities that people are interested in, \nyet nobody is for wasteful spending. So here is a process where we can \nactually reduce Federal spending in low-performing areas and be able to \nget the resources to spend in places we want to. It would be a BRAC-\ntype system, which we are familiar with, and it would apply it to the \nrest of Government.\n  The commission of reports gives us one vote, up or down, without \namendment, limited timeframe. This is a way we can responsibly, both \nparties, look at ways we can fund priorities in the future without \nraising taxes, and I hope that is what we are all about.\n  We are familiar with how that BRAC process works. A lot of people \naren't particularly happy when the report comes out, but it has worked \nand eliminated some $50 billion worth of lower priority military base \nspending. I don't know anybody who runs for Federal office or public \noffice anywhere who is for wasteful Government spending. Here is a way \nof getting at it. Because the system is built to spend, this would \nactually change that system to give us a process that can be fair to \nboth sides of the aisle, and ongoing in its effort to be able to get \nthis allocation on a more appropriate basis.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides to vote for the \namendment, and I call up amendment No. 581 and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

DEFICIT REDUCTION PROTECTION POINT OF ORDER.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any appropriations bill that does not include the \n     following provision:\n       ``Sec. __.  For deposit of an additional amount into the \n     account established under section 3113(d) of title 31, United \n     States Code, to reduce the public debt $____.''.\n       (b) Enforcement.--For purposes of enforcing allocations \n     pursuant to section 302(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974, any amendment that transfers budget authority (and the \n     outlays flowing therefrom) into the debt reduction account \n     provided by subsection (a) shall be scored so that the budget \n     authority continues to count towards the section 302(b) \n     allocation (with the outlays scored at the same level as \n     scored in the original account).\n       (c) Waiver and Appeal.--In the Senate, subsection (a) may \n     be waived or suspended only by an affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of \n     the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under \n     subsection (a).\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, this amendment is called the Debt \nReduction Appropriation Account. Currently, while all of us, on both \nsides, are talking about the need to cut wasteful spending and try to \ntrim the size of Government, our appropriations process does not allow \nfor cutting spending and using it for debt reduction. This amendment \nestablishes a debt reduction account for every appropriations bill so \nif during the debate of that appropriations bill we cut something in \nit, it will not be put back in the pot to be spent on something else. \nThis account will be used for debt reduction, so if all of us have a \ndebate about an item that should not be in a bill, it will go to debt \nreduction. It is a very simple debt reduction account for every \nappropriations bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I inquire from the Senator how this works? Perhaps \nthis is something we could accept, but I need to understand how it \nworks. Could the Senator tell me, as I looked at the amendment, on the \nbottom of the first page there is a blank, at least in the copy I have. \nIt says, ``For deposit of an additional amount into the account \nestablished under section 3113(d) of title 31, United States Code, to \nreduce the public debt''--and then there is a blank. Is that filled in \non the amendment of the Senator?\n  Mr. DeMINT. No, it is not. There is no dollar amount although there \nis a dollar sign here. I will have to inquire how that ended up there, \nbut this is not a requirement to put anything in the account. This is \nan account, a designated account. If an amount of money is actually cut \nfrom an appropriations bill, then it will reduce the 302(b) amount. \nThat amount will effectively be in that account which goes to debt \nreduction.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I see.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am constrained to resist this amendment \nbecause, as I understand it, what it does is, if the Appropriations \nCommittee would cut in a certain area they would then be prevented from \nusing that money in some other perhaps higher priority area. If there \nwere savings in one area of the budget and Homeland Security needed \nadditional funding, they would not be able to transfer the money.\n  On that basis I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield for a clarification? His \nexplanation, I am afraid, is not the amendment. We can still do what we \nnormally do here, which is take money from one account and put it in \nanother. But if a Senator wishes to reduce the amount of spending in a \ngiven area and does not designate it, there is an opportunity for it to \ngo into a debt reduction account. So if we want to take money from any \naccount and shift it to military or Defense, there is no prohibition in \nthis amendment, so we do not change what we are able to do now. What we \nare not able to do now is, if we cut something and want that money to \ngo to debt reduction--this amendment would simply allow, in the future, \nfor us to designate it to an account rather than to additional \nspending.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, that is not my reading of how this \namendment would function. I wish I had more time to analyze it. This is \nthe first time I have seen it so I am in a very awkward position here. \nThat is my reading of the amendment, so I have no alternative but to \nask my colleagues to oppose it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The yeas and nays have already been ordered. I ask the \nyeas and nays be ordered on all these amendments so we don't have to go \nthrough that every time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is not appropriate to order the \nyeas and nays by unanimous consent.\n  Is there a sufficient second on the yeas and nays on the DeMint \namendment?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from North Dakota. \nI would note, in our batting order, we have Senator Bunning on Social \nSecurity, Senator Dole on IRAs for soldiers, Senator Allard on \nmandatory spending, Senator Smith on SCHIP, Senator Thomas has one on \nextraneous items in the supplemental.\n  Then we will have, potentially, Senator Grassley and--Senator \nSessions on AMT first. Then Senator Hatch is going to get in here. We \nare going to get Senator Hatch taken care of. That is the lineup on our \nside so people have some type of idea.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 621\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that amendment No. 621 at the desk be called \nup for immediate consideration. I have sent a copy of the amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 621.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a deficit-neutral reserve fund for a repeal of \n    the 1993 increase in the income tax on Social Security Benefits)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR REPEAL OF THE 1993 \n                   INCREASE IN THE INCOME TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   BENEFITS.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the allocations, aggregates, and other levels in this \n     resolution by the amounts provided by a bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     would repeal the 1993 increase in the income tax on Social \n     Security benefits, provided that such legislation would not \n     increase the deficit over the total of the period of fiscal \n     years 2007 through 2012.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, my amendment would repeal an unfair tax \nthat affects 15 million seniors. I have brought this issue before the \nChamber before, so it should be familiar to many of my colleagues.\n  When the Social Security Program was created, benefits were not \ntaxed. In 1983, Congress decided that 50 percent of the benefits to \nseniors should be subject to tax. In 1993, we raised the amount to 85 \npercent of Social Security benefits. This tax affects supposedly \nwealthy seniors with incomes of $34,000 for single seniors and $44,000 \nfor a couple.\n  My amendment is fairly simple. It creates a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund to allow Congress to drop the tax back to its pre-1993 levels. \nThis means that 85 percent of the tax would be eliminated.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky has done us all \na favor by the way he has modified his amendment. It is an amendment we \ncan accept. I ask if the Senator could accept a voice vote.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Absolutely.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in my statement earlier, I failed to \nmention we have an agreement that Senator Kyl's vote will come before \n11 o'clock.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Correct. We will need to insert that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we accept the Bunning amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 621) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We would like to proceed to Senator Dole for the purpose \nof offering her amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 553\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mrs. Dole] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 553.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To extend financial relief for our reservists and national \nguard deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq by allowing them to make penalty \n   free withdrawals of their retirement funds through the year 2012)\n\n       On page 3, line 14, decrease the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, decrease the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 23, decrease the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, decrease the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, increase the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, increase the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, increase the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. The amendment I offer today is critical to our National \nGuard and reservists serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. It \nfixes a problem in the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Section 827 of \nthat act allows National Guardsmen and reservists called into active \nduty for at least 6 months to make penalty-free early withdrawals from \ntheir IRA, 401(k), or 403(b) retirement accounts. This provision \nexpires at the end of 2007. My amendment, which is fully offset, \ncorrects this by extending this important provision through 2012.\n  Our National Guardsmen and reservists always stand ready to put their \nlives on hold and answer the call of duty. They are putting themselves \ninto harm's way to protect our freedoms and security. They can face \nlengthy deployments that cause major financial strains for their \nfamilies. These outstanding men and women should continue to have \npenalty-free access to their retirement savings if they find themselves \nin a deployment-related financial crunch.\n  I urge passage of the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept the amendment of \nthe Senator from North Carolina. We urge our colleagues to accept it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to agree to the amendment offered by Senator \nDole.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 553) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S3666]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, next up is Senator Feinstein.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE STATE CRIMINAL ALIEN \n                   ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Control of illegal immigration is a Federal \n     responsibility.\n       (2) The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (referred \n     to in this section as ``SCAAP'') carried out pursuant to \n     section 241(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1231(i)) provides critical funding to States and \n     localities for reimbursement of costs incurred as a result of \n     housing undocumented criminal aliens.\n       (3) Congress appropriated $300,000,000 for SCAAP to \n     reimburse State and local governments for those costs in \n     fiscal year 2004.\n       (4) Congress appropriated $305,000,000 for SCAAP to \n     reimburse State and local governments for those costs in \n     fiscal year 2005.\n       (5) Congress appropriated $405,000,000 for SCAAP to \n     reimburse State and local governments for those costs in \n     fiscal year 2006.\n       (6) Congress appropriated $399,000,000 for SCAAP to \n     reimburse State and local governments for those costs in \n     fiscal year 2007.\n       (7) Congress has authorized to be appropriated $950,000,000 \n     to carry out SCAAP for each of the fiscal years 2008 through \n     2011.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the budgetary totals in this resolution assume that \n     $950,000,000 should be made available for SCAAP for fiscal \n     year 2008.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Boxer as a \ncosponsor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by \nSenator Kyl.\n  SCAAP is a vital program to the States and localities to reimburse \nthem for the costs associated with housing undocumented criminal \naliens. Funding for SCAAP is authorized in the amount of $950 million \nfor each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2011, but we have never fully \nfunded SCAAP.\n  Instead we have paid only pennies on the dollar for these costs. In \nmy home State of California, there are currently over 20,000 criminal \nalien inmates. It costs California approximately $715 million per year \nto house these aliens.\n  In 2007, Congress appropriated $399 million for SCAAP. In this budget \nresolution, SCAAP is funded at $407 million.\n  In 2005, a total of 758 applications from 50 different States and the \nU.S. territories were submitted for fiscal year 2005 SCAAP funds.\n  The real problem here is that the problem of illegal immigration is a \nFederal responsibility. Yet the Federal Government consistently shifts \nthe costs for enforcing immigration laws onto our States. This cost-\nshifting is not fair to State governments.\n  My amendment makes SCAAP funding whole by providing an additional \n$543 million to this program.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent to adopt the Feinstein amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this is an important amendment. It is \nnot related to partisan votes that we have been casting, but it is a \ntechnical amendment that amends the nature of the AMT patch.\n  The AMT patch is a huge tax reduction. It does eliminate about three-\nfourths of the people who would pay taxes under the AMT. My amendment \nis fairer. It would include 87 percent as many, but the way it would \nfix the AMT and give relief would be to allow families to utilize their \npersonal exemptions and their children's exemptions under the AMT \naccounting. That is not done today. As a result, seven times as many \nfamilies with children are caught by AMT as are single persons. It is \ndefinitely striking at children and families. I urge that this be \nadopted because it is fairer, and it would reduce costs and save $82 \nbillion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Sessions amendment would increase \ntaxes in fiscal year 2008 by $2.6 billion. It would increase taxes in \nfiscal year 2009, for a total in those 2 years of $11.7 billion of tax \nincreases. In later years, the Sessions amendment would provide \nadditional revenue loss of $148 billion over 5 years. That busts the \nbudget and takes us back into deficit. It is sort of the worst of all \nworlds. It increases taxes in the front end and then blows a hole in \nthe budget.\n  I urge colleagues to vote against the Sessions amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 473.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Sessions amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

ESTATE TAX REFORM INITIATIVE.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the aggregates, allocations, and other appropriate \n     levels in this resolution for a bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report that would provide \n     for estate tax reform legislation that addresses the current \n     flaws in the estate tax law by establishing an estate tax \n     exemption level of $5,000,000, an estate tax rate of 35 \n     percent, and a 5 percent surcharge on the largest estates, \n     provided that such legislation does not increase the deficit \n     over the total of fiscal years 2007 through 2012.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. President, this amendment provides a fiscally \nsound alternative for estate tax reform. It represents a fiscally sound \napproach to protecting family farms, ranches, and small businesses from \nthe onerous estate tax. It is cosponsored by Senators Lincoln, Baucus, \nLandrieu, Stabenow, Salazar, Bill Nelson, and Mark Pryor. \n  The amendment provides for an estate tax reform initiative; the \nnecessary next step to improving the estate tax component of the Baucus \namendment adopted by an overwhelming margin of 97 to 1. This amendment \ngets us to a $5 million exemption and a 35 percent rate.\n  I hope the day will come when we can fully repeal the estate tax \nforever, but unfortunately today is not that day. Unfortunately, the \nfiscal realities we face do not at this time allow for a permanent \nsolution. That is why we must adopt this amendment to provide peace of \nmind for thousands of families who are planning to pass their business, \nfarm, or ranch on to the next generation.\n  Like the Kyl amendment, our amendment will allow us to accommodate \nthe Landrieu proposal of a $5 million and 35 percent with a surcharge \nfor the largest estates. Unlike the, Kyl amendment, this amendment is \nfiscally responsible and deficit neutral.\n  I look forward to working with the cosponsors of this amendment and \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact meaningful estate tax \nreform this session, and eventually finding a permanent solution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and join me in \nfollowing through on the promise made in this amendment to extend \nestate tax relief with an exemption of $5 million and a top rate of 35 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator Lincoln from Arkansas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Nelson, as \nwell as Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley, who have helped us \nin the direction of moving forward to something that is realistic in \nterms of estate tax reform. We will\n\n[[Page S3668]]\n\nhave the opportunity in the Finance Committee to be able to craft \nsomething that makes sense. But without what Senator Nelson and I and \nothers are doing here, we will not have the direction to do that.\n  Many of us know we have outlived the boundaries of the current estate \ntax law. We know in 2010 it may go away, but the fact is in 2011 it \ncomes back at an old and arcane number.\n  What we do is take what Senator Baucus has already done in the first \namendment we voted on and adopted, and we increase it to a realistic \nand balanced level of a $5 million exemption and a 35-percent rate, and \nwe do it with a reserve fund that will allow us to make sure we pay for \nit in a fiscally sound way when it comes through the Finance Committee.\n  I have worked diligently on this issue since I have come to the \nSenate, recognizing that for our small businesses, our family \nbusinesses, and our family farms this is an essential component for \nthem to be able to be aware of how they can plan for their finances to \nkeep those family businesses in working order.\n  So we appreciate it. I urge our colleagues, this is a great \nopportunity to have the Senate on record as moving forward on this \nissue. I encourage all of my colleagues to take a look at it and \nsupport us because it gives us an opportunity to get moving on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, \nMs. Landrieu.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana has 10 \nseconds.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds, \nplease, and to have the same amount of time added to the other side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this is the right compromise on the \nestate tax at the right time. It is going to bring order to this tax \nthat should be paid. It is about what Kent Conrad has done, by \ngenerating a budget that generates surpluses, enabling us to give tax \nrelief, so we can give tax relief to small businesses and farms and \npeople who have built their businesses. That is what this amendment \ndoes: a $5 million exemption, a 35-percent rate, and we will continue \nto take it down as the money comes forward to do so.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am glad we are having the debate about the \ndeath tax. I regret the amendment I proposed a couple days ago was \nvoted down. There were some suggestions it was because of the capital \ngains and dividends provisions that were tied to it. So I brought an \namendment back with Senator Thune that would eliminate the capital \ngains and dividends part of it and simply have us vote, along with one \neducation tax credit, for real reform to the death tax.\n  Now, I want my colleagues on the Democratic side to appreciate--and I \nhave certainly appreciated working with all three of them.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Can we have order, please.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is \ncorrect. Please take conversations out of the Chamber.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I prefer not to be raising my \nvoice, but I cannot hear myself.\n  Let's understand what voting for the Democrat ``cover'' amendment \nwould do. First of all, when we had a $5 million exemption we were \ntalking about last year, all of the groups came to us and said: You \nhave to index it for inflation or pretty soon it will not mean \nanything. The Kyl-Thune amendment is indexed for inflation, the $5 \nmillion exempted amount. The amendment that is being proposed on the \nDemocratic side is not indexed for inflation, and you will hear from \ngroups such as the Farm Bureau and the NFIB and other groups that \nunderstand it has to be indexed for inflation.\n  Secondly, you say the rate is 35 percent, but there is a surcharge \nfor ``large'' estates. How are they defined? They are not defined. A \nmajority of Americans, according to surveys, say rates above 35 percent \nare confiscatory. So the 40-percent top rate in this Democratic \nproposal is going to be a big problem for a lot of Americans, both \nthose who have to pay and those who do not have to pay.\n  Finally, with respect to the idea this is paid for, appreciate the \nbig expenses for estate tax are after the year 2011. So it is folly to \nsay this is paid for. Yes, you will have raised taxes by about $60 \nbillion to ``pay'' for this for the 5 years covered by the budget, but \nthe reality is, it is not going to be paid for in the future.\n  Do you know what. All of us--the Senator from Arkansas, the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, the Senator from Louisiana, and other Senators on the \nDemocratic side--have in the past appreciated the fact that when it \ncomes to death tax reform, we should not raise taxes on some taxpayers \nto provide this relief for the people who have to pay the death tax.\n  The reality is, we should not have to raise money from one group of \ntaxpayers to pay for the relief granted to this group. The reality is \nprobably it is going to be the same group of folks.\n\n  So I say to my friends who would want to suggest this is a ``cover'' \namendment, that they can be just fine on this issue of death tax if \nthey will vote for the proposal that is before us right now. That is \nnot the case. If you want the real cover, that is to say the \nappreciation of the American people, reserve your aye vote for the Kyl-\nThune amendment which will come next.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 626.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 25, nays 74, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 101 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--25\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Byrd\n     Cardin\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Feingold\n     Inouye\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Salazar\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Voinovich\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--74\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Obama\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Johnson\n      \n  The amendment (No. 626) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 583\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate my colleagues not \nsupporting this proposition. There are two main--\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator have an amendment \nat the desk?\n  Mr. KYL. I am sorry, Mr. President. I thought my amendment was at the \ndesk. It is pending.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. There are two main differences between the amendment that \nwas just rejected and the one which I hope we will all support. The \nfirst difference was that the $5 million exempted amount for estates \nwas not indexed\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\nfor inflation. In the Kyl-Thune amendment, it is indexed for inflation. \nI think if you will all check with your folks, you will find they want \nthis indexed for inflation.\n  This is a little like AMT. At first it didn't hit very many people, \nbut after awhile, it begins to hit a lot of people, primarily because \nof inflation. The same thing will occur here. The whole point of an \nexemption is so people would not have to worry about spending all the \nmoney on insurance and lawyers and accountants, and so on, to plan \nagainst the estate tax. That is why you want an exempted amount such as \nthe $5 million, but it is important it doesn't get eroded over time. \nAgain, one of the key differences between the amendment that was just \nrejected and this amendment, which I hope you will support, is this \namendment is indexed for inflation.\n  Secondly, most Americans believe that a 40- or 45- or 50-percent rate \nis confiscatory.\n  The other difference between the amendment that just failed and the \none I hope you will now support is that the maximum rate under this is \n35 percent. I still think that is too high.\n  The amendment just agreed to had a maximum rate of 40 percent. I \nthink 35 percent is too high, if you look at the various polls that \nhave been taken. In any event, that is the maximum rate under this \namendment. It has been supported by a bipartisan group on both sides of \nthe aisle, which is why we sit at 35 percent, because the reality is \nthat in order to have the estate tax reform, we are going to need a \nbipartisan coalition.\n  My concluding remarks are to reach out to my friends on the other \nside of the aisle. My final plea is that we can demonstrate in a \nbipartisan way by supporting this amendment, which has enough \nflexibility in it because it is a budget amendment rather than a \nspecific proposal, to accommodate nuances that Members on both sides of \nthe aisle would like to see in estate tax reform.\n  The time for reform has come. Adopting this amendment will make that \npoint in a general way. Then we can sit down and work together to try \nto work something out that we can get passed. I would appreciate our \ncolleagues expressing support for death tax reform by voting aye on the \nKyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from North Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there have been a number of statements \nabout the previous amendments that are factually wrong. The previous \namendment had a $5 million exemption per person, plus a top effective \nrate of 35 percent. My colleagues on the other side have misread the \nprevious amendment. It had a top effective rate of 35 percent. I wanted \nto state that for the Record.\n  The fundamental difference between the two is that the previous \namendment was paid for. This amendment, by Senator Kyl, whom I respect, \nis not paid for. I would say to my colleagues, if this is a priority, \nwhy not pay for it? The hard reality is that if this amendment before \nus now is adopted--the Kyl amendment--it blows a hole in the budget, \nputs us back into deficit, after we have worked so hard all these hours \nto get a balanced budget by 2012. This proposal would put us back into \ndeficit by over $15 billion in 2012. It would add $35 billion to the \ndeficit.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. In the previous Baucus \namendment, we provided for all of the middle-class tax cuts and \nfundamental and significant estate tax reform. It was paid for. This \namendment is not. It ought to be rejected.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to make sure my colleagues don't think I was \nmisstating a fact. The top effective rate is 35 percent, but there is a \n5-percent surcharge on the largest estates. Am I wrong in that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is wrong. I know why the Senator is reading \nit to conclude that. My tax experts tell me that the way the \ninteractive effect occurs, the top effective rate is never more than 35 \npercent. I know why the Senator is reaching that conclusion. I would be \nglad to have my tax counsel visit with him because they assure me that \nin the previous amendment, the top effective rate was 35 percent. I \nknow the Senator agreed about the 5-percent surcharge. I think time has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to make a point. I have talked to \nthe chairman and this will be a 10-minute vote, not a 15-minute vote. \nFrom here on out, they will all be. Anybody who is not here, you are \ngoing to miss it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n583.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second. There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Who seeks time? The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Gregg has indicated repeatedly \nthat the 10-minute votes are just not being abided by. The only way \nthey can be abided by is, No. 1, if people stay in the Chamber or very \nclose to the Chamber. We are not going to finish this resolution unless \nwe change the way we are doing business. We still have dozens and \ndozens of amendments remaining. We are going to be here until 1 o'clock \nthis morning unless we change the way we do business.\n  I have to ask the leadership if they will support going to 10-minute \nvotes.\n  Mr. REID. With no 5 minutes. That is fine with me.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the leadership support that request?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We have been doing it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, we have gone over.\n  Mr. REID. We have gone 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the leadership support us going to 10-minutes votes?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I certainly think that is a good idea.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Then the word has to go out that we are going to 10-\nminute votes.\n  I have to try to make amends on a previous debate. Senator Kyl \nindicated on the Nelson amendment that it appeared to be higher than a \n35-percent rate. There was reason for him to believe that, looking at \nthe amendment. I want to make clear that while we believe the Nelson \namendment had a top effective rate of 35 percent, just looking at the \namendment, one could easily conclude that is not the case. So I want to \nmake that clear. In no way were we denigrating Senator Kyl's honor with \nrespect to accurately and honestly depicting that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his remarks. I \nappreciate\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\nit. Certainly, I knew there was no attempt to suggest that I was \nmisrepresenting. I try to read things very closely. This is one of the \nsituations where apparently it could have been read both ways.\n  I appreciate the comments of the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the clerks have a difficult time going \nthrough these votes in 10 minutes. They can do it, but it would be a \nlot easier if people will stay here and when their name is called \nanswer ``yea'' or ``nay.'' The way it is, they have to go back and \nforth so many times that it is like a jigsaw puzzle they have to work \nout every time.\n  The votes will be 10 minutes. There will be a 1-minute grace period. \nThat is the way it is going to be. That is what everybody should \nacknowledge will happen. It is approaching noontime. We have a lot to \ndo. We can condense this quickly, but people have to cooperate.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, for the information of Members on our side, \nthe amendments, as they are presently lined up, are Senator Hatch, \nSenator Allard, Senator Smith, Senator Thomas, Senator Specter, Senator \nGraham, Senator Grassley, Senator Lott, myself, Senator DeMint, and \nSenator Thune.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 508\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 508.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 508.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To establish a reserve fund for protecting coverage choices, \nadditional benefits, and lower cost-sharing for Medicare beneficiaries)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESERVE FUND FOR PROTECTING COVERAGE CHOICES, \n                   ADDITIONAL BENEFITS, AND LOWER COST-SHARING FOR \n                   MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.\n\n       If the Senate Committee on Finance--\n       (1) reports a bill, or if an amendment is offered thereto, \n     or if a conference report is submitted thereon, that--\n       (A) implements improvements to the Medicare or Medicaid \n     programs under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \n     Act, respectively, or the State Children's Health Insurance \n     program under title XXI of such Act; and\n       (B) does not--\n       (i) lead to fewer coverage choices for Medicare \n     beneficiaries, especially for those beneficiaries in rural \n     areas; or\n       (ii) result in reduced benefits or increased cost-sharing \n     for Medicare beneficiaries who choose a Medicare Advantage \n     plan under part C of such title XVIII, especially for low-\n     income beneficiaries who depend on their Medicare Advantage \n     plan for protection from high out-of-pocket cost-sharing; and\n       (2) is within its allocation as provided under section \n     302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974,\n\n     the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may revise \n     allocations of new budget authority and outlays, the revenue \n     aggregates, and other appropriate measures to reflect such \n     legislation provided that such legislation would not increase \n     the deficit for fiscal year 2008, and for the period of \n     fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have offered amendment No. 508 to ensure \nthat Congress continues to protect Medicare beneficiaries' coverage \nchoices, especially for those living in rural areas and low-income \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  My amendment establishes a budget-neutral reserve fund so that if \nCongress implements improvements to Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP, it may \nnot do so in a way that leads to fewer coverage choices for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. It also may not reduce the benefits of those \nbeneficiaries who are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans.\n  Medicare Advantage plans provide a range of benefits not available in \ntraditional Medicare such as vision and dental care, physical exams, \nand hearing aids.\n  Medicare Advantage plans also have chronic care management programs \nto help beneficiaries with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or \ncongestive heart failure better manage their conditions and stay \nhealthy.\n  I conclude by urging my colleagues to keep in mind the following:\n  Beneficiaries across the Nation--whether they live in a rural State \nsuch as Utah or urban area such as New York City--now have more \ncoverage choices.\n  These choices offer beneficiaries more benefits and lower out of \npocket costs.\n  Beneficiaries are satisfied.\n  Let's not forget that it was through policy decisions supported by \nMembers on both sides of the aisle that helped achieve those results.\n  And those results, in my opinion, are worth protecting for \nbeneficiaries' sake. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the NAACP and LULAC \nopposing cuts to the Medicare Advantage Program be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Washington Bureau, National Association for the \n           Advancement of Colored People,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2007.\n     Re NAACP support for the Medicare Advantage Program.\n     Members,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), our nation's \n     oldest, largest, and most widely recognized grassroots civil \n     rights organization, I would like to express our deep concern \n     about efforts to reduce funding for the Medicare Advantage \n     (MA) program.\n       The NAACP has a long history of working to ensure that \n     African Americans and other racial and ethnic minorities have \n     access to high-quality, affordable health care. That is why \n     we strongly support maintaining adequate funding for the \n     Medicare Advantage program that serves as a ``critical link'' \n     for accessing health care services, particularly for low-\n     income and minority Medicare beneficiaries.\n       MA plans--private health plan options that provide coverage \n     to 8.3 million Medicare beneficiaries--disproportionately \n     provide coverage to low-income and racial and ethnic minority \n     beneficiaries. Specifically, 40 percent of African Americans \n     without Medicaid or employer coverage rely on comprehensive \n     health insurance coverage provided by MA plans. By providing \n     more comprehensive benefits and lower cost-sharing than \n     traditional Medicare, MA plans help racial and ethnic \n     minority populations gain access to health care services that \n     are critical to their long-term health and well-being.\n       Moreover, minorities also benefit from the care and disease \n     management offered by MA plans. These programs help assure \n     that members with chronic conditions such as heart disease, \n     diabetes, and asthma receive high-quality care by encouraging \n     timely and regular check-ups, access to preventive services, \n     and chronic care management programs. Access to coordinated \n     care and disease management services are especially critical \n     to minorities who are more likely to suffer from common \n     chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, \n     respiratory disease, and certain forms of cancer.\n       Reduced funding for the MA program would have a negative \n     impact on the health and health care of millions of Medicare \n     beneficiaries--particularly for low-income and minority \n     beneficiaries. A study by Emory University's Kenneth Thorpe, \n     Ph.D., found that without MA, 2 million Medicare \n     beneficiaries would lose all supplemental coverage. Racial \n     and ethnic minorities would be especially hard hit, with the \n     number of African-Americans without supplemental coverage \n     rising to 59 percent.\n       As Congress continues to debate efforts to expand access to \n     high-quality, affordable care, we urge you not to backtrack \n     on these priorities by cutting funding for the MA program. \n     This program is vitally important to the health and well-\n     being of racial and ethnic minorities who rely on MA to \n     provide them with the comprehensive, affordable, and \n     coordinated care they need.\n       Thank you in advance for your attention to the NAACP \n     position on this matter. Should you have any questions or \n     comments, I hope that you will not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Hilary O. Shelton,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  League of United\n\n\n                                      Latin American Citizens,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2007.\n     Member of Congress,\n     U.S. Senate and House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Member of Congress: I am writing on behalf of the \n     League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC)--the oldest \n     and largest Hispanic membership organization in the United \n     States--to urge your opposition to efforts by some Members of \n     Congress to reduce funding for the Medicare Advantage (MA) \n     program.\n       LULAC's mission is to advance the economic condition, \n     educational attainment, health and civil rights of Hispanic \n     Americans. Ensuring access to high quality, affordable health \n     care is one of our top priorities, and one that is especially \n     critical in the Hispanic community. We firmly believe \n     Medicare Advantage is helping meet this challenge for \n     Hispanic seniors.\n       Medicare Advantage is vital to the well-being of Hispanic \n     Medicare beneficiaries. According to a 2005 study by Ken \n     Thorpe, Ph.D.,\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\n     of Emory University, Hispanics rely disproportionately on the \n     Medicare Advantage program. According to this study, more \n     than half (53 percent) of Hispanic beneficiaries without \n     Medicaid or employer-based coverage are enrolled in an MA \n     plans where they are available.\n       MA plans are important because they provide enhanced \n     benefits and lower cost-sharing than traditional Medicare. \n     According to CMS, MA enrollees save $86 per month when \n     compared to beneficiaries in traditional Medicare. We are \n     concerned that additional cuts in funding for Medicare \n     Advantage will threaten access to comprehensive benefits, \n     result in higher out-of-pocket health care costs, and create \n     financial barriers to care that will be particularly harmful \n     for Hispanic seniors.\n       The coordinated care and disease management offered under \n     Medicare Advantage plans is especially critical for Hispanic \n     Medicare beneficiaries, who are more likely to suffer from \n     chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, and certain \n     forms of cancer. These programs help assure that members with \n     chronic conditions benefit from care management and \n     coordination initiatives, which promote appropriate treatment \n     and medication use, reduce the risk of adverse events, and \n     optimize therapeutic outcomes.\n       LULAC calls upon your leadership to oppose these cuts and \n     fund MA programs to sustainable levels.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rosa Rosales,\n                                         LULAC National President.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on April 11, the Finance Committee is \ngoing to be holding a hearing on Medicare Advantage plans and other \nproviders' plans that affect Medicare. We want to do this right. We \nwant to do this in a very thoughtful, considerate way.\n  There are Medicare Advantage plans that are doing a lot of good work. \nThat is clear. Certainly, the Finance Committee, of which Senator Hatch \nis a member--and we have the April 11 hearing--is going to deal with \nthis issue. I urge Members to do this the right way, and the right way \nis to figure out what to do generally with all Medicare providers, \nincluding managed care. Again, there are managed care companies that \nare very good and provide benefits for seniors. Dental has already been \nmentioned by the good Senator from Utah. The more thoughtful way is to \nnot hamstring the committee by preventing the committee from making any \nchanges to these programs. Rather, let's be thoughtful, flexible.\n  I urge Members not to approve this amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 508.

SPENDING RECONCILIATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE \n                   ELIMINATION OF WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE IN \n                   MANDATORY PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Spending Reconciliation Instructions.--In the Senate, \n     not later than June 29, 2007, the Senate committees named in \n     this section shall submit their recommendations to the Senate \n     Committee on the Budget. After receiving those \n     recommendations, the Senate Committee on the Budget shall \n     report to the Senate a reconciliation bill carrying out all \n     such recommendations without any substantive revision.\n       (b) Special Scorekeeping Rule in the Senate.--\n       (1) Report to senate budget committee.--If a reconciliation \n     bill is enacted under this section, the Congressional Budget \n     Office, pursuant to section 202 of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974, shall send a report to the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget--\n       (A) whether that measure contains provisions that decrease \n     budget authority or outlays from the elimination of waste, \n     fraud, and abuse; and\n       (B) the amount of budget authority or outlays reduced each \n     year attributable to the elimination of waste, fraud, and \n     abuse in the bill, including the current year, the budget \n     year, and for each of the 10 years following the current \n     year.\n       (2) Exclusion from pay-as-you-go scorecard.--Any budget \n     authority or outlays reduced from provisions eliminating \n     waste, fraud, and abuse (as detailed in the report required \n     by paragraph (1)) shall not count as offsets for purposes of \n     section 201 of this resolution.\n       (c) Committees.--\n       (1) Committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry.--The \n     Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \n     shall report changes in laws within its jurisdiction \n     sufficient to reduce the level of direct spending for that \n     committee by $686,000,000 in outlays for fiscal year 2008 and \n     $3,577,000,000 in outlays for the period of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2012.\n       (2) Committee on banking, housing and urban affairs.--The \n     Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs shall \n     report changes in laws within its jurisdiction sufficient to \n     reduce the level of direct spending for that committee by \n     $113,000,000 in new budget authority for fiscal year 2008 and \n     $529,000,000 in new budget authority for the period of fiscal \n     years 2008 through 2012.\n       (3) Committee on commerce, science and transportation.--The \n     Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n     shall report changes in laws within its jurisdiction \n     sufficient to reduce the level of direct spending for that \n     committee by $110,000,000 in outlays for fiscal year 2008 and \n     $545,000,000 in outlays for the period of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2012.\n       (4) Committee on energy and natural resources.--The Senate \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources shall report \n     changes in laws within its jurisdiction sufficient to reduce \n     the level of direct spending for that committee by \n     $48,000,000 in outlays for fiscal year 2008 and $250,000,000 \n     in outlays for the period of fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n       (5)  Committee on environment and public works.--The Senate \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works shall report \n     changes in laws within its jurisdiction sufficient to reduce \n     the level of direct spending for that committee by \n     $18,000,000 in outlays for fiscal year 2008 and $97,000,000 \n     in outlays for the period of fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n       (6) Committee on finance.--The Senate Committee on Finance \n     shall report changes in laws within its jurisdiction \n     sufficient to reduce the level of direct spending for that\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\n     committee by $10,406,000,000 in budget authority for fiscal \n     year 2008 and $58,820,000,000 in outlays for the period of \n     fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n       (7) Committee on foreign relations.--The Senate Committee \n     on Foreign Relations shall report changes in laws within its \n     jurisdiction sufficient to reduce the level of direct \n     spending for that committee by $148,000,000 in outlays for \n     fiscal year 2008 and $665,000,000 in outlays for the period \n     of fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n       (8) Committee on homeland security and governmental \n     affairs.--The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs shall report changes in laws within its \n     jurisdiction sufficient to reduce the level of direct \n     spending for that committee by $1,063,000,000 in outlays for \n     fiscal year 2008 and $5,784,000,000 in outlays for the period \n     of fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n       (9) Committee on the judiciary.--The Senate Committee on \n     the Judiciary shall report changes in laws within its \n     jurisdiction sufficient to reduce the level of direct \n     spending for that committee by $81,000,000 in outlays for \n     fiscal year 2008 and $406,000,000 in outlays for the period \n     of fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n       (10) Committee on health, education, labor and pensions.--\n     The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions shall report changes in laws within its jurisdiction \n     sufficient to reduce the level of direct spending for that \n     committee by $145,000,000 in outlays for fiscal year 2008 and \n     $778,000,000 in outlays for the period of fiscal years 2008 \n     through 2012.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, this is an amendment that puts in \nreconciliation language a 1-percent reduction in spending in the \nmandatory programs that have been identified as having fraud, waste, \nand abuse. It excludes Armed Services, Veterans, and Social Security.\n  The amendment comes about because of the 2004 budget resolution, \nwhere Congress directed the Comptroller General to submit a \ncomprehensive report identifying instances in which the committees of \njurisdiction may make legislative changes to improve the economy, \nefficiency, and effectiveness of Federal programs in their \njurisdiction.\n  In compliance with our request, the GAO submitted a 300-plus-page \nreport full of specific examples of legislative changes with potential \nto yield budgetary savings. This will reduce the debt by $13 billion \nthe first budget year and $71 billion over 5 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment, if it were adopted, would \ncut Medicare and Medicaid by $58.8 billion. It would cut the Homeland \nSecurity Committee by $5.8 billion. It would cut the Agriculture \nCommittee by $3.6 billion.\n  Beyond that, Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order that the amendment violates section \n305(b)2 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and I urge a ``no'' \nvote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask that we waive the point of order, \nand I call for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, since the beginning of this Congress, I \nhave heard colleagues on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and \nDemocrats, talk about their determination to reauthorize and fund SCHIP \nto keep its promise to America's children, especially those with low \nincome. This amendment is the one amendment that proposes a real policy \nthat will raise real dollars so we can take a meaningful step in \nkeeping the promise of SCHIP. It proposes a reasonable increase in the \ntobacco tax that would provide up to $35 billion to help in this \nreauthorization, keeping this very important promise to millions of \nAmerica's children.\n  I believe this is a defining moment. Put politics aside and do \nsomething the American people can be proud of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator \nfrom North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we would be pleased to accept this \namendment on a voice vote.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I object.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If objection is heard--Senators can vote however they \nthink is the right way. We certainly always have that right; Senators \nalways have that right.\n  On this side, I urge Senators to vote aye.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 510, as modified. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 59, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 105 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\n\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Johnson\n       \n  The amendment (No. 510), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of an \namendment to the budget resolution that Senator Chambliss and I have \noffered to increase FY2008 funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial \nJustice Assistance Grant program to $900 million.\n  The need for this amendment is clear. This country is currently \nexperiencing a violent crime surge unlike anything we have seen in more \nthan a decade. Just a few weeks ago, the Police Executive Research \nForum reported that their survey of 56 cities and sheriffs' departments \nshowed that, from 2004 to 2006, homicides increased overall by 10 \npercent, aggravated assaults with guns rose 10 percent, and robberies \nrose 12 percent. In just 2 years.\n  Of course, these updated survey results mirror the FBI's own \nstatistics, which showed that in 2005 violent crime rose in every \nregion of the country, and by 2.5 percent overall--the largest reported \nincrease in 15 years. For the first 6 months of 2006, the surge in \nviolent crime was even worse--3.7 percent overall, according to the \nFBI.\n  Let me put these numbers in human terms. The International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police equates this 2.5 percent rise to 31,479 \nmore victims of violent crime in 2005. And a 3.7 percent increase for \nall of 2006, it says, equates to about 47,000 more Americans murdered, \nrobbed, assaulted, raped, or subjected to violent crimes last year.\n  Unfortunately, despite these disturbing numbers, the President's \nbudget proposal for FY2008 continued to propose drastic cuts in the \nFederal assistance traditionally available to State and local law \nenforcement.\n  Listen to the warning cry that the International Association of \nChiefs of Police recently issued:\n\n       [T]he cuts contained in the proposed FY 2008 budget have \n     the potential to cripple the capabilities of law enforcement \n     agencies nationwide and force many departments to take \n     officers off the streets, leading to more crime and violence \n     in our hometowns and, ultimately, less security for our \n     homeland.\n\n  These are strong words, but they make sense in the wake of the \ndrastic Federal cuts we have seen to State and local law enforcement, \nespecially in the last few years.\n  In FY2007, the total funding level for State, tribal and local law \nenforcement assistance was $2.316 billion. That was already more than \n$1.5 billion below the level given only 5 years earlier, when DOJ \nfunded programs for state and local law enforcement totaled $3.831 \nbillion.\n  Last year's $2.316 billion amount included not only Byrne/JAG, but \nalso the COPS program and 17 other State and Local Law Enforcement \nAssistance grant programs, including the State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program, SCAAP; Tribal Courts Initiative, and other programs \nto promote Drug Courts, Prescription Drug Monitoring, Cannabis \nEradication, and State and Local Intelligence Capabilities.\n  For FY2008, however, the President remarkably proposed to eliminate \nall 17 of these programs. In their place, it proposed only two \nconsolidated programs, one of which would be called the Byrne Public \nSafety Program, or BPSP. Unfortunately, even when BPSP was combined \nwith the President's other proposed programs, its total budgeted amount \nfor FY2008 was only $582 million--a $1.7 billion cut from the already-\ndepleted FY2007 number.\n  In other words, the President's budgeted $582 million represented an \n85 percent cut in these funds in just 6 years. And to make matters \nworse, the President's FY2008 budget also proposed more than $500 \nmillion in cuts to the DHS grant programs traditionally available to \nState and local law enforcement.\n  During the 1990s and earlier years in this decade, our Federal \nGovernment vigorously funded grants programs for State and local law \nenforcement. And we saw results--violent crime went down year after \nyear. But with the recent cuts, violent crime rates have now turned \nback up. Literally tens of thousands of additional Americans each year \nhave become victims of violent crime.\n  It is time for the Senate to add substantial Byrne/JAG funding to \nthis year's budget resolution--just as we have done in the past 2 \nyears. In FY2006 and again in FY2007, this Senate voted to increase \nByrne/JAG to $900 million--even after President Bush and previous \nBudget Committees tried to ``zero out'' this program.\n  I recognize and appreciate that Senator Conrad and his Budget \nCommittee in the new Congress have taken a very different view of \nByrne/JAG. I applaud their decision to reject the much smaller budget \nfigure for Byrne/JAG that was contained in the President's Budget, as \nwell as the decision to reject the President's proposal to consolidate \nByrne/JAG with other grant programs and eliminate its formula funding. \nThis is a major step forward.\n  Unfortunately, however, it just is not enough. At a time when this \ncountry is seeing the biggest surge in violent crime it has experienced \nin more than a decade, using FY2007 levels that are $1.5 billion below \nFY2002 levels will not do the trick. The Senate must do more--just as \nwe rose to the occasion and voted to do more in the past.\n  After a Byrne/JAG amendment was offered on the budget resolution last \nyear, we were confronted in June with the sharply higher 2005 violent \ncrime numbers reported by the FBI. And in December, the FBI gave us \neven worse violent crime numbers for the first half of 2006. Given \nthese disturbing trends, the Senate needs to restore these needed funds \nto the Byrne/JAG program.\n  I understand that this budget is tight, and I appreciate the \ndifficult tradeoffs involved. But at a time when\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\nwe are about to consider a Supplemental Appropriations bill that may \nadd more than $100 billion so that we can try to secure the streets of \nBaghdad against violence, I do not think that it's asking too much for \nus to spend the funds we need to secure our own streets from the \nviolence that the FBI says we are increasingly seeing.\n  Homeland security is undoubtedly important, but so is home town \nsecurity.\n  The Byrne/JAG program, named after slain New York Police Officer \nEdward Byrne, is a time-tested program run by DOJ that has proven its \neffectiveness over the course of more than 20 years. It is a key source \nof funding for multi-jurisdictional task forces. And because 40 percent \nof a State's Byrne/JAG funds must be set aside for local governments, \nsmaller and rural law enforcement agencies are often especially \ndependent on Byrne/JAG to meet their needs.\n  Increased funding for Byrne/JAG has been endorsed by a wide array of \nlaw enforcement groups, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 616\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for \nsupporting the amendment Senator Snowe and I offered to provide an \nadditional $97 million to the Small Business Administration. This \namendment was necessary because the President's budget request of $464 \nmillion was inadequate to fund the agency's core programs.\n  This, unfortunately, is nothing new. Since the President took office \nin 2001, he has cut the SBA, the only Federal agency dedicated to the \nstartup and growth of small businesses, more than any other agency. If \nwe exclude disaster loan funding, the President has cut the SBA by more \nthan 30 percent.\n  As a result of the President's cuts, SBA's loans and venture capital \nare more expensive, shifting more than $100 million in fees to the \nsmall business community, businesses are getting less counseling, and \nthey are losing out on opportunities to do business with the Federal \nGovernment, a very serious problem since the Federal Government spends \nabout $370 billion on contracting for services and goods each year.\n  Consequently, the baseline funding for the SBA is so low that it has \nmade it very hard for Congress to reverse the President's cuts. \nNevertheless, Senator Conrad and his Committee were able to increase by \n$635 million the account--referred to as function 370--that provides \nfunding for the SBA and other agencies. I congratulate them, and thank \nthem. They have demonstrated that it is possible to provide reasonable \nfunding for effective initiatives and still put the country back on \ntrack to a balanced budget.\n  Among the most disturbing proposed cuts to the SBA in fiscal year \n2008, the President has for the fourth year in a row eliminated all \nfunding for the Microloan program and for Microloan Technical \nAssistance. This is very hard to justify given that the administration \nis willing to spend so much on micro-credit in other countries. In \n2005, the administration provided approximately $211 million for the \ndevelopment of foreign microenterprise programs through the Agency for \nInternational Development. In fiscal year 2006, we are told by \nAmbassador Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, that the \nadministration provided more than $54 million for microloans in Iraq. \nAnd for fiscal year 2007, the administration has requested supplemental \nfunding for Iraq that includes at least $160 million for micro-credit \nprograms.\n  Our amendment restores the Microloan and Microloan technical \nassistance programs to the levels they were at in 2001--$3.2 million to \nleverage $30 million in loans and $20 million in technical assistance. \nOur amendment also restores the proposed cuts to the Women's Business \nCenters, the Small Business Development Centers, the Office of Veterans \nBusiness Development, and programs for the development of minority \nbusinesses and Native Americans. It restores $10 million in funding for \nthe New Markets programs, which have never received support from this \nadministration, in spite of claims about targeting areas of high \nunemployment.\n  My one big regret is that this amendment does not provide funding for \nthe 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program. My original budget amendment, No. 515, \ndid include $79 million in order to reduce fees on borrowers and \nlenders, which could have gone a long way to making these loans more \naffordable. Right now, on the largest loans, borrowers are paying \naround $50,000 in fees when a conventional loan would only cost around \n$20,000 in fees. We need to get that cost down. I am very disappointed \nthat the Republican leadership would not allow any funding for the 7(a) \nloans to be included in our amendment. I am hopeful that Senator Snowe \nand I, with our colleagues in the House, can continue to work on this \nand get funding for fee relief during the appropriations process.\n  Aside from that one disappointment, I am very pleased with our \namendment. It is reasonable and realistic. By restoring $97 million to \nthe SBA, we bring its funding for fiscal year 2008 to $561 million. \nThis is still $125 million--or 18 percent--less than SBA's funding in \nfiscal year 2001, and it is a fraction of the $2.9 trillion budget \nPresident Bush proposed for fiscal year 2008, but it will go a long way \nto fostering small business growth and sparking innovation.\n  I thank Senator Snowe and our colleagues Senators Lieberman, Enzi, \nCantwell, and Pryor for joining in this bipartisan effort.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise to draw attention to \nfunding for our Nation's small businesses, which has systematically \ndeclined over the last 6 years and is inadequate in both the \nPresident's budget and this budget resolution before us. I first \ncommend my colleage, Senator Kerry, for working with me on this \nbipartisan amendment to restore this critical funding for small \nbusinesses.\n  This amendment would restore $97 million in funding to the Small \nBusiness Administration, an agency that contributes substantially to \nour economic growth. Since 2001 the SBA's overall budget has declined \nby an unacceptable 31 percent. Especially when one considers that small \nbusinesses are the backbone of our economy, breathing life into areas \nonce devastated by manufacturing closures, disasters, and economic \nrecessions, it is frankly beyond me why we continue to shrink the \nresources that actually help our Nation's job creators grow.\n  Just last month, I heard firsthand from over 90 Maine small business \nmanufacturers about the barriers that hinder their success and the \nprograms that have helped manufacturers grow and expand their business \nlike the SBA's 504, 7(a), SBDC and HUBZone programs. However, this \nbudget falls short of providing the very programs that have helped \nrevitalize Maine's and our Nation's communities devastated by over \n20,700 manufacturing job losses since 2000.\n  This amendment is about the 25.8 million small businesses and small \nmanufacturers across the country, which are vital to the economic \ngrowth and job creation in each of our States. In every State, small \nbusinesses are the engine that drives our economy. Small businesses use \nSBA loans to expand and hire new workers; they receive vital advice \nfrom Women's Business Centers, Small Business Development Centers, and \nVeterans Business Development Centers; and they survive and thrive by \nobtaining contracts with the Federal Government. These are the people \nand the businesses my amendment assists. So why does this budget \nhandcuff the very programs that have allowed our businesses and economy \nto expand?\n\n  The SBA has helped create and retain over 5.3 million jobs since \n1999. It is clear that our economic future depends on the success of \nsmall firms, which constitute over 98 percent of our Nation's \nmanufacturing enterprises, create nearly three-quarters of new jobs, \nand produce 50 percent of the gross domestic product. However, we \ncannot, on the one hand, state how much we value small businesses, and \non the other hand, neglect to provide the assistance that small \nbusinesses so desperately need to compete.\n  This bipartisan amendment provides funds for the SBA's Microloan \nProgram, which provides loans of up to $35,000 and technical assistance \nto new and growing small businesses. The administration proposes to \neliminate the\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\nsubsidy for microloans and transfer the technical assistance duties to \nthe entrepreneurial development programs. However, this relatively \ninexpensive program is critical to our next generation of \nentrepreneurs. In fact, in my own State of Maine, the Microloan Program \nhas made 94 loans over the last 2 years, for a total of $1.7 million. \nThe elimination of this subsidy will increase interest rates for our \nNation's microlenders and micro-entrepreneurs located in rural and \nunderserved communities that have no other resource for financing.\n  Additionally, this amendment provides the critical funding for Small \nBusiness Development Centers, SCORE and Women's Business Centers, which \nserved over 1.2 million clients in 2006. Not only has funding for these \nprograms decreased over the last 5 years but the SBA proposes to \nincrease their responsibility to take on microloan technical \nassistance. These critical programs need and, quite frankly, deserve \nthe resources to reach and assist more small businesses.\n\n  Moreover, this amendment provides the resources necessary for our \nsmall businesses to access prime contracting and subcontracting \nopportunities. The SBA has failed to fix regulatory loopholes \nidentified by the GAO that allows large contractors to keep small \nbusiness set-asides. To address a contracting market that has increased \nto nearly $400 billion a year, the SBA budget needs to increase its \nresources and provide proper oversight.\n  I would like to point out the irony that the administration's budget \nsupports and funds microloans and assistance for foreign \nmicroenterprises, but eliminates, yes, eliminates, all funding for \ndomestic microloans and assistance for American microenterprises. While \nI fully support aid and assistance to foreign microenterprises, what \nare we saying with this imbalance? Is this fair? Is this the message we \nwant to send to our Nation's small businesses?\n  How can we justify repeated cuts in funding for loans and assistance \nhere at home? Is this our priority? I think it is not, and this \namendment reflects our priorities and our commitment to American small \nbusinesses. The $97 million provided for here would make a significant \ndifference to our job-creating small firms and helps them grow, \nflourish and thrive.\n  My amendment is absolutely necessary for America's small businesses \nand is an investment in the entrepreneurship and future of this \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to support it for the SBA and our small \nbusiness job creators. If we fail to provide sufficient support to \nSBA's core lending and business development programs, we threaten to \nreduce small businesses' ability to compete. The American economy needs \na strong and vibrant Small Business Administration.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the amendment the majority leader and I \nare offering today is the first step in our effort this Congress to \nundo a fundamental unfairness that affects over 300,000 disabled \nveterans in this country who also happen to be military retirees. In \nshort, this amendment creates a reserve fund that will allow this \nCongress to once and for all eliminate the offset that exists between \nmilitary retiree pay and VA disability benefits.\n  At a time when we have men and women in harm's way in Iraq, \nAfghanistan and in other locations around the globe, it is appropriate \nthat the budget resolution we pass out of the United States Senate \nacknowledge and seriously address the unmet needs of our Nation's \nveterans.\n  It is wrong that our veterans are enduring long waiting lines to \nreceive health care from the VA due to inadequate funding. It is wrong \nthat the Bush administration slammed the doors of the VA health care \nsystem on hundreds of thousands of so-called ``higher income'' \nveterans--veterans who in reality make as little as $28,000 a year. And \nit is wrong for this administration to try to impose higher copayments \nand enrollment fees on our veterans. As someone who sits on both the \nBudget Committee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, I am incredibly \nproud that on all these issues, this budget resolution is on the side \nof veterans and rejects administration proposals that short-change and \nnickel and dime those who have served.\n  The scandal at Walter Reed has highlighted that even here in \nWashington, only a short distance from this chamber, some of our \nservicemembers were living in sub-standard conditions with moldy walls, \nrodents, and holes in the ceilings. Thankfully, this budget resolution \nalso addresses this outrage.\n  In addition, this budget resolution also provides for substantial, \nnew investments in mental health services for our veterans to help us \ntreat the thousands of veterans returning from the Iraq War with Post \nTraumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD. Also this budget resolution recognizes \nthat we need to significantly increase funding to treat the large \nnumber of servicemembers returning with traumatic brain injury.\n  Finally, this budget resolution includes an amendment I added in \ncommittee that will allow us to make other important improvements to \nveterans' programs later this year. In short, the budget resolution we \nare considering is a huge step in the right direction when it comes to \nveterans' health care and benefits. Chairman Conrad and his staff \ndeserve tremendous credit for recognizing the very serious needs of our \nveterans and moving boldly to address them. I also want to commend \nChairman Akaka of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and his staff for \ntheir work and support throughout this budget process.\n  Even with the tremendous strides forward we have made for veterans in \nthis budget resolution there is one additional issue that needs to be \naddressed. Today, Senator Reid and I are offering this amendment to \ntake care of that very important issue. Before getting into the details \nfirst let me start off by saying that I am honored to be working with \nthe majority leader on this issue. I know that, year after year, he has \nbeen the leading voice in the Senate to eliminate the Disabled Veterans \nTax. And today, he continues that leadership with this amendment.\n  This amendment would create a reserve fund to allow for the \nelimination of the remaining offset between military retiree pay and VA \ndisability payments. In my view, this is an issue of basic fairness. \nMilitary retirees earned their retiree pay based on their long-term \nservice to the Nation. They earn their VA disability benefits based on \nthe disability they acquire or aggravate in the service of their \ncountry.\n  The current offset between these separately-earned benefits \noriginates from a 19th century law that required a dollar-for-dollar \noffset of military retired pay for VA disability compensation. In my \nview and the view of millions of veterans across the country, it is \nclear that veterans deserve to receive both their military retirement \nwhich they receive for their service and their VA disability payments \nas additional compensation for the injuries and lost earning power due \nto their service-connected disabilities.\n  Let me provide just a bit of background on some of the progress \nCongress has made on this issue in recent years, thanks in large part \nto the work of Senator Reid. In the fiscal year 2003 Department of \nDefense Authorization, Congress created a special benefit called \n``combat-related special compensation'' or CRSC. It expanded it in the \nfiscal year 2004 DoD Authorization. CRSC gives certain combat disabled \nveterans a cash benefit equivalent to what they would receive if full \nconcurrent receipt were allowed.\n  In the fiscal year 2004 DoD Authorization bill, Congress approved \nphasing-in concurrent receipt for military retirees rated as at least \n50 percent disabled. The fiscal year 2005 DoD Authorization ended the \nphase in for 100 percent disabled veterans.\n  So, today we find ourselves in a situation where retirees who are \nless than 50 percent disabled are getting no relief from the Disabled \nVeterans Tax and veterans at least 50 percent disabled but less than \n100 percent disabled are in the middle of the phase period that will \nnot be complete until 2014. Frankly, if Congress has made the \ndetermination that the ban on concurrent receipt of military retiree \npay and VA disability compensation is wrong--and I think the \nlegislation passed so far demonstrates that Congress has made that \ndetermination--there is no excuse for making veterans wait for the \nbenefits that we have acknowledged they are due. Now is the time--once \nand for all--we need to eliminate the disabled veterans tax.\n  The Reid-Sanders amendment is just one important step we need to take \nto\n\n[[Page S3677]]\n\nkeep faith to the promises we made to our veterans. I look forward to \nworking with the majority leader on this issue as it moves through the \nlegislative process and I would ask that my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, next we go to the Thomas amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I note on this amendment, when we get into \nthe rollcall, Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye wish to be deemed as \npaired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, did the desk get that?\n  On this next amendment, Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye are \npaired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The desk got that.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 515\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas] proposes amendment \n     No. 515.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask that the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prevent the adding of extraneous earmarks to an emergency \n                           war supplemental)\n\n       On page 34, line 9, after the period insert ``In a \n     nonregular appropriations bill designated to supplement \n     funding for ongoing combat operations, the authority to \n     designate under this subsection shall only apply to war-\n     related items that meet the criteria provided in subsection \n     (f).''\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, very quickly, this is a very simple vote, \nactually. What it has to do with is limiting the amount of additions \nthat can be put on supplementals that are designed for Defense \nspending. The amendment I am offering would attempt to bring some \ndiscipline back into the emergency spending process.\n  It simply holds to a supplemental those things that a supplemental \nwas designed for. The very nature of emergency spending is above and \nbeyond the approved budget. If we want to control spending and control \nthe deficit, then we need to control what we put on these kinds of \nsupplemental bills we are seeing worked out right as we speak.\n  However, too often the emergency supplementals are larded with all \nkinds of pet projects and spending that Members cannot pass in the \nregular process or others put it in there to get theirs passed.\n  It is an abuse of the process. We are going to end up holding our \ntroops hostage because of extraneous spending. I ask that Members \nsupport the amendment, that we hold spending in the supplemental to the \nmilitary for which it is designed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment, while well intended, would \ncreate a serious problem for the body. This amendment prevents the \nAppropriations Committee from reporting a bill with more than one type \nof emergency designation. Let me give my colleagues a concrete example. \nLast year Congress enacted an appropriations bill that included funding \nfor the war effort in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as disaster relief \nfor the gulf coast. This amendment would prevent that kind of \nlegislation. That would reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of this \nChamber already noted for lacking efficiency. I urge my colleagues to \nvote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is agreeing to amendment No. 515.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Mississippi (Mr. Lott).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 613, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 613, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 63, after line 24, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 326. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FOR ASBESTOS REFORM \n                   LEGISLATION.\n\n       The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget may \n     revise the aggregates, allocations, and other appropriate \n     levels in this resolution for a bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report regarding asbestos \n     reform, that (i) either provides monetary compensation to \n     impaired victims of mesothelioma or provides monetary \n     compensaton to impaired victims of asbestos-related disease \n     who can establish that asbestos exposure is a substanial \n     contributing factor in causing their condition, (ii) does not \n     provide monetary compensation to unimpaired claimants or \n     those suffering from a disease who cannot establish that \n     asbestos exposure was a substantial contributing factor in \n     causing their condition, and (iii) is estimated to remain \n     funded from nontaxpayer sources for the life of the fund, by \n     the amounts provided in such legislation for that purpose, \n     provided that such legislation would not increase the deficit \n     over the total of the period of fiscal years 2007 through \n     2057.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, after very considerable negotiation, it \nis my understanding this amendment is acceptable. I thank Senator \nConrad, Senator Gregg, Senator Reid, and Senator Ensign for their \ncooperation.\n  What this amendment does is eliminate a highly technical point of \norder that might have been available on asbestos reform legislation, to \ngive the discretion to the chairman of the Budget Committee to approve \na reserve fund. The bill will have to be revenue neutral. There are \nother points of order which could lie, but I think we will be able to \nestablish revenue neutrality when we produce the bill.\n  It has been necessary because some $30 billion to $40 billion have \nbeen lost on bankruptcy proceedings to retool the reform bill to cover \nmesothelioma and other deadly illnesses. We are in the process of \nworking it out.\n  I also thank my colleagues Senators Leahy, Feinstein, and Carper for \ntheir work on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment extends the marginal tax \nrate relief first passed in 2001. We lowered taxes in 2001. Simply put, \nif you vote against this amendment, the tax rates will revert back to \nthe 2001 levels. You would be voting to increase taxes on 28 million \nfamilies and small businesses. You would be voting to increase taxes on \nsmall businesses, on an average, by more than $3,600 per year. Mr. \nPresident, 78 percent of the benefit of this amendment goes to small \nbusiness owners. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. Tax \npolicy in this country is about being globally competitive. We need to \nkeep our tax rates down to keep our jobs in America. I urge everybody \nto vote for this amendment to make us competitive globally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the fact is, none of those rates change \nuntil 2010, No. 1. No. 2, the Senator's amendment also would not have \nthe effect described by the Senator. The effect the amendment would \nhave is to reduce revenue by $117 billion. It would put us back into \ndeficit in 2012 by $71 billion. This amendment is a budget buster.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a budget point of order against legislation \n that increases income tax rates on small businesses, family farms, or \n                            family ranches)\n\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT RAISES \n                   INCOME TAX RATES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES, FAMILY \n                   FARMS, OR FAMILY RANCHES.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any bill, resolution, amendment, amendment between \n     Houses, motion, or conference report that includes a Federal \n     income tax rate increase on incomes generated by small \n     businesses (within the meaning of section 474(c) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986) or family farms or family \n     ranches (within the meaning of section 2032A of such Code) \n     (regardless of the manner by which such businesses, farms and \n     ranches are organized). In this subsection, the term \n     ``Federal income tax rate increase'' means any amendment to \n     subsection (a), (b), (c), (d), or (e) of section 1, or to \n     section 11(b) or 55(b), of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \n     that imposes a new percentage as a rate of tax and thereby \n     increases the amount of tax imposed by any such section.\n       (b) Supermajority Waiver and Appeal.--\n       (1) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended in the \n     Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeal.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be \n     required in the Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of \n     the Chair on a point of order raised under this section.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 465) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe Senator Grassley has the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Do I have to wait for my amendment to be reported?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may use his time and then call up \nthe amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 471\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my amendment repeals the AMT. Except for \nthe telephone tax, the alternative minimum tax is the phoniest tax we \nhave ever passed. The AMT, in 1969, was meant to hit 155 taxpayers who \nused legal means to avoid taxation, under the theory that everybody \nought to pay some income tax.\n  This very year, more than 2,000 people who are very wealthy are not \npaying any income tax or alternative minimum income tax. So it is not \neven working and hitting the people it is supposed to hit. Right now, \nthis year, 2007, the year we are in, there are 23 million families that \nare going to be hit by this tax. It is a phony revenue machine, over 5 \nyears, $467 billion dollars. We are going to have to have a point of \norder this year to keep these 23 million taxpayers from paying this \ntax. We might as well do away with it right now, once and for all, and \nbe honest about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 471.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the budget resolution for fiscal year 2008 in order \n     to accommodate the full repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax \n preventing 23 million families and individuals from being subject to \nthe AMT in 2007, and millions of families and individuals in subsequent \n                                 years)\n\n       On page 3 line 10, decrease the amount by $30,700,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, decrease the amount by $82,500,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, decrease the amount by $96,300,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, decrease the amount by \n     $112,200,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, decrease the amount by $93,900,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, decrease the amount by $51,400,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, decrease the amount by $30,700,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, decrease the amount by $82,500,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, decrease the amount by $96,300,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 22, decrease the amount by \n     $112,200,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 23, decrease the amount by $93,900,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 1, decrease the amount by $51,400,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $3,450,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $7,727,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $12,984,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 9, increase the amount by $18,436,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 10, increase the amount by $22,732,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $3,450,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $7,727,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $12,984,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, increase the amount by $18,436,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 19, increase the amount by $22,732,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $31,200,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $85,950,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, increase the amount by \n     $104,027,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $125,184,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, increase the amount by $112,336,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, increase the amount by $74,132,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by $31,200,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $117,151,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $221,178,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, increase the amount by $346,362,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by \n     $458,698,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, increase the amount by \n     $532,830,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, increase the amount by $31,200,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, increase the amount by \n     $117,151,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 16, decrease the amount by \n     $221,178,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, increase the amount by \n     $346,362,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, increase the amount by \n     $458,698,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, increase the amount by \n     $532,830,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 8, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 9, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 12, increase the amount by $3,450,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 13, increase the amount by $3,450,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 16, increase the amount by $7,727,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 17, increase the amount by $7,727,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 20, increase the amount by \n     $12,984,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 21, increase the amount by \n     $12,984,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 24, increase the amount by \n     $18,436,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 25, increase the amount by \n     $18,436,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 3, increase the amount by $22,732,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 4, increase the amount by $22,732,000,000.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the reality of the budget resolution is \nthis may not have anything to do with eliminating the alternative \nminimum tax. The one thing it will do is reduce the revenue of the \nGovernment over the next 5 years by $533 billion, plunging us right \nback into deficit. Look, we can deal with the AMT. We have dealt with \nit in the underlying budget resolution for the next 2 years. There will \nbe no increase in the number of people affected by the AMT for the next \n2 years under the budget resolution, and that is paid for. \nUnfortunately, this amendment is not paid for. It would plunge us back \ninto deficit. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the scoring of any amount realized from the sale \n  or lease of land or interests in land that are part of the National \n   Park System, the National Forest System, or the National Wildlife \n                             Refuge System)\n\n       On page 48, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 210. PROHIBITION ON SCORING OF AMOUNTS FROM SALES OR \n                   LEASES OF CERTAIN FEDERAL LAND.\n\n       Any amount realized from the sale or lease of land or \n     interests in land (other than a sale or lease authorized by \n     statute, as of the date of adoption of this concurrent \n     resolution by both Houses) that are part of the National Park \n     System, the National Forest System, or the National Wildlife \n     Refuge System shall not be scored with respect to the level \n     of budget authority, outlays, or revenues.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, the purpose of this amendment is to \ntake away any incentive to sell off our National Park System, or \nforests or wildlife system, by ensuring that we not count revenues from \nthose sales in order to get a balanced budget. That is the idea behind \nit.\n  I am informed by the chairman of the Budget Committee that he would \nhave to oppose the amendment in this form but he is not necessarily in \ndisagreement about the purpose I am trying to accomplish. So I ask him \nhis views on it before taking any further action.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would have to resist this amendment in \nits current form because it requires directed scoring. It requires the \nCongressional Budget Office to score something in a way mandated by \nCongress. I think that is a slippery slope. I don't think that is the \nway we want to go. We don't want to start requiring CBO to score things \nin a certain way. That would impede the impartiality of the CBO.\n  We are happy to work with the Senator to try to find other ways to \naddress the concerns he has expressed in this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I am pleased that the amendment is going \nto be withdrawn. I will be happy to work with the chairman on this \nissue. I understand their concern. We should not be selling off our \npublic land treasures for the purpose of balancing the budget. At the \nsame time, if you sell a surplus vacant piece of property, should it \nnot go in and be counted as revenue of our Government if it was once an \nasset? I think the answer is yes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this amendment would preclude the sale \nof National Park, National Wildlife Refuge and National Forest lands as \na means of paying ongoing operating expenses of the Federal Government. \nThe amendment would have reinstated the budget treatment of these land \nsales as it existed prior to 1995 and would preclude the sell-off of \nour national heritage to balance the budget.\n  On too many occasions over the past several Congresses, controversial \nland sales and leasing proposals have been advanced within the context \nof the Federal budget process. These provisions have complicated the \nconsideration of the budget and have frustrated the efforts of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee to ensure responsible \nstewardship of our Federal lands.\n  I understand that the chairman of the Budget Committee has concerns \nabout changing the scoring rules in the context of this budget \nresolution. I have agreed to withdraw my amendment, with the \nunderstanding that the chairman of the Budget Committee will work with \nme and with the leadership of the Congressional Budget Office to \naddress this important issue during the course of this year. It is my \nhope and expectation that this serious problem can be addressed prior \nto consideration of the next budget resolution. I ask unanimous consent \nthat several letters in support of the amendment be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, Berkley Conservation \n           Institute, Izaak Walton League of America, National \n           Wildlife Federation, Orion--The Hunters Institute, \n           Trout Unlimited,\n                                                   March 21, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations \n     and the millions of hunters, anglers and outdoor enthusiasts \n     we represent, we urge you to support an amendment that \n     Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) will offer to the Senate \n     Budget Resolution this week to prohibit the scoring for \n     budget purposes of revenues associated with the sale of \n     public lands.\n       In recent years the budget and reconciliation process has \n     been abused to promote the sale of public lands and interests \n     in public lands under the guise of deficit reduction. Last \n     Congress, the House passed a reconciliation bill that \n     included a mining law measure which would have resulted in a \n     fire sale of millions of acres of our public lands. A draft \n     of the same bill included a provision to sell off units of \n     the National Park System such as Theodore Roosevelt Island. \n     The President's budget proposals in Fiscal Years 2007 and \n     2008 included the sale of nearly $1 billion of lands managed \n     by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. \n     These controversial measures require a fair and open debate \n     and are not appropriate to be considered in the budget \n     process.\n       Millions of Americans enjoy hunting, fishing and the many \n     other recreational opportunities that our magnificent public \n     lands provide. It is irresponsible to sell our cherished \n     public lands and interests in lands to balance the federal \n     budget. Our public lands are a legacy for future generations \n     that must be conserved. Unfortunately current budget rules \n     provide an incentive to sell public lands for short-term \n     revenues.\n       Budget reconciliation procedures are inappropriate for \n     legislation regarding public lands sales and leasing. Senator \n     Bingaman's amendment would reinstate the rule on the sale of \n     assets as it applied to federal lands from 1987 through 1995. \n     We respectfully urge you to stand for our public lands by \n     supporting Senator Bingaman's amendment to the Budget \n     Resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jim Lyon,\n       Senior Vice President for Conservation, National Wildlife \n     Federation.\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\n     Chris Wood,\n       Vice President for Conservation, Trout Unlimited.\n     Jim Posewitz,\n       Executive Director, Orion--The Hunters Institute.\n     Steven K.

It is our hope that this change will \n     bring an end to what has become an all-too-frequent push to \n     parcel off and dispose of the nation's priceless natural \n     resources and use the projected revenues as an offset during \n     the budget debate.\n       The budget and reconciliation process has been used to \n     promote the sale of public lands and interests in public \n     lands under the guise of deficit reduction. For example, oil \n     and gas leasing on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has \n     been proposed as part of the budget reconciliation process, \n     as have the sales of National Park System units and so-called \n     mining law ``reforms'' to sell off vast tracts of public \n     lands. In addition, the Administration has--for two years \n     running--pressed proposals to sell huge acreages of public \n     lands as part of its yearly budget package.\n       The outcry generated by these proposals could not have been \n     clearer: The American public values its land heritage and \n     expects members of Congress to act as stewards of these \n     irreplaceable resources. We believe that most Americans would \n     consider it irresponsible to sell off their homes and \n     investments to cover household operating expenses, but the \n     current budget scoring rules encourage Congress to do just \n     that. Senator Bingaman's amendment would remove that \n     incentive and move the consideration of important public land \n     management policies out of the budget venue and back to the \n     committees of jurisdiction.\n       Thanks to the foresight of preservation pioneers such as \n     Teddy Roosevelt and a continuing tradition of conservation, \n     this generation has inherited a rich natural heritage. We \n     urge you to stand up for that heritage and to join Senator \n     Bingaman with a vote to protect public lands.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 21, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: During consideration of the Budget Resolution \n     on the Senate floor this week, Senator Bingaman plans to \n     offer an amendment to prohibit scoring of revenue from the \n     sale or lease of federal lands which are part of the National \n     Park System, National Forest system or the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service refuge system. We urge you to support \n     Senator Bingaman's amendment.\n       Over the past several years, various ideas about gaining \n     revenue by selling federal land have surfaced in the budget \n     and reconciliation process. Thankfully, these proposals have \n     generally met with stiff opposition from Members of Congress \n     on both sides of the aisle. Clearly, selling off public \n     assets to obtain a one-time credit toward reducing the \n     deficit is bad public policy; but the possibility of \n     addressing the deficit by selling pieces of the National Park \n     System--places set aside by Congress as the most important \n     examples of our natural and cultural heritage, and the part \n     of the federal government most highly valued by the American \n     people--is simply indefensible.\n       As unlikely as it might appear, there have been such poorly \n     conceived proposals to sell off some of our most precious \n     national treasures for budget purposes as recently as in the \n     109th Congress. In light of these attempts to pursue such \n     ill-advised and untenable approaches to deficit reduction, it \n     is imperative that Congress makes clear such options are \n     foreclosed. By returning to the rule followed under previous \n     budget resolutions, that is what Senator Bingaman's amendment \n     will do.\n       Again, we urge you to support Senator Bingaman's amendment. \n     NPCA considers this a significant vote to protect America's \n     priceless heritage found in our national parks, and may use \n     it in our biennial ``Friend of the National Parks'' scorecard \n     for the 110th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas C. Kiernan,\n                           President, National Parks Conservation.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, in light of the position of the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, I will withdraw the amendment and \nwork with him in the coming months to see if we can get this issue \naddressed in another way so we don't have this incentive--not for the \nsale of all lands, of course, but for the sale of these particular \nlands to which we give a special designation.\n  With that, I withdraw amendment No. 587.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, Senator DeMint is next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 578\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 578.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we have had several votes regarding the \ndeath tax today. Some have reduced it a little bit. We have gotten into \na lot of details about who would win and who would lose.\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\n  My amendment would eliminate the death tax, would continue what we \nwill achieve in 2010. This Congress voted to phase out the death tax. \nIn 2010, it will be gone. My amendment will keep it that way throughout \nthe budget process.\n  I believe, as many do, this is the most immoral and un-American tax \nwe can possibly have in this country. Yesterday, I was distressed to \nhear colleagues on the other side were concerned that some children \nmight inherit wealth from a family farm or business they didn't earn. \nYet we say the Government earned it even though these businesses have \nalready paid taxes on their profit, payroll, sales taxes, and property \ntaxes throughout the person's life.\n  We need to eliminate this death tax. It is un-American. This is our \nopportunity to vote for it today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I urge colleagues to resist this \namendment. If we want to blow a hole in the budget, this is the way to \ndo it. We have already addressed dramatic, important estate tax reform. \nThis completely eliminates the estate tax and blows a total hole in the \nbudget.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase funding for the COPS Program to $1.15 billion for \n   FY 2008 to provide state and local law enforcement with critical \nresources necessary to prevent and respond to violent crime and acts of \n  terrorism and is offset by an unallocated reduction to non-defense \n  discretionary spending and/or reduction to administrative expenses)\n\n       On page 23, line 12, increase the amount by $598,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 13, increase the amount by $72,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 17, increase the amount by $167,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 21, increase the amount by $150,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 25, increase the amount by $120,000,000.\n       On page 24, line 4, increase the amount by $90,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 12, decrease the amount by $598,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 13, decrease the amount by $72,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 17, decrease the amount by $167,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 21, decrease the amount by $150,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 25, decrease the amount by $120,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 4, decrease the amount by $90,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this amendment reinstates the COPS Program. \nI remind everyone, when the COPS Program was functioning, violent crime \nin America reduced 8.5 percent a year for 7 years in a row.\n  Mr. President, throughout the 1990s, we funded the COPS Program at \nroughly $1.2 billion, and it drove down crime. Now crime is rising \nagain. In every one of our States it is up. Violent crime is up across \nthe board. The Police Investigative Research Forum released a report \nwhich found that murders were up 10.6 percent in 2004.\n  The COPS Program in the crime bill worked, and the Government \nAccounting Office found a statistical link between the COPS grants and \na reduction in crime. The Brookings Institution reported the COPS \nProgram is one of the most cost-effective programs we have ever had in \nthis country. Local officials urgently need this support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be \nadded as cosponsors: Lieberman, Clinton, Salazar, Obama, Kohl, Harkin, \nBoxer, Kerry, Whitehouse, Dorgan, Dodd, Schumer, and all Democrats on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the COPS Program has some history here. It \nwas started by President Clinton. His position was, and he asked for, \n100,000 police officers. He said that when we got to 100,000, the \nprogram would stop. We got to 110,000 police officers and the program \ncontinues on and on and on.\n  This program should have ended 5 years ago or 6 years ago, but it \ncontinues. It is similar to so many Federal programs that get \nconstituencies that go on well past what their original purpose was. It \nmay be well intentioned, but we cannot afford it and we shouldn't \ncontinue it. It was never thought it would be continued this long.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Mr. President, this amendment really is symbolic of a lot \nof the things we are trying to work on. What it does is it focuses on \nextraneous funding that is directed toward supplemental spending bills, \nsupplemental funding for combat operation spending, which we expect to \nbe coming over from the House.\n  There are dozens and dozens of nondefense-related earmarks on this \nbill. We had a number of amendments which we have agreed not to vote \non, but just to vote on this one to make the point. We should not be \nadding $20 billion of extra spending on an emergency bill for our \ncombat operations. We certainly should not be adding $25 million for \nspinach growers. This amendment would eliminate, as part of our budget \nprocess, the accepting of spending for spinach in relation to emergency \nsupplemental spending for combat operations.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Bunning], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     594, as modified.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide a deficit-neutral reserve fund for protecting \n                     State flexibility in Medicaid)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DEFICIT-NEUTRAL RESERVE FUND FOR PROTECTING STATE \n                   FLEXIBILITY IN MEDICAID.\n\n       If the Committee on Finance reports a bill or joint \n     resolution, if an amendment is offered thereto, or if a \n     conference report is submitted thereon, that implements \n     improvements to Medicare, Medicaid, or the State Children's \n     Health Insurance Program, but that does not reduce the \n     ability of States to provide coverage to Medicaid recipients \n     through flexible benefit options that provide greater \n     opportunities to provide health benefits coverage for \n     Medicaid recipients, or alter the guarantee in section 1937 \n     of the Social Security Act of coverage of early and periodic \n     screening, diagnostic, and treatment services for children, \n     then, provided that the Committee is within its allocation as \n     provided under section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget may \n     revise allocations of new budget authority and outlays, the \n     revenue aggregates, and other appropriate measures to reflect \n     such legislation, provided that such legislation would not \n     increase the deficit for fiscal year 2008 and the period of \n     fiscal years 2008 through 2012.\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. My amendment is very simple. It gives Members a chance \nto go on record about supporting States' flexibility in Medicaid which \nCongress provided under the Deficit Reduction Act. My State and several \nothers have already used this flexibility to improve their Medicaid \nprograms. A vote for my amendment supports allowing States to designate \nbenefits that fit the specific needs of their State and population. A \nvote against it is support of a one-size-fits-all model for Medicaid.\n  Some people have tried to say this amendment tries to undercut the \nmandatory child care benefits under Medicaid. That is not true and \ncould not be further from the truth. In fact, the amendment we are \nvoting on clarifies that legislation could not alter Medicaid's \nmandatory coverage benefits for children.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to lend my support to the Bunning \namendment No. 594.\n  In the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, we gave the States the ability \nto create flexible benefit plans. Section 6044 of the Deficit Reduction \nAct established a new section 1937 in title XIX, which allows States \nthe option to provide a benefit package that meets a benchmark standard \nor benchmark equivalent standard of coverage for certain Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. Under this section, States are required to provide Early \nand Periodic Screening Diagnostic and Treatment, EPSDT, services to \nchildren enrolled in benchmark coverage or benchmark equivalent \ncoverage.\n  Specifically, section 1937(a)(1)(A) contained two related provisions. \nFirst, section 1937(a)(1)(A)(i), provides that States choosing to \nprovide coverage under this section must provide benchmark coverage or \nbenchmark equivalent coverage in the case of beneficiaries for whom a \nbenchmark is an option. Second, section 1937(a)(1)(A)(ii), provides \nthat in the case of children under age 19 receiving benchmark coverage \nor benchmark equivalent coverage, States must cover ``wraparound'' \nbenefits to the benchmark\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\ncoverage or benchmark equivalent coverage consisting of EPSDT services \nand benefits specified in section 1905(r). In other words, an EPSDT \n``wraparound'' consisting of all benefits and services enumerated in \nsection 1905(r) is a requirement for States electing the benchmark \noption or benchmark equivalent coverage. The use of the term \n``wraparound'' in this section should not be confused with the optional \n``wraparound'' flexibility afforded states under section 1937(a)(1)(C). \nThis section allows States to offer one or more ``wraparound'' benefits \nto enrollees, who otherwise would be limited to benchmark or benchmark \nequivalent coverage. EPSDT is not made optional but remains a required \nbenefit.\n  On March 31, 2006, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nCMS, issued guidance to states in a Dear State Medicaid Director letter \non the implementation of the benchmark coverage. The CMS letter stated \nthe following:\n\n       Individuals under age 19 who are covered under the State \n     plan under section 1902(a)(10)(A) of the Act must receive \n     wrap-around benefits to the benchmark, or benchmark-\n     equivalent plan, consisting of early and periodic screening, \n     diagnostic, and treatment (EPSDT) services defined in section \n     1905(r). Wrap-around benefits must be sufficient so that, in \n     combination with the benchmark or benchmark-equivalent \n     benefits package, these individuals receive the full EPSDT \n     benefit. The State plan must include a description of how \n     wrap-around benefits or additional services will be provided \n     to ensure that these beneficiaries receive full EPSDT \n     services.\n\n  It is my belief that the requirement of the provision of ESPDT to all \nchildren receiving benefits through a benchmark benefit package is a \nsettled issue, both as a matter of law and of implementation of the \nlaw.\n  Giving States the ability to design benefit packages that are \nappropriate to the people receiving the benefits is key to Medicaid's \nfuture. The purpose of this important provision is to free States from \na one-size-fits-all approach to Medicaid. Several States, including \nKentucky, West Virginia, Idaho and Kansas, are taking the lead with \nthese innovative plans to cover Medicaid recipients. We should resist \nany effort to limit the ability of the States to develop and implement \nthese flexible, benchmark benefit plans. This flexibility will \nstrengthen the long-term viability of the Medicaid Program and thereby \nprotects coverage for low income children, pregnant women and families.\n  A vote against the Bunning amendment is a vote against the tools that \nStates desperately need to manage their Medicaid Program. To me, the \nvote here is obvious. Vote to protect the Medicaid Program and state \nflexibility in Medicaid. Vote to protect the EPSDT benefit for \nchildren. Vote for the Bunning amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment does undermine the basis of \nMedicaid today, which is ``medically necessary services.'' The effect \nof this amendment is to allow States to lower health care coverage for \nlow-income kids. That is the effect of this amendment. Why do States \nwant more flexibility, especially with respect to this program? So \nbasically they can lower benefits. They can save money. There has been \na longstanding principle under Medicaid that Medicaid should provide \nmedically necessary services, such as immunizations or checkups, to \nlow-income kids, and that is the basis. We have to keep it. The effect \nof this amendment is to undermine that. If we stand for anything here, \nit is making sure low-income kids do not have less health care \nbenefits, at least. They should have more. This amendment would \nundermine that and allow States to have lower benefits for kids, and \nfor that reason it should be rejected.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, do we have any time on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

This is a program for children, not adults.\n  I yield the rest of my time to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, this is budget neutral and kid friendly. \nIt allows children to have access to health care and dentistry, and \nhealth care and mental health.

Mr. President, the underlying budget resolution expands \nSCHIP coverage. This amendment goes the other direction; it restricts \ncoverage. It creates a false choice saying we will take away here, we \nwill give there. The net effect of it is it restricts coverage for \nkids.\n  It is similar to--it is not exactly the same as, but it is similar to \nthe Cornyn amendment on SCHIP, which we defeated with a vote of 38 to \n59.\n  The long and short of it is, this does restrict SCHIP benefits.

Mr. President, this amendment deals with veterans. Many \nStates have first-time home-buy programs. They have tax-exempt programs \nthat allow people of low income to get access to mortgages at low \ninterest rates. By the wisdom of the Congress in 2006, the Tax Relief \nand Health Care Act of 2006 allowed veterans to participate, even if \nthey are not first-time home buyers. It is a benefit that expires \nJanuary 1, 2008. It allows veterans to participate in first-time home \nbuyer mortgage programs, even if they are not a first-time home buyer. \nThis is not the time to cut benefits for our returning heroes.

Mr. President, this amendment would repeal the 1993 AMT tax \nincrease that generally increased the AMT rates from 24 percent to a \ntwo-tiered 26 and 28 percent. This is one last opportunity on this \nresolution to correct the mistake we made in 1993, which began in 1969 \nwith the so-called alternative minimum tax. This was the guarantee that \nthe wealthy paid their fair share, ostensibly, but it has morphed into \na terrible tax on the middle class. This is not a full repeal like the \nearlier amendment. This is the one that actually addresses the problem \nwe created in 1993, the creeping rate increase that went from 24 to 26 \npercent. I urge colleagues to take this action to effectively deal with \nthe AMT problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me alert colleagues, if this amendment \nis adopted, we will be here until 2 o'clock this morning. I hope that \nsobers everybody's consideration on this matter.\n  On a serious note, the Lott amendment blows a hole in the budget \nbecause it is not paid for. It is not offset, $231 billion not paid \nfor. I urge colleagues to vote no. Let's not give up the gains we have \nmade in these hours of work to balance the budget by 2012. Please, \nreject the Lott amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of \n     the ruling of the chair on a point of order raised under this \n     section.\n       (d) General Point of Order.--It shall be in order for a \n     Senator to raise a single point of order that several \n     provisions of a bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report violate this section. The Presiding Officer \n     may sustain the point of order as to\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\n     some or all of the provisions against which the Senator \n     raised the point of order. If the Presiding Officer so \n     sustains the point of order as to some of the provisions \n     (including provisions of an amendment, motion, or conference \n     report) against which the Senator raised the point of order, \n     then only those provisions (including provision of an \n     amendment, motion, or conference report) against which the \n     Presiding Officer sustains the point of order shall be deemed \n     stricken pursuant to this section. Before the Presiding \n     Officer rules on such a point of order, any Senator may move \n     to waive such a point of order as it applies to some or all \n     of the provisions against which the point of order was \n     raised. Such a motion to waive is amendable in accordance \n     with rules and precedents of the Senate. After the Presiding \n     Officer rules on such a point of order, any Senator may \n     appeal the ruling of the Presiding Officer on such a point of \n     order as it applies to some or all of the provisions on which \n     the Presiding Officer ruled.\n       (e) Form of the Point of Order.--When the Senate is \n     considering a conference report on, or an amendment between \n     the Houses in relation to, a bill, upon a point of order \n     being made by any Senator pursuant to this section, and such \n     point of order being sustained, such material contained in \n     such conference report or amendment shall be deemed stricken, \n     and the Senate shall proceed to consider the question of \n     whether the Senate shall recede from its amendment and concur \n     with a further amendment, or concur in the House amendment \n     with a further amendment, as the case may be, which further \n     amendment shall consist of only that portion of the \n     conference report or House amendment, as the case may be, not \n     so stricken. Any such motion shall be debatable. In any case \n     in which such point of order is sustained against a \n     conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such \n     conference report by operation of this subsection), no \n     further amendment shall be in order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 518\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Smith \namendment No. 518 be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 518) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To fund the State Department, USAID, and other foreign \n   affairs agencies and their programs at the level requested by the \n                               President)\n\n       On page 9, line 8, increase the amount by $2,200,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 9, increase the amount by $1,049,400,000.\n       On page 9, line 13, increase the amount by $567,600,000.\n       On page 9, line 17, increase the amount by $224,400,000.\n       On page 9, line 21, increase the amount by $149,600,000.\n       On page 9, line 25, increase the amount by $121,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 12, decrease the amount by $2,200,000,000.\n       On page 26, line 13, decrease the amount by $1,049,400,000.\n       On page 26, line 17, decrease the amount by $567,600,000.\n       On page 26, line 21, decrease the amount by $224,400,000.\n       On page 26, line 25, decrease the amount by $149,600,000.\n       On page 27, line 4, decrease the amount by $121,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to explain why I \noffered an amendment with Senator Smith to increase the international \naffairs budget. Prior to the Budget Committee's consideration of the \n2008 international affairs budget, Senator Smith and I, along with many \nof our colleagues on both side of the aisle, circulated a letter to the \nBudget Committee asking for a significant increase in the international \naffairs budget.\n  I feel very strongly that given the myriad challenges facing the \nUnited States around the world, the international affairs budget needs \nbe more robustly funded.\n  As my colleagues know, this budget supports the people and programs \ndevoted to strengthening alliances, promoting peaceful relationships \namong nations, boosting economic development, eliminating poverty, and \nexplaining and representing U.S. policy abroad.\n  As my colleagues also know, the international affairs budget \nconstitutes just over 1 percent of Federal spending, yet it funds some \nof the most essential components of America's foreign policy, including \nour diplomatic service, foreign aid, international health programs, and \nemergency relief operations among others.\n  The international affairs budget provides the funding for the most \nimportant tools we have to implement our foreign policy. Robust funding \nis necessary to implement these critical programs and policies to fund \nAmerican diplomacy and global development, so that we can continue to \nexpand our leadership in the fight for freedom, prosperity and peace \nthroughout the world.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to vote for this budget \nresolution today. I believe this blueprint for the government's \nspending and revenues will help put us back on a fiscally responsible \npath.\n  Before I turn to the merits of this resolution, I want to address the \nfact that my amendment to establish a deficit neutral reserve fund to \npromote American manufacturing has been included in this resolution. I \nthank Senators Conrad and Gregg for accepting this amendment, and I \nlook forward to working with them and other Members to carry out its \nintent.\n  I believe that we must take strong and dramatic actions in this \nCongress to revitalize and support our domestic manufacturing sector. \nWe need to enhance our research and development programs, provide tax \nincentives to encourage and sustain domestic manufacturing, and level \nthe playing field for our domestic manufacturers in the global \nmarketplace. My amendment will be helpful as we fight in this Congress \nto take these important steps.\n  We need to stop the hemorrhaging of manufacturing jobs from the \nUnited States. Our economy and well-being are directly linked to the \nhealth of our manufacturing sector, yet we continue to lose \nmanufacturing jobs in this country. Since 2001, we have lost 3 million \nmanufacturing jobs nationwide--including more than 200,000 in my home \nState of Michigan.\n  Millions more manufacturing jobs hang in the balance. Our companies \nface enormous pressure in competing in the global marketplace without \nsufficient support from the U.S. government. Our companies are not \ncompeting against other companies overseas--they are competing against \nother governments that strongly support their manufacturing sectors.\n  We need to provide significant federal support for technology \ninitiatives and advances that will help keep our companies on the \ncutting edge of technology development and competitive in the global \nmarketplace. All of this requires a bold and comprehensive effort \nacross many segments of our federal government. It will involve many \ncommittees and many federal agencies, but I believe it is critical to \nstem the tide of the domestic manufacturing crisis occurring in this \ncountry.\n  My amendment points us in the direction we need to take. It will \nsupport legislation that would revitalize our domestic manufacturing \nsector in four critical ways--by increasing Federal research and \ndevelopment; by expanding the scope and effectiveness of manufacturing \nprograms across the Federal Government; basing support for development \nof alternative fuels and leap-ahead automotive and energy technologies; \nand by establishing tax incentives to encourage the continued \nproduction in the U.S. of advanced technologies and the infrastructure \nto support them.\n  There are many other parts of this resolution to be pleased with as \nwell. For too long now we have been digging deeper and deeper into a \nditch of debt. President Bush's budget submitted to Congress in \nFebruary would continue that trend by increasing the gross Federal debt \nby nearly $3 trillion to $11.5 trillion by 2012. That's $38,000 per \nperson. The budget resolution we are considering today should start to \nreverse that trend.\n  First, this resolution reestablishes a strong pay-go rule, which \nwould require any new spending or tax cuts to be paid for elsewhere in \nthe budget or receive a supermajority of at least 60 votes in the \nSenate. This concept is common sense for most families, who work to \nlive within their means by balancing what goes out with what comes in. \nI heartily welcome its return.\n  This budget also takes the positive steps of establishing a new \nbudget point of order against long-term deficit increases and allowing \nthe Senate's unique budget reconciliation process, which was abused in \nrecent years by the Republican majority, to be used for deficit \nreduction only, not to increase the deficit with measures which \notherwise could not pass the Senate.\n  This budget also sets a blueprint for going after our country's \nmassive $350 billion tax gap, which is the difference between the \namount of taxes owed by\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\ntaxpayers and the amount collected. One of the primary tax gap areas I \nhope Congress will focus on this year is the offshore tax haven and tax \nshelter abuses that are undermining the integrity of our tax system. \nThere are many ways Congress can go about tackling these problems, and \nI commend Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee for their \nwillingness to take on and push Congress to address these complicated \nareas. Cracking down on these abuses which shift the tax burden onto \nordinary taxpayers is a critical step toward achieving fairness in our \ntax system.\n  Additionally, I am pleased that this budget assumes an extension of \nalternative minimum tax, AMT, relief for 2 years. This is relief we \nknow is needed to avoid imposing this unintended tax increase on \nmillions of middle income families. This time frame gives the Finance \nCommittee time to work out a fix that is appropriate and, I hope, paid \nfor.\n  The two AMT amendments offered to this resolution which we considered \ntoday were not paid for. The amendment offered by Senator Lott would \nadd $231 billion to the debt over the next 5 years, and Senator \nGrassley's amendment would have cost $533 billion over that same time. \nWe must not only fix AMT, we must fix it responsibly.\n  Furthermore, I am pleased that this budget resolution supports our \nmen and women in uniform by providing all the funding requested by the \nPresident for national defense, for both the underlying national \ndefense program and the additional costs of operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. I believe our policy in Iraq must change, but I do not \nsupport attempts to cut off funds for our troops in the field. This \nresolution fully funds our forces at home and overseas, at the levels I \nand Senator McCain, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, \nrequested in our letter to the Budget Committee.\n  I also believe funding for these ongoing operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan should be accounted for in our budget, and that it was past \ntime the President and Congress stop treating these costs as if they \nwere unanticipated ``emergency'' expenditures. I am pleased that this \nresolution supports the request Senator McCain and I made to build \nthese costs into the budget.\n  This has two beneficial effects. First, it makes this budget more \nhonest about the cost of this war and the impact it has on our federal \ndeficit. Second, putting this spending into the regular budget process \nhelps ensure that funding requested for operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan will receive greater congressional oversight. I commend \nSenator Conrad for his continuing leadership on fiscal responsibility \nand accountability.\n  On the issue of funding for our Nation's veterans, I am pleased that \nthis resolution includes the resources needed to ensure that our \nveterans get the health care they deserve. In total, the resolution \nprovides more than $43 billion for the Veterans Affairs healthcare \nsystem--$3.5 billion more than President Bush's budget. Again, this \nyear, the Senate has rejected President Bush's proposal to raise \ncopayments and to impose new fees and higher copayments on certain \nveterans.\n  I am also pleased that this budget affirms the Senate's commitment to \nauthorize at an appropriate level the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, SCHIP, before it expires in September 2007. Making sure \nchildren have adequate health care should be one of our nation's top \npriorities. However, President Bush's budget would lead to the loss of \ncritical coverage in many states. It is imperative that we reject that \ninadequate proposal, and this budget resolution does that.\n  This budget also represents a significant improvement over the \nPresident's budget for education. There are more funds for Pell grants, \nIDEA, and No Child Left Behind Act than the President requested. It \nwould be shameful to fail in our responsibility to our children to \nadopt a spending blueprint that does not provide our schools the \nresources they need.\n  I am also pleased that this budget rejects the broad array of cuts to \nenvironmental protection programs that were included in the President's \nbudget. This budget resolution fully funds the Environmental Protection \nAgency's programs to support clean and safe drinking water, and \nincreases funding for the Superfund program by $211 million over the \nlevel in the President's budget. The budget also provides about $900 \nmillion more for the EPA than the President's budget. This bill also \nprotects Federal lands by rejecting President Bush's proposal to assume \nrevenues from proposals to sell Federal lands.\n  I am also heartened that the budget rejects the President's proposal \nto drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR.\n  Further, I also support the Senate's adoption of an amendment to fund \nthe Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, at $3.2 billion, \nwhich will ensure that more households can be served by this very \nimportant program. Unfortunately, this program has been woefully \nunderfunded by President Bush's budget, as well as in past years.\n  I also want to talk a bit about a couple more of the amendments we \nvoted on today. I support extending tax cuts for low- and middle-income \ntaxpayers. However, I opposed Senator Graham's amendment because it \nwould have extended the excessive tax cuts for those in the highest \nincome bracket which I have opposed from the first time we voted on it \nin 2001, and which we simply can't afford.\n  I also opposed an estate tax amendment offered by Senator Ben Nelson. \nI would support legislation to prevent a return to the 2001 exemption \nlevel, which is too low and no longer appropriate. The current law \nestate tax exemption level for 2009 of $3.5 million, $7 million for \ncouples, is appropriate and results in only one-third of one percent of \nestates owing any estate tax. I also had concerns about the Nelson \namendment because it proposed a reduction of the rate to 35 percent, \nwhich would be a huge loss to the treasury and the amendment does not \nspecify how the revenue needed to keep these changes from increasing \nthe deficit would be raised.\n  It is a welcome change to be voting for a budget resolution that I \nbelieve can change the failed fiscal policies and irresponsible tax \ncuts pushed by this administration. This resolution paves the way for \nimportant investments in America's future to put our country back on \ntrack and to begin the long process of climbing out of the ditch of \ndebt.\n  Mr. President, during this budget debate there have been different \nviews expressed regarding the amount of revenue that would result if \nCongress will go after the offshore tax haven and tax shelter abuses \nthat are undermining the integrity of our tax system. There are many \nways Congress can go about tackling these problems, and I commend \nChairman Conrad and the Budget Committee for their willingness to take \non and push Congress to address these complicated areas. Cracking down \non these abuses is a critical step toward achieving fairness in our tax \nsystem.\n  If Congress addresses these inequities, it would also bring in \nbillions of dollars needed to pay for many important national \npriorities. These priorities are recognized in this budget resolution \nitself, such as education, children's health care, veterans medical \ncare, community development block grants, and law enforcement. We can \ngo a long way toward paying for these critical programs by stopping \nthese tax dodges that rob the Treasury of up to $100 billion a year, \nand shift the tax burden from high-income persons and companies who are \nprincipal users of offshore tax havens onto the backs of middle-income \nfamilies who pay their taxes.\n  For many years, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, of \nwhich I am chairman, has been looking at the problem of offshore \ncorporate, bank, and tax secrecy laws and practices that help taxpayers \ndodge their U.S. tax obligations by preventing U.S. tax authorities \nfrom gaining access to key financial and beneficial ownership \ninformation.\n  The subcommittee has also spent years looking at abusive tax \nshelters, which are complicated transactions promoted to provide tax \nbenefits unintended by the Tax Code. They are very different from \nlegitimate tax shelters, such as deducting the interest paid on home \nmortgages or congressionally approved tax deductions for building \naffordable housing. Some abusive tax\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\nshelters involve complicated domestic transactions; others make use of \noffshore shenanigans. All abusive tax shelters are marked by one \ncharacteristic: no real economic or business rationale other than tax \navoidance.\n  I would like to talk briefly about what we found during those \ninvestigations. I think the specifics help make clear that if we have \nthe political will, these are areas ripe with abuses that we can put an \nend to.\n  Offshore Investigation. During its year long investigation into \noffshore tax haven abuses, the subcommittee issued more than 70 \nsubpoenas, conducted more than 80 interviews, and reviewed more than 2 \nmillion pages of documents. In the resulting hearing held in August \n2006, the subcommittee showed through case studies that offshore tax \nhaven countries have, in effect, declared economic war on honest U.S. \ntaxpayers by giving tax dodgers a way to avoid their U.S. tax bills and \nleave them for others to pay. Offshore tax havens attract these tax \ndodgers by shrouding their financial transactions in a ``black box'' of \nsecrecy that is extremely difficult to penetrate. They sell secrecy to \nattract customers and reward them with low or no taxes.\n  This legal black box allows tax dodgers to hide assets, mask who \ncontrols them, and obscure how their assets are used. An army of \n``offshore service providers'' lawyers, bankers, brokers, and others \nthen joins forces to exploit the impenetrable curtain of secrecy and \nhelp clients skirt U.S. tax, securities, and antimoney laundering laws. \nMany of the firms concocting or facilitating these schemes are \nrespected names here in the United States.\n  These schemes require the secrecy of tax havens because they can't \nstand the light of day. Our investigation laid out six case studies \nthat illustrated the scope and seriousness of the problem. In one case, \ntwo U.S. citizens moved about $190 million in untaxed stock option \ncompensation offshore to a complex array of 58 offshore trusts and \ncorporations and utilized a wide range of offshore mechanisms to \nexercise direction over these assets and hundreds of millions of \ndollars in investment gains. These untaxed earnings were then used to \nfinance business ventures, acquire real estate, provide loans, and buy \nart, furnishings and jewelry for the personal use of the family \nmembers.\n  Much of this elaborate scheme involved an offshore bank and an \nadministrative services firm for offshore entities, both housed in a \nbuilding in the Cayman Islands that we have shown a few times on the \nSenate floor during this budget debate, the Ugland House. Believe it or \nnot, the building is the official address of 12,748 companies. Just \nhaving a post office box in the building enables these shell companies \nto shift profits that otherwise should be reported as taxable income in \nthe country where it is actually earned.\n  In another case study, two offshore shell corporations engaged in \nfake stock transactions, seeming to trade stock back and forth as if it \nwere fantasy baseball to create the illusion of economic activity. The \nshell corporations pretended to run up hundreds of millions of dollars \nin fake stock losses and then used these phantom losses to offset about \n$2 billion in real capital gains of the promoters' U.S. clients. The \nresult was $300 million in lost tax revenues to the Treasury. This \noffshore scheme would be comical because of its complexity but for the \nsobering fact that these tax haven abuses are eating away at the fabric \nof the U.S. tax system and undermining U.S. laws intended to safeguard \nour capital markets and financial systems from financial crime.\n  Our investigation shone a needed spotlight into the black box of \noffshore tax havens. It revealed a system that is corrupt and \ncorrupting. Honest Americans are footing the bill for tax haven abuses, \nand it is long past time for Congress to shut those abuses down.\n  Abusive Tax Shelters. In addition to offshore shenanigans, there are \nplenty of homegrown tax shelters being used to dodge taxes. For 5 \nyears, our subcommittee has also been conducting investigations into \nthe design, sale, and implementation of these complex transactions that \nhave no economic or business rationale other than to avoid tax. Our \nfirst hearing on this topic in recent years was held in January 2002, \nwhen the subcommittee examined an abusive tax shelter purchased by \nEnron. In November 2003, the subcommittee held 2 days of hearings and \nreleased a staff report that pulled back the curtain on how even some \nrespected accounting firms, banks, investment advisors, and law firms \nhad become engines pushing the design and sale of abusive tax shelters \nto corporations and individuals across this country. In February 2005, \nthe subcommittee issued a bipartisan report that provided further \ndetails on the role these professional firms played in the \nproliferation of these abusive shelters. Our subcommittee report was \nendorsed by the full Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs in April 2005. Most recently, a 2006 subcommittee staff report \nentitled, ``Tax Haven Abuses: The Enablers, the Tools, and Secrecy,'' \ndisclosed how financial and legal professionals designed and sold yet \nanother abusive tax shelter known as the POINT Strategy, which depended \non secrecy laws and practices in the Isle of Man to conceal the phantom \nnature of securities trades that lay at the center of that tax shelter \ntransaction.\n\n  The subcommittee investigations have found that many abusive tax \nshelters are not dreamed up by the taxpayers who use them. Instead, \nmost are devised by tax professionals, such as accountants, bankers, \ninvestment advisors, and lawyers, who then sell the tax shelter to \nclients for a fee. In fact, as our 2003 investigation widened, we found \na large number of tax advisors cooking up one complex scheme after \nanother, packaging them up as generic ``tax products'' with boiler-\nplate legal and tax opinion letters, and then undertaking elaborate \nmarketing schemes to peddle these products to literally thousands of \npersons across the country. In return, these tax shelter promoters were \ngetting hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, while diverting \nbillions of dollars in tax revenues from the U.S. Treasury each year.\n  For example, one shelter investigated by the subcommittee and \nfeatured in the 2003 hearings has since become part of an IRS effort to \nsettle cases involving a set of abusive tax shelters known as ``Son of \nBoss.'' Following our hearing, more than 1,200 taxpayers have admitted \nwrongdoing and agreed to pay back taxes, interest, and penalties \ntotaling more than $3.7 billion. That is billions of dollars the IRS \nhas collected on just one type of tax shelter, demonstrating both the \ndepth of the problem and the potential for progress. The POINT shelter \nfeatured in our 2006 hearing involved another $300 million in taxes \nlost to the Treasury on transactions conducted by just six taxpayers.\n  Tax Levies on Federal Contractors Who Don't Pay Their Taxes. That is \nnot all. For the last 4 years, our subcommittee has been focusing \nattention on another sector of the tax gap involving Federal \ncontractors who don't pay their taxes. These contractors are stuffing \ntheir pockets with taxpayer dollars, while stiffing Uncle Sam by not \npaying their taxes.\n  Past subcommittee hearings have exposed the fact that there are about \n27,000 defense contractors with $3 billion in unpaid taxes; 33,000 \ncontractors with other Federal agencies who owe $3.3 billion in unpaid \ntax debt; and 3,800 GSA contractors with $1.4 billion in unpaid tax \ndebt. Earlier this week, another subcommittee hearing put the spotlight \non 21,000 Medicare physicians and related medical suppliers with $1.3 \nbillion in unpaid tax debt. These mind-boggling numbers represent tens \nof thousands of companies putting their hand in the taxpayers' wallet, \nwhile dodging billions of dollars in tax obligations.\n  A key program designed to stop this type of abuse is the Federal \nPayment Levy Program. This program was enacted about 10 years ago to \nenable the Federal Government to identify Federal payments being made \nto tax deadbeats, and to withhold a portion of those taxpayer dollars \nto pay off a portion of the person's tax debt. For the last 4 years, \nour subcommittee has conducted an intensive effort to strengthen the \ntax levy program for Federal contractors who don't pay their taxes. As \na result, over the past 3 years, tax levy collections as a whole have \nmore than doubled, increasing from about $136 million in 2004 to nearly \n$340 million in 2006. Of these totals, tax levy collections from \nFederal contractors in particular have also more than doubled, \nincreasing from about $28 million\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\nto $62 million. But $62 million is only a fraction of the billions of \nuncollected taxes owed by Federal contractors getting paid hundreds of \nbillions in taxpayer dollars. Much more can and should be done to \nreduce the Federal tax gap by increasing tax levy collections.\n  The first step would be to require the Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services to move as quickly as possible to make all $450 \nbillion Medicare and Medicaid payments each year subject to the tax \nlevy program, so that all of these taxpayer dollars are screened for \nrepayment of tax debt. The next step would be to strengthen the tax \nlevy program as a whole. In 2006, for example, the Federal Government \nidentified a total of about $122 billion in assessed tax debt that \ncould be collected, in part, through the tax levy program. At the same \ntime, it determined that only about 45 percent of that uncollected tax \ndebt was actually matched against the Federal payments being made that \nyear. In other words, in 2006, some $67 billion in tax debt was never \n``turned on'' for actual collection under the tax levy program.\n  Simple reforms could ensure that a lot more of that $67 billion is \nset up for collection under the tax levy program. One key barrier right \nnow, for example, is an elaborate series of tax levy notices, mandated \nby law, that currently have to be issued by the IRS before tax debt can \nbe collected through the tax levy program. While the tax levy notices \nmake sense if the Federal Government is targeting payments being \nprovided by a third party, such as an employer, they make a lot less \nsense when the levy is targeting taxpayer dollars going to the very \npeople who owe the tax debt. For that reason, Senator Coleman and I \nplan to introduce legislation to reform the tax levy notice process for \nFederal payments. We also plan to strengthen other aspects of the tax \nlevy program to start narrowing that multibillion-dollar tax gap.\n  IRS Enforcement Efforts to Reduce the Tax Gap. In our efforts to \nreducing the tax gap, it will be critical that we give the IRS the \nfunds it needs to go after tax dodgers. For every dollar invested in \nthe IRS's budget, the service yields more than $4 in enforcement \nrevenue. Beyond the additional revenues collected, increased IRS \nenforcement deters those who might otherwise have dodged their tax \nobligations and reassures honest taxpayers that compliance with the law \nis broadly achieved.\n  I am pleased that this budget resolution fully funds the President's \nbudget request for the IRS, and includes an additional $399 million \navailable for IRS enforcement activities. I can't think of many better \ninvestments to recover revenues wrongfully lost to the U.S. Treasury \nand to build respect for the law and respect for the honest Americans \nwho play by the rules and meet their tax obligations.\n  Scope of Problem. The abusive tax shelters and offshore case studies \nthat the subcommittee has delved into are merely a handful of examples \nthat can be used to better understand the details behind these \nwidespread problems.\n\n  Because secrecy is such a key component of offshore abuses, it is \nincredibly difficult to estimate just how much income is sheltered \noffshore. Recent estimates from tax experts, Joe Guttentag and Reuven \nAvi-Yonah, estimate that offshore tax haven abuses by individuals cost \nthe U.S. Treasury between $40 billion and $70 billion a year in taxes \nthat are owed but not collected.\n  Corporations are also using tax havens to avoid payment of U.S. \ntaxes. Preliminary results from a study to be released soon by Kimberly \nClausing of Wellesley College show that $50 billion in U.S. revenue was \nlost in 2002 from profit-shifting by corporations to low-tax countries. \nA GAO report Senator Dorgan and I released in 2004 found that nearly \ntwo-thirds of the top 100 companies doing business with the U.S. \nGovernment had one or more subsidiaries in a tax haven. One company, \nTyco International, had 115. Enron, in its heyday, had over 400 Cayman \nsubsidiaries.\n  Data released by the Commerce Department further demonstrates the \nextent of U.S. corporate use of tax havens, indicating that, as of \n2001, almost half of all foreign profits of U.S. corporations were in \ntax havens. A study released by the journal, ``Tax Notes'' in September \n2004 found that American companies were able to shift $149 billion of \nprofits to 18 tax haven countries in 2002, up 68 percent from $88 \nbillion in 1999.\n  A 2004 study by Professor John Zdanowicz found that transfer pricing \nabuses by corporations cost the U.S. Treasury $53 billion a year. Last \nyear the IRS settled a transfer pricing dispute with one company alone, \ndrug giant Glaxo SmithKline, for $3.4 billion. The size of this \nsettlement with just one company indicates that it is worth looking to \nsee if there are ways to improve the relevant portions of the Tax Code. \nTreasury has proposed regulations in this area, and I urge the \nadministration to finalize those rules in as strong a form as possible. \nI also urge the Finance Committee and others to make it a priority to \nstop these transfer pricing abuses that are hurting average taxpayers \nas well as disadvantaging U.S. companies that play by the rules.\n  How to Address the Problem. One of the big questions that surrounds \nall of this is how to start addressing these problems. I have a bill \nthat would be a huge step in the right direction. We can't let the \noffshore tax havens hide $100 billion in U.S. tax revenues which are \nneeded to protect our troops, fund health care and education, and meet \nthe other needs of American families. We cannot tolerate high-priced \naccountants, lawyers, and banks concocting ways for tax cheats to \noffload their unpaid taxes onto the backs of honest taxpayers. That is \nwhy earlier this year I introduced the Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, along \nwith Senators Coleman and Obama. This bill provides a powerful set of \nnew tools to clamp down on offshore tax and tax shelter abuses.\n  Among other measures, our bill would:\n  Establish Presumptions to Combat Offshore Secrecy by allowing U.S. \ntax and securities law enforcement to presume that nonpublicly traded, \noffshore corporations and trusts are controlled by the U.S. taxpayers \nwho formed them or sent them assets, and to presume that money moving \nbetween U.S. taxpayers and offshore entities is taxable income, unless \nthe taxpayer proves otherwise;\n  Impose Tougher Requirements on U.S. Taxpayers Using Offshore Secrecy \nJurisdictions by listing 34 jurisdictions which have already been named \nin IRS court filings as probable locations for U.S. tax evasion;\n  Authorize Special Measures to Stop Offshore Tax Abuses by giving \nTreasury authority to take special measures against foreign \njurisdictions and financial institutions that impede U.S. tax \nenforcement;\n  Strengthen Detection of Offshore Activities by requiring U.S. \nfinancial institutions that open accounts for foreign entities \ncontrolled by U.S. clients, open accounts in offshore secrecy \njurisdictions for U.S. clients, or establish entities in offshore \nsecrecy jurisdictions for U.S. clients, to report such actions to the \nIRS;\n  Close Offshore Trust Loopholes by taxing offshore trust income used \nto buy real estate, artwork and jewelry for U.S. persons, and treating \nas trust beneficiaries those persons who actually receive offshore \ntrust assets;\n  Strengthen Penalties on tax shelter promoters by increasing the \nmaximum fine to 150 percent of their ill-gotten gains, and on corporate \ninsiders who hide offshore stock holdings by increasing the maximum \nfine on them to $1 million per violation of U.S. securities laws;\n  Stop Tax Shelter Patents by prohibiting the U.S. Patent and Trademark \nOffice from issuing patents for ``inventions designed to minimize, \navoid, defer, or otherwise affect liability for Federal, State, local, \nor foreign tax''.\n  This is only a partial list of a host of innovative measures we have \nincluded in our bill to strengthen the ability of Federal regulators to \ncombat offshore tax haven and tax shelter abuses. We believe these new \ntools merit congressional attention and enactment this year if we are \ngoing to begin to make a serious dent in the $100 billion in annual \nlost tax revenue from offshore tax abuses that forces honest taxpayers \nto shoulder a greater tax burden than they would otherwise have to \nbear.\n  Tax cheats make it harder to maintain our highways, protect our \nborders, advance medical research, and inspect our food. They make it \ndifficult to give needed tax relief to small businesses\n\n[[Page S3691]]\n\nand middle-income victims of the alternative minimum tax. They also \ndeepen the deficit ditch that threatens the economic well-being of our \nchildren and grandchildren. The assumptions made in this budget \nresolution that we can raise ample revenues by shutting them down are \nnot only reasonable, they are crucial to maintaining the integrity of \nour tax system. I applaud Chairman Conrad and the Budget Committee, as \nwell as the Finance Committee and Chairman Baucus, for their hard \nfought efforts on this front, and I look forward to working with them \nand other allies on this issue as we address these problems later this \nyear.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support this budget resolution. For the \nlast few years, I have not been able to support the budget resolution \nbecause it focused on the wrong priorities. I would like to commend \nSenate Budget Committee Chairman Conrad for crafting a budget \nresolution that focuses on the right priorities.\n  Today, we have before us a resolution that restores fiscal sanity to \nthe budget process. It recognizes the realities of our current and \nfuture financial situation. This resolution eliminates the deficit by \n2012 and unlike the Bush administration's budget it does not leave out \nimportant costs like the funding of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand addressing the individual alternative minimum tax, AMT.\n  This budget resolution returns discipline to the budget process. It \nrestores the pay-as-you-go-rule which was essential to reducing the \ndeficit in the 1990s. It includes a provision which requires the \nreconciliation process to be used for deficit reduction. The \nreconciliation process was designed to set-up a procedure to expedite \nthe passage of legislation. It was used successfully to reduce the \ndeficit, but in recent years it was used to pass debt-financed tax \ncuts. Today, we are restoring the reconciliation process to its \noriginal purpose--deficit reduction.\n  The priority of the Administration's budget is to make permanent the \n2001 and 2003 tax cuts--at the expense of hard working families. This \nbudget puts families first; it puts education first; it puts health \ncare first. It is a resolution we can and should be proud of, \nparticularly because we will be reauthorizing the Higher Education Act \nand No Child Left Behind this year. Now we know we will have enough \nmoney to make a difference with our legislation.\n  This resolution specifically and substantially addresses one of my \nlegislative priorities--providing health insurance to children. In \n2005, 361,000 children under the age of 18 were added to the rolls of \nthe uninsured, the first time in almost a decade that the number of \nchildren without insurance in this country increased. This brings the \ntotal number of uninsured children under the age of 21 to a staggering \n11 million. Thankfully, this budget begins to put kids first.\n  Under the resolution, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nS-CHIP, will be funded with an additional $50 billion over the next \nfive years. This will maintain coverage for all currently enrolled \nchildren and enable coverage to be expanded to the estimated six \nmillion children that are eligible for, but not enrolled in, public \nhealth insurance programs. I will continue to work on this issue to \nensure that every child in America gets the health care coverage they \ndeserve: Their health and our future depend upon it.\n  This budget resolution includes many deficit-neutral reserve funds \nwhich will allow us to address our priorities in a fiscally responsible \nmanner, including a fund for small business health care. Recently, \nSenator Snowe and I held a hearing on this issue in the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship. This hearing provided a blueprint \nfor how we can move forward to provide small business owners the relief \nthey need from rising premium costs while also ensuring that more \nemployees of small firms have access to affordable, meaningful health \ncare coverage.\n  I have introduced legislation that would provide small businesses \nwith refundable tax credits to help with the cost of providing their \nemployees with coverage. I am also working on reinsurance legislation \nthat would help small businesses with catastrophic costs. Small \nbusiness health care needs to be addressed this year. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on this issue.\n  This budget makes veterans a priority. Our veterans have admirably \nserved their country and should receive the best health care that we \ncan provide them. To follow through on this promise this budget \nresolution includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to make sure that \nveterans receive necessary treatments and services.\n  I offered an amendment which ensures that this reserve fund addresses \nthe needs of low-vision and blinded veterans. More and more of our \nbrave soldiers returning from Iraq are coming home with serious eye \ninjuries, mainly caused by traumatic brain injury. We must do our best \nto provide vision rehabilitation and screening services to try and save \nthe sight of these veterans. The statistics are staggering: from March \n2003 to April 2005, 16 percent of all causalities from Iraq had direct \neye injuries. Between Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval Hospital they have \nperformed over 1,200 emergency eye surgeries. I am pleased that my \namendment passed so that low-vision and blinded veterans will get the \nservices they deserve.\n  I am pleased that this budget resolution puts an end to the myth that \ntax cuts pay for themselves. During the debate on this budget \nresolution, many of my colleagues argued that this resolution \nrepresents a tax increase. That is wrong. This budget provides a \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund for tax relief. This will give the Finance \nCommittee the opportunity to evaluate the tax cuts and extend them in a \nrevenue neutral manner.\n  This budget addresses the individual AMT for 2007 and 2008. The \nAdministration's budget only addresses this AMT for 2007. The \nresolution will prevent new taxpayers from being impacted by the AMT \nfor the next 2 years and gives us time to work on a fiscally \nresponsible solution. We need to address the AMT so it no longer \npunishes families with children that live in high tax States. Without \naddressing the AMT, there will be a hidden tax increase on the middle \nclass.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this fiscally responsible budget \nresolution that puts families first.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as the Senate concludes debate on the fiscal \nyear 2008 budget resolution, I would like to thank Chairman Conrad and \nSenator Gregg for all of their hard work at the mark-up last week. We \nhad a constructive debate, and while I did not vote for the product, I \nrespect the process and way he ran the committee mark-up. I know that \ncrafting an annual budget is a difficult task. I also want to \nacknowledge the importance of writing and passing a budget resolution. \nThis document is a vital part of the operation of Congress. It sets a \nfiscal blueprint that Congress will follow for the year, and \nestablishes procedural hurdles when these guidelines are not adhered \nto.\n  As an accountant, I think it is a valuable exercise to review our \nNation's overall priorities. I was disappointed to learn that the \ncommittee-reported resolution, adopted on a party-line vote, doesn't do \nmore to promote economic growth and limit overall government spending. \nThis is a tax-and-spend, big-government budget. It assumes that the tax \ncuts will expire as scheduled under current law, resulting in $900 \nbillion in tax increases for Americans. The Democratic budget also far \noutspends the President's discretionary budget request. The committee-\nreported resolution allows for $949 billion in regular, nonemergency \nbudget authority to the appropriations committee, $18 billion more than \nthe President's requested level of $933 billion.\n  It also does nothing, on net, to reduce mandatory spending. Our \nNation's mandatory health programs are growing each year by more than 6 \npercent--an unsustainable level--and last week the Budget Committee \nrejected, on party-line votes, two amendments that would have included \nreconciliation instructions to the Finance Committee to contain this \nspending.\n  I have a legislative track record of fiscal responsibility and \nmeaningful deficit reduction. In 2005, under the Deficit Reduction Act, \nthe Republican Congress was able to produce nearly $40 billion in \nspending cuts. I am proud that under my chairmanship, the HELP \nCommittee led the entire Congress in deficit reduction, and produced\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\n$15.5 billion in savings--that is 40 percent of the entire law.\n  But that was then. Let me restate that now, the budget resolution we \nare debating on the floor of the Senate does nothing to reduce net \nmandatory spending. It's not right to overspend now--and pass the bill \non to our children and grandchildren to pay later. I challenge the \nSenate to work across party lines and do more to shore up our \neconomic future. If one-half of the Senate authorizing committees equal \nthe level of deficit reduction this year that the HELP Committee \nachieved in 2005, the deficit would be reduced by an additional $100 \nbillion. But this week, similar to the mark-up last week, the Senate \nrejected multiple amendments to reform our Nation's largest entitlement \nprograms and slow the growth in mandatory spending.\n\n  In my role as lead Republican on the HELP Committee, I will continue \nto use the reauthorization process to stretch Federal dollars the \nfarthest--ensuring that programs are cost effective and not \nduplicative, so that precious Federal funds touch as many people as \npossible.\n  I will also look for an avenue this year to address health care \naccess and affordability. As my colleagues know, last year Senator Ben \nNelson and I introduced legislation that would allow business and trade \nassociations to band their members together in small business health \nplans, and offer group health coverage on a national or statewide \nbasis. This legislation, The Health Insurance Marketplace and \nModernization and Affordability Act, was a direct response to the \nrunaway costs that are driving Americans and small businesses away from \nthe health insurance marketplace.\n  The HELP Committee has a role to play in making employer-sponsored \nhealth care more accessible and affordable. Employer-provided health \ninsurance is voluntary--and it is in critical condition. Sixty percent \nof the country's employers offer insurance today, down 9 percent from \njust 5 years ago. And the cost of health insurance for companies has \nnearly doubled in that same period--with employers expected to pay an \naverage of $8,167 per employee family, versus $4,248 5 years ago.\n  Progress on this critical issue is moving forward, and bipartisan \ndiscussions are promising. Last year we built a very solid foundation, \nwhich continues to grow.\n  We are continuing to move forward on this issue and to deal with \noutstanding concerns. I am actively engaged in negotiations with other \nmembers of this body on how best to craft that proposal.\n  Rather, the best way to achieve real small business health care \nreform is to proceed forcefully to build on the significant progress we \nmade last year. Development of small business health legislation is a \nprocess that is well along, and I believe success is in sight. We are \non a promising track, and we should stick with it. America's small \nbusinesses deserve no less than our sincere commitment to make this \neffort a success.\n  I also want to mention progress on another HELP-related bill, mental \nhealth parity legislation. In February, the HELP Committee favorably \nreported the Domenici-Kennedy-Enzi compromise parity bill on a \nbipartisan vote of 18-3. It is the product of more than 2 years of \nbipartisan negotiations and supported by more than 60 organizations. I \nam pleased that Senator Domenici authored a deficit-neutral reserve \nfund for mental health parity legislation at the mark-up last week. \nThis reserve fund will serve as a placeholder in the budget for our \ncompromise legislation, which focuses on a benefit, not a mandate.\n  Lastly, I would like to call attention to an amendment that I offered \nat the Budget mark-up last week, and reoffered on the floor. The \namendment is very simple: it establishes a 60-vote threshold for \nlegislation that imposes unfunded mandates on the private sector, in \nexcess of the $131 million threshold for fiscal year 2007 established \nin the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, UMRA.\n  A 60-vote point of order currently applies to legislation that \nimposes unfunded mandates on State and local governments. I think the \nSenate should have a new 60-vote point of order that applies to \nlegislation that creates unfunded private sector mandates. We here in \nWashington must stop thinking that we have a monopoly on good ideas. \nThis is a commonsense proposal, and should have been approved.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to mention a few programs that \nare important to Wyoming.\n  As our Nation's most abundant energy source, coal must play a central \nrole in electrical generation for years to come. In order for that to \nhappen, we need to continue finding ways to make coal generation \ncleaner. Programs like the Clean Coal Power Initiative will play a \nmajor role in making that happen and so I support increased funding of \nthis program.\n  We also need to see proper funding of the Federal loan guarantee \nprogram. Federal loan guarantees can play an important role in \ndeveloping new energy projects. It is my hope that we can provide \nenough funding to get some of these projects off the drawing board, and \nmost specifically, I hope that we provide funding to the Department of \nEnergy to move forward with loan guarantees for coal-to-liquids \nprojects. Coal-to-liquids technology has the potential to help reduce \nour Nation's dependence on foreign energy barons and should be \nexplored.\n  In addition, funding for rural air service and maintenance is \nessential for states like Wyoming. Without Federal support through \nessential air service and airport improvement programs, many rural \ncommunities would have no commercial air service and extremely limited \ngeneral aviation. I hope this issue will be part of the debate on the \nreauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration this year. I \nencourage my colleagues to recognize the importance of this funding, \nnot only as a matter of dependability, but also as a public safety \nissue.\n\n  I want to mention two additional issues of great importance to \nWyoming and other rural States; housing and homelessness. The McKinney \nVento Homelessness Assistance Act is the primary law through which \nCongress funds homelessness programs in the United States. \nUnfortunately, rural States have historically received very little of \nthis money. Yet rural States must confront homelessness too, and the \ngeographic size of our States further complicates our efforts. In \nresponse to this, Congress authorized the Rural Homelessness Grant \nProgram in 1992 under the McKinney-Vento Act. This program provides \nfunding for transitional housing and education services in rural \nStates, as well as rental or down-payment assistance. The intent of \nthis program is to level the playing field between rural and urban \nStates. Unfortunately, this program has never been appropriated funds \nsince its creation, so the purpose of this program has never been \nfulfilled, and rural states continue to suffer. This can be a valuable \nprogram for rural States like Wyoming.\n  I would like to briefly call attention to the Small Business \nAdministration. I serve on the Small Business Committee and enjoy using \nmy small business experience to help make a difference in the lives of \nmany people in Wyoming and throughout the country. We are working in \nWyoming to stabilize and steadily grow our small businesses through the \nutilization of the Small Business Innovation Research, SBIR, program. \nThe risk and expense of conducting serious research and development \nefforts are often beyond the means of many small businesses, especially \nrural small businesses. By reserving a specific percentage of Federal \nR funds for small business, SBIR enables small businesses to compete \non the same level as larger businesses and stimulate high-tech \ninnovation in their rural States.\n  The FAST and Rural Outreach programs are congressionally authorized \nprograms that provide technical assistance that helps Wyoming's small \nbusinesses utilize the SBIR program.\n  Finally, the Agriculture Committee has a big task in reauthorizing \nthe farm bill this year. Writing a tight budget that will help us reach \nour long-term fiscal goals is a priority for me. However, we also need \nto provide adequate funding in the budget for the farm bill. Though you \ncannot tell by the name, the farm bill affects the lives of many \nunsuspecting Americans. Policies and projects for distance learning, \nconservation, food assistance, renewable fuels, and our forests are\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\nprovided for in the farm bill, in addition to the well-known commodity \nprograms.\n  The Senate should reject this tax and spend budget. It increases \ntaxes on working families by $900 billion, creates a spending spree on \nthe Government's credit card and does nothing to contain runaway \nentitlement spending.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to support the fiscal \nyear 2008 budget resolution and our Budget chairman, Senator Conrad, \nwho has done an extraordinary job in developing such a thoughtful \nresolution.\n  This budget resolution helps to get our country back on the right \nfiscal track, and it highlights many priorities for American families \nthat were neglected or ignored over the last few years. For example, \nthis resolution increases discretionary education funding by about $9 \nbillion so that we can invest in title 1, IDEA and improving Pell \ngrants and student aid.\n  Another important change is the investment in our veterans by \nproviding $3.5 billion more for the VA. This resolution approximately \nmatches the funding request of the veteran's organizations, known as \nthe independent budget. It is a travesty that VA has been underfunded \nin the past as veterans are returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. In \nWest Virginia, I host confidential roundtables to listen in private to \nour returning veterans. I want to hear from them personally about their \nexperience in combat, and their care and treatment after they come \nhome. I am deeply disturbed by stories of hassles to get medical \nappointment and lengthy delays in processing claims for benefits. Every \nveteran who has bravely served our Nation deserves timely and quality \ncare and benefits. Because of the violence and intense combat, many of \nour returning veterans want and need mental health care. We have a \nmoral obligation to care for our veterans, both those coming home today \nand the aging veterans of WWII, Korea and Vietnam. This budget \nresolution is a meaningful downpayment to fulfill our obligations. It \nwill let us investment in mental health care, and begin to improve our \nVA benefits system so that wounded soldiers do not have to wait \nridiculous amounts of time to get their benefit claims resolved.\n  One part of this resolution that is deeply important to me is the \ninvestment of $50 billion for reauthorization of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, CHIP. In 1997, I fought hard to create this program, \nand I am enormously proud of the success of CHIP in providing insurance \ncoverage to children. In my own State of West Virginia, there are \nnearly 40,000 children covered through CHIP each year. This budget \nresolution will allow us to move CHIP forward in two important ways: \nfirst, to maintain coverage for children currently enrolled in the \nprogram today and, second, to expand coverage to children who are \neligible but not yet enrolled in the program. This provision is a \nstrong signal of the new priorities of the leadership in the 110th \nCongress. I would like to particularly thank Senator Conrad and his \nstaff for the commitment this resolution makes to CHIP. I know this \nbudget wasn't easy. I know that there are many competing priorities for \nlimited Federal resources and an ever escalating demand. But, I am so \nproud that Democrats are taking a stand for children and making CHIP \nreauthorization the top health care priority this year.\n  This budget resolution is responsible. It restores pay-as-you-go \nrules. But it also includes deficit-neutral reserve funds so that \nCongress can move forward on important areas like reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act, competitiveness and other domestic priorities \nthat have been ignored for too long. I have been proud to support this \nbudget resolution throughout a long day of votes, and I want to thank \nand commend our chairman, Senator Conrad, for a job well done.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for \nthe fiscal year 2008 budget resolution.\n  This budget resolution provides Congress with a $2.9 trillion \nspending blueprint for the upcoming year. It establishes a process and \nguidelines by which Congress will determine the revenues and spending \nfor the Federal Government.\n  I support this resolution. It puts our Nation on the road back to \nfiscal responsibility. Nevertheless, I am deeply concerned about our \nNation's fiscal health.\n  We have moved a long way from where we were 6 years ago. When \nPresident Clinton left office, he left with a projected 10-year surplus \nof $5.6 trillion. That surplus could have allowed Congress to eliminate \nthe Nation's debt by 2010.\n  But today, the Nation faces a $248 billion deficit and the debt has \ngrown to $8.9 trillion. This translates to roughly $30,000 owed by each \nand every United States citizen.\n  It took almost 200 years for every President from George Washington \nto George H.W. Bush to amass $2.6 trillion in debt. President Bush \nmatched their $2.6 trillion in debt in just 5 years.\n  And, over the next 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office projects \nthe interest payments on the debt will be more than $3 trillion. That \nis $3 trillion that cannot be spent on priorities like healthcare, \neducation or homeland security.\n  This should be a major concern to the American people.\n  Our Nation is in this situation because of the misplaced policies of \nthe Bush administration and the Republican Congress.\n  The President's tax cuts have cost this Nation over $1 trillion. Over \nthe next 10 years, these tax cuts will cost over $3 trillion more.\n  The vast majority of these tax cuts have gone to benefit the very \nwealthy.\n  Additionally, the War in Iraq and Afghanistan has cost $510 billion \nto date. And there is no end in sight.\n  This has squeezed the budget and made it difficult to fund all those \nprograms that deserve funding.\n  Let me tell you what this means.\n  When the President submitted his budget proposal to Congress on \nFebruary 5, it was deeply flawed.\n  It cut or eliminated 141 programs, programs that are of great \nimportance to the American people.\n  My home State of California was especially hard hit.\n  The President's budget proposed cutting Community Development Block \nGrants by 21 percent. This would have meant that California's CDBG \nfunding would be cut by almost $140 million from its 2006 funding \nlevel.\n  This would be devastating.\n  In the City of Victorville, CDBG funds have helped revitalize areas \nof the city 3000 residents call home.\n  In Los Angeles, these funds have allowed 8,500 housing units to be \nrehabilitated. CDBG funds have preserved over 2,000 jobs and removed \nover 41 million square feet of graffiti.\n  Yet the President's budget did not support this important program.\n  The President's budget also short-changed the law enforcement \nprograms that Americans rely on for their continued safety.\n  The Community Oriented Policing Services, COPS, program was \neliminated under the President's budget, as was the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program, SCAAP. As a border State, these programs are \nessential to California.\n  Additionally, under the President's budget, the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, SCHIP, was given only half of the funding \nthat is necessary to continue to serve the children already enrolled in \nthis program.\n  The good news is the budget before us today restores many of the \nPresident's cuts. For instance:\n  It funds CDBG at 2007 levels, plus an adjustment for inflation. \nCalifornia State and local governments can continue to work for housing \nand community development in low-income areas.\n  The budget also restores funding to the COPS program. It allocates \n$522 million for COPS, a program that has put over 100,000 police \nofficers on the streets in communities across the country. And we have \nadopted an amendment by my colleague Senator Biden to increase COPS \nfunding to its authorized level of $1.5 billion. I was proud to support \nthis increase.\n  This budget also restores $407 million for SCAAP. And through an \namendment I offered and the Senate has adopted, will increase the \nfunding for SCAAP to its authorized level of $950 million. California \nhas the highest number of undocumented aliens in the country. And \nCalifornia prisons house over 20,000 criminal aliens, incurring \ntremendous costs. Last year alone, California spent over $715 million \nkeeping criminal aliens off the streets.\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\n  This budget increases spending on SCHIP from $2 billion in the \nPresident's budget to $50 billion. The $48 billion increase will allow \nfor continued coverage of all currently enrolled children in SCHIP. \nThis budget then goes one step further. It expands SCHIP, insuring an \nadditional six million children who are currently eligible for this \nprogram but are not enrolled. Young Americans should not suffer as a \nresult of the President's misplaced priorities.\n  Additionally, this budget provides critically needed funding for \nvital Veterans' care programs. Specifically, it provides over $43 \nbillion for Veterans, $3.5 billion more than the proposal offered by \nPresident Bush. This money will allow our brave troops to obtain the \nmedical care they deserve.\n  After the alarming revelations at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and \nother Veterans' facilities around the country, it is clear that we need \nto ensure that VA facilities provide the highest level of care. This \nproposal funds medical and prosthetic research and information \ntechnology; and it ensures that baseline operating expenses are met.\n  In addition, the proposal provides middle-income taxpayers relief \nfrom the alternative minimum tax.\n  Absent congressional action, nearly 20 million more Americans will be \nforced to pay the AMT next year. This proposal adds 2 years of relief \nfrom the AMT, where the President could only find room for 1.\n  Congress faced many restrictions and tough choices in crafting this \nbudget. And lawmakers' hands were tied due to years of fiscal \nmismanagement.\n  The budget resolution is far from perfect. It fails to provide \npermanent relief from the AMT for middle-class families and, while it \nrestores much needed funds in critical areas, it does not fully fund \ncritical programs. But it refocuses our priorities. And it takes \nimportant steps to restore fiscal responsibility.\n  Unlike the President's budget proposal, this budget will create a \nsurplus in 2012 and is nearly balanced a year before that.\n  Change will take time. And there is no cure-all for the years of \nfiscal irresponsibility and misguided policies that we have seen.\n  As I said before, this budget is far from perfect. However, it \ninitiates much needed change and I believe will put us back on the path \nfrom which the President and Republican Congress strayed.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto act in the best interest of Americans who have entrusted us with a \ngreat responsibility. I hope that they will join me today in meeting \nthis responsibility by voting for the fiscal year 2008 budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I wish to speak today as a member of the \nSenate Budget Committee.\n  I had hoped that the budget that was presented before the Committee \nlast week was going to be fiscally responsible. Chairman Conrad had \nsaid earlier this year that he was prepared to get savings out of long-\nterm entitlement programs. He had made similar statements in the past. \nSo I had some hope that this budget would take a serious look at what \nwe could do to address the issue of out-of-control entitlement growth.\n  Unfortunately, I was not able to support this budget in Committee and \nI will not be able to support it here on the Senate floor.\n  This budget does not take seriously the out-of-control entitlement \nspending looming on the horizon. This budget resolution fails to show \nthat Congress is willing to make the difficult choices necessary to \nensure that the Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid programs will \ncontinue into the future.\n  This country faces $67 trillion in unfunded liabilities over the next \n75 years. Thirty two trillion dollars of that is in the Medicare \nprogram, $20 trillion is in the Medicaid program and the remaining $15 \ntrillion is in the Social Security program and other liabilities.\n  As Senator Gregg pointed out yesterday, $67 trillion represents more \nthan the entire amount of revenues received by the Federal Government \nsince the beginning of the republic.\n  How are our children supposed to pay for that?\n  We don't have to wait 75 years for the problem to blow up in our \nfaces. In about 2032--almost 25 years from now--the cost of just \nMedicare, Medicaid and Social Security, if left unchecked, will exceed \nthe 18.2 percent of GDP that is the historic level of our Federal \nrevenues. So every single penny of what should be received by the \nFederal Government in revenue will be spent on just three programs.\n  Where is the money for defense to come from? Where is money for \neducation to come from? LIHEAP? NASA? Worker training? Border \nenforcement? Name any program that you support and tell me just where \nthe money is to come from? This is the future we face.\n  And yet this budget resolution doesn't move a toe toward fixing it. \nIt includes not one penny in net entitlement reform.\n  President Bush presented Congress with a budget that makes strides in \nthis direction by attempting to slow the rate of growth in these \nprograms. I'm not talking about wholesale reform here--although I feel \nthat such reform is needed. Just implementing incremental changes can \nmake a huge difference simply because of the enormous amounts of money \nthat we are dealing with here.\n  For example, in Medicare the President proposed reducing the growth \nin the program from 6.5 percent to 5.6 percent over 5 years. This \nchange, just a 1 percent reduction from how Medicare would otherwise \ngrow over the same time period, is estimated to reduce Medicare's 75-\nyear unfunded liability by 25 percent--or $8 trillion. For Medicaid, \nthe President proposed reducing the growth rate from 7.3 percent to 7.1 \npercent.\n  Keep in mind that this means we will still have spending increases in \nthese programs--pretty substantial increases in fact. However, these \nincreases just won't be as big as originally projected.\n  The President's budget calls for some commonsense reforms to both \nMedicare and Medicaid to reduce spending. In Medicare, for example, the \nPresident's budget makes several suggestions to ensure that the program \nis adequately paying providers for the cost of care without overpaying.\n  In Medicaid, the President has proposed ensuring Medicaid \nprescription drugs are reimbursed fairly and by improving the financial \nintegrity of the program.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I would obviously need to take \na close look at these reforms before any are implemented. However, it \nis vitally important that the American taxpayer does Not overpay for \nhealth care services or products.\n  The President's budget also requires wealthy seniors to pay more for \nMedicare by reducing the Federal subsidy for Medicare Part D premiums \nfor these seniors. This means that seniors who have incomes over \n$80,000 for an individual or $160,000 for a couple would be required to \npay more for their Medicare drug benefit.\n  To me, this just makes sense. Today's working middle-class American \ntaxpayers should not be subsidizing the health care of Bill Gates' \nfather. Also, we already do this for Medicare Part B. Such a change \nwould only affect about 5 percent of seniors.\n\n  These are the types of changes that we need to be making. Yet this \nbudget resolution before us today makes no net changes to entitlement \nprograms. This, despite the fact that the Big 3 entitlement programs \ncurrently account for over 41 percent of the Federal budget, and that \nnumber will grow to almost 57 percent in 10 years.\n  A budget that does not seriously address entitlement spending is not \nresponsible. This budget is not responsible.\n  Again, I am not asking for wholesale reforms here. I am very \nsupportive of looking at comprehensive reforms and I support the \nefforts of Chairman Conrad and Senator Gregg to set up a bipartisan \ngroup to take a look at recommending them.\n  But that is not what I am asking for in this budget before us today. \nWe should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Maybe we don't \nhave a perfect way to fix our entitlement challenge right now. But we \ncould have made a good start this year and started on some incremental \nchanges. However, the authors of this budget chose not to do that.\n  We face a demographic tidal wave in this country. As the baby-boom \ngeneration grows older, the number of people\n\n[[Page S3695]]\n\nin the United States ages 65 and over is expected to roughly double by \n2030. But instead of saving for a rainy day, we continue to spend, \nspend, spend.\n  Hard choices have to be made. Spending has to be controlled. \nEntitlements have to be reigned in.\n  We are saddling our children and grandchildren with an unfair burden.\n  The President's budget started us in the right direction. \nUnfortunately, the Democratic budget has dropped the ball, and pushed \noff the inevitable hard decisions until another day.\n  I am profoundly disappointed with the budget I see before us today, \nand I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Con. Res. 21, the \nbudget resolution currently before this body. This budget restores \nfiscal discipline on both the spending and revenue sides of the ledger, \nreinstates the pay-as-you-go rules that were so successful during the \nlate 1990s in helping us achieve budget surpluses, and provides a \nresponsible framework for meeting our Nation's most important \npriorities. With these accomplishments, it represents a major \nimprovement over the budgets of recent years and the budget submitted \nby the President last month. It puts our country in a much better \nposition to address the major long-term fiscal challenges looming just \naround the corner.\n  We as Americans are fortunate to be a part of the world's largest and \nmost prosperous economy. America is, by many measures, doing well but I \ndefy anyone to say we that we cannot do better. We must ensure our \nnational security and restore our moral authority in the world. We must \naddress growing middle class insecurity, reflected in falling incomes \ncoupled with rising costs and record low personal savings coupled with \nrecord high household debt. We must stem the backward slide of rising \npoverty of recent years.\n  As a Nation, we must take this opportunity to lay a strong foundation \nfor the future: to constructively respond to the accelerating pace of \nglobalization, to secure clean and renewable sources of energy, and to \nrein in the skyrocketing health care costs that threaten to overwhelm \nthe budgets of households, businesses, and the Government.\n  Our ability to effectively address any of these challenges, Mr. \nPresident, depends on properly managing our fiscal resources. This \nbudget takes an important step towards restoring fiscal responsibility, \nreversing the profligate trend of the last several years. Since the \ncurrent President took office, fiscal discipline has been thrown to the \nwind. Since 2000, we have seen our nation go from a $236 billion budget \nsurplus to a projected $244 billion deficit, from a National debt of \n$5.6 trillion to $8.8 trillion today, with the share of that debt held \nby foreign lenders doubling. Critical investments in education and \ninfrastructure have been shortchanged, and middle-class tax cuts have \nbeen passed over in favor of more lavish, budget-busting tax breaks for \nthe wealthiest Americans who needed them least.\n  Instead of continuing these irresponsible policies and passing the \ncosts on to our children and grandchildren, the budget now before us \nwould restore fiscal discipline and renew investments in our nation's \ncritical priorities. First and foremost, it reinstates common-sense \npay-as-you-go rules that require any new spending or tax cuts to be \npaid for up front, rather than added to the debt. And because of this \ncommitment to pay-as-you-go, it balances the federal budget within 5 \nyears and reduces the debt as a share of the economy. It requires \nhonest budgeting for the cost of ongoing military operations. The \nresolution also imposes discipline on both spending and revenue, \nlowering spending every year as a share of the economy and cracking \ndown on abusive tax shelters that cost American taxpayers an average of \n$2,000 apiece every year, according to the Internal Revenue Service's \nNational Taxpayer Advocate.\n  Within the context of fiscal responsibility, this budget also \nallocates our resources to our Nation's most important priorities.\n  Mr. President, few priorities are more important than investing in \nour Nation's children. The budget before us recognizes this commitment \nby rejecting the President's proposed cuts to education. Instead, it \nprovides a funding increase of $9.2 billion above the president's \nrequest for education and training, from birth through post-secondary \neducation, including Head Start, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA), programs authorized under the No Child Left \nBehind Act, and Pell Grants. The increased investment will ensure that \nmore preschool children from disadvantaged backgrounds will be ready \nfor school. It will help elementary schools, middle schools, and high \nschools close achievement gaps; increase graduation rates; and reduce \nthe need for remedial education at a later time. It will ensure that \nschools can attract, train, and retain high-quality teachers. It will \nkeep our commitment to educate students with disabilities. And it will \nmake college more affordable so that eligible students can gain the \nskills and experience they need to compete in the global marketplace. \nSimply put, this budget gives more Americans the tools they need to \nfulfill their potential, including their college dreams. Mr. President, \nwe can be confident of one thing: the investment we make here will be \nreturned to us, many times over.\n  In addition to investing in our human capital, this budget also makes \nimportant investments in our physical capital. Specifically, it honors \nthe funding levels for highways and transit that were authorized for \nfiscal year 2008 in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act (SAFETEA), funding that will help States and \ncommunities conduct critical maintenance and make needed improvements \nin their transportation infrastructure. It more than doubles funding \nfor transit security an important start, although more still needs to \nbe done and rejects the Bush administration's continued attempts to \nzero out funding for Amtrak, which serves so many people in Connecticut \nand across the country.\n  With the number of Americans without health insurance on the rise, \nthis budget provides up to $50 billion to help cover uninsured children \nthrough the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, which \nis up for reauthorization this year. We also know that this \nadministration has failed to meet its commitments to the health of our \nveterans, as revealed by the recent reports on the disgraceful \nconditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. As an answer to this \nmajor shortfall, the budget before us provides more than $3.5 billion \nfor veterans above the level proposed by the administration. And where \nprevious budgets have cut funding for first responders, this budget \nrestores the administration's proposed cuts to Firefighter Grants, the \nCOPS program, and Local Law Enforcement and Terrorism Prevention \nGrants. Finally, this budget also rejects the administration's proposed \ncuts to low-income heating assistance and to the Community Development \nBlock Grants an absolutely vital source of federal grant assistance for \neconomic development in our local communities.\n  Mr. President, I would also add and I have already spoken on this \nmatter--that I am pleased that the Senate voted to adopt the Smith-Dodd \namendment to add $2.2 billion to Function 150 for the International \nAffairs budget, which will provide important funds for international \naid, poverty reduction, and other critical foreign policy priorities.\n  Mr. President, the priorities in this budget set a positive course \nfor our Nation. In its lists of numbers we read a statement of our \nvalues. We can all speak in unlimited praise of responsibility and \neducation and opportunity in the abstract but for the first time in \nseveral years, I'm proud to say we have a budget in front of us that \nputs flesh on our words. It restores discipline. It confronts the \nchallenges of a struggling middle class and an aging population, \npromoting opportunity, prosperity, and security across the board. And \nit puts the American people's money towards the wisest priority of all: \ninvesting in the years to come. In sum, I think we have a budget that \nreflects the best values of the American people, and I am proud to give \nit my support.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nwith this year's budget resolution. This budget is putting us on a very \ndangerous path in terms of our economy. A huge tax hike is not the \nright direction for our country.\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\n  The Republican progrowth tax policies that have been implemented over \nthe past few years have had a tremendous impact on our economy. Since \nAugust 2003, more than 7.5 million jobs have been created. Our \nunemployment rate remains low at 4.5 percent--which is well below the \n5.1 percent average rate for 2005 and below the average of each of the \npast four decades. Thanks to our strong economic growth, tax revenues \ncontinue to pour in. Tax receipts were up about 12 percent in 2006, on \ntop of 2005's 14.6 percent increase. Receipts have grown another 8 \npercent so far in fiscal year 2007.\n  But instead of building on this success, this budget takes us in a \ncompletely different direction. The resolution would raise taxes by \n$900 billion--the largest tax hike in history. This tax increase will \nhave real consequences on American families. An Oregon family of four \nwith $50,000 in earnings will see their taxes go up 132 percent to \n$3,675 in 2011 if the Republican tax relief is not made permanent, and \n15 million seniors would see their taxes increase if current tax policy \nis not extended.\n  We are heading in the wrong direction with this budget. Therefore, I \nwill be voting against the budget resolution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, after many long years of flawed budget \npolicies that have eroded our Nation's infrastructure and recklessly \ntaken from the health and safety of American working families, the \nSenate finally has an opportunity to change course.\n  The President has submitted a grossly inadequate budget request for \nthe fiscal year 2008, built around the erroneous premise that tax cuts \nare sacrosanct. I reject that argument. I hope that my colleagues will \nreject that argument.\n  The President's budget includes $2 trillion of new tax cuts, many of \nwhich will benefit those who least need them. In order to fund those \ntax breaks, the President cuts the programs that working Americans rely \non the most. The President proposes to cut the Medicare and Medicaid \nPrograms, which provide health care to seniors and children. He \nproposes to cut funding for housing for the elderly in rural America. \nHe proposes to cut funding for first responder programs, jeopardizing \nthe safety of our firefighters and law enforcement officers, and those \nof us whom they protect. He proposes to cut funding for our children \nand schools, for health care research and rural hospitals, and for our \ncommunities and economic development.\n  The President is proposing to take an awful lot from working American \nfamilies in order to pay for his tax breaks. His budget cuts are not \nfunding the troops overseas, or being used to pay down the national \ndebt. The president's own budget tables show that the gross federal \ndebt will continue to increase to record levels, $12 trillion in the \nnext five years, even if his spending cuts are enacted into law.\n  I reject the argument that seniors must give up their health care, \nand that children must give up funding for their schools, in order to \nfund tax breaks for the wealthiest of the wealthy in America.\n  The President's budget continues the dangerous practice of chipping \naway at domestic priorities, and trying to get away with spending as \nlittle as possible on critical infrastructure. There are consequences--\nsometimes significant consequences, and sometimes deadly consequences--\nwhen the administration tries to hide the impact of its budget cuts in \norder to fund more tax cuts.\n  H.G. Wells wrote that human history is a race between education and \ncatastrophe.\n  The Congress must get into the race to avert the next catastrophe. \nThe squeeze on domestic discretionary spending these past years has \ndone a lot of damage to the infrastructure of our Nation. It has \nresulted in budgetary shortfalls that are wholly irresponsible, and \nthey must be addressed.\n  Look at FEMA's inability to respond to natural disasters. Look at the \nshortfalls in the Low-Income Home Energy Assistant Program, LIHEAP, \naffecting so many of our States. Look at the shortfalls in our homeland \nsecurity, where glaring vulnerabilities along the border are left to \nlinger year after year after year. Look at the shortfalls in the \nfunding for our veterans. The problems at Walter Reed did not happen \nbecause our military is not committed to caring for its wounded. It \nhappened because we have an administration that is trying to cut \ncorners in order to pay for its tax breaks for wealthy Americans.\n  Look at the Department of Labor, where the administration chipped \naway at the mine safety budget for 6 years until it had lost 217 \ninspectors, undermined the enforcement of the Mine Act, and left coal \nminers underground with inadequate safety equipment. It is no \ncoincidence that mining deaths increased to record numbers last year, \nwhile the administration cut the coal enforcement budget, reduced the \nnumber of safety inspectors, and reduced the severity of enforcement \nactions against habitual violators.\n  Gas and energy prices are on the rise again, and, still, the \nPresident's budget does not adequately address our Nation's congested \nroads, our overcrowded transit and rail systems, or the energy \nbottlenecks causing higher prices and electricity failures and power \noutages. These are the festering signs of our Nation's infrastructure \nslowly being starved.\n  When the catastrophes come, they are Hurricanes that brutalize our \ncities and people, or scandals that surface at our Nation's veterans \nfacilities, or tragedies that take the lives of our coal miners \nunderground due to lack of sufficient Federal inspections.\n  I reject the administration's tactics of cutting funds and hiding the \nconsequences until a catastrophe hits. I reject that kind of Russian \nroulette. I reject the notion that the health and safety of the \nAmerican people is less important than extending a tax cut. Today, the \nCongress has an opportunity to reject that approach, and I hope that it \ndoes reject it.\n  We must have a budget that sets realistic spending levels. That is \nthe only way to real budget enforcement and discipline. The last \nCongresses pinned their expectations to pie-in-the-sky, fantasy \nspending levels that were totally disconnected from reality. When those \nbudgets proved inadequate and the appropriations process stalled, the \nCongress was forced to consider massive off-budget supplementals and \nend-of-the-year continuing resolutions and omnibus spending bills that \nexempted hundreds of billions of dollars of spending from the oversight \nof the regular appropriations process. The result was always higher \ndeficits, and less accountability to the American people.\n  The budget before the Senate today rejects that approach. It sets \nrealistic spending levels that would allow the Congress to consider the \nannual appropriations bills in a timely manner, and subject those bills \nto debate and amendments in the Senate. That is the best kind of \nenforcement mechanism--full and open debate and amendments. This budget \nsets a discretionary spending level of $949 billion in the fiscal year \n2008, $16 billion above the President's request, and above the \nPresident's requested freeze at fiscal year 2007 levels for domestic \nprograms. The Congress must address the unacceptable cuts in health \ncare, veterans programs, and other critical priorities that have been \nproposed by the President.\n  This budget is practical, and it is tough. This is not a budget \nlacking in enforcement mechanisms, and they would apply equally and \nfairly to all pieces of the budget revenues, mandatory entitlements, \nand discretionary spending. This budget caps discretionary spending in \nthe fiscal year 2008, subject to a 60-vote point of order. It caps \nadvance appropriations in the fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and it \ncreates a 60-vote point of order against both emergency defense and \nnondefense spending, to limit the kind of budget gimmickry that has \nbeen used in the past to circumvent the discretionary spending caps. On \nthe revenue and mandatory entitlement side of the ledger, this budget \nrestores pay-go budget enforcement, subjecting new mandatory spending \nand tax cuts that are not offset to a 60-vote point of order. It also \ncreates a 60-vote point of order against reconciliation legislation \nthat worsens the deficit, causes a deficit, or reduces a surplus by \ndecreasing revenues or increasing spending. Here, more than anywhere \nelse, is where the budget process has been abused the most. Budget \nreconciliation has been used to shield controversial tax cuts from \ndebate and amendments in the\n\n[[Page S3697]]\n\nSenate, which have added trillions of dollars to the national debt. \nThis budget will stop such egregious practices from continuing.\n  This budget gives the Congress the flexibility it needs to address \nthe gross deficiencies in the president's request, and it demands \nsavings from every piece of the budget--revenues, discretionary, and \nmandatory--in order to do it. This budget is evenhanded and fair, and \nits spending levels can be enforced.\n  I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee for writing a budget \nthat sets a new course. I hope that the Senate follows the lead of our \nchairman. He is trying to address the next catastrophe before it \nhappens. He is trying to set enforceable spending limits to rein in \nthis administration's budget deficits. He is doing the right thing with \nthis budget. It deserves the support of the Senate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the great untold story of the post-9/11 \nperiod is the recovery of America's will to move on, despite new \nthreats, and build an even stronger economy, an even stronger America \nthan before. We gave the American people the tools they needed to help \nthemselves and then we got out of the way.\n  We eliminated the marriage penalty and doubled the child tax credit. \nWe created a tuition tax deduction. We increased the deduction on \ncharitable gifts and put the death tax on the road to extinction. We \nslashed the tax on capital gains and dividends.\n  The American people took care of the rest. They took all these things \nand unleashed a flood of economic activity that is still lifting the \ntide for tens of millions of working families and retirees. We look out \nat the American economy today with amazement. Despite \n9/11, despite a recession, despite Katrina, despite a war, we see: 4.5 \npercent unemployment--lower than the average of the last four decades. \nAn economy that is grown at 3.4 percent over the last four quarters. \nMore than 7.2 million new jobs since August '03\n  That is more jobs over the last 4 years than the European Union and \nJapan--combined.\n  China may have the world's fastest growing economy. But its entire \nGDP is less than the amount that ours has grown in the last 5\\1/2\\ \nyears.\n  New jobs create new revenue, and it's been pouring into the U.S. \nTreasury at a staggering clip. Since we cut taxes on capital gains, tax \nrevenues exceeded government estimates by more than two-thirds.\n  President Bush looked out over this economic landscape too, and he \ngave us a budget that builds on it, that advocates discipline and \nanticipates continued strong revenues by keeping tax cuts in place.\n  That is the formula for continuing to shrink the deficit and leading \nus to a surplus. And we had reason to think the Democrats would embrace \nit, even on taxes, when my good friend the senior Senator from Nevada \nsaid back in November that raising taxes would be, ``Unacceptable.''\n  Well, we should have known better. Budget week is like an annual \ndebutante ball for the Democrats. They step out so everybody can take a \ngood look at them, but their budgets never look good in the lights.\n  The budget they proposed this week was a disaster. It restored the \nmarriage tax, cut the child credit in half, lowered deductions on \neverything from charitable gifts to college tuition, and raised taxes \non capital gains and dividends. It wasn't just a tax increase. It was \nthe mother of all tax increases. Nearly four times bigger than the \nprevious record.\n  It reversed every tax cut we passed, and its passage would have \nresulted in a tax increase on every single taxpayer in America.\n  A family of four with two kids and an annual income of $56,300 would \npay an extra $2,000\n  Nearly 50 million married couples would pay an extra $2,700 each year \nin taxes.\n  More than 10 million single mothers would see their tax bill go up by \nmore than $1,000.\n  Seventeen million seniors would see their taxes go up by more than \n$2,000.\n  Spending wasn't any better.\n\n  Here too, we thought the Democrats might be coming around. The day \nbefore the President's budget was released, my good friend, the Senior \nSenator from North Dakota, said:\n\n       We need to be tough on spending. The week after that, he \n     went even farther, saying we should sharply inhibit the \n     growth of spending.\n\n  But then the curtain fell, and we saw the reality. The Democrats \nproposed to increase nonessential spending over the President's budget \nby nearly $150 billion.\n  And as if that wasn't enough, in addition to the tax hikes we could \nsee, they set up 20 new accounts that they planned to fill up with \nmoney they had raised from a raft of new taxes they didn't even \nspecify. Most of these funds are for worthy purposes. But let's be \nhonest with the American people and pay for these programs by trimming \nwaste, fraud, and abuse instead of open-ended tax hikes down the road.\n  Republicans opened this Congress with a pledge to work with \nDemocrats. We gave them a soaring economy and an offer to take \nadvantage of divided government to do big things, as divided \ngovernments have in the past. One of the big things we proposed was \nentitlement reform. Every Member of this Chamber knows Social Security \nis unsustainable in its current form. Yet the budget writers ignored \nthe problem altogether. They proposed to raise $916 billion in new \ntaxes--and to spend it. Budget week is when the rhetoric meets reality: \nand one of the sad realities this budget revealed was that Democrats \nweren't serious about reform this week.\n\n  Oh they will deny it. Just like they have tried to deny that the tax \nhikes in this budget are tax hikes.\n  After I and my colleagues pointed out the new taxes in this budget, \nthe senior Senator from North Dakota rose to say that we were letting \nour imaginations get the better of us. He said the Democratic budget \ncontained ``no proposed tax increase.''\n  But then, one day after rising on the floor to insist that there were \nno new taxes in this budget, he and his Democratic colleagues admitted \nas much. They voted for an amendment that would reduce some of the more \nunsavory tax increases in their budget.\n  Well, you don't need to be Einstein to know that you can't lower a \ntax increase that doesn't exist.\n  The upshot of that amendment is that the budget we are now being \nasked to vote on no longer represents a tax hike four times larger than \nthe previous record.\n  We are being asked to vote on a tax hike nearly three times bigger \nthan the previous record--and, in the process, to get in the way of an \neconomic expansion, increase nonessential spending by tens of billions \nof dollars, and do absolutely nothing about a pending entitlement \ncrisis.\n  Republicans wouldn't do any one of those things, let alone all four. \nAnd we urge our colleagues on other side to reconsider the damage they \nplan to inflict on Americans who have worked hard to rebuild and \nreenergize this country over the last 5 years.\n  Their current budget would squeeze three-quarters of a trillion \ndollars out of the American taxpayer without shaving so much as a dime \nfrom a single government program. This is the very definition of tax \nand spend. It represents a tremendous missed opportunity. And it is a \nterrible disappointment.\n  When Republicans proposed to accomplish big things, this isn't what \nwe had in mind.\n  This budget is a big mistake. Republicans can't support it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say for the colleagues who are \nwaiting, we are working on a final package of amendments to be adopted \nby unanimous consent. That package has many amendments by many \ncolleagues. It has to go through a vetting process. It is not quite \ncomplete. As soon as it is, we will move to that and then to final \npassage.\n  I thank my colleagues for their extraordinary cooperation. So many \ncolleagues have agreed to withhold amendments. It has been very \nhelpful. We have to have this final process complete before we can go \nto final passage.\n  While we are awaiting that package, I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank the staffs who have made truly an extraordinary \neffort. Mary Naylor, my staff director; John Righter, my deputy staff \ndirector; the counsel, Lisa Konwinski; Kobye Noel, who is the one who \ndoes all of our charts. I know my colleagues enjoy them; Joel Friedman, \nmy other deputy staff director; Steve Bailey, who does the tax\n\n[[Page S3698]]\n\nwork; and Jamie Morin, who does defense. I thank all of the others on \nmy staff who have done such an extraordinary job working nights and \nweekends for weeks--Steve Posner, Stu Nagurka, David Vandivier, Mike \nJones, Jim Esquea, Sarah Kuehl, Jim Miller, Joan Huffer, Cliff \nIsenberg, Brodi Fontenot, Robyn Hiestand, Susan Reeves, Jim Klumpner, \nAnne Page, Ben Soskin, and Josh Ryan. I thank each and every one of my \nstaff.\n  I also wish to recognize the extraordinary professionalism of Senator \nGregg's staff. They are absolutely first rate and absolutely \ndependable--people whose word you can count on. Of course, no one is \nbetter than the ranking member, Senator Gregg. He has demonstrated over \nand over his willingness to cooperate; more than that, his \nprofessionalism and also his extraordinary knowledge of the budget. I \nwish to thank all of those who have participated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to join Senator Conrad in thanking \nboth our staffs. They are exceptional. They are incredibly talented \npeople. They work extraordinary hours: Mary Naylor and her team on that \nside. Scott Gudes, Denzel McGuire on our side, including Allison \nParent, Jim Hearn, Cheri Reidy, Dan Brandt, Dave Fisher, Conwell Smith, \nJay Kholsa, Richie Weiblinger, Seems Mittal, Vanessa Green, Winnie \nCheung, Betsy Holahan, Jeff Turcotte, David Myers, Jason Delisk, Dave \nPappone, Jennifer Pollum, Mike Lofgren, Kevin Bargo, Matt Giroux, Liz \nWroe, and Lynne Seymour, our team that works so well over here. They \nare special people who put in an extraordinary amount of effort on \nbehalf of the American people. We thank them for it. This is a complex \nbill. It involves many nights of work and takes a lot of time to work \nit up into a final package. As you can see from the amount of paper \nthat is being run around right now, it is extraordinary that we are \nable to keep it straight, and it is because of their extraordinary \nability.\n  I also wish to thank the staff on the dais, the Senate staff. This is \nprobably the most difficult bill the Senate deals with because there \nare so many votes that come so quickly in such rapid succession and \nthey always do an exceptional job and I very much appreciate it.\n  Finally, I wish to thank the chairman, Senator Conrad, who treats us \nwith dignity, respect and fairness and runs an extremely professional \nshop as chairman of the Budget Committee and who is committed to making \nsure the integrity of the Senate and the process of the Senate remains \nprofessional. We thank him for that, and we thank him for his \nassistance.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I so appreciate the two managers of this \nbill. A year ago the roles were reversed. Senator Judd was the \nchairman. Senator Conrad was the ranking member. Mr. President, the way \nthey operate it doesn't matter. They truly set an example of how the \nSenate should operate. I say--and I say this without any reservation or \nqualification--these two fine Senators deserve a hand.\n  Mr. GREGG. Actually, last year Senator Gregg was in charge. This \nyear, Senator Judd is in charge.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Monday, \nfollowing morning business, the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nH.R. 1591.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this being the case, there will be no votes \non Monday. We have done such a great job here, and we are moving to the \nsupplemental on Monday. There will be no votes Monday. We will have a \ntough week on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday perhaps, but we \nmade great progress, and I think the Senate should feel good about the \nwork we have accomplished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me add my word of thanks to Chairman Conrad and \nSenator Gregg. They have done a spectacular job on this budget, and I \nwish to thank my Senators on this side of the aisle for cooperating in \nsuch a way that we are going to finish this bill at midafternoon on \nFriday, one of the earliest completion times we have had.\n  Finally, with regard to next week, it is the view of the Republican \nside of the aisle that we need to finish that bill next week. The \ntroops need the money. There is a veto threat out against the bill \npotentially if it is not fixed on the floor of the Senate.

Mr. President, I would like to thank the Chairman of the \nBudget Committee for his efforts to include my bipartisan amendment to \nincrease the allocation for LIHEAP, the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, to $3.2 billion in the budget resolution. As the \nchairman knows, this is the level that was recommended in a bipartisan \nletter signed by 35 governors and is the minimum level of funding \nneeded to allow States to provide the same level of assistance as in \nfiscal year 2006.\n  The rise in energy prices has led to an increase in the number of \nfamilies seeking and receiving assistance. In fiscal year 2006, with an \nadditional $1 billion, over 500,000 additional households were served \nby LIHEAP, increasing the total to 5.6 million. However, that \nrepresents less than 15 percent of the eligible households.\n  LIHEAP is not only a heating program, it is also a cooling program. \nThe number of households receiving cooling assistance increased to \n540,000 in fiscal year 2006, up from 315,000 in 2005.\n  LIHEAP provides a vital safety net for our Nation's low-income \nhouseholds by helping them remain healthy and secure during bitterly \ncold winters in the North and hot summers in the South. For many low-\nincome families, disabled individuals, and senior citizens living on \nfixed incomes, home energy costs are unaffordable. Low-income families \npay close to 18 percent of their income on energy. The average family \nonly pays 4 percent.\n  According to a recent survey conducted by the National Energy \nAssistance Directors Association, NEADA, families who receive LIHEAP \nare very poor and have few choices but to cut back on food, medicine, \nand other essentials in order to pay their home energy costs when \nfunding is inadequate to meet the need. Sixty-four percent of those \nsurveyed said that without LIHEAP, they would have had to keep their \nhome at an unsafe or unhealthy temperature. Fifty-four percent said \nthat they would have had their electric or gas service disconnected if \nLIHEAP benefits had not been available.\n  Increasing funding for this vital and valuable program remains a top \npriority for me. I am grateful that the Senate has accepted this \nbipartisan amendment.\n  I also want to reiterate my comments from yesterday about this budget \nresolution. Chairman Conrad has worked tirelessly to ensure that this \nresolution meets the pressing needs of the American people and restores \nthe fiscal discipline that has been lacking for several years.\n  We have been charting an unsustainable fiscal policy course over the \nlast 6 years. Instead of a $505 billion surplus in 2006, Republican \nfiscal policies left us with a deficit of $248 billion. Reversing this \ncourse and restoring balance is essential to our economic well-being. \nThis budget takes the necessary steps toward equilibrium by achieving a \nbalanced budget by 2012 and providing funding for essential programs \nthat improve the lives of hardworking Americans who have been \nstruggling during this sluggish economic recovery.\n  It includes necessary funding for the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, SCHIP; a program that provides a vital safety net to \nmillions of families who do not earn enough to buy health insurance for \ntheir children.\n  The budget also includes language that allows for the establishment \nof an affordable housing fund financed by government-sponsored \nenterprises. This affordable housing fund will provide grants for the \nproduction, preservation, and rehabilitation of affordable housing for \nvery low-income families.\n  The budget resolution reinforces our commitment to America's veterans \nby including $43.1 billion for discretionary veterans' programs and \nrejecting the President's proposed increases in fees on veterans \nenrolled in the VA health care system.\n  I was also pleased to see that this budget rejects the President's \nproposed cuts in funding for education and training programs and \ninstead appropriately invests in these necessary endeavors, in part by \nincluding significant increases in funding for the Department of \nEducation--$6.1 billion above the President's request and $4 billion \nabove the FY07 inflation-adjusted level.\n  I thank Chairman Conrad and his staff for their hard work in \nproducing this budget, which is both supportive of the needs of the \nAmerican people and fiscally sound. I will support this resolution and \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, last year on March 20, the President signed \nS. 2320, which augmented funding for the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance program. In light of the historically high energy costs, it \nwas prudent to shift funding to accommodate for the reduced purchasing \npower of the vital program. As many of us know, disaster was narrowly \naverted last winter and the summer of 2006.\n  With heating oil at $2.45 a gallon in Maine, we must recognize that \nenergy prices will continue to burden the citizens who are most \nsusceptible to heat and cold in the coming fiscal year. As we know in \neach of our states, energy is a necessity of life during extreme \nweather. In fact, it has been found that 73 percent of households have \nbeen forced to cut back on, and even go without other necessities such \nas food, prescription drugs and mortgage and rent payments. The LIHEAP \nprogram is, for many low-income families and our Nation's elderly, is \nthe only barrier from nature's elements.\n  This program is a national program. In fiscal year 2006 LIHEAP \nassisted 5,710,000 households in the United States, including 48,000 \nhouseholds in Maine. In Fiscal Year 2006, the nearly 6 million \nhouseholds that received funding only represented 25 percent of the \nhouseholds eligible for assistance. Unfortunately, that figure \nillustrates that with the exponential rise in energy prices, this \nprogram has become an even more vital program.\n  This is also reflected in level of support from our Nation's \ngovernors. On February 15th, a bipartisan group of 35 governors wrote \nthe leadership of the House and Senate stating that ``In 2006, we were \ngrateful that Congress made a significant investment in LIHEAP, \nrecognizing that soaring energy prices required additional funding for \nthe program.'' The letter further reads that, ``We urge you to use the \n2006 funding level of $3.2 billion as a base to build from in the \nfuture--not a one time emergency investment in energy assistance.'' The \nletter was signed by governors with diverse political views and from a \ndistinct regions including Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, \nOklahoma, and South Dakota. This is a national program and, \naccordingly, it has national support.\n  It is incumbent on us to prepare the Nation's budget in light of the \nyear's perceivable threats facing the United States and with our \ncitizens in mind. Current energy prices present an impending crisis for \nthe United State's most vulnerable. The LIHEAP program does not stem \nthe effects of winter, but it quells the effects of energy prices and \nallays the fears of our Nation's most vulnerable citizens.\n  I believe that our Nation's budget should prioritize the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, and believe that an increase of an \nadditional $703 million represents a responsible and vital investment. \nI urge my colleagues to support this program.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 635\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by Senators Ben Nelson, \nBaucus, Grassley, Kennedy, and Salazar, to offer a bipartisan amendment \nwhich creates a deficit neutral reserve fund that recognizes the \nsignificance of market-based pooling as a tool in addressing rising \nhealth insurance costs, and health care quality.\n  Market-based pooling is especially important for small businesses, \nwhich now have virtually no ability to use strength in numbers across \nState lines to negotiate better and more affordable coverage for their \nworkers.\n  America faces an ever-widening gap between health care ``haves'' and \n``have nots.'' Without effective market pooling power, ever-growing \nnumbers of small businesses and uninsured and underinsured Americans \nare slipping into the ``have not'' column. This is a tragic gap we can \nand must close.\n  Senator Nelson and I are actively discussing with our colleagues \npossible\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\nbipartisan approaches. As the wide bipartisan support for today's \namendment shows, we are on a promising track, and we intend to stick \nwith it. Market-based pooling must be a part of any comprehensive \nhealth reform solution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have now taken the next step on the \njourney to having a budget resolution in place for the Nation. It \npassed the committee and has now passed the Senate. This is an \nimportant turning point for the Congress, certainly for the Senate. \nThree of the last five years, our country has not had a budget. It is \nimportant--critically important--for the Congress of the United States \nto agree on a budget. I would be the first one to say this is an \nimperfect budget, but it does advance the cause of having the \ndiscipline of a budget for our country.\n  I thank all of our colleagues who have worked to this end, even those \nwho voted against it but who cooperated in the process. I especially \nthank Senator Gregg again and his outstanding professional staff. I see \nhis staff director, Scott Gudes, who has been a true professional.\n  I very much appreciate having the chance to work with people of that \ncaliber. And again, to my own staff director, Mary Naylor, who has \nworked such extraordinary hours, weekend after weekend, night after \nnight until 10, 11, sometimes 2 in the morning, this has truly been an \nextraordinary effort, and I thank her, and I thank all of my staff. To \nmany of them who are here, I say thank you. You have done this \ninstitution proud, and I appreciate it deeply.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, once again, we welcome in the Spring.\n\n     Blows the thaw-wind pleasantly,\n     Drips the soaking rain,\n     By fits looks down the waking sun:\n     Young grass springs on the plain;\n     Young leaves clothe early hedgerow trees; Seeds, and roots, \n           and stones of fruits, Swollen with sap put forth their \n           shoots; Curled-headed ferns sprout in the lane; Birds \n           sing and pair again.\n\n     There is no time like Spring,\n     When life's alive in everything . . .\n\n                                             --Christina Rossetti.\n\n  March 21 is the vernal equinox, when the day and night are, briefly, \nin perfect balance. It is the first day of spring. This year, of \ncourse, the early switch to daylight savings time has created the \nillusion of an earlier spring with the artificial and arbitrary \nestablishment of darker mornings and longer evenings. I, for one, am \nhappy to welcome an early spring. It is my favorite season, full of new \nhope and untarnished promise.\n  West Virginia has seen some snow this winter. The snow was welcomed \nby skiers and farmers, but those of us who neither ski nor plow view \nsnow more as a nuisance--something to be moved out of the way, \nsomething that complicates our commutes and closes the schools. Snow \nmakes the world monochromatic, a palette that ranges along a single \nline from blinding white through the shades of gray to the tired black \nof grime-crusted snow along the roadways. We are ready for spring, \nready for some light and for lots of vibrant color around us.\n  This year, the March winds again worked their artistry, blowing away \nthe flotsam and jetsam of winter to uncover a clean canvas with just \nthe sweeping curves of earth and the angular armature of tree limbs \nsketched in charcoal, awaiting the Master's hand to apply delicate \nspringtime washes of color. Over the past weeks, we have seen the \nMaster's skill at work in the first creeping stain of green across the \nlawns and fields, the soft blush of blossoms in the wild plum trees, \nthe deepening blue of the sky. Each day, the colors have grown darker, \nricher, and more vibrant, as if the warm breezes carried them to us \nfrom some distant sunny clime. Bright details have begun to take shape \nin the scattered spangles of violet and yellow crocus and the bright \naccents of hardy daffodils amid their grass green leaves. Oh, \ndaffodils--the poets write of you! The Boston poet Amy Lowell (1874-\n1925) wrote of you:\n\n     Thou yellow trumpeter of laggard Spring!\n     Thou herald of rich Summer's myriad flowers!\n     The climbing sun with new recovered powers\n     Does warm thee into being, through the ring\n     Of rich, brown earth he woos thee, makes thee fling\n     Thy green shoots up, inheriting the dowers\n     Of bending sky and sudden, sweeping showers,\n     Till ripe and blossoming thou art a thing\n     To make all nature glad, thou art so gay;\n     To fill the lonely with a joy untold;\n     Nodding at every gust of wind to-day,\n     To-morrow jeweled with raindrops.\n     Always bold\n     To stand erect, full in the dazzling play\n     Of April's sun, for thou has caught his gold.\n\n  Mr. President, spring would not be spring without the daffodils. \nTheir delicate beauty and seemingly fragile petals belie their \ntoughness. Year after year, the daffodils spread, competing with the \ngrass and the tree roots to expand their beds. They manage to deter the \nonslaught of determined squirrels and other wild creatures who unearth \nand consume dainty and expensive spring bulbs like so many canapes at a \nreception. They push their way up into the sun through frozen ground \nand choking mats of fallen leaves. They defy howling winds and frigid \nnighttime temperatures. They survive people and houses to bloom on \naround the decaying foundations of long ago farmsteads. And they do it \nall with effortless beauty, inspiring us and filling us with joy. The \nfirst daffodil, like the first robin, is akin to the dove that brought \nthe olive branch back to Noah--a reassurance to worried man\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\nfrom God that the spring, like the land, will return.\n  I do not want to take up too much of the Senate's time. We have \nimportant matters before us, matters of war and peace, matters of \nspending and accounting. But even in the heat of debate, we can each \nfind joy in those first spring days. We can each feel peace in the \nsteady warmth of the springtime sun, calm in the soft breeze that \ncarries the scent of hyacinths, and delight in springtime flowers. The \nfirst day of spring is truly a time to stop and smell the flowers.\n\n     There is no time like Spring,\n     When life's alive in everything,\n     Before new nestlings sing,\n     Before cleft swallows speed their journey back\n     Along the trackless track--God guides their wing,\n     He spreads their table that they nothing lack,\n     Before the daisy grows a common flower\n     Before the sun has power\n     To scorch the world up in his noontide hour.\n\n     --Christina Rossetti.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/23/senate-section/article/S3703-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3703-S3704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STOPPING OVERSEAS SUBSIDIES ACT\n\n   Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, our Nation's manufacturers and their \nemployees can compete against the best in the world, but they cannot \ncompete against nations that provide huge subsidies and other unfair \nadvantages to their producers. Time and time again, I hear from \nmanufacturers in my State whose efforts to compete successfully in the \nglobal economy simply cannot overcome the practices of illegal pricing \nand subsidies of nations such as China. The results of these unfair \npractices are lost jobs, shuttered factories, and decimated \ncommunities.\n  Consider this one example that affects my home State. The American \nresidential wood furniture industry has experienced devastating losses \ndue to surges of unfairly priced furniture imports from China. \nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 146,600 jobs, or \nabout 22 percent of the workforce, have been lost in the U.S. furniture \nindustry since 2000. Unfairly priced imports from China are a leading \ncause in these job losses. China's wooden bedroom furniture exports to \nthe U.S., which amounted to just $169 million in 1999, reached an \nestimated $1.8 billion in 2006. By subsidizing investments in furniture \nmanufacturing facilities, China is exploiting the U.S. market to the \nbenefit of its producers and putting our employees at an unfair \nadvantage.\n  One fine furniture manufacturer in Maine, Moosehead Manufacturing, \nstruggled for years to cope with the onslaught of unfair imports from \nChina. Despite the company's quality products and attempts to survive \nthrough several rounds of layoffs and participation in the Federal \nTrade Adjustment for Firms program, Moosehead was not able to keep its \ndoors open in the face of unfair Chinese imports. The company announced \nits closing on February 8, 2007. This is a tragic development--for this \nfamily-owned business, for its skilled employees, and for the community \nand State.\n  It is because of the experience of manufacturers such as Moosehead \nthat I reintroduced the Stopping Overseas Subsidies Act. I am pleased \nto be joined by my friend and colleague from Indiana, Senator Bayh, who \nhas worked closely with me on this legislation. The core provision of \nthis bill revises current trade remedy laws to ensure that U.S. \ncountervailing duty laws apply to imports from nonmarket economies, \nsuch as China.\n  Our Nation's trade remedy laws are intended to give American \nindustries and their employees relief from the effects of illegal trade \npractices. Unfortunately, some countries in the world choose to cheat \ninstead of compete fairly. In these cases, U.S. industries can file \npetitions under U.S. trade remedy laws for relief.\n  Up until recently, the practice of the Department of Commerce was to \naccept an antisubsidy petition against any market economy--such as \nCanada or Chile--but not against a nonmarket economy such as China. As \na result, nonmarket countries that subsidize their industries the most \nheavily and cause the most injury to U.S. industries and workers, such \nas China, were exempt from the reach of American countervailing duty \nlaws.\n  The countervailing duty statute on its face in no way limits the \napplication of the law to any country. There is nothing in the \ncountervailing duty provisions per se, or anywhere else in the statute, \nthat limits the broad language applying countervailing duty remedies to \nevery ``country.'' Unfortunately, the Department's interpretation of \nthis statute for the last two decades has been that it does not apply \nto nonmarket economies, and this policy was upheld by a 1986 Federal \ncourt decision that maintained that Congress needs to clarify the \nstatute on this issue.\n  The good news is that, on November 22, 2007, the Department of \nCommerce finally accepted the first countervailing duty petition \nagainst a nonmarket economy since the 1986 court decision. The case was \nfiled against China by New Page Corporation, a coated free sheet paper \ncompany with operations in Maine, Ohio, and Maryland. Despite its \nefficient, state-of-the-art mills, skilled and dedicated employees, \nstrong relationships with customers, strategically located mills and \ndistribution facilities and growing markets for its products, New Page \nhad to shut down an entire paper line as a result of unfair foreign \ncompetition.\n\n  Jim Tyrone, senior vice president of New Page Corporation, testified \nbefore the Ways and Means Committee on February 15, 2007, regarding the \nillegal subsidies that China is providing to its paper industry. \nStarting in the late 1990s the Government of China targeted its \ndomestic coated paper industry for rapid development. As part of this \ndevelopment plan, the Chinese Government provides low-cost policy loans \nthrough government-owned banks. It also provides grants for the \ndevelopment of new paper capacity, and tax breaks based on export \nperformance and domestic equipment purchases. Moreover, Tyrone \ntestified, government banks in China forgave at least $660 million in \nloans they had provided to China's largest paper producer, Asia Pulp & \nPaper, when that company declared bankruptcy in 2003.\n  The result is that in the United States, Chinese coated free sheet \nmarket share has increased by an average 75 percent annually over the \npast four years based on publicly available data, despite having to \nship their products thousands of miles to reach the U.S. market. \nIronically, and in contrast to U.S. paper producers, China has no \nnatural advantage in the production of paper. It does not have an \nabundant supply of the requisite inputs, and must import much of the \npulp that it uses to make paper. It is only because of illegal \nsubsidization that China can compete in the paper products market in \nthe U.S. and Europe.\n  According to a 2005 study by the American Forest and Paper Products \nAssociation, China is using an array of subsidies to promote the \ndevelopment of timber and pulp production in China. These include \ngovernment loans and loan subsidies for technology renovation, \npromotion of foreign investment in state-owned enterprises, and \nprotection of debt-ridden state-owned enterprises that maintain excess \nor idle production capacity through local government ``soft'' loans and \nloan forgiveness.\n  In its 2006 Report to Congress, the U.S.-China Economic and Security \nReview Commission, a bipartisan organization established by Congress in \n2000 to provide recommendations to Congress on the relationship between \nthe United States and China, noted:\n  China has a centralized industrial policy that employs a wide variety \nof tools to promote favored industries. In particular, China has used a \nrange of subsidies to encourage the manufacture of goods meant for \nexport over the manufacture of goods meant for domestic consumption, \nand to secure foreign investment in the manufacturing sector.\n  Similar conclusions are contained in the United States Trade \nRepresentative's 2006 Report to Congress, which concludes:\n  China continues to pursue problematic industrial policies that rely \non trade-distorting measures such as local content requirements, import \nand export restrictions, discriminatory regulations and prohibited \nsubsidies, all of which raise serious WTO concerns.\n  These practices run counter to China's obligations under its 2001 \nWorld Trade Organization accession agreement. In its accession \nprotocol, China explicitly agreed that it would be subject to the \nsubsidy disciplines of other\n\n[[Page S3704]]\n\nmember countries. In fact, it agreed to specific provisions in article \n15 of the protocol which permit WTO countries to use alternative \nbenchmarks for measuring subsidies in China. Yet, unbelievably, the \nGovernment of China is arguing in the New Page case that the Department \nof Commerce is legally prohibited from applying countervailing duty \nlaws to imports from China.\n  This is exactly why our legislation is still needed, despite the \nDepartment of Commerce's acceptance of New Page's case. If U.S. law is \nclear on the subject of whether anti-subsidy petitions can be filed \nagainst nonmarket economies, countries such as China cannot use U.S. \ncourts to dispute that fact. In addition, the Department of Commerce \nwill not be able to summarily reject future antisubsidy petitions \nagainst nonmarket economies due to a change in leadership in the \ndepartment or for political reasons.\n  I want to point out that this bill also includes a number of new \nprovisions that are designed to strengthen our government's ability to \nhold our trading partners accountable for their illegal trade \npractices. The bill makes clear that the United States can use \ninformation from third countries and alternative methodologies when \ncalculating China's subsidies. This is consistent with what China \nitself agreed to in its WTO accession protocol. The bill provides that \na determination by the Department of Commerce to revoke a country's \nstatus as a nonmarket economy under U.S. antidumping law must be \napproved by Congress. Finally, the bill requires the U.S. International \nTrade Commission to conduct a study regarding how the People's Republic \nof China uses government intervention to promote investment, \nemployment, and exports.\n  Unfair market conditions cannot continue to cause our manufacturers \nto hemorrhage jobs. No State understands this more than my home State \nof Maine. According to the United States Department of Labor, 10,400 \nmanufacturing jobs in Maine have been lost since 2001, a 14.8 percent \ndecline. This is why organizations such as the Maine Forest Products \nCouncil and the Maine Wood Products Association have strongly endorsed \nour proposal to extend U.S. countervailing duty laws to nonmarket \neconomies.\n  The stopping overseas subsidies bill is a bipartisan, bicameral bill \nthat has a broad range of support across many industries and \ngeographical areas. A companion bill has been introduced in the House \nby Representatives by Artur Davis of Alabama and Phil English of \nPennsylvania.\n  U.S. industries don't want protection--they want fair competition. \nIllegal subsidies distort fair competition, regardless of the economic \nsystem in which they are used. Our legislation simply levels the \nplaying field by allowing antisubsidy petitions to be brought against \nnonmarket economies in addition to market economies.\n  Some countries, such as China, want to have all the benefits of \nengaging in international trading institutions and systems yet continue \nto cheat on the system with no penalties. It is time these countries \nwere held to the same standards as other countries around the world. I \nask you to join me in supporting the SOS bill to ensure that all \ncountries are held accountable for their trade practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/23/senate-section/article/S3704-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            HONORING THE MADISON HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASTICS TEAM\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the Madison \nHigh School gymnastics team. On February 16, 2007, the Lady Bulldogs \nwon the South Dakota Class A State Gymnastics Title. This impressive \naccomplishment allowed the Lady Bulldogs to tie the national record of \n13 consecutive championship wins. They currently share the national \nrecord with Sehome High School in Bellingham, WA, who set the record \nfrom 1973 to 1985.\n  The Lady Bulldogs finished the season with an outstanding performance \nat the South Dakota Class A State Gymnastics Meet. With a final score \nof 141.893 points they not only tied the national record for \nconsecutive State championships, but also set a South Dakota Class A \nState record. These two records highlight the talent and dedication \nthat has characterized Madison's gymnastics team for the past 13 years.\n  Head Coach Maridee Dossett has demonstrated her allegiance to the \nLady Bulldogs both as an athlete and a coach. She was a senior on the \nteam that brought home the first State title for the Madison gymnasts \nin 1995. Since that time, she has continued to contribute to the \nsuccess of the team through her dedication and strong leadership.\n  Leading Madison to victory was Katie Finck in the uneven bars and \nfloor exercise categories, and Katie Breuer in the balance beam, vault \nand all around categories. Following the example set by these two \ngymnasts, the Lady Bulldogs illustrated their extraordinary teamwork \nand successfully dominated each category of the competition.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to honor and thank all those \ndedicated to the Madison Central School District: Head Coach Maridee \nDossett, Assistant Coach Kindra Norby, Athletic Director Bud Postma, \nPrincipal Sharon Knowlton, and Superintendent Dr. Frank Palleria. The \ntime and effort put forth by these individuals have made it possible \nfor the Lady Bulldogs to be one of the most successful gymnastics teams \nof all time.\n  I would also like to recognize the gymnast's parents for their \nsupport and devotion to the team. This great honor was made possible by \nyour encouragement and dedication to your daughters and their \nteammates.\n  Most of all I would like to congratulate the women who won the State \nchampionship this year and all the athletes who have been a part of \nthis record-tying streak. The gymnasts of the 2006-2007 Lady Bulldog \nteam, in alphabetical order, are as follows: Katie Breuer, Kassie \nFinck, Theresa Knapp, Katie Mackenzie, Heidi Mogck, Mara Riedel, Sara \nRogers, Kaitlyn Walker, and Heather Williams.\n  These student-athletes should be very proud of their remarkable \nachievements over the past years. The inspiration of the gymnasts that \nbegan this record success in 1995 has empowered those who have followed \nin their footsteps and will continue to bring motivation to Madison's \nstudent-athletes in the future.\n  On behalf of the city of Madison and the State of South Dakota, I am \npleased to say congratulations Lady Bulldogs on this impressive \nnational accomplishment and keep up the great work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/23/senate-section/article/S3704-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3704-S3705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING DePAUW UNIVERSITY'S WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the DePauw \nUniversity women's basketball team for winning the 2007 NCAA Division \nIII National Championship. The Tigers defeated Washington University in \nSt. Louis on Saturday at the ``Birthplace of Basketball,'' Springfield \nCollege. This is DePauw University's first national athletic \nchampionship and a proud moment for our State.\n  In being told of their victory, I was reminded of what people say \nabout teamwork, that at the end of the day we are only as strong as the \nshoulders we lean on. The talent of the Tigers was apparent throughout \ntheir school record 31-3 season, but it was their extraordinary \nteamwork that brought the championship trophy back to Greencastle. \nThese young women are a testament to what student athletes should be, \nand they should be commended for winning with class, courage, and \ncharacter.\n  While the members of the team have put in countless hours practicing \nand developing their skills, the parents and coaching staff dedicated \nshould also be recognized for their role supporting and preparing the \nteam. As a father of two young boys who love to play sports, I know how \nrewarding it can be to watch my sons' games. I also know how dedicated \nparents must be to drive their children to practice every day, make it \nto the games, and cheer the whole game through. It is this kind of \ndedication that builds a support network worthy of a national \nchampionship.\n  Throughout the season, the Tigers' true character shined as they \nnever lost faith in themselves and prevailed as a team. Their conduct \nthis season should be an example for all other student athletes to \nfollow. I congratulate\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\nthe DePauw University Tigers on their National Championship and commend \nthem for the example they set for all student athletes who I hope are \ninspired by their example.\n  The 2006-2007 DePauw University Tigers are; Kristy Mahon, Suzy \nDoughty, Tina Frierson, Cassie Pruzin, Kalei Lowes, K.C. Stoll, Kelsey \nFlanagan, Caitlin McGonigal, Adedrea Chaney, Liz Bondi, Gretchen and \nGwen Haehl, Kristin Barrow, Jenna Fernandez, Tegan Krouse, Bridget \nBailey, Andrea Travelstead, Emily Marshall, Meghan Warner, Katie \nO'Connor and Sarah Merkel.

A bill to secure the promise of personalized medicine for all \nAmericans by expanding and accelerating genomic research and \ninitiatives to improve the accuracy of disease diagnosis, increase the \nsafety of drugs, and identify novel treatments; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n[[Page S3709]]\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today joined by my colleague Senator \nRichard Burr, to reintroduce the Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act \nof 2007. This bill will expand and accelerate scientific advancement in \nthe field of genomics, which is already beginning to change the \nparadigm of medical practice as we know it, and has profound \nimplications for health and health care in this nation.\n  The ``miracles of medicine'' have been demonstrated since early man. \nMany of the traditional medicines used today, such as aspirin and \nmorphine, are derivatives of plants ancient people used to treat \nillnesses and injuries centuries ago. Since those ancient times, our \nknowledge of medicine and disease has expanded tremendously. Today, \nmodern breakthroughs in the fields of genetics and genomics have \nuncovered another layer of complexity in the way we treat and prevent \ndisease.\n  Over the past decade, we have unlocked many of the mysteries about \nDNA and RNA, their structure, and how their code is translated into the \nproteins that make up the tissues and organs of the human body. \nResearchers have also made discoveries about the various functions of \nDNA such as replication, genetic recombination and regulation, just to \nname a few, and have developed the necessary technologies to do all of \nthis work.\n  This knowledge isn't just sitting in books on the shelf nor is it \nconfined to the work benches of laboratories. We have used these \nresearch findings to pinpoint the causes of many diseases, such as \nsickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. \nMoreover, scientists have translated this genetic knowledge into \nseveral treatments and therapies prompting a bridge between the \nlaboratory bench and the patient's bedside.\n  We've made so many achievements and come a long way in our \nunderstanding and application of genetics knowledge. And yet, we are \njust beginning to realize the full potential of this science to predict \nthe onset of disease, diagnose earlier, and develop therapies that can \ntreat or cure Americans from so many afflictions.\n  Just 4 years ago, scientists at the National Institutes of Health and \nthe Department of Energy reached another major landmark, with the \ncompletion of the sequencing of the entire human genome, our genetic \nblueprint described by many as the Holy Grail of biology and hailed as \none of the greatest scientific achievements to date.\n  The completion of the Human Genome Project has paved the way for a \nmore sophisticated understanding of disease causation. The HGP has \nexpanded focus from the science of genetics, which refers to the study \nof single genes, to include genomics, which describes the study of all \nthe genes in an individual, as well as the interactions of those genes \nwith each other. The role environmental factors play in promoting \ndisease and the potential influence they have at the genetic level is \nalso an area of interest.\n  We know that all human beings are 99.9 percent identical in genetic \nmakeup, but differences in the remaining 0.1 percent hold important \nclues about the causes of disease and response to drugs. Simply put, \nthe study of genomics will help us learn why some people get sick and \nothers do not, and use this information to better prevent and treat \ndisease.\n  The relatively new field of genomics is key to the practice of \npersonalized medicine. Personalized medicine is the use of genomic and \nmolecular data to better target the delivery of health care, facilitate \nthe discovery and clinical testing of new products, and help determine \na patient's predisposition to a particular disease or condition. \nPersonalized medicine represents a revolutionary and exciting change in \nthe fundamental approach and practice of medicine\n  Pharmacogenomics, or the study of how genes affect a person's \nresponse to drugs, is a critical component of personalized medicine. \nCurrently, so-called blockbuster drugs are typically effective in only \n40 to 60 percent of patients who take them. Other studies have found \nthat up to 15 percent of hospitalized patients experience a serious \nadverse drug reaction, causing an estimated 100,000 deaths each year. \nPharmacogenomics has the potential to dramatically increase the \neffectiveness and safety of drugs, both of which are major health care \nconcerns.\n  We have a growing number of examples of how pharmacogenomics research \nhas helped to save lives. For example, the chemotherapy Purinethol is a \nlifesaver for kids with leukemia, but in some cases, patients suffer \nsevere, sometimes fatal, side effects. In the 1990's, researchers \nidentified the gene variant that prevents affected patients from \nproperly breaking down Purinethol, allowing doctors to screen patients \nand adjust dosages for safer use of the drug.\n  Herceptin, another example, is a breast cancer drug that initially \nfailed in clinical trials. However, researchers discovered that 1 in 4 \nbreast cancers have too many copies of a certain gene, which helps \ncells grow, divide and repair themselves. Extra copies of this gene \ncause uncontrolled and rapid growth resulting in tumor formation. As it \nturns out, Herceptin is an effective drug for patients with this type \nof cancer, with significantly improved survival for affected women. \nHerceptin offers a clear illustration of the power of personalized \nmedicine and highlights the importance of incorporating genetic \nanalysis in the development and application of new therapies.\n  Realizing the promise of personalized medicine will require continued \nFederal leadership and agency collaboration; expansion and acceleration \nof genomics research; a capable genomics workforce; incentives to \nencourage development of genomic tests and therapies; and greater \nattention to the quality of genetic tests, direct-to-consumer \nadvertising and use of personal genomic information.\n  The Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act of 2007 will address many \nof these issues. The bill requires the Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to establish the Genomics and Personalized \nMedicine Interagency Working Group to expand and accelerate genomics \nresearch through enhanced communication, collaboration and integration \nof relevant activities.\n  Genetic and genomics research will be expanded, to increase the \ncollection of data that will advance both fields, through the support \nof the biobanking initiative aimed at increasing and improving genomic \nscreening tools, diagnostics and therapeutics. The Secretary will also \nestablish a national distributed database so data finding can be \nshared.\n  This bill requests that the Secretary support efforts to improve the \nadequacy of genetics and genomics training through modernized curricula \nand review of relevant certifications, and by identifying alternative \neducation options such as distance or on-line learning programs. In \naddition, the Secretary will promote initiatives to increase the \nintegration of genetics and genomics into all aspects of medical and \npublic health practice, with specific focus on training and guideline \ndevelopment for providers without expertise or experience in the field \nof genomics.\n  This bill also requests the National Academies of Science to formally \nstudy the development of companion diagnostic tests and to provide \nexpert guidance about the level of incentives and potential approaches \nto really move this area forward.\n  Last but not least, the bill focuses on the safety, efficacy and \navailability of information about genetic tests, including \npharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomics tests. The Secretary will contract \nwith the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study and make \nrecommendations regarding Federal oversight and regulation of genetic \ntests. After this study is complete, the Secretary will develop a \ndecision matrix to help determine which types of tests require review \nand the level of review needed for such tests as well as the \nresponsible agency. The Secretary will also establish a specialty area \nfor molecular and biochemical genetics tests at CMS and direct a review \nby the CDC of direct-to-consumer marketing practices.\n  In conclusion, we stand at this new and expansive frontier of \npersonalized medicine we must explore and test the hypotheses and \ninnovations in the area of genomics that can protect and promote our \nhealth. Genomics holds unparalleled promise for public health and for \nmedicine, and the Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act of 2007 will \nhelp us to fulfill this promise. I\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\nurge my colleagues to support me in passing this critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 979. A bill to establish a Vote by Mail grant program; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, on Election Day 2006 in Tillamook County, \nOR, 13 inches of rain fell. Roads were closed. Parts of the county \nbecame unreachable. Governor Kulongoski declared a state of emergency. \nAnd yet--70 percent of the voters in the county still cast their \nballots.\n  Why? Because Oregonians in Tillamook County and all over the State \ncast their votes by mail.\n  Even without weather like this, folks in other States around the \ncountry had trouble casting their votes.\n  In Denver, CO, hundreds of voters were turned away when the database \nof registered voters crashed.\n  Nearly a quarter of precincts in Indianapolis, IN, resorted to paper \nballots when poll workers couldn't figure out how to connect optical \nscan voting machines with the new touch-screen models.\n  In Johnson County, KS, poll workers used hand lotion to prevent the \ncounty's touch-screen voting machines from spitting out cards.\n  In Missouri, poll workers were demanding photo identification despite \na court ruling barring the practice.\n  In Shaker Heights, OH, voters were turned from the polls when \nelectronic voting machines failed to work.\n  Voters in Washington State received phone calls instructing them to \nvote at the wrong precinct.\n  A polling location in New Mexico received 150 ballots instead of \n1,500.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  The point is, vote by mail has worked in Oregon and not just in this \nelection, but in every election it has been used.\n  It's a pretty simple system. Voters get their ballots in the mail. \nWherever and whenever they would like, right up to Election Day, voters \ncomplete their ballots and return them.\n  Vote by mail makes polling place problems a thing of the past--no \nmore polls opening late and no more long lines.\n  There's no more confusion about whether you are on the voter rolls. \nEither you get the ballot in the mail, or you don't and if you don't, \nyou have ample time to contact your election officials to sort it out.\n  Vote by mail dramatically reduces the chance of voter fraud. Trained \nelection officials match the signature on each ballot against the \nsignature on each voter's registration card and no ballot is processed \nor counted until officials are satisfied that the two signatures match.\n  Vote by mail ensures a paper trail--each voter marks up their ballot \nand sends it in. That ballot is counted and then becomes the paper \nrecord used in the event of a recount.\n  There's less risk of voter intimidation and that's why a 2003 study \nof Oregon voters showed that those groups that would likely be most \nvulnerable to coercion, including the elderly, actually prefer vote by \nmail.\n  Vote by mail leads to more educated voters. Because folks get their \nballots weeks before the election, they have the time they need to get \neducated about the candidates and the issues, and deliberate in a way \nnot possible at a polling place.\n  And vote by mail generates costs savings that can be spent on other \npriorities like education, law enforcement and roads. Because there is \nno longer any need to transport equipment to polling stations and to \nhire and train poll workers, Oregon has reduced its election-related \ncosts by 30 percent since implementing vote by mail.\n  I think the Oregon experience can be copied elsewhere and that's why \nI am introducing my Vote by Mail Act of 2007 today, which creates a \nthree year, $18 million grant program to help states adopt vote by mail \nelection systems like the one that Oregon voters have been successfully \nusing for some time now.\n  To participate in the grant program, States must demonstrate that the \nvote by mail system they intend to implement includes the same elements \nthat have made Oregon's system so successful, including a system for \nrecording electronically each voter's registration and signature and a \nprocess for ensuring that the signature on each VBM ballot is verified \nagainst that voter's electronically recorded signature. States that \ndecide to participate in the program have the option of adopting vote \nby mail State-wide, within a group of selected counties, or even in a \nsingle county. States transitioning to vote by mail State-wide will \nreceive $2 million. States transitioning to VBM less than State-wide \nwill receive $1 million.\n  I think that vote by mail will improve the elections in every State \nthat adopts it. But to be sure, my bill instructs the Government \nAccountability Office to evaluate the benefits of vote by mail and to \nproduce a study comparing traditional voting methods and vote by mail.\n  I urge my colleagues to lend their support to the Vote by Mail Act of \n2007. I believe it can help ensure hassle-free elections and help \nrebuild confidence in our election system.\n  Because right now, some folks feel like they are so powerless to do \nanything to fix things that they throw their hands in the air and walk \naway. And society suffers. For democracies to work there needs to be \npublic engagement. But that requires a sense of investedness--unless I \nthink of the government as my government, which means it's considering \nmy interests and, more importantly, trying to solve them, it's pretty \nhard to stay invested.\n  The sense of resignation, of frustration, even dislocation, expressed \nby some folks troubles me. And I consider it my job to foster a greater \nsense of public investment. This means making sure that the government \nworks for everyone and that there are tangible results that you can \nshow people so that they understand that it's their government and that \nit works for them.\n  I think election reform like my vote by mail bill accomplishes this \ngoal at the most basic level. Without fair, trouble-free elections, \nyou've got serious problems. You don't even get past go. The public \ncan't have confidence in its government if it doesn't have confidence \nin the system that elected that government. As we saw in 2000 in \nFlorida, it is extremely difficult to untangle problems after Election \nDay so you really have to get it right the first time. Vote by mail \nhelps ensures this.\n  I am pleased to have my esteemed colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kerry as an original co-sponsor. I am also pleased that \nCongresswoman Susan David of California is introducing the House \ncompanion bill. I am also happy to announce that the American \nAssociation of People with Disabilities, the American Postal Workers \nUnion, Common Cause, and the National Association of Postal Supervisors \nare publicly supporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 979\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Vote by Mail Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Supreme Court declared in Reynolds v. Sims that \n     ``[i]t has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified \n     voters have a constitutionally protected right to vote . . . \n     and to have their votes counted.''.\n       (2) In the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections, voting \n     technology failures and procedural irregularities deprived \n     some Americans of their fundamental right to vote.\n       (3) In 2000, faulty punch card ballots and other equipment \n     failures prevented accurate vote counts nationwide. A report \n     by the Caltech/MIT Voting Technology Project estimates that \n     approximately 1,500,000 votes for president were intended to \n     be cast but not counted in the 2000 election because of \n     equipment failures.\n       (4) In 2004, software errors, malfunctioning electronic \n     voting systems, and long lines at the polls prevented \n     accurate vote counts and prevented some people from voting. \n     For instance, voters at Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio \n     waited in line for up to 12 hours because there were only 2 \n     machines available for 1,300 voters.\n       (5) In 2006, election day problems plagued voters in a \n     number of States as well. For instance, in Denver, Colorado, \n     hundreds of voters were turned away when the database of \n     registered voters crashed. In Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, \n     malfunctioning machines and an inadequate number of \n     provisional ballots generated long lines, causing many voters \n     to leave without casting a vote.\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\n       (6) Under the Oregon Vote by Mail system, election \n     officials mail ballots to all registered voters at least 2 \n     weeks before election day. Voters mark their ballots, seal \n     the ballots in both unmarked secrecy envelopes and signed \n     return envelopes, and return the ballots by mail or to secure \n     drop boxes. Once a ballot is received, election officials \n     scan the bar code on the ballot envelope, which brings up the \n     voter's signature on a computer screen. The election official \n     compares the signature on the screen and the signature on the \n     ballot envelope. Only if the signature on the ballot envelope \n     is determined to be authentic is the ballot forwarded on to \n     be counted.\n       (7) Oregon's Vote by Mail system has deterred voter fraud \n     because the system includes numerous security measures such \n     as the signature authentication system. Potential misconduct \n     is also discouraged by the power of the State to punish those \n     who engage in voter fraud with up to five years in prison, \n     $100,000 in fines, and the loss of their vote.\n       (8) Oregon's Vote by Mail system promotes uniformity and \n     strict compliance with Federal and State voting laws because \n     ballot processing is centralized in county clerk's offices, \n     rather than at numerous polling places.\n       (9) Vote by Mail is one factor making voter turnout in \n     Oregon consistently higher than the average national voter \n     turnout. For example, Oregon experienced a record voting-age-\n     eligible population turnout of 70.6 percent in the 2004 \n     presidential election, compared to 58.4 percent nationally. \n     Oregon's turnout of registered voters for that election was \n     86.48 percent.\n       (10) Women, younger voters, and homemakers also report that \n     they vote more often using Vote by Mail.\n       (11) Vote by Mail reduces election costs by eliminating the \n     need to transport equipment to polling stations and to hire \n     and train poll workers. Oregon has reduced its election-\n     related costs by 30 percent since implementing Vote by Mail.\n       (12) Vote by Mail allows voters to educate themselves \n     because they receive ballots well before election day, which \n     provides them with ample time to research issues, study \n     ballots, and deliberate in a way that is not possible at a \n     polling place.\n       (13) Vote by Mail is accurate--at least 2 studies comparing \n     voting technologies show that absentee voting methods, \n     including Vote by Mail systems, result in a more accurate \n     vote count.\n       (14) Vote by Mail results in more up-to-date voter rolls, \n     since election officials use forwarding information from the \n     post office to update voter registration.\n       (15) Vote by Mail allows voters to visually verify that \n     their votes were cast correctly and produces a paper trail \n     for recounts.\n       (16) In a survey taken 5 years after Oregon implemented the \n     Vote by Mail system, more than 8 in 10 Oregon voters said \n     they preferred voting by mail to traditional voting.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to address \nonline pharmacies; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nSessions to re-introduce the Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act. \nOur legislation protects the safety of consumers who wish to fill \nlegitimate prescriptions over the Internet, while holding accountable \nthose who operate unregistered pharmacies.\n  This legislation imposes basic, commonsense requirements on an \nindustry that presents both promise and peril.\n  First, this bill establishes disclosure standards for Internet \npharmacies.\n  Second, this bill prohibits an Internet pharmacy from dispensing or \nselling a controlled substance without an in-person examination by a \nphysician.\n  Third, it allows a State Attorney General to bring a civil action in \na federal district court to enjoin a pharmacy operating in violation of \nthe law, and to enforce compliance with the provisions of this law.\n  The disclosure requirements contained in this bill will allow \npatients to differentiate between shady off-shore pharmacies and \nlegitimate licensed ones. Under this legislation, pharmacies must \nclearly disclose: the name and address of the pharmacy. Contact \ninformation for the pharmacist-in-charge. A list of States in which the \npharmacy is licensed to operate.\n  They must also clearly post a statement that they comply with the \nrequirements in this legislation.\n  The bill states that pharmacies can dispense to patients only if they \nhave a valid prescription from a practitioner who has performed an in-\nperson examination. This requirement will ensure that doctors can \nverify the health status of a patient and ensure that the drug he or \nshe will receive from the pharmacy is medically appropriate.\n  This legislation recognizes that in the case of an emergency, a \npatient may not always be able to see his or her typical physician. For \nthat reason, it allows a doctor to designate a covering practitioner to \nwrite a valid prescription if he or she is not available.\n  Finally, this bill contains real penalties to hold accountable those \nwho continue to operate pharmacies in violation of these requirements.\n  First, for Internet sales of controlled substances, the bill makes \nclear that such activities are subject to the current Federal laws \nagainst illegal distributions and the same penalties applicable to \nhand-to-hand sales.\n  Second, the bill increases the penalties for illegal distributions of \ncontrolled substances categorized by the DEA as Schedule III, IV and V \nsubstances, with new penalties if death or serious bodily injury \nresults, and longer periods of supervised release available after \nconvictions.\n  The bill also allows a State's Attorney General to file a Federal \nmotion to stop these pharmacies from operating illegally, no matter \nwhere the entity is headquartered. Previously, this type of enforcement \nwould require a filing in every state.\n  Prescription drug abuse is a growing front on the War on Drugs, with \n15.1 million adults admitting to abuse of prescription drugs in a 2003 \nstudy. That's a 94 percent increase in the last decade.\n  Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported \nthat deaths from accidental drug overdoses nearly doubled from 1999 to \n2004, increasing from 11,155 in 1999 to 19,838 in 2004. Accidental drug \noverdoses are now the Nation's second-leading cause of accidental \ndeath, behind automobile crashes.\n  The CDC attributed the rise in drug overdose deaths to a higher use \nof prescription painkillers and increasing numbers of overdoses of \ncocaine and prescription sedatives. These increases did not occur in \nour inner cities; instead, the increase was described as being fueled \nby prescription drug abuse in middle-class, rural America--with \noverdose death rates doubling in 23 States, mostly in the South and \nMidwest.\n  Ready access to controlled substances over the Internet is helping to \nfuel these addictions. A study conducted by the National Center on \nAddiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University found at least 344 \nwebsites offering controlled substances.\n  89 percent of these pharmacies do not require a prescription from a \nphysician, accepting either an online consultation or no prescription \nat all.\n  38 percent of these pharmacies claim their drugs are shipping within \nthe United States, putting them within the reach of U.S. law \nenforcement.\n  We also know that internet pharmacies fill a disproportionate number \nof prescriptions for controlled substances. According to data from the \nNational Community Pharmacy Association (NCPA)-Pfizer Digest, \ncontrolled substances account for only 11 percent of the business at \ncommunity ``brick and mortar'' pharmacies. 89 percent of their business \nconsists of non-controlled prescription drugs. In contrast, \napproximately 95 percent of the business done by internet pharmacies is \ncontrolled substances.\n  To understand how many of these Internet pharmacy websites exist, \njust visit any Internet search engine. Type in the name of any \ncontrolled substance, like Vicodin, Oxycontin, codeine, or even \nanabolic steroids. Several websites will appear, offering to sell you \nthese drugs without a prescription and without a medical examination. \nSome of these websites simply ask patients to send copies of medical \nrecords, with no verification of their validity. Patients use these \npharmacies to obtain addictive drugs like Vicodin and Oxycontin. They \ncan receive these dangerous drugs without a doctor performing a \nphysical exam to ensure that an underlying health condition will not \ncause a dangerous side effect. Often, a credit card is all that is \nrequired.\n  Law enforcement officials are well aware of this growing problem but \nface many challenges in trying to find and prosecute rogue pharmacy \noperators. Last year, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales appeared before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee and warned at\n\n[[Page S3713]]\n\nthat time how ``the purchase of . . . controlled pharmaceuticals on the \nInternet is of great concern.'' He said that the Internet's wide \naccessibility and anonymity ``give drug abusers the ability to \ncircumvent the law, as well as sound medical practice, a[s] they \ndispense potentially dangerous controlled pharmaceuticals,'' and said \nthat, with ``no identifying . . . information on these websites, it is \nvery difficult for law enforcement to track any of the individuals \nbehind them.''\n\n  In January of this year, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales again \nappeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The problem had only \ngrown worse. He described the non-medicinal use of controlled substance \nprescription drugs as ``the fastest rising category of drug abuse in \nrecent years.'' He noted how ``[r]ogue pharmacies operating illicitly \nthrough the Internet increasingly have become a source for the illegal \nsupply of controlled substances,'' and offered to work with Congress to \ntry to adopt additional enforcement tools that may be appropriate.\n  I believe that the bill I introduce today will address many of these \nproblems that the Attorney General has identified.\n  At the same time, receiving medications from a legitimate, licensed \nInternet pharmacy is one of the new conveniences ushered in by the \nInternet age. This bill preserves the ability of well run pharmacies \nand well intentioned patients to access controlled substances by means \nof the Internet.\n  In closing, I want to share with you the story of Ryan T. Haight of \nLa Mesa, CA. Ryan was an 18-year-old honor student from La Mesa, CA, \nwhen he died in his home on February 12, 2001.\n  His parents found a bottle of Vicodin in his room with a label from \nan out-of-state pharmacy.\n  It turns out that Ryan had been ordering addictive drugs online and \npaying with a debit card his parents gave him to buy baseball cards on \neBay.\n  Without a physical exam or his parents' consent, Ryan had been \nobtaining controlled substances, some from an Internet site in \nOklahoma. It only took a few months before Ryan's life was ended by an \noverdose on a cocktail of painkillers.\n  Ryan's story is just one of many. Internet pharmacies are making it \nincreasingly easy for teens like Ryan to access deadly prescription \ndrugs. That is why I support this legislation. It creates sensible \nrequirements for Internet pharmacy websites that will not impact access \nto convenient, oftentimes cost-saving drugs.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and I \nask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 980\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, after working together with Senator \nFeinstein, I am pleased to help introduce the Online Pharmacy Consumer \nProtection Act of 2007. I have worked to take the lead in protecting \nconsumers specifically as it relates to the sale and distribution of \ncontrolled substances over the internet and holding liable those who do \nso via unregistered online pharmacies. I commend Senator Feinstein for \nher leadership on this issue and look forward to working with her to \npass this important piece of legislation.\n  This bill would prohibit the distribution of controlled substances by \nmeans of the Internet without a valid prescription and provides for the \nlegitimate online distribution of those drugs in certain circumstances. \nThis past January, Attorney General Gonzalez testified to the Judiciary \nCommittee that abuse of controlled substances is being fed by ``the \nproliferation of illicit Web sites that offer controlled substances for \nsale, requiring little more than a cursory online questionnaire and \ncharging double the normal price.'' Gonzales further testified that \n``[w]e must preserve legitimate access to medications over the Internet \nwhile preventing online drug dealers from using cyberspace as a haven \nfor drug trafficking. I look forward to working with the Congress to \nensure that controlled substances are dispensed over the Internet only \nfor legitimate medical purposes.'' The sale and distribution of \ncontrolled pharmaceuticals on the Internet of great concern because is \ngives those who abuse drugs the ability to circumvent the law, and \nsound medical practice. This bill would go a long way in addressing the \nconcerns expressed by Attorney General Gonzalez by reigning in a \npractice that has gone unregulated for far too long.\n  Recently, there has been an explosion in the number of online \npharmacies that provide controlled substances to users without valid \nprescriptions. Most illegal drug abuse involving prescription drugs is \nassociated with Internet purchases, where users are given a \nprescription without ever seeing a doctor. The most prominent abuse \noccurs with regard to controlled substances such as Hydrocodone, \nValium, Xanax, OxyContin, and Vicodin.\n  A 2006 study reported that ``a staggering 89 percent of sites selling \ncontrolled prescription drugs have no prescription requirements.'' \nAccording to the study, 15.1 million adults admitted to abusing \nprescription drugs, including 2.3 million abusers between the ages of \n12 and 17. Currently, there is no way to police this illegal activity.\n  The ease with which consumers may purchase controlled substances from \nonline pharmacies without a prescription is shocking. Often consumers \ncan obtain a prescription from physicians employed by the online \npharmacy by simply filling out a brief questionnaire on the pharmacy's \nwebsite. Most online pharmacies have no way to verify that the consumer \nordering the prescription is actually who they claim to be, or that the \nmedical condition the consumer describes actually exists. Thus, drug \naddicts and minor children can easily order controlled substances and \nprescription drugs over the internet simply by providing false \nidentities or\n\n[[Page S3716]]\n\ndescribing non-existent medical conditions.\n  In 2001, Ryan Haight, a California high school honors student and \nathlete, died from an overdose of the painkiller hydrocodone that he \npurchased from an online pharmacy. The doctor prescribing hydrocodone \nhad never met or personally examined Ryan. Ryan simply filled out the \npharmacy's online questionnaire, and described himself as a 25-year-old \nmale suffering from chronic back pain. Ryan's death could have been \navoided. I believe that Congress is in the best position to help \nprevent teenagers from purchasing controlled substances and \nprescription drugs from online rouge pharmacies.\n  I also believe that Congress has the ability to help prevent adult \nprescription drug abuse by making it harder to purchase these drugs \nonline without a valid prescription. The Online Pharmacy Consumer \nProtection Act would: (1) provide criminal penalties for those who \nknowingly or intentionally (unlawfully) dispense controlled substances \nover the Internet, (2) give state attorneys general a civil cause of \naction against anyone who violates the Act if they have reason to \nbelieve that the violation affects the interests of their state's \nresidents, and (3) allow the Federal Government to take possession of \nany tangible or intangible property used illegally by online \npharmacies.\n  The Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act would also require online \npharmacies to: (1) file a registration statement with the Attorney\n  General and meet additional registration requirements promulgated by \nhim/her, (2) report to the Attorney General any controlled substances \ndispensed over the Internet, and (3) comply with licensing and \ndisclosure requirements.\n  The Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2007 takes a \nsubstantial step towards plugging a loophole in our drug laws by \nregulating the practice of distributing controlled substances via the \ninternet.\n  By holding unregistered online pharmacies accountable for their \nactivity, we are ensuring that those who seek to purchase prescription \ndrugs by using the internet are protected from those engaged in \nreprehensible business practices.\n  Once again I thank Senator Feinstein for her leadership in addressing \nthis serious issue. I commend this bill to my colleagues for study and \nI urge them to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S. 982. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nintegration of mental health services and mental health treatment \noutreach teams, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, Senator Collins and I are \nreintroducing the Positive Aging Act, to improve the accessibility and \nquality of mental health services for our rapidly growing population of \nolder Americans. I want to thank Senator Collins for her leadership on \naging issues, and for partnering with me on numerous pieces of \nlegislation and initiatives related to these and other important health \nissues.\n  We are pleased to be reintroducing this important legislation in \nanticipation of reauthorization of the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration (SAMHSA).\n  I want to acknowledge and thank our partners from the mental health \nand aging community who have collaborated with us and have been working \ndiligently on these issues for many years, including the American \nPsychological Association, the American Association for Geriatric \nPsychiatry, the National Association of Social Workers, the Alzheimer's \nAssociation, the New York City Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association, \nthe American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, the \nAmerican Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the American \nMental Health Counselors Association, the American Society on Aging, \nthe Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, the Geriatric Mental \nHealth Alliance of New York, the Gerontological Society of America, \nMental Health America, the National Association of State Mental Health \nProgram Directors, the National Council on Aging, Psychologists in Long \nTerm Care, the Older Women's League, the Society of Clinical \nGeropsychology, the Suicide Prevention Action Network USA, and all the \nother groups who have lent their support.\n  American society today has benefited tremendously from advances in \nmedical science that are helping us to live longer than ever before. In \nNew York State alone, there are an estimated two and a half million \ncitizens aged 65 or older. And this population will only continue to \ngrow as the first wave of Baby Boomers turns 65 in less than ten years.\n  According to a December 2006 report from the U.S. Census Bureau, the \nnumber of older Americans aged 65 and over is expected to double over \nthe next 25 years, and nearly 20 percent of citizens will be 65 years \nor older by the year 2030. Further, the fastest growing segment of the \nU.S. population is the age group of Americans who are 85 and older.\n  Although it is encouraging that our Nation's citizens are living \nlonger than ever before, mental and behavioral health challenges \naccompany this increased longevity. So as we look forward to leading \nlonger lives, we must also acknowledge the challenges that we face \nrelated to the quality of life as we age.\n  Although most older adults enjoy good mental health, it is estimated \nthat nearly 20 percent of Americans age 55 or older experience a mental \ndisorder. In New York State alone, there are an estimated 366,000 \nadults aged 55 or older with mental health or substance abuse \ndisorders. Nationally, it is anticipated that the number of seniors \nwith mental and behavioral health problems will almost quadruple, from \n4 million in 1970 to 15 million in 2030.\n  Among the most prevalent mental health concerns older adults \nencounter are anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, and substance \nabuse. When left untreated, these problems can have severe physical and \npsychological implications. In fact, men age 85 and older have the \nhighest rates of suicide in our country and depression is the foremost \nrisk factor.\n  The physical consequences of mental health disorders can be both \nexpensive and debilitating. Depression has a powerful negative impact \non ability to function, resulting in high rates of disability. The \nWorld Health Organization projects that by the year 2020, depression \nwill remain a leading cause of disability, second only to \ncardiovascular disease. Even mild depression lowers immunity and may \ncompromise a person's ability to fight infections and cancers. Research \nindicates that 50-70 percent of all primary care medical visits are \nrelated to psychological factors such as anxiety, depression, and \nstress. Further, evidence suggests that an estimated 75 percent of \nseniors who commit suicide have visited a primary care professional \nwithin a month of their death.\n  Mental disorders do not have to be a part of the aging process \nbecause we have effective treatments for these conditions. But despite \nthese effective treatments, too many American seniors go without the \nservices they need and deserve because of poor integration of physical \nand mental health care. As of 2006, only 37 percent of New Yorkers who \nsuffer from depression had obtained mental health treatment.\n  The current divide in our country between health care and mental \nhealth care manifests itself in many ways. Too often physicians and \nother health professionals fail to recognize the signs and symptoms of \nmental health problems. Even more troubling, knowledge about treatment \nis simply not accessible to many primary care practitioners. As a \nwhole, we have failed to fully integrate mental health screening and \ntreatment into our health service systems.\n  These missed opportunities to diagnose and treat mental health \ndisorders are taking a tremendous toll on seniors and increasing the \nburden on their families and our health care system.\n  It is within our power and our responsibility to bridge the gap \nbetween physical and mental health care and help promote the well-being \nof older Americans.\n  In last year's reauthorization of the Older Americans Act, Senator \nCollins and I successfully enacted Title I of the Positive Aging Act of \n2005, which authorized grants for the delivery of mental health \nscreening and treatment\n\n[[Page S3717]]\n\nservices for older adults and grants to promote awareness and reduce \nstigma regarding mental disorders in later life.\n  While this took an important step toward improving mental health \nservices for older adults, significant efforts are necessary to ensure \ncomprehensive geriatric mental health care.\n  That is why I am reintroducing the Title II provisions of the \nPositive Aging Act of 2005 as the Positive Aging Act of 2007 with my \ncosponsor Senator Collins. This legislation would amend the Public \nHealth Service Act to improve access to mental health services for our \nnation's seniors by integrating mental health services into primary \ncare and community settings.\n  Specifically, the Positive Aging Act of 2007 would fund demonstration \nprojects to support integration of mental health services in primary \ncare settings.\n  It would fund grants for community-based mental health treatment \noutreach teams to improve older Americans' access to mental health \nservices.\n  This legislation would also ensure that these geriatric mental health \nprograms have proper attention and oversight by: mandating the \ndesignation of a Deputy Director for Older Adult Mental Health Services \nin the Center for Mental Health Services; including representatives of \nolder Americans or their families and geriatric mental health \nprofessionals on the Advisory Council for the Center for Mental Health \nServices; and requiring state plans under Community Mental Health \nServices Block Grants to include descriptions of the states' outreach \nto and services for older individuals.\n  And because substance-related disorders require the same attention as \nmental health conditions, the Positive Aging Act of 2007 will target \nsubstance abuse in older adults in projects of national significance.\n  Today, we are fortunate to have a variety of effective treatments to \naddress the mental health needs of American seniors. I believe that we \nowe it to older adults in this country to do all that we can to ensure \nthat they have access to high quality mental health care, so they can \nenjoy their golden years.\n  The Positive Aging Act of 2007 takes a critical step in this \ndirection, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact \nthis legislation during the upcoming SAMHSA reauthorization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                            of Social Workers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 23, 2007\n     Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Russell Senate Office Building\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Susan M. Collins,\n     Dirkson Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Clinton and Collins: The National Association \n     of Social Workers (NASW) is the largest professional social \n     work organization, with 150,000 members nationwide. NASW \n     promotes, develops, and protects the practice of social work \n     and social workers, while enhancing the well-being of \n     individuals, families, and communities through its work, \n     service, and advocacy.\n       NASW fully supports the Positive Aging Act of 2007, which \n     you are introducing today, along with Representatives Patrick \n     Kennedy (D-MA) and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL). Many older \n     adults are currently unable to obtain much-needed mental \n     health services for a variety of reasons, including lack of \n     access and the stigma attached to mental illness. The \n     Positive Aging Act of 2007 will help integrate primary care \n     with mental health care for older adults, particularly those \n     with low incomes, living in community settings.\n       Social workers are aware of the problems older people \n     encounter in obtaining necessary mental health care. \n     Frequently, they are called upon to address older adults' \n     mental health needs only after crises arise, when the \n     emotional toll on clients and their families is much higher, \n     and the costs to Medicare are much more significant.\n       Clinical social workers assess and treat many older \n     Americans with mental health needs. In fact, more than 39,000 \n     social workers now participate in Medicare, delivering mental \n     health services and enabling many thousands of older \n     beneficiaries to lead more fulfilling and healthier lives.\n       NASW is particularly supportive of the multidisciplinary \n     teams of mental health professionals envisioned in this bill \n     as an integral part of primary care services. These teams, \n     which include professional social workers, will have the \n     training and competence to meet older Americans' diverse \n     physical and behavioral health needs. The Association \n     commends the senators and representatives for raising these \n     vital health issues, and urges Congress to move quickly to \n     enact this legislation.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this vital health care \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Carolyn Polowy,\n     General Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           American Psychological Association,\n\n                                                   March 23, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Clinton and Collins: On behalf of the 148,000 \n     members and affiliates of the American Psychological \n     Association (APA), I am writing to applaud your ongoing \n     commitment to the mental and behavioral health needs of older \n     Americans and express our strong support for the Positive \n     Aging Act of 2007. This important legislation will improve \n     access to vital mental and behavioral health care for older \n     adults by supporting the integration of mental health \n     services into primary care and community settings.\n       An estimated 20 percent of community-based older adults in \n     the U.S. have a mental health problem. These disorders can \n     have a significant impact on both physical and mental health, \n     often leading to increases in disease, disability, and \n     mortality. Evidence suggests that up to 75 percent of older \n     adults who commit suicide have visited a primary care \n     professional within 30 days of their death. Although \n     effective treatments exist, the mental health needs of many \n     older Americans go unrecognized and untreated because of \n     poorly integrated systems of care to address the physical and \n     mental health needs of seniors.\n       The Positive Aging Act of 2007 takes an important step \n     toward improving access to quality mental and behavioral \n     health care for older adults by integrating mental health \n     services into primary care and community settings where older \n     adults reside and receive services. By supporting \n     collaboration between interdisciplinary teams of mental \n     health professionals and other providers of health and social \n     services, this legislation promotes an integrated approach to \n     addressing the health and well being of our nation's growing \n     older adult population.\n       We commend you for your leadership and commitment to the \n     mental and behavioral health needs of older adults and look \n     forward to working with you to ensure enactment of the \n     Positive Aging Act.

Through projects administered \n     by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration, this legislation will integrate mental health \n     services with other primary care services in community \n     settings that are easily accessible to the elderly.\n       Dementia, depression, anxiety and substance abuse among \n     Americans over age 65 are growing problems that result in \n     functional dependence, longterm institutional care and \n     reduced quality of life. Missed opportunities to diagnose and \n     treat mental diseases are taking a tremendous toll on the \n     elderly and increasing the burden on families and the health \n     care system. The ``Positive Aging Act'' will increase \n     opportunities for effective diagnosis and treatment of mental \n     disorders among the elderly.\n       AAGP is a professional membership organization dedicated to \n     promoting the mental health and well-being of older people \n     and improving the care of those with late-life mental \n     disorders. AAGP's membership consists of 2,000 geriatric \n     psychiatrists, as well as other health professionals who \n     focus on the mental health problems faced by senior citizens. \n     In addition, AAGP has an active Foundation which focuses on \n     reducing the stigma of mental disorders in the aging \n     population.\n       AAGP appreciates your leadership in addressing the mental \n     health needs of older Americans, and we look forward to \n     working with you on this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Christine deVries,\n     Executive Director.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/23/senate-section/article/S3718-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 121--TO DIRECT THE SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL TO APPEAR AS \n AMICUS CURIAE IN THE NAME OF THE SENATE IN SUPPORT OF THE APPELLEE IN \n              OFFICE OF SENATOR MARK DAYTON V.

An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of \n     the ruling of the chair on a point of order raised under this \n     section.\n       (d) General Point of Order.--lt shall be in order for a \n     Senator to raise a single point of order that several \n     provisions of a bill, resolution, amendment, motion, or \n     conference report violate this section. The Presiding Officer \n     may sustain the point of order as to some or all of the \n     provisions against which the Senator raised the point of \n     order. If the Presiding Officer so sustains the point of \n     order as to some of the provisions (including provisions of \n     an amendment, motion, or conference report) against which the \n     Senator raised the point of order, then only those provisions \n     (including provision of an amendment, motion, or conference \n     report) against which the Presiding Officer sustains the \n     point of order shall be deemed stricken pursuant to this \n     section. Before the Presiding Officer rules on such a point \n     of order, any Senator may move to waive such a point of order \n     as it applies to some or all of the provisions against which \n     the point of order was raised. Such a motion to waive is \n     amendable in accordance with rules and precedents of the \n     Senate.

\n     and\n       Whereas the people of the United States should carry on the \n     legacy of William Wilberforce by working to end the modern \n     slave trade, human trafficking, and the degradation of human \n     dignity: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) observes February 23, 2007, as the 200th anniversary of \n     the ban of the slave trade in the British Empire;\n       (2) recognizes the positive impact William Wilberforce had \n     on renewing the culture of his day and ending the inhumane \n     practice of human slavery;\n       (3) commends to the people of the United States the example \n     of William Wilberforce and his commitment to the values of \n     inherent human dignity and freedom, which reside in each and \n     every human being;\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States to--\n       (A) observe the 200th anniversary of the ban of the slave \n     trade in the British Empire;\n       (B) reflect on William Wilberforce's selfless dedication to \n     the fight against slavery and his commitment to the neediest \n     in society; and\n       (C) commit themselves to recognize the value of human life \n     and human dignity; and\n       (5) unequivocally condemns all forms of human trafficking \n     and slavery, which are an assault on human dignity that \n     William Wilberforce would steadfastly resist.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/23/senate-section/article/S3724-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE\n\n  The resolution (H.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 121 that was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 121) to direct the Senate Legal \n     Counsel to appear as amicus curiae in the name of the Senate \n     in support of the appellee in Office of Senator Mark Dayton \n     v. Brad Hanson.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this resolution concerns an appeal pending \nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States in an action brought by a \nformer Senate employee against his employing office, the Office of \nformer Senator Mark Dayton. In 2003, the former employee sued the \noffice under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. As a defense \nto the suit, the office asserted that the Speech or Debate Clause of \nthe Constitution barred a suit by the employee, because during his time \nwith the office his job included legislative duties.\n  The lower courts denied this argument and refused to dismiss the suit \non that ground. The office has now appealed this case to the Supreme \nCourt, placing directly before the High Court the question of the \napplication of the Speech or Debate Clause to suits brought under the \nCongressional Accountability Act.\n  As the scope of the Speech or Debate Clause will now be considered in \nthe merits of an appeal by the Supreme Court for the first time in \nalmost 30 years, it is important that the Senate as an institution have \na voice in those proceedings to protect the Senate's interests in that \nimportant constitutional privilege that secures the independence of \nthis body from the other branches of Government.\n  It is also important that the legal counsel appear on the Senate's \nbehalf in this action so that the Court can be presented with the \nSenate's understanding of the proper application of the Speech or \nDebate Clause to the Congressional Accountability Act. Congress passed \nthe act to apply to Congress the same Federal workplace and employment \nlaws that applied to the private sector and the executive branch, \ngiving our employees the same protections enjoyed by employees \nelsewhere. That was done with the understanding that suits by \ncongressional employees, even employees with legislative duties, were \nnot automatically barred by the Speech or Debate Clause privilege of \nMembers.\n  Accordingly, as the Supreme Court is now being urged to bar all \nCongressional Accountability Act suits that are brought for adverse \npersonnel actions by employees with any legislative duties, it is \nimportant that the Senate present to the Court the position that suits \nunder the Congressional Accountability Act can proceed consistent with \nthe Speech or Debate Clause. While that Clause would provide Members \nwith a robust evidentiary and testimonial privilege concerning their \nlegislative activities in these lawsuits and may limit permissible \nrelief, it does not automatically block all such suits at the outset.\n  In addition, the Supreme Court has directed the parties to brief the \nadditional questions of whether the case has become moot because \nSenator Dayton has left office, and whether the office of Senator \nDayton could appeal the case directly to the Supreme Court. On these \nquestions, the legal counsel will describe why suits brought under the \nCongressional Accountability Act against the office of a Member of \nCongress do not become moot after the Member departs from Congress. \nIndeed, the contrary position would undermine the act's important \nprotections for employees whose Members are soon to end their \ncongressional service. The legal counsel will also argue that the \nappeal is not within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court as the \nprovision of the Congressional Accountability Act that provides for \ndirect appeal to the Supreme Court is not satisfied here.\n  In sum, this resolution would direct the Senate legal counsel to \nappear in this action on behalf of the Senate to protect the Senate's \ninterests in the proper application of the Speech or Debate Clause to \ncivil suits brought under the Congressional Accountability Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; and that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 121) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 121\n\n       Whereas, in the case of Office of Senator Mark Dayton v. \n     Brad Hanson, No. 06-618, pending in the Supreme Court of the \n     United States, the application of the Speech or Debate \n     Clause, Article I, section 6, clause I of the Constitution to \n     suits brought under the Congressional Accountability Act, \n     Pub. L. No. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3 (1995), has been placed in \n     issue; and\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(c), 706(a), and 713(a) of \n     the Ethics in Government Act of 1978,2 U.S.C. 288b(c), \n     288e(a), and 288l(a), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     appear as amicus curiae in the name of the Senate in any \n     legal action in which the powers and responsibilities of \n     Congress under the Constitution are placed in issue: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is directed to \n     appear as amicus curiae on behalf of the Senate in support of \n     Appellee Brad Hanson in Office of Senator Mark Dayton v.
