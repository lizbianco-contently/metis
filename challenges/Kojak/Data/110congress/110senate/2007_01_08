We hope to complete \nthe voting by 12 noon if all goes right. But there will be votes \nFriday.\n  We will not finish this ethics bill this week, but we will finish \nnext week, unless something untoward develops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S205-7", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S205-S206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING PRESIDENT GERALD FORD\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I never had the opportunity to meet with \nGerald Ford when he was President, but I did when he was Vice \nPresident. I was chairman of the National Lieutenant Governors \nConference. This was during the height of the energy crisis, and we \ncame to Washington. One of the pleasures was meeting with the Vice \nPresident in the White House. That was really a big deal for me, a \nyoung Lieutenant Governor from Nevada. And a week or so after having \nmet with the Vice President, he sent a picture to my home, a picture of \nme and the Vice\n\n[[Page S206]]\n\nPresident. That was really a significant event in the Reid family, but \nalso my boy thought it was a significant event, and he took a crayon \nand marked all over that picture--my prized picture of my being in \nWashington, sitting with the Vice President. So my wife and I labored \nfor some time and worked to get the crayon off that picture. We did a \npretty good job. I still have the picture, but you can see my boy's \nmarking on that with his crayon. I wish I had the opportunity to talk \nto the Vice President about that. I am sure he would have laughed.\n\n  President Ford was a wonderful man. We all know he died the day after \nChristmas. He was 93 years old. There were celebrations, as there \nshould have been, in the Capitol Rotunda, at the National Cathedral, \nthe Ford Presidential Library in Grand Rapids, MI, and the Episcopal \nChurch in Grand Rapids, MI, where I had the opportunity to attend at \nthe invitation of the former First Lady. The speeches were good. Former \nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld spoke, President Jimmy Carter spoke, a \nnoted historian spoke. It was really a quite moving event.\n  We have heard tales during the past couple weeks of Gerald Ford and \nthe athlete he was. We have even read from Chevy Chase, who became \nfamous literally making fun of Gerald Ford. He made fun of him \nbecause--he was a big man--coming out of an airplane once, he hit his \nhead on the airplane door, and that was the beginning of Chevy Chase's \ncareer.\n  The fact is, even though Chevy Chase became famous making fun of \nPresident Ford, we have never had a more athletic President than \nPresident Ford--All-Big Ten; he was a great, outstanding football \nplayer at the University of Michigan.\n  As a Member of Congress, he was outstanding. He was praised by people \nwho served with him. He served for about 25 years in the Congress and \nbecame the Republican leader. He, of course, was Commander in Chief as \nPresident of the United States. But one of the things we have learned \nso directly during the last couple weeks is how great he was to his \nwife Betty. She, during the time of their real public presence, had \nbreast cancer and had a bout with alcoholism, and she approached both \nin a very strong, courageous way. The Betty Ford Clinic in Palm Springs \nis a place where people go to find that they are addicted and need \nhelp. But we have learned what a wonderful wife she was to President \nFord and what a great First Lady she was to her entire country.\n  We have heard tributes from Senators, Governors, clergy, newsmen, and \nPresidents. They differed in tone and substance, but they all made the \npoint of stressing one thing: Gerald Ford was, above all, a man of \nintegrity, a man of honesty, and, ultimately, a role model for all of \nus who serve in Government.\n  He, of course, is the only man to become President who was never \nelected. Yet, time and time again, he proved himself the right man at \nthe right time, healing the Nation after the scars of Watergate and \nmoving our country forward.\n  Husband to his wife Betty, father to his beautiful children, Michael, \nJohn, Steven, and Susan, World War II veteran, star athlete, even an \nEagle Scout--Gerald Ford was the core of what America is all about, a \nshining example of what we hold best in America. He took office at a \ndark time in our country's history and shepherded this Nation through \nthe trials of Vietnam and Watergate, with a bipartisan spirit of \nreconciliation and grace, a shining example to us all. He reminded a \nwounded nation of the honesty and decency of its leaders.\n  Mr. President, we all hope when we pass on our friends and colleagues \nwill look back and say we left the world a better place. With Gerald \nFord, there is no doubt. This Government, this Nation, this world are \nbetter from Gerald Ford's life and service to our country, and for this \nthe Senate honors his life today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S206-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S.

Mr. President, many praiseworthy things have been said \nabout Gerald Rudolph Ford over the past 2 weeks, and this is good. It \nis good to see so many people speak so well of a man who was often \nwrongly criticized in life, and it has been uplifting to watch an \nentire nation stop and reflect on what it means to live a good life, \ngood to see that old virtues still have the power to inspire.\n  Of course, Gerald Ford didn't seek out the Presidency, and certainly \nhe came into the highest elected position in the land in the \nunlikeliest of ways.\n  I was recently reminded that his life didn't get off to the most \npromising start. Born Leslie Lynch King, Jr., in Omaha, NE, his mother \nand father divorced when he was 2.\n  His mother picked up and moved back home to Grand Rapids, where she \nmarried a paint and varnish salesman. Gerald Ford, Sr., gave Dorothy \nthree more boys--and her first son a new name that he would carry into \nhistory.\n  The childhood home was pleasant, but since money was tight, Junior \nhad to mow lawns and grill hamburgers after school.\n  The experiences of the boy had an effect on the man: Ford would later \ngain a reputation in Congress as a fiscal conservative, as someone who \nthought that Government, like any household, should live within its \nbudget. He didn't learn this from a policy paper. He didn't need to.\n  We have heard that Gerald Ford was a great athlete, that he could \nhave played with the Packers or the Lions, but he took a job as an \nassistant coach at Yale instead. And determined to go to Yale Law \nSchool, he convinced the faculty to let him on parttime. They did.\n  Gerry Ford once said:\n\n       The harder you work, the luckier you are. I worked like \n     hell.\n\n  He ended up in the top fourth of a law school class that included a \nfuture Supreme Court Justice, a future Secretary of State--and a future \nPresident.\n  We have heard how President Ford signed up for the Navy after Pearl \nHarbor; that he put duty and country first, and nearly got swept off \nthe deck of the USS Monterey in the middle of a typhoon. It wouldn't be \nhis last brush with an early death.\n  And we have heard a love story: that Ford came home to Michigan after \nthe war and married a pretty young dancer named Betty Bloomer; that he \nstarted to think about politics, and that Betty wasn't worried at all \nabout it distracting from family life. ``I never thought he'd win,'' \nshe said.\n  But, of course, he did.\n  The Fords moved east, and decided to stay awhile, and stayed together \nthrough it all--until last week, when Betty, older now but no less \ngraceful, said good-bye to her husband, the President, in the same \nchurch where they said ``I do'' 58 years ago.\n  We have been inspired by the story of President Ford's political \ncareer--how he didn't make a name for himself with high-profile \nspeeches or partisan broadsides; how he did his job, and did it well, \nin big and little things.\n  He built a reputation as someone who could bridge the gap, who \nbrought people together and worked problems out. Gerry Ford summed up \nhis approach to lawmaking this way:\n\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\n\n       You have to give a little, take a little, to get what you \n     really want. But you don't give up your principles.\n\n  All this is what we have heard about Gerald Rudolph Ford's life \nbefore the President of the United States called him at home on October \n6, 1973, to see if he would be willing to replace a Vice President who \nhad resigned in disgrace.\n  Congressmen all over Washington were sitting by their phones that \nnight, hoping the call would come for them. Gerry Ford was swimming \nlaps.\n  And 8 months later, when the President himself resigned, Ford was \nthere again.\n  There's a plaque at the Ford library which says that Gerald Ford may \nhave been among the unluckiest Presidents of the 20th century. Where I \ncome from we don't call that luck. We call it providence.\n  As Ford himself put it: 1975 was ``not a time for summer soldiers and \nsunshine patriots. It was a year of fears and alarms.'' Gerry Ford was \nthe right man for the moment because he was a good man all along.\n  And what did he bring to the presidency? Exactly what we needed in \nthat dark and painful hour: honesty, simplicity, and what he liked to \ncall, ``a little straight talk''.\n  Ford's sincerity may have been his greatest gift, but it almost \nsurely cost him the greatest honor the voters could have given him. He \ntold them plainly, just a few months after taking the oath, that the \nstate of the Union wasn't good.\n  He gave them bad news again the next year, an election year when most \npeople would have been tempted to gloss over problems. The state of the \nUnion was better, he said, but it still wasn't good enough.\n  And when he lost, he wasn't bitter. He even made a point to make sure \nthe transition was smooth. He didn't want Jimmy Carter to face the same \nproblems he did, he said.\n  I remember those days. I was a young lawyer in Ford's Justice \nDepartment. I remember how the new President restored hope in our \ncountry, in the presidency, and in the Republican Party.\n  I remember how he lost his own race for reelection but cleared the \nway for another great Midwesterner to win 4 years later.\n  This Nation has owed a tribute to Gerald Ford for a long time, and it \nis good that he has gotten it in these last days.\n  In weaker moments, we tend to think that victory goes to the fast, \nthe brilliant, the well-born. But in one of our Nation's weakest \nmoments, Gerald Ford showed us leadership through the gentlemanly \nvirtues of honesty, integrity, and plain hard work.\n  The tributes now are almost done. But the greatest tribute we can \ngive to Gerald Rudolph Ford lies ahead. The American people have shown \nhow much they admire leaders who are honest, straightforward, kind.\n  In the early days of a new session, we best honor the memory of our \n38th President, and the Nation he loved and served so well, by making \nthose qualities our own.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished majority leader \nand minority leader for their initiative in putting this resolution \ntogether. I, also, thank both of our distinguished leaders for \nincluding in the resolution a reference to the action by the Senate, an \ninitiative we took in the Senate Armed Services Committee at the time \nthat I was privileged to be chairman and the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Levin, was the ranking member, to name one of America's \nfuture aircraft carriers, now under construction, the USS Gerald R. \nFord. This initiative then was taken into consideration by the \nDepartment of Defense, the Secretary at that time, and, indeed, the \nSecretary of the Navy. The Secretary of the Navy has, traditionally, \nresponsibility for the naming of ships. And whereas the Armed Services \nCommittee recommended during floor consideration of the annual defense \nauthorization bill that the naming be written in law, in conference, at \nthe request of the Secretary of the Navy, we made it a sense of the \nCongress.\n  The Department of Defense will host a ceremony on January 16th, with \nthe Ford family and others to formally name the ship in honor of \nPresident Ford.\n  I, also, thank Jack Marsh, former Secretary of the Army and former \ncounselor to President Ford, for his participation in the effort by the \nSenate to take this initiative, as well as former Secretary of Defense \nMelvin Laird. I collaborated with both of those distinguished \ngentlemen. Secretary Laird was a lifetime friend and served in Congress \nwith, then, Gerald Ford.\n  As we go forth in our careers, we always should look back to \nacknowledge those who made it possible for us to achieve our goals. I \nam always very humbled by the many people who helped inspire me to run \nfor the Senate and who helped me win election. Gerald Ford was right \nthere at the beginning of my first race with sound, practical advice.\n  I ask the indulgence of my colleagues where I recount some of that \nadvice: It started, I remember, in the summer of 1960. I was an advance \nman for then Vice President Nixon. We were on a campaign train trip \nthrough the Middle Western States, that included a stop in Michigan. \nThis was the old-fashioned train with the observation car, where the \ncandidate would go out on the rear platform and give a speech to the \ncrowds that gathered in all the little towns and communities along the \nroute. But we had one very memorable stop, I remember the town was \nMuskegon, Michigan.\n  My job was to get the candidate, the Vice President, and some of his \nsenior staff off the train and to the auditorium in town. In performing \nthese tasks, I was joined by an elected Michigan official. In a moment, \nI will provide his name. As we entered the building, we went into a \nholding area. I was awaiting a cue from the master of ceremonies on \nstage to bring on the Vice President. He was escorted by this local \nofficial. As we were waiting, unbeknownst to us, in the balcony, some \nmischievous people--I don't think it was evil, but it was mischievous--\nsuddenly pelted us all with raw eggs. There we were, the Vice President \nwith eggs streaming down off him. I took out my handkerchief and did \nthe best I could to polish him up a bit, and the local official did the \nsame. The Vice President went on the stage, fully composed, and gave an \nexcellent speech.\n  I went back to the train thinking that I would be severely \nreprimanded and my first job in politics terminated. Well, it turns out \nthat the local official who helped me get him up to the stage and who \nalso helped to polish-up the Vice President joined me in the \nobservation car, where they were serving beer. As he came in, I thanked \nhim, but said: You know, I think this is the end of my political \ncareer.\n  And he said: Why so?\n  And I described my responsibility. And he then said: Well, of course, \nI am a local Congressman and I should bear the responsibility.\n  And we joined each other with a beer, he said to me: You know, I \nthink both of us will survive.\n  That was Gerald Ford, showing the magnanimity of that marvelous man \nand his understanding of those types of situations.\n  I want to thank that wonderful American for his contribution to \ninspire me later in years to try for the Senate. He was then Vice \nPresident, and he used to counsel me on how to get started in public \nlife. I was then Secretary of the Navy, having succeeded John Chafee, a \nformer Member of this body, the much revered Senator from Rhode Island. \nAnd John Chafee had left the Navy Secretary's Office and ran for the \nSenate and was defeated in his first bid. And I was ready to plunge in \nand try my first race when Ford said to me: No, you want to kind of get \nbehind you this career in the Department of Defense, because it was a \nhighly controversial period of history. There was much concern among \nthe citizenry, not unlike what we see today.\n  I took his advice. And he said: Go run the Bicentennial. I will get \nyou appointed to that Presidential Office.\n  I said: Mr. President, I don't even know how to spell the word.\n  He said: Study up on it.\n  Not only did he do that, but he came down as Vice President and \nadministered the oath to me on the steps of his beloved House of \nRepresentatives. The Bicentennial was a marvelous career opportunity to \nlearn the fundamentals of public office. I worked with him\n\n[[Page S208]]\n\nclosely, took an enormous interest, as he knew the Bicentennial would \nbecome a healing mechanism for the country in the aftermath of \nWatergate. He was right. I traveled with him on July 4, 1976, in his \nhelicopter, and we made stops along the way. I will never forget going \nto New York Harbor on the final day of the two year celebration. And \nthere we were on the deck of a carrier. And he struck the ship's bell \nsuch that it triggered church bells all across the United States to \ncelebrate that day in American history.\n  While we were standing there, he told me about his trip to sea in \n1944. I read from his biography:\n\n       His closest call with death came not as a result of enemy \n     fire, however, but during a vicious typhoon in the Philippine \n     Sea in December 1944. He came within inches of being swept \n     overboard while the storm raged. The ship, which was severely \n     damaged by the storm and the resulting fire, had to be taken \n     out of service. Ford spent the remainder of the war ashore \n     and was discharged as a lieutenant commander in February \n     1946.\n\n  During the course of the war, he was awarded the Bronze Star, and \nother decorations for his valiant service. But I remember when I went \noverseas in 1951, as a communications officer for a Marine Corps \nsquadron. We were aboard the same class of ship. It was a small \ncarrier. We also went through a typhoon in the South Pacific en route \nto Korea. It was 72 hours of memory that will never be erased, but I \nknow what he went through because I think that typhoon was far more \nsevere than the one our ship experienced. So I take my hat off to this \nmagnificent American, who was among those who made it possible for me, \nin many respects, to eventually be privileged to represent the State of \nVirginia in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the sense of \nCongress naming the CVN-78 aircraft carrier as the USS Gerald R. Ford \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 1012. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NAMING THE CVN-78 AIRCRAFT \n                   CARRIER AS THE U.S.S. GERALD R. FORD.\n\n       1. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Gerald R. Ford has served his country with honor and \n     distinction for the past 64 years, and continues to serve.\n       (2) Gerald R. Ford was commissioned in the Naval Reserve in \n     1942 and served valiantly at sea on the U.S.S.

Ford was appointed by President \n     Nixon to the office of Vice President of the United States \n     under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, having been \n     confirmed by overwhelming majorities in both Houses of \n     Congress.\n       (9) On August 9, 1974, Gerald R.

Gerald \n     R. Ford.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of Michigan's \ngreat sons. Today we honor the remarkable life and lasting legacy of \nPresident Gerald R. Ford. I thank our leaders and colleagues for the \nwonderful tribute that will be voted on at noontime today.\n  This past week our Nation mourned the passing of a President, while \nMichigan mourned the loss of a family member. Throughout his decades in \npublic service, including a quarter century representing Michigan in \nthe Congress, Gerald Ford worked tirelessly to serve the people and the \ninterests of our great State and his beloved country.\n  It is an honor that the State of Michigan will serve as the final \nresting place for one of our Nation's great leaders. The funeral last \nWednesday, which I was fortunate enough to attend, was truly a moving \ntribute to a man who cared deeply for the city of Grand Rapids, his \nhome State of Michigan, and the country. The thousands of mourners who \ncame to pay their respects is evidence of what he meant to us. People \nstanding in line for hours, on into the night, and the wonderful, \ngracious way the family greeted so many of those coming to show their \nrespect for Gerald Ford was a wonderful, meaningful act to watch.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't take the opportunity to speak about \nGerald Ford's family. Betty Ford's grace and strength throughout the \npast few weeks have stood as a reminder not only of the importance of \nfamily in the life of Gerald Ford but also how much she has given to \nAmerica through her courage, her example, and her charity. Betty Ford \nstood shoulder to shoulder with President Ford as a true partner \nthroughout his life, while redefining the role of First Lady and \nserving the country with her own dedicated work on issues such as \nalcohol and drug abuse. Together the Fords raised four remarkable \nchildren--Michael, John, Steven, and Susan. It is a testimony to Gerald \nFord's character that he will be remembered not only as a great leader \nbut as a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.\n  Born July 14, 1913, in Omaha, NE, Ford moved at a young age with his \nmother to Grand Rapids, MI, to live with his stepfather.\n  While attending South High School in Grand Rapids, Ford proved \nhimself an academic and athletic prodigy, being named not only to the \nhonor society but all-city and all-State football teams.\n  In 1931, Gerald Ford entered the University of Michigan, playing \ncenter and linebacker for the Wolverines. He played on two undefeated \nteams and was named the team's most outstanding player in 1934. Ford's \nlegacy will always be felt at the university. To this day, his number \n28 is one of only 5 football jerseys retired by the University of \nMichigan, while the School of Public Policy bearing his name will shape \nand produce America's leaders for generations to come.\n  Gerald Ford's childhood in Grand Rapids and his education both on and \noff the field at the University of Michigan helped forge a man whose \ncharacter and actions throughout his life exemplified what is best \nabout Michigan--hard work, loyalty, honesty, and selflessness.\n  After graduating from Michigan, Ford rebuffed offers from the Detroit \nLions and the Green Bay Packers in order to attend Yale University Law \nSchool. He continued his love of athletics there by serving as a boxing \ncoach and assistant varsity football coach. In 1941, he earned his law \ndegree from Yale, graduating in the top quarter of his class.\n  Gerald Ford then returned to the city he considered his home, Grand \nRapids, to practice law before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve in April \n1942, serving as an assistant navigator with the USS Monterey in the \nPacific during World War II. Ford was discharged from the Navy in 1946 \nas a lieutenant commander, returning to Michigan to practice law.\n\n[[Page S209]]\n\n  Entering politics with the encouragement of his stepfather, Gerald \nFord ran for Congress in 1948, unseating incumbent Bartel Jonkman in \nthe primary and going on to receive 61 percent of the vote in the \ngeneral election. Gerald Ford would go on to represent the people of \nMichigan in Congress for the next 25 years, in 1965 rising to become \nthe minority leader in the House.\n  In late 1973, Ford was called on to serve the country in a different \ncapacity, as we all know, being named and confirmed Vice President. \nWithin 8 short months, he was again called on to take the mantle of \nresponsibility he had not sought, taking the oath of office as the 38th \nPresident of the United States. Stepping into the Oval Office during \none of America's greatest constitutional crises, President Ford's quiet \ndemeanor and steady hand helped calm a nation and kept the Government \nmoving forward during some of its darkest days.\n  It is a testament to President Ford and his time in public office, \nhighlighted by his years in the White House, that even those who \ndisagreed with his policy positions respected him as a person and a \npublic servant. Gerald Ford dedicated his life to make our State and \nour Nation a better place to live, work, and raise a family. He was a \nman who understood that integrity and service are more than just words, \nthey are ideals--ideals he learned in our wonderful Michigan and \npracticed every day of his life.\n  As a husband, a father, a Congressman, and our President, he led \nquietly by example, earning respect and friendship on both sides of the \naisle through the hard work and honesty for which he was known. \nPresident Ford was a man utterly deserving of the words inscribed on a \nfootball resting on a homemade memorial outside the Ford Museum in \nGrand Rapids this week:\n\n       A true American and a hometown hero.\n\n  President Ford, we thank you for your service. You will be missed. \nOur continuing prayers and support go to your family.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased the Senate is formally \nexpressing its respect and appreciation for the life and public service \nof President Gerald R. Ford.\n  No person in public service in my memory did more to restore \nconfidence in our political institutions than President Ford.\n  He was a friend and mentor to me as a member of the body, giving me \nsound advice and serving as a wonderful role model during my career in \nCongress and in the Senate.\n  I admired him enormously. His seriousness of purpose and his common \nsense approach to solving our national problems were qualities that \nenabled him to give our nation a new sense of confidence and direction.\n  We are deeply grateful that he served so ably as our Republican \nLeader in the House, Vice President, and President of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of Gerald Ford, the \n38th President of the United States. President Ford shouldered his \nburden with a unique sense of humility and good humor, in an office not \nknown for nourishing those traits. President Ford's unusual combination \nof courage, strength, and conviction led America out of a deep crisis, \nhealing our wounds and strengthening our Constitution in the process.\n  Gerald Ford was a self-made Michigander who worked part-time jobs as \na young man to help support his family, and later to put himself \nthrough Yale Law School. A man of many talents, he could have been a \nprofessional football player, or lived well as an attorney. But \ninstead, he chose a life of service, first as a decorated naval \nofficer, then a 24-year Member of Congress, leader of his party in the \nHouse of Representatives, and Presiding Officer of this Chamber as Vice \nPresident.\n  Domestic turmoil and foreign policy challenges marked the mid-1970s, \nand President Ford addressed them both. History has favorably judged \nhis actions to move the country beyond the Watergate scandal, although \nhe paid a heavy price at the time. He also acknowledged the severe \neconomic difficulties faced by millions of Americans and worked head-on \nto alleviate them.\n  Despite the host of domestic challenges America faced, President Ford \nremained a committed internationalist. He advanced the cause of peace \nin the Middle East, helping to end hostilities between Israel and Egypt \nand laying the groundwork for a peace between those two countries that \nendures to this day. His backing of the Helsinki Accords, while \ncontroversial, gave important support to dissidents living under Soviet \nrule who sought respect for their human rights.\n  Throughout his life, Gerald Ford handled the responsibilities and \nchallenges that circumstance thrust on him without losing his \nMidwestern openness and sensibility. To many who disagreed with him, he \nstill came across as a comforting figure who had the Nation's best \ninterests at heart. Central to this ability to connect with people was \nhis self-deprecating sense of humor, summed up by the quip, ``I'm a \nFord, not a Lincoln.''\n  And while he may not have been a Lincoln, he certainly was not a \ncommon President. America is a better place because of him, and we all \nowe President Ford and his wife, Betty, a tremendous debt of gratitude.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to President \nGerald Ford. His passing on December 26, 2006, was marked with a \nyearning for the unity he brought to our Nation over 30 years ago. I \nextend my sincerest and most heartfelt sympathies to his family.\n  Gerald Ford and I were in Congress together for a brief period of \ntime. He was a friend to me when I was a freshman Senator and \nthroughout my career. I will always remember and appreciate his support \nand counsel.\n  President Ford came into office at a very difficult time and faced \nmultiple tasks. He met those challenges and successfully brought the \nNation through a tumultuous period in the history of the presidency. \nWhile his time in the White House was relatively short, his legacy \ncontinues to persist. President Ford's leadership and credibility \nworked to bring the Nation through the Watergate crisis and its \naftermath. That proved to be invaluable and underscored the resiliency \nof our democratic government.\n  My wife Nancy and I send our condolences and prayers to First Lady \nBetty Ford and to the entire Ford family. We join the Nation in \nmourning President Ford and in honoring a long life of service. May his \nsoul rest in peace.\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe 38th President of the United States.\n  Gerald Ford was an honest man, a modest man, and a patriotic man who \ncared deeply about this country. During World War II, he answered his \nNation's call to duty, serving in the Navy aboard the USS Monterey in \nthe Pacific Theatre. He later trained new naval officers for sea duty. \nShortly after his discharge as a lieutenant commander in 1946, he began \nhis storied political career.\n  During his 25 years of service in the House of Representatives, \nGerald Ford earned the respect and admiration of nearly everyone in \nWashington. Gerald Ford's impeccable integrity made him the ideal \nchoice to lead America at a time of considerable division.\n  When he was nominated by President Nixon to become Vice President, he \nwas confirmed overwhelmingly by the Senate and the House. The Senate \nvote was 92-3, and the House vote was 387-35.\n  Before President Nixon submitted his nomination for Vice President, \nhe asked the leadership of both parties who they would choose were they \nin his shoes. The obvious response was Gerald Ford.\n  When Gerald Ford assumed the Presidency following President Nixon's \nresignation, he moved quickly to bring our country together. He did \nthis by always remaining true to his character. He also adhered to the \ncommon-sense principles that guided him throughout his career and his \nlife. He never lost touch with his Midwestern values. And he never \nwavered from doing what he thought was in the best interests of the \npeople of our country.\n  President Ford also attracted very talented employees. Among those \nwho served in the Ford Administration were Alan Greenspan, Council of \nEconomic Advisers; George H.W. Bush, CIA Director; James Baker, \nUndersecretary of Commerce; Dick Cheney, Chief of Staff; and Donald \nRumsfeld, Chief of Staff and later Secretary of Defense.\n  I had the pleasure of working with President Ford when he appointed \nme\n\n[[Page S210]]\n\nvice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board in 1976.\n  President Ford was a reliable friend and invaluable counselor. I will \nnever forget his coming to Texas to campaign with me during my first \nrace for the Senate. President Ford was always available to offer \nadvice and remained in close touch with those of us who were his many \nappointees, staff, and colleagues over the years. This is the kind of \nperson he was. It was an honor and a privilege to consider him a \nfriend.\n  He cared deeply for his family, for his loving wife Betty, and for \nhis four children: Michael, John, Steven, Susan.\n  He cared for everyone he came to know during his magnificent \npolitical career.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to Betty and the entire Ford family as \nwe honor a public servant who gave tirelessly to our country. He will \nbe missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S210-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

FORD\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I don't know if my friends on the other \nside of the aisle want any of the 3 minutes remaining. If not, I will \nproceed.\n  I wanted to comment, briefly, on the life and passing of Gerald Ford \nduring this period. I was listening to the remarks of my good friend \nfrom Virginia, and except for the part about eggs being thrown in \nMichigan, it struck an absolutely accurate chord, everything he said. \nIt was kind of hard to imagine that anyone would throw eggs in \nMichigan, but I have to defend my home State. Other than that, I am \nsure his memory is very accurate and even the location no doubt is \naccurate.\n  He talked about Gerry Ford and what he did heroically in World War II \nand how he survived the typhoon. Gerry Ford, when he became President, \ninherited a typhoon. Most Americans will remember President Ford for \nrighting the ship of state during that stormy time when he became \nPresident. We all remember him for that because it was heroic what he \ndid then for our Nation, a different kind of heroism from what he \ndisplayed in World War II but heroism nonetheless. He was deeply \nrespected on both sides of the aisle for his civility, his \nbipartisanship, his integrity.\n  We, in Michigan, in addition to remembering him as all others will \nfor what he did to right that ship of state of ours, also remember him \nfor a lifetime of service, including 13 terms in the House of \nRepresentatives from Michigan's Fifth Congressional District. And we, \nalso, take particular pride in this son of Michigan and the manner in \nwhich he always treasured his west Michigan roots. There were many \neulogies that were recently given about Gerald Ford, but in all of them \nit was noted that he never forgot where he came from. That was a very \nimportant part of this absolutely wonderful man, a friend of mine, \nsomeone with whom I had a number of dealings.\n  Before time runs out for our morning business, I wanted to thank the \nSenator from Virginia. I don't know if this has been mentioned this \nmorning or not. The Senator from Virginia authored an amendment during \nthe last authorization bill which we adopted here which, by the way, is \nthe John Warner Defense Authorization Act for the next fiscal year, \nnamed after John Warner in tribute to his chairmanship. But in that \nbill, Senator Warner offered an amendment that would name the first of \na future class of aircraft carriers the USS Gerald Ford. I understand \nthat the Navy recently announced that it is going to follow the \nsuggestion which was incorporated in the Warner amendment, which I was \nproud to cosponsor, but in presenting that amendment at that time, \nSenator Warner recounted some of the heroism of our dear friend, the \nrecently departed President Ford, and his heroism both in war and \npeacetime.\n  I thank Senator Warner for the initiative he took to honor Gerry \nFord's service to our country in a way which I think will have a very \nspecial meaning to President Ford because, as a Navy man, having the \nfirst of a future class of aircraft carriers named after him would \nbring a special pride to his heart.\n  Gerald Ford began his service to our country in the Navy during World \nWar II, where he displayed great valor in combat, and this will be a \nfitting tribute.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with Gerald Ford's beloved wife Betty \nand his family as we celebrate his life and legacy.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, and I acknowledge \nthe Senator's help on that. It was a joint project by the two of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S210-4", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week, on the very first day of this \nnew Congress, I joined with my colleague from Louisiana, Senator Mary \nLandrieu, in introducing the Access to Affordable Health Care Act. This \nis a comprehensive plan which builds on the strengths of our current \npublic programs and private health care system to make affordable \nhealth care available to millions more Americans. It is similar to \nlegislation we introduced in the last Congress. I hope, given the \nurgency of dealing with the cost of health care and health insurance, \nthat this will be the year this legislation moves forward.\n  One of my priorities in the Senate has long been to expand access to \naffordable health care. There are still far too many Americans without \nhealth insurance or with woefully inadequate coverage. As many as 46 \nmillion Americans are uninsured, and millions more are underinsured. \nThe State of Maine is in the midst of a growing health insurance \ncrisis, with insurance premiums rising at alarming rates. Whether I am \ntalking to a self-employed fisherman, a displaced mill worker, the \nowner of a struggling small business, or the human resources manager of \na large company, the soaring costs of health insurance are a common \nconcern. These cost increases, double digit this past year, have been \nparticularly burdensome for small businesses, the backbone of the Maine \neconomy.\n  Maine's small business owners want to provide coverage for their \nemployees, but they are caught in a cost squeeze. They know that if \nthey pass on premium increases to their employees, more and more of \nthem will decline coverage altogether because they simply can't afford \ntheir share. Yet these small businesses cannot continue to simply \nabsorb the double-digit increases in their health insurance premiums \nyear after year. The problem of rising costs is even more acute for \nindividuals and families who must purchase health insurance on their \nown. Monthly health insurance premiums in my State often exceed a \nfamily's mortgage payment. Clearly, we must do more to make health \ninsurance more available and more affordable.\n  The legislation Senator Landrieu and I are introducing is a seven-\npoint plan that combines a variety of public and private approaches. \nThe legislation's seven goals are, first, to expand access to \naffordable health care for small businesses; second, to make health \ninsurance more affordable for individuals and families purchasing \ncoverage on their own; third, to strengthen the health care safety net \nfor those without coverage; fourth, to expand access to care in rural \nand underserved areas; fifth, to increase access to affordable long-\nterm care, a major challenge as our population continues to age; sixth, \nto promote healthier lifestyles; and seventh, to provide more equitable \nMedicare payments to Maine providers to reduce the Medicare shortfall \nwhich has forced hospitals, physicians, and other health care providers \nto shift costs on to other payers in the form of higher charges, which, \nin turn, drives up the cost of health care premiums.\n  Let me discuss these points in greater detail.\n  First, expanding access for small businesses by helping small \nemployers cope with rising health insurance costs. Since most Americans \nget their\n\n[[Page S212]]\n\nhealth insurance through the workplace, it is a common assumption, but \na false one, that people without health insurance are unemployed. In \nfact, as many as 83 percent of Americans who do not have health \ninsurance are in a family with a worker or are working themselves. \nUninsured working Americans are most often the employees of small \nbusinesses. In fact, some 63 percent of uninsured workers are employed \nby small firms. Smaller firms generally face higher costs for health \ninsurance than larger companies, which makes them again less likely to \noffer coverage.\n  The legislation we have introduced will help these employers cope \nwith rising costs by creating a new tax credit for small businesses to \nmake health insurance more affordable. It will also encourage small \nbusinesses that do not offer health insurance to start doing so with \nthe help of this tax credit, and it will help employers that do offer \ninsurance to continue coverage in the face of escalating premiums.\n  Our legislation would also provide grants to provide startup funding \nto States to help businesses join in purchasing co-ops. These co-ops \nwould enable small businesses to band together to purchase health \ninsurance jointly, but this part of the bill does not preempt State \nlaw, so it is a different approach than some have taken.\n  The legislation would also authorize the Small Business \nAdministration grant program for States, local governments, and \nnonprofit organizations to provide information about benefits of health \ninsurance to small employers, including tax benefits, increased \nproductivity of employees, and decreased turnover. These would also be \nused to help make employers aware of current incentives under State and \nFederal laws. It is an interesting fact that one survey showed that 57 \npercent of small employers did not know they could deduct 100 percent \nof their health insurance premiums as a business expense. I want to \nchange that into a tax credit which is far more valuable, but many \nsmall businesses don't realize that there is a tax incentive even in \nour current tax laws.\n\n  The legislation would also create a new program to encourage \ninnovation by awarding demonstration grants in up to 10 States \nconducting the innovative coverage expansions such as pooling \narrangements or group market reforms, or subsidies to employers or \nindividuals. We know the States are the laboratories for reform. \nInsurance is regulated at the State level. This would provide for some \nassistance in conducting some innovative projects to expand coverage.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act would also expand access to \naffordable health insurance for individuals and families. One of the \nfirst bills I sponsored when I first came to the Senate in 1997 was \nlegislation introduced by Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy to create \nthe State Children's Health Insurance Program, the SCHIP program, which \nprovides insurance for children of low-income parents who cannot afford \nhealth insurance yet make too much money to qualify for the Medicaid \nProgram. Since that time, this program has contributed to a one-third \ndecline in the number of uninsured children in this country. Today, \nover 6 million children--including approximately 14,500 in Maine--are \nreceiving health care coverage through this remarkably effective \nprogram.\n  Our legislation would shore up the looming shortfalls in the SCHIP \nprogram in 17 States, including Maine. We want to ensure that children \ncurrently enrolled in the program do not lose their coverage, and in \norder to achieve that goal, we need to make up that shortfall. Just \nprior to adjournment last month, Congress approved legislation which \npartially addressed that shortfall, but that provides only about one-\nfifth of the funds needed. Our legislation would help close that gap.\n  Our bill also builds on the success of the SCHIP program by giving \nStates a number of new tools to increase participation. I won't go \nthrough all of the changes we would make, but let me mention one. We \nwould allow the parents of those children enrolled in the SCHIP program \nto enroll in the health insurance program on a subsidized rate, \ndepending on their income, if the State wants to take advantage of that \noption. The experts tell us that would help provide coverage for about \n6 million more low-income Americans.\n  So what I am trying to do is take advantage of some existing programs \nsuch as SCHIP, expanding them, providing new tax incentives such as the \ntax credit for small businesses to help piece together a program that \nbuilds on the strengths of the existing program that still has a \nprivate sector approach and yet fills in the gaps in coverage and helps \nmake health insurance more affordable. Part of that is providing for \nmore funding for community health centers which operate in underserved \nurban as well as rural communities. They provide critical primary care \nservices to millions of Americans regardless of their ability to pay.\n  We also know we need to deal with the problem of not enough \nphysicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other \nprimary care providers in underserved areas. We need to revamp the \nNational Health Service Corps, which helps supply doctors, dentists, \nand other clinicians who serve in rural and inner-city areas. We want \nto revamp that program to make it more flexible. I was talking to \nphysicians in Holten, ME, just recently who said that program used to \nbe a source of physicians for rural Maine, but over the years it has \nbecome rigid and encrusted and not flexible enough and is no longer \nnearly as valuable as it once was. We would revamp that program.\n  As Senate cochair with Senator Clinton of the bipartisan \nCongressional Task Force on Alzheimer's Disease, I am particularly \nsensitive to the long-term needs of patients with chronic diseases such \nas Alzheimer's and of the impact on their families. Long-term care is \nthe major catastrophic health expense faced by older Americans today, \nand these costs will only increase with the aging of the baby boomer \ngeneration--our generation.\n  I have been surprised that many Americans mistakenly believe that \nMedicare or their private health insurance policy will cover the cost \nof long-term care should they develop a chronic illness or a cognitive \nimpairment such as Alzheimer's. Unfortunately, far too many do not \ndiscover they do not have coverage until they are confronted with the \ndifficult decision of placing a much loved parent or spouse in a long-\nterm care facility and facing the shocking realization that unless they \nhave long-term care coverage, they have to cover the costs themselves. \nWe need to encourage people to purchase long-term care insurance, to \nplan for this need.\n  The bill we are introducing provides a tax credit for long-term care \nexpenses of up to $3,000 to provide some help to families struggling \nwith that cost, and it would encourage more Americans to plan for their \nfuture long-term care needs by providing a tax deduction to help them \npurchase long-term care insurance.\n  Health insurance alone is not going to ensure good health. As noted \nauthor and physician Dr. Michael Crichton has observed, ``The future in \nmedicine lies not in treating illness but in preventing it.'' Many of \nour serious health problems are directly related to unhealthy \nbehaviors: Smoking, the lack of regular exercise, poor diet. These \nthree major risk factors alone have made my State the State with the \nfourth highest death rate, due to four largely preventable diseases--or \nat least you can delay their onset--cardiovascular disease, cancer, \nchronic lung disease, and diabetes. These diseases are responsible for \n70 percent of the health care problems in Maine.\n  Our bill, therefore, contains a number of provisions designed to \npromote healthy lifestyles. It includes, for example, grants to allow \nStates to assist small businesses in establishing worksite wellness \nprograms for their employees. It also authorizes a grant program to \nsupport new and existing community partnerships. There is a great one \nin Franklin County, in Maine. It is the Healthy Community Coalition, \nand it has made a difference in promoting healthy lifestyles.\n  Finally, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act will promote \ngreater equity in Medicare payments and help to ensure that the \nMedicare system rewards, rather than punishes, States such as Maine \nthat deliver high-quality, cost-effective Medicare services to our \nelderly and disabled citizens. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 \nand subsequent legislation did take some significant steps toward \npromoting\n\n[[Page S213]]\n\ngreater fairness by increasing Medicare payments to rural hospitals and \nby modifying geographic adjustment factors that discriminated against \nphysicians and other providers in rural areas. Our legislation would \nbuild on these improvements by establishing pilot programs that reward \nproviders of high-quality, cost-effective Medicare services.\n  The Access to Affordable Health Care Act outlines a blueprint for \nreform based on principles upon which I am hopeful that a bipartisan \nmajority of Congress could agree. The plan takes significant strides \ntoward the goal of access to health care coverage by bringing millions \nmore Americans into the insurance system and by strengthening the \nhealth care safety net. Most of all, it helps address the No. 1 \nobstacle to health insurance--and that is its cost--through a variety \nof incentives.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

Madam President, it is a very important issue that is \ngoing to be coming before the Senate very shortly, and it deals with \nthe Medicare prescription drug benefit and whether the Government ought \nto negotiate prices as opposed to what is in the Medicare Part D bill. \nI wish to speak on that subject because this issue is very important to \nthe seniors of America. It is important for the public and for Medicare \nbeneficiaries to fully understand these proposed changes. It is equally \nimportant we explore in depth the effects these changes are going to \nhave on this program and particularly the negative impact on the senior \ncitizens of our country. So I am going to spend some time this week \ndealing with this issue.\n  First, everyone should recognize that political opponents of the drug \nbenefit have, in every way, done everything they can to tear apart and \ndenigrate this new benefit that the vast majority of seniors find to \ntheir liking, based upon a lot of different polls that have been taken \nover the last 7 or 8 months. In fact, the opponents of this legislation \nhave done this ever since the ink was barely dry on the bill we called \nthe Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.\n  First they said that no plan would offer--meaning no benefit plan; \nthe people, the administrators of the program--that none of these plans \nwould offer the new drug benefit in the first place, that eventually \nthe Government was going to end up doing it. Of course, we know that is \nnot the fact. The plan is up and running, and the plans are offering so \nmany.\n  Then, after it was up and running, these opponents of the legislation \nsaid, well, there were too many plans. They said it was too confusing, \nseniors would not be able to choose a plan. But 91 percent of seniors \nare covered by some plan that has prescription drugs in it, and surveys \nshow overwhelming satisfaction by seniors with their plans.\n  Opponents suggested plans could change their prices and the drugs \nthey cover at the drop of a hat without even almost any notice. This \ndid not turn out to be the case. The opponents tainted beneficiaries' \nviews of the benefits before it even got off the ground. You wondered \nwhether the millions of people who signed up would ever sign up, \nhearing so much negative stuff about it. But they did sign up.\n  And, as we have heard from the opponents over and over again, one of \nthe biggest criticisms about the drug benefit is that the Government \ndoes not negotiate with drugmakers for lower prices. So they have gone \nto great lengths to make it sound as if nobody is negotiating with the \ndrug companies. It is, of course, correct that the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services does not do negotiation with drug companies. But it \nis absolutely not true there are not negotiations going on with drug \ncompanies. People who say that are completely nonsensical in their \nunderstanding of the legislation or maybe they have some ulterior \nmotive of wanting to continue to degrade and denigrate a piece of \nlegislation that seniors have accepted.\n  The idea behind the drug benefit is that multiple drug plans would \ncompete with each other to get the lowest prices from manufacturers, to \nbe the best negotiator, and to offer beneficiaries the best possible \ndrug plan.\n  The pattern for this was the 40-year-old Federal Employees Health \nBenefit Plan that has worked so well for Federal employees. We \npatterned this program, Part D, after that: plans negotiating for \nFederal employees, getting a good price; plans that have membership of \nsenior citizens negotiating with drug companies to get the best \npossible price for senior citizens who are in a particular plan.\n  But the opponents of this legislation do not like plans negotiating. \nThey think the Government directly can do a better job of negotiating \nbecause they have a belief about Government always doing good, \nGovernment always doing the best. Their faith is in big Government \nbecause they lack faith in the American people. They find it very hard \nto believe anybody other than the Government could do a better job of \nnegotiating.\n  Last week on the Senate floor, the senior Senator from Illinois said \nthe law ``took competition out of the program so that [the drug \ncompanies] could charge what they want.'' Well, it did not take \ncompetition out of the program. Competition is what this program is all \nabout.\n  In fact, the competition is working. Plans have no restrictions on \nthe tools they can use to negotiate with drug companies. And, remember, \nthese plans must be approved by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. Not every Tom, Dick, and Harry can go out and offer a plan \nand hoodwink seniors. There is control over these plans. But once the \nplan is approved, there are no restrictions on the tools they can use \nto negotiate. And, of course, this is very important because one thing \nwe had learned is that Government is not actually a very good entity at \nfiguring out what it should pay for drugs.\n  I have a chart in the Chamber with a quote from the Washington Post. \nThey recognized this fact, that the Government cannot do a very good \njob of negotiating, where they said: ``Governments are notoriously bad \nat setting prices. . . .'' And then, as a matter of emphasis, it said: \n``and the U.S. government is notoriously bad at setting prices in the \nmedical realm.'' I will add to that: especially when it comes to \nmedicine policy.\n  Now, we knew this because of the Government's experience for paying \nfor drugs under another Medicare program, not Part D as in ``Donald,'' \nbut Part B as in ``Bob,'' the one that pays for doctors. Those drugs \nare given during a physician's office visit, and they could be drugs \nsuch as oral cancer drugs.\n  Medicare payments for these drugs were based on what is called the \naverage wholesale price. ``AWP'' is the moniker that is used for that. \nAWP is a little bit like the sticker price of a car. The sticker price \non a car is not what you pay for the car. And the average wholesale \nprice, AWP, is not what you pay for drugs. The joke was that AWP \nactually stood for ``Ain't What's Paid.''\n  Over the past decade, reports issued by the Office of the Inspector \nGeneral, the Department of Justice, and the Government Accountability \nOffice found that by relying on AWP, Medicare was vastly overpaying for \nthese drugs.\n  So the Federal Government sets the price, and we end up wasting a lot \nof taxpayer money under Part B with the few drugs that Medicare was \npaying for before we passed Part D.\n  Recommendations were made to change payments so that they reflected \nactual market cost. The Clinton administration tried to make some of \nthese changes, but after push-back from providers, it backed off. \nCongress took another run at this issue in 2003 in\n\n[[Page S214]]\n\nthe Medicare Modernization Act, and we were successful. Congress \nreformed how Medicare pays for these drugs under Part B as opposed to \nthe drug program Part D. Medicare now based its payments for many of \nthese drugs on what it ought to, a market-based price. This change is \nalready saving taxpayers and beneficiaries, but it took years to get \nfixed. All that time Medicare and taxpayers paid too much for these \ndrugs. Billions and billions of dollars were wasted.\n  I compliment President Clinton for trying to do something about it, \nbut he couldn't get it done. Congress had to act. But when we had all \nof this track record, as we were writing the prescription drug bill, I, \nfor one, didn't want to repeat that experience under the Medicare drug \nbenefit. We also knew that Medicare overpays for a lot of other \nservices and equipment. The bookshelves are full of other reports from \nthe Government Accountability Office, from the Inspector General, from \nthe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, from the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and others, about how Medicare is paying too much in too many \nareas where the Government pays for health care through Medicare.\n  For example, Medicare overpaid for durable medical equipment for \nyears until the Republican-led Congress made changes in 2005 in what we \ncalled the Deficit Reduction Act. In fact, just 12 months ago, now, \nthat was a big issue before the Congress.\n  Each year, the Office of Inspector General issues its Red Book which \npresents cost-saving recommendations. The books are usually 50 or more \npages long, and the recommendations span all aspects of Medicare--\nhospitals, physicians, home health, the Medicare Part D plans, among \nothers. And this is more evidence on many areas where Medicare doesn't \nget the best deal, where the Government doesn't get the best deal. So \nGovernment doesn't always know best. In fact, the situation is so bad \nthat several years ago, Congress created what is called the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission, also known as MedPAC, to provide advice to \nus in Congress and to the Center for Medicare Services on what we ought \nto pay for services. And every year Congress hears recommendations from \nMedPAC addressing Medicare overpayments; yes, trying to do something \nabout wasting the taxpayers' money, paying more than we should for \nhealth care for our senior citizens.\n  But even though we have MedPAC, experts studying this, coming out \nwith recommendations, it takes Congress or the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services far too many years to make the changes to save the \ntaxpayers money--more evidence that Government doesn't always know best \nwhen it sets prices.\n  In making recommendations, MedPAC looks at profit margins as an \nexample. One type of provider had been found to have a margin of 16 \npercent off of Medicare payments. Congress has been able to act on many \nMedPAC recommendations, but it is not easy. There is always some \nspecial interest out there fighting saving the taxpayers money. As \nchairman of the Finance Committee, I received letters from Members \nsaying, ``Please don't cut benefits for this provider group or that \nprovider group.'' So as the Clinton administration found, letters like \nthat, where they come to Congress or to the administration, can make it \ndifficult in very short order to solve a lot of these overpayment \nproblems, despite compelling evidence of overpayment, despite the high \nprofit margins, despite the fact that the proposed change could save \nthe taxpayers billions of dollars.\n  The architects of the drug benefit--and I am one of them--were \nconcerned that this same kind of dynamic would happen again. So 3 years \nago, when we wrote the bill, we tried to deal with that problem. \nPolitical pressures on the Medicare drug benefit would tie the hands of \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services. If that happened, the \nprogram would be unmanageable, and the costs would skyrocket, just as \nthey have in many of these other instances where the Government is \nsetting the price. So, instead, Congress put competing private plans in \ncharge of negotiating; again, following on the pattern of 40 years of \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. So under the Part D \nMedicare prescription drug program, these health plans and their \npharmacy benefit managers, because they have years of experience in \nthis arena--it is what they do--they negotiate, and Health and Human \nServices has had very little experience and a very dismal track record \nin doing it.\n  These plans and managers have powerful bargaining clout in the \nmarket. They manage the drug coverage for tens of millions of people. \nThere are plans that cover upwards of 50 million people--75 million in \none case--far more than the 41 million Medicare beneficiaries. So, \nclearly, Medicare beneficiaries account for a large number of all \nprescriptions filled each year. Some might argue that 41 million \nbeneficiaries have more clout than 75 million nonbeneficiaries. But \nnumbers alone do not necessarily translate into lower cost. It is what \nis done to leverage those numbers that leads to lower costs.\n  That leverage comes from the plan being able to say to a drug company \nsomething like: I can get a better deal on a different drug that has \nthe same clinical effect made by manufacturer Y. So thank you for your \noffer, but I am leaving the table.\n  Some plans get a better deal on drug A and put it on their formulary. \nSome plans get a better deal on drug B. But many experts agree, and \nexperience suggests, that it would be difficult for Medicare itself to \nwalk away from the table; in other words, the Government people doing \nthe negotiating. There would be enormous pressure to cover everything \nand, if it did, the negotiating power lies then with the manufacturers \nand not with Medicare.\n  In fact, in a November 2 Wall Street Journal editorial, Dr. Allen \nEnthoven, an economist at Stanford University, wrote:\n\n       When the government negotiates its hands are tied because \n     there are few drugs it can exclude without facing political \n     backlash from doctors and the Medicare population, a very \n     influential group of voters.\n\n  Yesterday's New York Times quoted Dr. Alan Garber, the director of \nthe Center for Health Policy at Stanford University, on the same \nsubject. Dr. Garber said:\n\n       To obtain drugs at low prices, a purchaser must be able to \n     say no to covering a particular drug.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       [I]f you cannot walk away from a deal, there's no way you \n     can be sure of obtaining [the lowest possible] price.\n\n  Dr. Garber's point is exactly on point. The Medicare drug benefit \nrecognizes that the Government would be a weaker negotiator. So as we \nset it up, it relies upon private sector plans to do the negotiating, \nas has been done for 40 years under the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program. We believed then that the private sector could be a \ntough negotiator, and we had a way to make competition work.\n  When Congress finished work on the new drug benefit in 2003, we knew \nit was an experiment. Nothing like this had been tried on this scale. \nHere is what we learned: Private competition works. It has been very \nsuccessful in keeping costs down. These plans that negotiate their bids \nhave come in lower than we even expected. This year they were down 10 \npercent from last year's bids. How many commodities do you see in \nAmerica where you are going to find something 10 percent less this year \nthan last year?\n  It happens that premiums are lower for people joining these plans; \nthe premiums that they pay are lower than they were estimated to be. \nBefore 2006, Medicare's chief actuary estimated that the average \nmonthly premium would be $37 a month. But because of competition, it \nwas actually $23 in 2006. That is 38 percent lower than expected. And \nbecause of the strong competition between plans, the average premium \nfor beneficiaries is expected to be about $22. That is $1 cheaper this \nyear than in 2006. The net cost to the Federal Government is also lower \nthan expected. Just today the official Medicare actuaries are \nannouncing that the net 10-year cost of Part D has dropped by $189 \nbillion over the original budget window used when the Medicare \nModernization Act was enacted in 2003. That is, in fact, a 30-percent \ndrop in actual cost compared to what was projected when the bill was \nbeing written.\n  Cost overruns is the name of the game with most people doing business \nwith the Federal Government. In this particular case, this is an \nexception to cost overruns. This is where things are\n\n[[Page S215]]\n\ncoming in $189 billion less than bureaucrats projected they would cost \nwhen the bill was written. Of course, States are involved in this as \nwell because they had a lot of senior citizens on what we call Medicaid \nfor low-income people. States are saving money in lower contributions. \nThese are referred to as clawback payments. So State payments are now \nprojected to be $37 billion less over a 10-year period, and that is 27 \npercent lower than what we thought they would be when the legislation \nwas written.\n  Just in the year 2006, the 50 States saved $700 million. The plans \nare negotiating lower prices for drugs. Let's take the top 25 drugs \nused by seniors. Using them, the Medicare prescription drug plans have \nbeen able to negotiate prices that are, on average, 35 percent lower \nthan the average cash price at the retail pharmacies. That is 35 \npercent lower. Some examples: Lipitor is 15 percent lower; Anetol, 63 \npercent lower; Norvas, 28 percent lower; Fosamax, 30 percent lower.\n  When the drug benefit was signed into law, we believed it would work. \nWe believed it would hold down costs. That is certainly happening \ntoday, now going into the second year of experience with this \nlegislation. At the time it was signed into law, we also said that if \nit did not work, if the negotiating model we wrote into the legislation \ndid not hold costs down, then Congress would need to reexamine the \nwhole setup. That makes sense. But if costs grew too fast, then the \nwhole idea, obviously, would have to be revisited. Maybe we would have \nto restrict access to drugs. Maybe we would have to rely more on mail-\norder pharmacies, instead of liberal access to local retail pharmacies. \nMaybe more drastic cost-cutting measures would be needed. We thought of \nall those things as we were writing this legislation.\n  But as it turns out now, 3 years later, since the President signed \nthe bill, that is not the case. Everyone has heard the old saying, ``If \nit ain't broke, don't fix it.'' That certainly applies here, and the \nevidence shows it. I would be the first one to say the Medicare drug \nbenefit is not perfect. There are improvements that can be made. The \nSenate version of the drug bill had some important features that I hope \nwe can revisit at some point. Congress should look at ways to make it \neasier for low-income beneficiaries to get the additional assistance \nthey need by eliminating the low-income subsidy asset tax. We need to \nlook at payments to pharmacies and make some reforms in that area. We \nneed to look at ways to simplify the enrollment process. And there are \nother areas, too, where we can make improvements.\n  But to emphasize one area that is working very well, it is the \nnegotiating power of the Medicare drug plans. They have shown their \nability to hold down costs, so it is working. The pleas from the drug \nplans' opponents to put the Government--because they believe in big \nGovernment--in charge of negotiating are, quite frankly, about \npolitics, not policy. These voices want to score political points with \nthe drug benefit. It saddens me that we are going to start off this \nyear with a new Democratic-controlled Congress playing politics with \nMedicare and raising issues that could harm our senior citizens as \nopposed to benefiting them.\n  But that is what this issue is all about; it is about politics. It is \nnot about saving money because this program, through negotiations by \nthe drug plans, is already saving money. It is surely not about \nimproving the program. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office looked \nat the proposals made last year to have the Secretary negotiating drug \nprices, and they concluded they would not achieve any savings. So \naround here the Congressional Budget Office is like God. If they say \nsomething costs something and you don't have an offset for it, they are \nso much of a god around here, if you try to get it done, you have to \nhave 60 votes to get it done. Now we have the Congressional Budget \nOffice saying there are no savings, because the Government negotiates \ninstead of having the plans negotiate. During the debate on the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005, Senators Snowe, Wyden, McCain, and Stabenow \noffered an amendment to give the Secretary authority to negotiate with \ndrug companies.\n  Here is what CBO said about that amendment: It would produce zero \nsavings. So what is this amendment all about? If you are going to save \nsenior citizens some money by having Government negotiate instead of \nthe plans, you should not get a big zero out of the CBO.\n  I want to have a second chart observed by my colleagues. This is a \nperson a lot of people 3 years ago were expressing was competent when \nhe was judging that this bill would cost more than the CBO said it \nwould cost, and that somehow the administration was playing games with \nthese figures. All these figures ended up being too high because they \nare $189 billion lower than they were saying they were going to be. \nThere are no cost overruns in this program as in every other program. I \nam going to refer to the chief actuary for Medicare who examined these \nproposals we are talking about and having the Government negotiate. He \ncame up with the same conclusion: Direct price negotiations by the \nHealth and Human Services Secretary would be unlikely to achieve \nprescription drug discounts of greater magnitude than those negotiated \nby the Medicare prescription drug plans responding to competitive \nforces.\n  Competition in the marketplace is what getting the consumer the best \nbuy for the money is all about. Every day consumers benefit from \ncompetition. We wrote competition into this program 3 years ago, and \nthat competition is working for the seniors. Now we have people who \nwant to come out here and screw it all up for the senior citizens of \nAmerica.\n  I hope we can put politics aside here and focus on some of the real \nimprovements we could be making in the drug benefit program that I \npointed out today that need to be made, and not deal with things that \nare working. ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''\n  Madam President, since no other Members are here, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nfriend of mine, an amazing woman in Springfield, IL, a dedicated public \nservant, Linda Hawker.\n  After nearly 30 years in public life, Linda is retiring as Secretary \nof the Illinois State Senate and starting a new chapter in her life. \nThose who worked with Linda in the Illinois State capitol can tell you \nwhat an amazing difference she made in the office of the Secretary of \nthe Senate. The job is a tough one. The hours are long. But Linda has \nworked tirelessly to serve the people of the Senate and the people of \nmy State.\n  Linda is going to be missed. Linda and I started together working in \nthe Illinois State Senate. I was fresh out of law school. She had just \nstarted as a secretary to one of the State senators back in the early \n1970s. She was born and raised in Springfield. Linda is one of eight \nchildren. She worked hard throughout her life to raise her daughter. \nShe graduated from Sangamon State University, now known as the \nUniversity of Illinois-Springfield, with a degree in political studies.\n  Linda has worked so hard not only for the Senate but for many \ncandidates for the Illinois State Senate over the years. She was the \nfirst woman to serve as Secretary of the Illinois Senate, the guardian \nof the public records of that institution. Before serving in that \nposition, she was assistant secretary. Prior to that, she worked for \nthe Senate Democratic leadership staff and served as special assistant \nto former Illinois Senate president Phil Rock.\n  As Secretary of the Senate, Linda is best known as the chief \nadministrative and fiscal officer of the Senate. But those terms don't \ntell the whole story. She brought a state-of-the-art computer system \ninto the Illinois State Senate to make it easier to track bills and \ndebate them. She was also instrumental in the creation and development \nof the Illinois Women in Government Organization. In 2004, she was\n\n[[Page S216]]\n\nhonored by the Illinois Democratic Women with the Eleanor Roosevelt \nOutstanding Democratic Woman of the Year Award--an award presented to \nonly one woman each year--for her work in grassroots politics. Linda is \nalso a founder of the Illinois Women in Leadership Organization, which \nprovides opportunities and training for women to become more \npolitically involved in my State.\n  Linda is deeply involved in her community, having worked in a lot of \norganizations, including the Committee to Study the Honesty and \nIntegrity of Springfield Elections, the University of Illinois at \nSpringfield Alumni Council, the Springfield Urban League, and is a \nformer member of the Executive Committee for the American Society of \nLegislative Clerks and Secretaries.\n  But if you ask those who know Linda well, they will tell you that her \nstory should not just be told in terms of what she has done but the \npeople's lives she has affected. She is known as the go-to person in my \npart of the world, especially if you want to run for office. She is \nknown not just as a fabulous adviser and mentor; she is the hardest \nworking person I have known in the political scene. She is not afraid \nto roll up her sleeves and get into the thick of it. Linda managed the \ncampaign of Senator Penny Severns, whose life was taken away too soon \nby breast cancer. They were quite a team. Penny Severns won a district \nshe was never supposed to win, and Linda was right by her side. She has \nalways been a great person to talk to. She always had time to listen. \nTo be Linda Hawker's friend is to know loyalty, honesty, a diligent \nworker, and the best kind of friendship.\n  Her leadership as both Secretary and Assistant Secretary of the \nIllinois Senate has been an example of quiet integrity to all of those, \nincluding myself, who have worked with her. She will start a new \nchapter in her life with retirement, but I know no matter what she does \nshe will be successful.\n  Last night, they had a reception for Linda in Springfield and I was \ntold by press accounts this morning it was one of the largest \nbipartisan turnouts in history, which she truly deserved. She was that \nkind of a person and still is and will be for many years to come. We \nhope she has many great adventures in the future.\n  Linda, congratulations for your hard work, and thanks for being my \nfriend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S216-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S216-S218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE IRAQ RESOLUTION ON MILITARY FORCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it was just a few years ago--some days \nseem much longer--that we considered a resolution in the Senate to \nauthorize the use of military force in Iraq. We cast thousands of \nvotes. Most members of Congress cannot recall too many of them \nspecifically, unless reminded. But you never forget a vote on a war \nbecause you know that, at the end of the day, if you decide to go \nforward, people will die. It is your fervent hope that it will be the \nenemy, of course, but you know, in honesty, that it will be American \nsoldiers and innocent people as well. So a vote on a war is one that \nMembers of Congress--most every one of them--take so seriously. It \ncosts you sleep, as you think about the right thing to do.\n\n  I can recall when the vote was cast on this war in Iraq. I sat on the \nIntelligence Committee for months listening to the testimony and all \nthe evidence that was brought before us, listening behind closed doors \nto this classified information about the situation in that country, and \nthen emerging from that Intelligence Committee and reading newspapers \nand watching television, saying the American people are not being told \nthe same thing outside that room that I am being told inside that room. \nThere were serious differences of opinion in this administration about \nwhether there were even weapons of mass destruction.\n  At one point, we challenged the administration and said: If there are \nweapons of mass destruction, for goodness' sake, turn over some \nlocations to the international inspectors. Let them find them. Once \nthey discover them, it will confirm our fear, and other countries will \njoin us in this effort against Saddam Hussein. But, no, they wouldn't \ndo it. Although they told us there were hundreds of possible locations, \nthey wouldn't turn over any specific location possibility to the \ninternational inspectors.\n  It raised a question in my mind as to whether they were very certain \nof any locations. And, if you remember, weapons of mass destruction \nwere the centerpiece of the argument for the invasion of Iraq.\n  On Christmas Day many years later after that decision was made on the \nfloor of this Senate, we learned that more Americans have now died in \nIraq than died on September 11. Less than a week after that disclosure, \non New Year's Eve, we marked a mournful milestone in the war in Iraq: \nthe death of the 3,000th U.S. serviceman killed in Iraq.\n  Today, as I stand before the Senate, the Department of Defense \nreports that we have lost 3,014 American soldiers in Iraq. The 3,000th \ndeath is as tragic as the 1st death, the 300th death, the 1,000th \ndeath, but the staggering scope of casualties, the enormous toll this \nwar has taken, must not be allowed to pass unnoticed.\n  America's service men and women are the bravest and best in the \nworld. I know I say that with some patriotic pride, having been there \nto sit and have breakfast and lunch with them in Iraq, Afghanistan, and \ntheir other assignments. I just can't say enough about their courage \nand sacrifice, just ordinary, young-looking men and women who do \nextraordinary things.\n  This last October, with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, while \nsitting for breakfast with a group of about 12 soldiers from Illinois, \nI went around the table: Where are you from? Downstate. Oh, you are \nfrom the suburbs of Chicago. Or, you live in the city. We talked about \neverything under the Sun. We talked about the Chicago Bears, the Cubs, \nthe White Sox, and how things were going back home.\n  I asked them how things were going. They said: We had to get up \nearly. We had to form an honor guard at dawn because one of our \nsoldiers was killed in the middle of the night by one of these homemade \nbombs that takes so many lives.\n  I asked: How often does that happen?\n  Well, pretty frequently.\n  We know it does because we read the press accounts. We think of these \nyoung men and women and the challenges they face every single day as \nthey risk their lives for America. We think about the families back \nhome deep in prayer that their soldier is going to return home safely.\n  We owe them so much. We owe them our prayers and thanks for sure. But \nthose of us in elected office owe them more than that. Part of what we \nowe them is a plan to bring this war to a close, a plan to bring them \nhome safely, a plan to congratulate them as they return home for what \nthey have given to this country.\n  Last March, President Bush was asked whether there would come a day \nwhen there will be no U.S. forces in Iraq. His answer to that simple \nquestion spoke volumes. The President said: That, of course, is an \nobjective, and that will be decided by future Presidents and future \nGovernments of Iraq.\n  Now we are told that in a few days the President will make a major \npolicy announcement about this war. According to reports he is going to \ncall for an increase, a major escalation of the U.S. troops committed \nin Iraq. The administration carefully has used the word ``surge'' to \nsuggest this is somehow temporary, but we have to listen carefully when \nthe President makes his announcement to see just how temporary it might \nbe for the 10,000 or 20,000 or more American lives that will be at risk \nbecause of this decision.\n  Sending tens of thousands more troops to Iraq is not a change of \ncourse. It is not what our top military experts advise. In fact, they \nhave said just the opposite. It is clearly not what the American people \nbargained for when they voted just a few months ago for a change in our \ndirection in Iraq. It is literally and tragically more of the same. I \nthink our troops deserve better.\n  President Bush has always said he will send more troops if the \ncommanders in the field said they needed more. In December, General \nAbizaid, the head of the U.S. Central Command, testified before the \nArmed Services Committee. This is what the general said. The President \ntold us he was listening to the generals:\n\n\n[[Page S217]]\n\n\n       Our troops' posture needs to stay where it is as we move to \n     enhance the capabilities of the Iraq security forces and then \n     we need to assess whether or not we can bring major combat \n     units out of there. . . .\n\n  General Abizaid went on to say:\n\n       The ability to sustain that commitment [of 20,000 \n     additional troops] is simply not something we have right now.\n\n  That was a statement made by General Abizaid just a few weeks ago. He \nis now moving on. He is being replaced. This was the advice of the \nleader of the Army and the Central Command in the field of battle. \nGeneral Abizaid continued:\n\n       I met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the \n     core commander, General Dempsey. We all talked together. And \n     I said, ``In your professional opinion, if we were to bring \n     in more American troops now, does it add considerably to our \n     ability to achieve success in Iraq?''\n\n  General Abizaid testified:\n\n       And they all said no. And the reason is, because we want \n     the Iraqis to do more. It's easy for the Iraqis to rely upon \n     us to do the work. I believe that more American forces \n     prevent the Iraqis from doing more, from taking more \n     responsibility for their own future.\n\n  Last month, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, the group that was \nheaded by former Secretary of State James Baker and Congressman Lee \nHamilton of Indiana, offered a series of recommendations that they say \ncould allow U.S. forces to largely redeploy safely out of Iraq by April \n1, 2008. The President has made it clear--although he thanked the \ncommission--that he doesn't share their feelings. He also apparently \ndoes not share the views of the Commission that the situation in Iraq \nis grave and deteriorating.\n  This war began with deception--a deception of the American people \nabout the threat of weapons of mass destruction. It then moved into a \nphase of denial where we were told over and over: Oh, the Iraqi \nsoldiers, the forces are just terrific; we are getting them ready to \ntake our place there; we are going to stand down when they stand up. As \nviolence ramped up dramatically, as more and more people died, \nincluding American soldiers, it went from deception to denial, and now \nwe are in delusion, a delusion that somehow sending more American \ntroops into the field of battle, putting them in the midst of a civil \nwar that finds its roots in history 14 centuries old, that somehow \nplacing our best and bravest soldiers, marines, airmen, and sailors in \nthis crossfire of sectarian violence, putting more of them there, as \nthe President is likely to suggest, is going to bring this to an end \nsooner.\n  I think the President is wrong, I think the Iraq Study Group had it \nright, and I think sending those troops in, as General Abizaid said, \ngives a message to the Iraqis that is completely wrong.\n  Think about this for a minute. We sent the best military in the \nworld. They deposed Saddam Hussein, took him out of power in a matter \nof weeks, dug him out of a hole in the ground, put him on trial which \nled to his execution. We then gave the Iraqis a chance to vote on their \nown constitution. We allowed them to form their own government. We have \nspent $400 billion. We have lost 3,014 lives as of this moment, and the \nnumber, sadly, continues to mount. Twenty-three thousand American \nsoldiers have come home injured, 2,000 of them multiple amputees, \nsoldiers who are blinded, soldiers whose lives may never be the same. \nWe have done all this for this nation of Iraq, and now what we ask of \nthem is simply this: Stand up and defend your own country. If you \nbelieve in your country and your future, be willing to stand and fight \nfor it. Be willing to make the hard political decisions to bring peace \nand stability to your country.\n  That is the message we should be giving them, but instead, this \nadministration's message is we will send in more American soldiers, \nmaybe 10,000, 20,000, 30,000. We will escalate this conflict. We will \nescalate our commitment. We will build up these forces.\n  According to two members of the Iraq Study Group who were present \nwhen the group met with the President in November, President Bush said \nhe continues to use the word ``victory'' to describe the vision in Iraq \nbecause ``it's a word the American people understand.'' The President \nsaid: If I start to change it, it will look like I am beginning to \nchange my policy.\n  That is a staggering statement because, Mr. President, we do need a \nchange of policy. We need to face the reality of what we are currently \nfacing in Iraq.\n  There are other costs beyond what I have mentioned. There are costs \nthat we feel at home. I voted against this Iraq war--23 of us did--but \nI voted for every single penny this President has asked for. My \nthinking on it is very basic and fundamental: If it were my son and \ndaughter in uniform, I would want them to have everything they need--\neverything. I can quarrel with this President, debate him all day about \nthe policy, but not at the expense of the safety of our troops.\n  The money we spent there--almost $2 billion a week, over $400 billion \nin total--is money that has been taken out of America, away from our \nneeds at home, money that, sadly, has been piled up in debt as this \nadministration refuses to even pay for the war they are waging.\n  We are currently spending about $8 billion a month on Iraq--$8 \nbillion. We are going to be asked to come up with another $100 billion \nsoon and, sadly, that money we spent so far doesn't even include the \ncost of reequipping our Armed Forces or caring for our veterans who \nhave come home. That is a long-term cost of this war that we will pay \nfor decades to come.\n  What could we have done in America with the $380 billion or $400 \nbillion that we spent in Iraq? We could have paid for all of the \nfollowing that I am about to list--all of the following: Health care \ncoverage for all of the uninsured children in America for the entire \nduration of this war; 4-year scholarships to a public university for \nall of this year's graduating high school seniors in America; new \naffordable housing units for 500,000 needy families; all the needed \nport security requirements to keep our homeland safe; substantial new \nenergy conservation programs. Or, we could have completely funded No \nChild Left Behind.\n  Remember that program where we tested our kids and found out they \nneeded help and then the Federal Government didn't send the help? We \ncould have done that.\n  Or, we could have provided savings accounts for low-income families \npreparing for retirement, or made a downpayment on reducing the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  From my State of Illinois, our share of the Iraq war comes to about \n$19 billion. With that $19 billion, we could have paid for 2.5 million \nIllinois children in Head Start, insured 11 million children for 1 \nyear, paid the salaries of 330,000 teachers for a year, underwritten \n170,000 new affordable housing units, and covered 900,000 4-year \nscholarships to public universities.\n  President Bush has the distinction not just for this policy in Iraq, \nbut the fact that he is the first American President in our history who \nhas cut taxes in the midst of a war. His tax cuts have benefited the \nwealthiest people in America and left the largest debt in the history \nof the United States, and every year we remain in Iraq we add $75 \nbillion to $100 billion to that national debt.\n  Beyond the cost of human lives and dollars, there are strategic costs \nin this war. Our military is stretched dangerously thin. The National \nGuard units that have been activated have come home with less \nequipment. Today, in Illinois, we have about a third of the equipment \nwe need to respond to another crisis either at home or overseas.\n  We also know that when it comes to combat readiness, there are no \nunits prepared to go into war at this moment. We have stretched our \nmilitary so thin. The costs of reequipping these units and rebuilding \nthese services are enormous and go way beyond what we have already \nspent in Iraq. Investing U.S. troop levels in Iraq will almost \ncertainly prolong our involvement in that nation. It almost certainly \nwill make President Bush's statement that it will be up to the \nsuccessors to bring our forces home a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is \nnot what the American people voted for in November. Sending these \ntroops to Iraq will send the wrong message to Iraq. It will signal that \nAmericans will continue to bear the burdens of this war.\n\n  This year, the British, who have been the most cooperative in helping \nus there, are slated to pull their troops out. At that point, it will \nbe virtually\n\n[[Page S218]]\n\nan American struggle, with only a handful of countries remaining by our \nside.\n  General Casey, the commanding general in Baghdad, recently stated:\n\n       The longer we in the U.S. force continue to bear the main \n     burden of Iraq's security, the longer it lengthens the time \n     that the government of Iraq has to make the hard decisions \n     about reconciliation and dealing with the militias.\n\n  General Casey also said:\n\n       It has always been my view that a heavy and sustained \n     American military presence was not going to solve the \n     problems in Iraq over the long term.\n\n  These are the generals President Bush said he listens to, and these \nare the people who are in command of our forces. These are voices which \nclearly disagree with the escalation of this war in Iraq.\n  Last week, America bid farewell to a good and decent man named Gerald \nFord. I was honored to be at his funeral service in Grand Rapids, MI. \nHe was a man who served at one of the most tumultuous times in American \nhistory. He inherited a war he couldn't win. Years later, when asked \nabout that Vietnam war, President Ford said:\n\n       My approach was we inherited the problem with the job. It \n     is my obligation on behalf of the country to try and solve \n     the damn thing.\n\n  A generation later, our Nation faces a similar moment. We need to \nwork together. We need to cooperate on a bipartisan basis to find a \nplan worthy of the courage and sacrifice of our men and women in \nuniform. It should begin now. It shouldn't be left to future \nPresidents.\n  If one reads the authorization for Iraq, one understands that the \ngoals and missions of that statement for the use of force have changed \ndramatically. No weapons of mass destruction, no Saddam Hussein, no \nthreat to America. It is time for us to announce that we achieved our \ngoals in Iraq and now the American people need to hand this \nresponsibility over to the people of that nation in Iraq.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor).

Mr. President, on the basis of the very kind \ncomments of the Senator from Illinois and others, very reasoned \ncomments, many of these comments having been stimulated by the Iraq \nStudy Group, which Mr. Baker and Mr. Hamilton both made their first \npresentation to the Congress, to our Senate Armed Services Committee, \nback in early December, there is a lot of wisdom in this. The members \nof this study commission are some of the finest public servants to have \nbeen produced in this country and who obviously have the interest of \nthis country at heart and who are struggling through this thicket of \nunclear occurrences in the Middle East and Central Asia. The goal is to \nfigure a way in which there might be a chance at stabilizing Iraq \npolitically and economically so that country has a chance to continue \nto exist with a democratically elected government. Yet, at this point, \nit is certainly not clear that stability is going to materialize. We \ncertainly hope it does because of the consequences for America and for \nthe rest of the free world if Iraq crumbles into chaos.\n  Looming over that entire region is an ascendant Iran, an Iran that is \npenetrating its influence, not only through the Shiites in Iraq but \nthrough its efforts in other parts of the Middle East, through Syria, \nthrough Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in the Palestinian Territories and \nas a result, we see the increasing influence of Iran and their brand of \nShiite Islam. This is much to the consternation of a majority of the \nArab world, in particular the Sunni Arab world as well as Israel.\n  In the 2 weeks preceding Christmas, I went on a visit to nine nations \nwithin a 12-day period, coming back just in time for Christmas. I was \nstruck by the words I would hear from leaders in Israel where I first \nvisited and the words I would hear by other Arab leaders, in some cases \nheads of state in Sunni Arab nations. Those words were almost identical \nin describing the real present and future threat posed by Iran. Of \ncourse, a lot of that concern was not only related to Iran obtaining a \nnuclear weapon but the immediate concern of Iraq spiraling into chaos, \nwith no stability whatsoever, with the continued penetration by the \nIranian Shiite influence.\n  I first went to Israel, and then continued on, visiting with the \nheads of state and the governments, in Palestine, and then on to \nJordan, Syria, Lebanon, on to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, which, by the way, \nGeneral Hayden, the head of the CIA, requested I go and spend time with \nthe Saudi King, to urge the Saudis to exert their influence with the \nSunni tribes in Iraq working towards reconciliation. I went from Saudi \nArabia to Bahrain and then into Iraq. I have come away with a number of \nconclusions.\n  After visiting with the marines in western Iraq in Al Anbar Province, \nindeed a U.S. troop increase may well help us be better able to \nstabilize that part of Iraq. It is almost entirely Sunni, and the major \nthreat there is al-Qaida, and of course the big military threat to us \nthere is the IEDs, the improvised explosive devices.\n  I, along with Senator Coleman of Minnesota, as we were in Iraq \ntogether--and he can certainly speak for himself, but I think we were \npersuaded by talking to the Marine commanders that an increase of some \nnumber of troops there would help them in what they are doing on a \ndaily basis, which is trying to get the local Arab leaders to take over \ntheir own security. There is some degree of success in western Iraq but \nnot in Baghdad. In Baghdad there is the sectarian violence that \neveryone has heard about.\n  What we were shocked to hear was from prominent Sunni members of the \nGovernment in Iraq, in Baghdad. One prominent, high-level Iraqi \nGovernment official, a shia, said to us: Sectarian violence is not the \nproblem. Those were almost his exact words. In his opinion, the problem \nwas the Sunni extremists, the Baathists who want to retain power, just \nlike they had it in the old days under Saddam Hussein, and the foreign \nfighters from al-Qaida. For that high-level official to sit there and \nlook two U.S. Senators in the eyes and say that sectarian violence was \nnot the problem is either a complete misreading of the circumstances, \nthe reality on the ground, or else his mind is so enveloped in \nsectarian violence and the old hatreds of the Shiites against the \nSunnis and vice versa, those hatreds that are so ingrained that he \ncan't see beyond that sectarianism.\n  So in a few days, we are going to receive the President's new plan. I \nlook forward to seeing and hearing the details of it, but it is not a \nnew plan because there is no plan now. We need some honest realism in \nthe policy, not hardheaded ideology. This so-called new policy ought to \nbe driven by realism. It is the situation on the ground in Baghdad that \nno surge is going to solve the problem. I think those who are leaking \nthis report in advance of it coming out have it backwards. A surge to \nsolve the sectarian violence is not going to work. We ought to have the \nsectarian violence subside because Iraqi Sunnis and Shiites decide that \nit is more in their interests to reconcile than it is to fight the old \nhatred fights. At the same time, it would be my recommendation, as the \nIraq Study Group report has recommended, that we start moving more to a \ntraining mission from a combat mission. Only if the sectors decide they \nare going to reconcile, then we, the United States, can help them be \nbetter prepared in a training mission instead of a combat mission. It \nis my hope that the Saudis would utilize their extensive tribal Sunni \ncontacts in order to urge those Sunnis in Iraq that the only way you \nare going to see a better end of the day is to have some \nreconciliation. And the Saudis told me that they are now starting to \nsee this opportunity.\n\n  There have been things that have come out in the last couple of weeks \nthat I don't think bode too well for us. The one general who, time \nafter time, came before our Senate Armed Services Committee and in whom \nI had a degree of trust in what he was saying\n\n[[Page S219]]\n\nwas General Abizaid. Now General Abizaid is going to retire. He not \nonly speaks the language, he has been involved in that region of the \nworld for years, yet his advice is no longer going to be sought. That, \nto me, is a mistake.\n  What is at stake is the entire region with the Iranian ascendancy. \nWhat is at stake is the more than 140,000 American troops who are there \nnow and all of those who will be rotated there in the future. What is \nat stake in the Middle East and central Asia is a part of the world of \nenormous importance to the United States.\n  It is hard to talk about this very difficult condition the United \nStates is facing without also saying there is another policy we clearly \nought to look at in order to make some changes to lessen our dependence \non that part of the world in the future, and that is energy \nindependence. If we did not have to import 60 percent of our daily \nconsumption of oil from places such as the Persian Gulf region or \nNigeria or Venezuela, wouldn't the defense outlook for the United \nStates and the way we would approach our foreign policy in different \nparts of the world be considerably different and a lot easier for the \nUnited States?\n  As we eagerly anticipate the President's comments and his report on \nhis new policy, let's understand there is not a new policy. There has \nnot been a policy in the past. The idea that this surge of troops is a \nnew policy is not new. We tried that before a couple of years ago and \nit did not work. It did not work because of the longstanding violence \nand hatred between those two groups of Islam which goes back to the \n1600s, when the two brands of Islam started separating, and what \nultimately came to be the Shiites separated from the Sunnis after the \ndeath of Mohammed. A separation, with the two sides wanting revenge is \nhow this has played out over the years. It is still going on.\n  We have enormous stakes. We hope we can get it right.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 197, which was introduced \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 197) to authorize salary adjustments for \n     justices and judges of the United States for fiscal year \n     2007.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid for expediting passage \nof legislation I introduced today with him and Senators Specter, Reid, \nFeinstein, and Cornyn to authorize cost-of-living adjustments for the \nsalaries of United States Justices and judges for fiscal year 2007. \nThis is a step I supported taking--and that we should have taken--in \nthe last Congress. I am glad that a holdup on the Republican side that \nprevented us from passing this last week was resolved so that we could \nmove forward in a unanimous and bipartisan way to take care of this \nunfinished business in the Senate. I hope that the House of \nRepresentatives will join us in making cost-of-living increase for \njudges an early item of business.\n  The legislation we pass today is a modest step towards addressing the \nissues raised by Chief Justice Roberts in his ``Year End Report on the \nFederal Judiciary.'' I have commended the Chief Justice for speaking \nout on behalf of the judiciary and for seeking to strengthen the \nindependence of the judicial branch. Judicial independence is critical \nfor preserving our system of government and protecting the rights of \nall Americans.\n  In 1975, Congress enacted the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living \nAdjustment Act, intended to give judges, Members of Congress and other \nhigh-ranking executive branch officials automatic COLAs as accorded \nother Federal employees unless rejected by Congress. In 1981, Congress \nenacted section 140 of Public Law 97-92, mandating specific \ncongressional action to give COLAs to judges. With the end of the last \nCongress, however, the continuing resolutions providing funding failed \nto suspend section 140, thus ensuring that no COLA would be provided \nfor Federal judges during the current fiscal year, unless other action \nis taken. Four years ago, the last time Congress missed making a \nscheduled cost-of-living adjustment for the judiciary, I sponsored \nremedial legislation that was enacted. I have done so, again, in the \nhope that Congress will correct this slight.\n  The bipartisan legislation we pass today provides for a COLA for \nFederal judges consistent with the law and with fairness. I have worked \nhard as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee over the last 4 years \nto ensure the independence of the judiciary.\n  Some of us have tried over the years to improve the compensation of \njudges. I have sponsored bills for general increases in judicial \ncompensation. One such measure did pass the Senate a few years ago only \nto be stalled by the Republican House leadership. Senator Feinstein was \nthe lead sponsor of such a bill last Congress.\n  I intend to do what I can to convince Congress to fairly evaluate \nthis issue and the Chief Justice's arguments, so that we can see what \nsolutions may be possible. I hope Congress and the President will \nreconsider a broader judicial compensation measure this year to adjust \ntheir salaries. We have taken a first step now by taking up and passing \nthis bill allowing for the annual judicial COLA that was not enacted \nlast year.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table; that any statements related to this bill be printed in the \nRecord. I also indicate this matter has been cleared with Senator \nMcConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 197) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Senate will begin the \nhard work of moving our country forward with S. 1. S. 1 is the ethics, \nlobbying, earmark reform legislation that will be before this body \ntomorrow.\n  After a long time, it seems, the new Senate has been sworn in. Our 10 \nnew colleagues are here. Today we govern, and we start with S. 1. It is \ncalled the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act. When \npassed, this legislation will help ensure America has a government as \ngood and as honest as the people whom it serves. I want the record to \nbe spread with my appreciation for Senator McConnell cosponsoring this \nlegislation. As the Chair knows and has worked so hard to promote \nbipartisanship, we cannot accomplish anything in this 110th Congress \nunless the legislative body works together on a bipartisan basis and \nsends legislation to the President that he will sign. Senator McConnell \nset the right tone in agreeing to cosponsor this most important \nlegislation. Again, I\n\n[[Page S220]]\n\nappreciate that very much. It is good for the American people to see \nthat the first piece of legislation being brought before this body is \none that is cosponsored by the Republican leader and the Democratic \nleader.\n  In the weeks leading to this new Congress, we have heard Members from \nboth sides of the aisle talk about bipartisanship. S. 1 will have \nturned that talk into action. This is a bipartisan bill cosponsored by \nthe two leaders, as well as the chairs and ranking members of the \nrelevant committees.\n  The designation of the bill as S. 1 has symbolic importance. Often S. \n1 is a vehicle for the majority party to make a partisan statement to \nits base. I have asked my staff to ascertain the last time a bill \ndesignated as S. 1 was jointly sponsored by the majority and minority \nleaders. It has been 32 years. In 1975, majority leader Mike Mansfield \nand minority leader Hugh Scott jointly sponsored a bipartisan criminal \njustice reform bill. I am very happy to revive the Mansfield-Scott \ntradition, where we have leaders working together to move this country \nforward.\n  There are many reasons ethics reform is the first legislative item \nthe Senate will consider. Most importantly, because no issue facing \nthis body is more fundamentally important. Honest government should not \nbe a partisan goal. It is the key to a strong nation. All our work this \nyear is based upon what S. 1 is to the American people. When we make \nleaders accountable to the people, not the special interests or \nlobbyists, there is no limit to what we can accomplish. We can be \nenergy independent. We can have affordable health care. We can build a \nstrong economy and provide real security for our country. Each of these \ngoals can be accomplished if we ensure that the people's needs, not \nspecial interest needs, are put first.\n  Ethics reform is also the first order of business because it is a \nclear priority of the American people. In election day exit polls on \nNovember 7, voters spoke loudly and very clearly about their diminished \nfaith in government. Forty-one percent of voters named corruption as \nextremely important in determining whom they would vote for. Americans \nwant us to purge the Government of undue influence, and they want us to \neliminate the conditions that led to the scandal-making headlines of \nlast year and 2005: headlines about officials being flown to Scotland \nfor rounds of golf; headlines about committee chairmen negotiating \nlucrative lobbying jobs with the industries they oversee, while working \non legislation important to those industries; and, of course, headlines \nabout ``pay to play'' schemes such as the infamous K Street Project, \nwhere jobs and campaign donations were traded for legislation and other \nofficial acts.\n  A number of elected officials and lobbyists have been put in jail for \ntheir activities that showed a disrespect for the Congress and the \ncountry. The American people simply have had enough. This is not the \nfirst time the Senate has considered ethics legislation. Last year, in \nthe wake of the scandals of 2005, we debated and passed a reform bill \nin the Senate. Unfortunately, it fell victim to politics and never \nemerged from a conference committee, even though that bill passed on a \nbipartisan basis in the Senate. This year we are not going to let that \nhappen. We will pass this bill, put it into law.\n  The House of Representatives has already acted on part of this issue, \nas their rules allow them to proceed faster than the Senate, and that \nis an understatement. I applaud Speaker Pelosi for making ethics reform \na House priority. We will address many of the same issues here. But \nbecause of our rules, we will proceed at a much slower pace, not \nbecause we want to but that is how the Senate operates.\n  This bill will not be referred to the committees of jurisdiction. \nSenator McConnell and I have decided to begin the debate with the same \nbill that passed this Chamber 90 to 8 last year. It has been through \nthe committees previously, providing us with a strong starting point \nfor action this year.\n  The reforms in S. 1 are very real, very strong. To begin, it \nprohibits gifts and travel paid for by lobbyists, such as Jack \nAbramoff's infamous trips around the world. Under provisions of this \nbill, no Member or staff would be able to receive any gift or take any \ntrip paid for by a registered lobbyist. Next, this legislation will \nslow the revolving door that shuffles lawmakers and top staff between \nFederal jobs and the private sector. We all remember the case of the \nHouse chairman to manage the Medicare Part D bill on the floor of the \nHouse only to leave shortly thereafter to make $1 million a year as \npresident of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. \nThis bill will ban former Members from lobbying for 2 years, toughen \nlobbying bans already in place for senior staff, require public \ndisclosure by Members negotiating private sector employment, and strip \nformer Members who become lobbyists of their floor privileges.\n  Third, this bill will improve Senate procedures to make our work more \ntransparent to the public. It will require full disclosure of earmarks. \nIt will provide new tools to ensure that Members of Congress and \nmembers of the public have a chance to review bills before they are \nvoted on. It will make it harder to insert new provisions in conference \nreports and hand out special favors in the dead of night.\n  Fourth, it will improve lobbying disclosures. Today lobbyists must \nfile reports semiannually. Our legislation will require them quarterly. \nNot only that, we will post the reports on the Internet, and we will \nrequire lobbyists to include their campaign contributions and \nfundraisers. Those who don't follow the rules will be subject to stiff \nnew penalties.\n  Fifth, this bill will make partisan efforts to influence private \nsector hiring, such as the K Street Project, a violation of Senate \nrules and mandate ethics training for all Members and staff.\n  The bill I have outlined, in a broad sense, is a starting point. If \nwe did nothing else other than pass this bill, we would have enacted \nthe most sweeping ethics reforms in a generation or more. But we will \nnot stop with this bill that has been introduced. Very soon I expect to \noffer a substitute amendment that will strengthen this legislation even \nmore. I hope to do that sometime tomorrow. Then we will have ample time \nfor other Senators to improve the bill through further amendment.\n  Our two Democratic managers, Senators Feinstein and Lieberman, will \noversee a strong bipartisan debate. And together we will pass the \nstrongest Government reform bill to come out of the Senate since \nWatergate.\n  Some of the improvements I expect to be approved this week include \nextending the gifts and travel ban to companies and groups that hire \nlobbyists, not just the lobbyists themselves. I also expect we will \napprove earmark disclosure and that we will toughen penalties for those \nwho set up fraudulent, corrupt lobbying schemes such as the ones Mr. \nAbramoff created.\n  We have tremendous challenges facing us this year, but our first is \nto restore the people's faith in their government. With the bipartisan \nreforms I have outlined today, we can accomplish that task.\n  There is no better way to start this new Congress than by showing the \nAmerican people that we will answer only to them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

It offers the opportunity for the Senate to come\n\n[[Page S221]]\n\ntogether, in a bipartisan way, and pass lobbying reforms, some ethics \nreform, some earmarks reform, and take a real step together in an \nimportant way.\n  As we all know, the House has passed a set of rules, and so the \nconference is going to be an interesting one because the Senate will \nhave its own bill. The House will have its own exclusive rules and \nhopefully will present some bill language from relevant committees in \nthe House that we will be able to reconcile in the conference \ncommittee.\n  Tomorrow, with Senator Bennett as the ranking member, as well as \nSenators Lieberman and Collins, we will formally present this bill. I \nhope that the presentation will reflect our commitment to work together \nto see that the discussion is full, that we understand that there are \ndifferences of opinion within the Senate on some of the points, but \nthat it is critically important that action be taken.\n  We all know what has happened this past year. We all know that the \nresults of the election have indicated that corruption is an important \nconcern of the electorate, some say the most important concern, even \nwith Iraq, that was voted on in this election. So the voice of the \npeople calling us to move ahead, pass legislation, and see that our \nHouse is clean and scrupulous is increasingly important. I believe we \nwill measure up.\n  The base bill that will be on the floor tomorrow is identical to the \nbill that was passed last year. It came to the floor in the early part \nof the year and was then passed by the Senate. It was held up in the \nHouse over a difference of opinion on 527 reform. And from that point \non, it was stymied and went nowhere.\n  It is also my understanding--and my staff has been a party to the \ndiscussions--that there will be a leadership amendment. That leadership \namendment will be concurred in by the majority leader, the minority \nleader, the chair and ranking member of Rules and others. It will \nessentially toughen the bill that was presented last year. We will deal \nwith a number of issues, including strengthening the earmark language.\n  Now, I want to make a couple of personal comments on earmarks. In my \nview, this is the most difficult part of the entire bill, to reconcile \nfeelings, to be able to develop some form of a consensus. An earmark is \nan appropriation placed in the budget by Members of Congress. I believe \nearmarks should exist. We have big States, and I come from a big State \nof 38 million people. We pay far more in taxes than we get back in \nservices. Therefore, to be able to place in the budget certain critical \nitems that benefit California's infrastructure and California's \nprograms is important.\n  I also strongly believe that my name should accompany the earmark. I \nhave no problem letting anyone know what earmark I have suggested.\n  I strongly believe that--and this is where I think I probably differ \nfrom some of my colleagues--if an earmark is added in the dark of \nnight, if the earmark is not voted on by a subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee, it should be subject to a 60-vote point of \norder. Right now, rule XXVIII, according to the Parliamentarian, does \nnot apply to earmarks per se but out-of-scope matters only--for \nexample, ANWR. So I think the discussion in the ensuing week and a half \nis going to be an interesting one.\n  Secondly, are earmarks just non-Federal additions, congressional \nadditions to a budget, or do they also encompass funds that go to State \nentities or private entities? As we work on this issue, I say to the \nMembers that I would very much like to know your views. I would like to \nwork with every Member. It is my intention as the new chairman of the \nRules Committee to work openly and, hopefully, in a bipartisan way not \nonly with the ranking member but with other Republicans and Democrats \non that committee. The first hearing we will have in the Rules \nCommittee will be on the subject of the past election--specifically, \nthe undervote in Sarasota, FL, on certain items on their ballot, e-\nvoting, and what we might be able to do to assure people who vote that \ntheir vote is recorded accurately; that there are actually no \nswitchovers; that there is no difference between how you press the \nbutton and how your vote is recorded; and that you can corroborate with \na paper trail that, in fact, that is the way you voted.\n  I come to the Senate floor to make very brief opening remarks and \nsignal my intention to work with the Rules Committee on this bill in a \nbipartisan way and, hopefully, to make as much progress as we can.\n  I have been an appropriator for 13 out of my 15 years in this body. I \nhave served in different capacities, as we all have. We work our way up \nthrough the chairs in Appropriations. I think the time has come for \nearmarks, and for holds as well, to stop the anonymity, give them the \nfull light of day; for Members who produce earmarks to be willing to \ndefend them and that when earmarks are placed in the dark of night by a \nMember, they would be subject to a 60-vote point of order.\n  I will say one other thing about holds. A hold is something that a \nMember does to essentially indicate that they have a concern about a \nvote. It is difficult, from a parliamentary perspective, to take action \nbecause you may just want to hold a bill so that you have an \nopportunity to read it, which would just be 24 hours or so. Or you may \nhave some mischief in your mind when you produce a hold. I have seen \nholds that were put on virtually everything that came out of a \ncommittee because one Member wanted to make a point. I have seen \nMembers put holds on every bill another Member had to make a point. It \nseems to me that along with the era of the anonymous earmark, the era \nof the anonymous hold ought to be put to rest with a big sign that says \n``rest in peace.''\n  This is a new day. I do agree that transparency and full disclosure \nact in the best interest of this body. I look forward to presenting the \nbill tomorrow, along with Ranking Member Bennett, Senator Lieberman, \nand Senator Collins, and to the ensuing 6 or 7 days of discussion and \namendments.\n  I want to ask one other thing, and that is that when the bill comes \nto the floor, Members come down and file their amendments so that in \naddition to the leadership-proposed substitute, we will have knowledge \nof what is about to come to the floor.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business \nwith Members granted approximately 10 minutes apiece, if they so \nchoose; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S221-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S221-S223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WESTERN KANSAS SNOWSTORMS\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to call your attention to \nwhat can only be described as a major disaster in my home State of \nKansas and surrounding States--certainly the State represented by the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer--along with New Mexico and eastern \nColorado, more especially in western Kansas.\n  In the last days of December, a large winter storm spread over 30 \ninches of heavy snow and up to 3 inches of ice in much of my State of \nKansas.\n  As you can see from this picture of what used to be a row of electric \ntowers--a very idyllic scene in Kansas, where we produce the food and \nfiber this Nation needs--and then from the following picture--I will \ntake this picture down and basically show you what happened after the \nblizzard--of what remains, this storm has caused overwhelming \ndestruction all throughout the region. There are 21 towers in this \ncondition, as shown in the picture. These are major towers of power, of \nelectrical grid that have been destroyed all across my State of Kansas, \nmore especially in the western part.\n  As a result, 15-foot snowdrifts closed highways and left over 60,000 \ncustomers without power. Over 10,000 downed utility poles litter the \narea. We did not get that picture blown up in time, but it is a \nmarvelous picture of a road--you can see the snow here--that goes by \nwith a whole bunch of telephone poles snapped off like matchsticks. And \nthat has happened all throughout that area. Residents who are lucky \nenough to have\n\n[[Page S222]]\n\ngenerators are now paying up to $50 a day for diesel fuel to simply \ngenerate electricity to stay warm, to exist.\n  What is more, the storm hit one of the largest concentrations of \nlivestock in the State. Let me put up a chart that is going to be a \nlittle difficult to discern from the standpoint of what it portrays. \nFor reasons you can understand when you look at this image, we have \nreceived numerous reports of animals like this calf--yes, this is a \ncalf. You can see the calf's nose, and one eye here and one eye here. \nWe do not know whether the calf made it, in that our producers are \nworking overtime, our ranchers are working overtime to get food to \ntheir livestock herds. But in this particular instance, you can see \nwhat happens to an animal that is caught in these kinds of conditions--\na rather sad scene, to say the least. Either they succumb to a lack of \nfood or a lack of water or they suffer extreme weight loss.\n  (Ms. STABENOW assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, what happens, as you well know, coming \nfrom the State you represent, is that you will have a thaw, but the \nthaw will only involve a couple of inches, and it turns to ice, and \nthen below that mud. So if you have any livestock there, they are \nstuck. You could even put a bale of hay right next to them and they \ncould not eat it.\n  So many economic livelihoods are in danger if Kansas farmers are \nunable to reach their herds of cattle or keep them fed. I take great \npride in reporting that all across our State our producers are doing \nthe very best they can under very difficult circumstances.\n  In light of the overwhelming destruction this storm has thrust on our \nState, 44 counties were immediately declared states of disaster. This \ncomes as no surprise to those of us who have seen the damage this storm \nhas caused or those of us who have gone through previous storms. I \nremember the one in 1973, which caused great damage, and we had to use \nAir Force planes with bales of hay to keep the livestock herds, at \nleast to the extent they could be, from dying. However, what comes as a \nsurprise to myself and many others is that FEMA has been unable to \nfully respond to our vital requests for assistance.\n  Last night, the President issued a major disaster declaration for \nKansas, allowing the State access to two--two--of the seven--that is \nimportant: Two of the seven--major types of public assistance. However, \nhe agreed with me, when I showed the President these images of our \nState a moment ago at the White House that the damage in the western \npart of our State goes far beyond something called ``debris removal'' \nand ``emergency protective services.''\n  Furthermore, we have been told that debris removal does not cover the \nremoval of snow. Now, wait a minute. If you are in western Kansas or \nyou are out on the high plains and you have 30 inches of snow and 15-\nfoot snowdrifts but you cannot remove the snow because it cannot be \ncategorized as debris, how on Earth can you reach the debris that is \nunderneath the snow? That seems to be a quandary or a question that is \nrather ridiculous under the circumstances.\n  While I understand that Federal officials must confirm a record or \nnear-record amount of snow in order to expend Federal funds--I \nunderstand that--30 inches of snow certainly covers any other debris \none could hope to clear, including the 15-foot drifts.\n  The bottom line is that the State of Kansas needs its Federal \nGovernment to assist in restoring power and clearing massive amounts of \nsnow. And they need this assistance immediately--not next week, next \nmonth, or next year.\n  I have been told that meetings this week will determine whether \nKansas qualifies for the remaining categories of public assistance. You \nremember that picture of the transformer, which I will put back up--and \nI will cover the picture of this poor calf--these are the kinds of \nthings where we have to have public assistance; otherwise, you have \nlocal, small generators and people paying $50 a day for diesel fuel \njust to keep warm. That is the kind of category of public assistance--I \nam not going to list all of them--we desperately need.\n  I can only ask on behalf of Kansans, who will have been stuck in the \nsnow for 2 weeks by the time these meetings occur, that these decisions \nbe made sooner rather than later. I have been informed just this \nmorning by our FEMA Director, Mr. David Paulison--who wants to be of \nall possible help--that much work remains to be done between the State \nand also our regional FEMA officials.\n  I understand that. There are a lot of regulations. There are a lot of \nthings Congress itself has put into the regulations in regard to FEMA \nhelp or State officials, that they must work through this. But the 850 \npeople in Sharon Springs, Kansas, cannot afford to clear the 15-foot \nsnowdrifts that are currently covering six blocks of Main Street. Their \ncounty of 1,500 people could not have known to budget for the 600 \ntruckloads of snow they estimate it will take to clear just their Main \nStreet, just that area. They estimate it would take that to do the job. \nThey need their Federal Government's help, and they need their State \nand also regional FEMA help to expedite this process, which I \nunderstand is going to take place on Wednesday. Why it cannot take \nplace before that I am not sure. And why the Weather Service cannot at \nleast discern this was a major snow--a major snow of 30 inches and 15-\nfoot drifts--is a little bit beyond me. We will keep working on that.\n\n  As each day passes that FEMA is not able to issue the remaining \ncategories of assistance--I am not blaming FEMA. I know there is a \nprocess. I am not blaming the State. I know there is a process. But the \npeople of Saint Francis and the people of many other communities--\ncounty seat communities, noncounty seat communities, very small \ncommunities--need the assistance now.\n  I hope FEMA and our Government do not give the impression that it is \nentirely focused solely on large urban and suburban communities, or \nnatural disasters that make the headlines, make the headlines, and make \nthe headlines. Obviously, I am talking about hurricanes, I am talking \nabout mudslides, I am talking about forest fires, I am talking about \nmajor disasters where FEMA does the best job they possibly can. We have \ncome through a lot in the past sessions of Congress.\n  So I am asking our State officials and our FEMA folks here in \nWashington and also on a regional level to prove this is not the case \nby quickly providing all available Federal resources to support this \neffort in our heartland. And again, let's do it this week. Let's not \nwait until next week and the week after and a month after.\n  I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB McGOWAN\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the accomplishments of \nBob McGowan, the Washoe County assessor. Last year, after more than 24 \nyears in office, Bob retired as the longest serving elected department \nhead in the county. His personable demeanor and dedication to service \nwill be missed.\n  Bob has been a resident of Nevada for more than 38 years. After \nworking in the Nevada Attorney General's office, Bob made the first of \nmany successful runs for elected office. In 1982, the citizens of \nWashoe County elected him as their county assessor. For more than two \ndecades, Bob has presided over the growth of Washoe County. From the \nrising real estate values at Lake Tahoe to the rapid development in the \ncity of Reno, Bob has sought to provide fairness for Washoe County \nresidents.\n  Most importantly, Bob has never forgotten that the goal of elected \noffice is service. After his election in 2002, he told the Reno-Gazette \nJournal: ``From the first day I went in office, we've always been a \npublic service organization, not just a property appraisal.'' Under \nBob's guidance, the assessor's office has become more responsive to \nWashoe County residents. For example, Bob moved the assessor's office \ninto the digital age, and residents of Washoe County can now access \nmany forms online. Bob has also worked to\n\n[[Page S223]]\n\nsave the taxpayers money, trimming his own budget to return more than \n$2 million dollars to the Washoe County general fund.\n  As the county assessor, Bob has always been in tune with the issues \nof Washoe County. He has navigated controversies over rising property \nvalues with ease, taking the time to talk with the people he serves. To \nthis day, residents are amazed that Bob is so approachable and \naccessible. He can quickly put a visitor at ease with his humble \ndemeanor and his frequent jokes. In fact, I cannot recall a time that I \nhave met with Bob when he hasn't told me a funny anecdote or story.\n  In addition to his professional accomplishments, Bob is a dedicated \npart of his community. He has served as president for Habitat for \nHumanity and as an executive board member of the alumni organization \nfor the University of Nevada, Reno. Additionally, as the president of \nthe Keep Truckee Meadows Beautiful organization, he led an effort to \nprotect the pristine areas surrounding Lake Tahoe. While working to \nimprove Washoe County, Bob also raised three wonderful children in \nReno. A few years ago, I had the privilege to host his daughter, Megan, \nin my Washington office. A finer former employee does not exist.\n  Bob McGowan has been an important part of Northern Nevada for more \nthan two decades. His retirement will leave large shoes to fill, but I \nam confident that Bob will continue to improve Washoe County for many \nyears to come. It is my great pleasure to offer my congratulations to \nBob and the McGowan family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S223-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S223-S224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Corpsman Christopher Anderson\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to reflect for a moment on the \nservice and sacrifice of Navy Hospital Corpsman Christopher Anderson of \nLongmont, CO. Corpsman Anderson was killed in Iraq last month in the \nvolatile Al Anbar province in service to this Nation. He was only 24, \nand was laid to rest late last month in Arlington National Cemetery \nhere in our Nation's Capital.\n  In Longmont, they bade farewell to Hospital Corpsman Anderson with \nall appropriate honors that this Nation, his community and his family \ncould bestow: A Purple Heart and 21-gun salute, a release of doves, and \nhundreds lining the streets to pay their final respects to a young man \ntaken from this life all too soon.\n  Serving as a Navy Corpsman with a unit of Marines is no easy task. \nThe job dates back to the Spanish-American War, and is an incredibly \ndangerous job which entails carrying a loaded weapon along with the \ntools of your trade: Saving lives.\n  The marines I have had the privilege of knowing are all proud, brave \nand honorable men whose respect must be earned through hard work. For a \nCorpsman, the title of ``Doc'' comes only when you have earned the \nrespect of your Marine unit, when they are prepared to risk their lives \nfor you as they would one of their own, because they know with absolute \nconviction that you would do the same.\n  One fellow Navy Corpsman reflected on the honor of this title, saying \nof the Marines, ``If they yell, `Corpsman up,' they know Doc is going \nto be right there. . . . When the Marines call you `Doc,' you know \nyou'll never let them down, you'll never leave their side. That bond \nbetween a Marine and a Navy corpsman is something that will last \nforever. We call them `My Marines'--they call us `My Doc.' ''\n  Navy Hospital Corpsman Christopher Anderson was ``Doc'' to his \nmarines.\n  For Christopher Anderson, service was always in his blood. He was an \nuncommon young man of steady nerves and a unique ability to inspire \nothers to find greatness in themselves. When he graduated Longmont High \nSchool in 2000, he sought a way to make a difference in the world, and \nhad considered becoming a police officer or firefighter. His \ngrandfather observed, ``If he saw a wreck on the side of the road, he \nwas the first to stop and help.''\n  And then in 2005, a higher calling of service reached out to \nChristopher: America. When Christopher enlisted in the U.S. Navy in \nAugust, 2005, he was the fourth generation of his family to join the \nservice. And he carried on his family tradition with honor and \ndistinction.\n  Throughout training and during his service, Hospital Corpsman \nAnderson met every challenge with excellence. At his boot camp \ngraduation, Corpsman Anderson was voted by his peers the ``honor \ngraduate'' of his class, the premier member of his class. He sought \nadvanced combat medic training and volunteered for an assignment to the \nfront lines in Iraq. When one of his sergeants was injured by an IED in \nIraq, a surgeon commented that Corpsman Anderson's emergency medical \ntreatment was the finest he had ever seen.\n  A marine will tell you that he will always take a bullet for his Doc, \nbecause his Doc is the only one who can take it back out. Hospital \nCorpsman Christopher Anderson sacrificed his life for this Nation \nbecause he knew that our Nation needed his service. He accepted these \ngreat risks with a smile and extraordinary courage from which all of us \ncan take a lesson. He sacrificed himself for the ideals of his country. \nIt is a debt which we cannot repay, and a loss we cannot replace. And \nwe are all humbled by his service and sacrifice.\n  To Christopher's parents, Rick and Debra, his brother Kyle, I know \nthat no words can describe or assuage the pain you feel. I pray that \nyou can find comfort in the knowledge that Christopher was doing \nsomething which he truly loved, and of which he was extraordinarily \nproud. He will endure in our hearts and prayers.\n\n\n                     Lance Corporal Nicklas Palmer\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the life and service of a young \nmarine from Leadville, CO: Marine LCpl Nicklas James Palmer. Lance \nCorporal Palmer was killed last month in Fallujah, Iraq.\n  Nick Palmer was only 19 years old when he was taken from his family \nin Iraq. But he was serving his Nation with honor and distinction as a \nmarine, something he had dreamed of doing as a high school student in \nLake County.\n  Nick Palmer came to the State of Colorado as a boy, and in 2005 when \nhe graduated from Lake County High School, he was a man prepared to \nfind his place in the world. In high school, Nick was a football player \nwho lettered all 4 years with the Lake County High varsity squad, a \nlineman to be precise.\n  I have known a few linemen in my day, and it tells us all something \nabout his character and why he was drawn to the Marine Corps: Nick \nPalmer was a man who knew that there was tough work to be done, that it \nrequired leadership, physical skill and courage and that he was the \nright man for the job.\n  The Marine Corps was a natural fit for Nick Palmer. It was physical \nand independent, and allowed him the opportunity to become a leader. In \nfact, Nick prepared for Marine Corps boot camp by taking 10-mile runs \nwith a 40-pound pack on his back, determined to be the finest recruit \nat Camp Pendleton in San Diego.\n  That is a lineman's mentality, and it is the steel at the very core \nof the U.S. Marine Corps: Through discipline, one achieves excellence.\n  Nick Palmer was not solely a man of serious character. His family, \nclassmates, teachers, and community all reflected that he was a young \nman who always had a smile for a friend and saw the laughs to be had in \nlife. He was a loyal friend, an independent young man who was always \nprepared to lend a hand or take the lead.\n  Lance Corporal Palmer was anxious to get to Iraq, to begin his \nservice to his Nation. His time with the Marine Corps was marked by his \ncontinuing leadership: Lance Corporal Palmer's commanding officer in \nIraq noted that he was never afraid to step forward and say, ``I'll do \nit.''\n  It was that spirit that moved Nick Palmer to serve this Nation in the \nfirst place as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps. His character, \nleadership, and courage exemplified that sacred motto of the Marines: \nSemper Fi. Always Faithful.\n  To Nick's mother and father, Brad and Rachele, and his brother \nDustin, know that you and Nick will remain in the thoughts and prayers \nof an entire Nation. We are honored by his service, we are humbled by \nhis sacrifice, and we are forever grateful for his courage and \ncharacter.\n\n\n                    Private First Class Seth Stanton\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to reflect on the loss of a Coloradan and \nmember of the U.S. Armed Forces, Army PFC Seth\n\n[[Page S224]]\n\nStanton. Private First Class Stanton was fatally wounded late last \nmonth in Taji, Iraq, when a roadside bomb exploded beneath his vehicle. \nHe was only 19 years old.\n  In June 2005, after graduating from Coronado High School in Colorado \nSprings, he enlisted in the Army. At the time the improvised explosive \ndevice destroyed the humvee in which he was riding, had been in Iraq \nfor 2 months.\n  Seth Stanton was a young man who, as his uncle noted, lived every \nminute of his life to the fullest. He was an outstanding student who \nwas skipped all the way up to the 12th grade, ahead of his age, after \nbeing home schooled for many years.\n  And he loved off-roading in his prized Jeep Cherokee with its heavy-\nduty suspension and oversized tires rumbling across our state's rugged \nterrain. He even bragged to his friends about how four fellow service \nmembers told him one day ``how illegal my Jeep is.''\n  As a man, Seth Stanton had many opportunities ahead of him. But \ninstead of choosing to attend college or join the workforce, Seth \nStanton chose a different path: the U.S. Army. Private First Class \nStanton knew that his Nation, and the people of Iraq, needed his \nservice and support, and he bravely stepped forward and volunteered for \nthis challenging duty.\n  Private First Class Stanton didn't choose to follow this path, as his \ngrandmother Georgell noted, out of politics or economics or some other \nmotive. He chose it because he knew in his heart it was the right thing \nto do: dedicate himself to a cause greater than his own.\n  The tragedy of a life of such promise going unrealized affects \neveryone in this body, and in this Nation, but not as deeply or \npersonally as it will move his parents Stephen and Anna or the rest of \nhis family. Every American mourns your loss with you, and Seth's \ncourage and sacrifice will be honored always.\n  Chapter Five of the Book of Matthew chronicles that, in his Sermon on \nthe Mount, Jesus tells us, ``Blessed are the peacemakers: for they \nshall be called the children of God.'' I hope that this brings you \nsolace in the coming days, with the knowledge that He holds Seth close, \nand blesses his character and sacrifice.\n\n\n                      Staff Sergeant David Staats\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to call the Nation's attention to a service \nmember whom we lost late last month in service to our country.\n  Army SSgt David Staats was killed in Taji, Iraq, when a roadside bomb \ndetonated beneath his vehicle. Staff Sergeant Staats epitomized the \nspirit of service to his Nation. He was only a few weeks into his third \ntour in Iraq. He was a young man, only 30 years old, with his entire \nlife ahead of him. He leaves behind his wife Meagan, his 8-year-old son \nTyler, and stepdaughter, Katie.\n  He heard the call to serve his country early on, enlisting in the \nArmy before he even graduated from high school in 1995. After his \nsecond tour, in which he was stationed in Kuwait and Iraq, he briefly \nleft the service. But soldiering was in his blood, the core of who he \nwas, and he reenlisted after only a year away from the Army.\n  In his service in Iraq, Staff Sergeant Staats was upholding the \nglobal values of human dignity, freedom and liberty. He did so not for \nglory or praise, but because he had absolute confidence in his values \nand his mission to protect those who cannot protect themselves.\n  Staff Sergeant Staats' mother said it best: ``He was doing what he \nthought he should do.''\n  David Staats was a loving son, husband and father, too. He treasured \nthe time he spent with his son Tyler and his stepdaughter Katie, and \nwas an adoring husband to his wife Meagan.\n  President Abraham Lincoln famously once said, ``In the end, it's not \nthe years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.'' The \nloss of David Staats was sudden, and tragic. It reminds each America of \nthe gravity of that which we ask of our service members, and the brief \nnature of our time on this Earth.\n  But in his service to our Nation and his family, David Staats lived a \nlife of honor, courage, character and distinction to which every \nAmerican can look with respect and admiration.\n  To Meagan, Tyler, and Katie, to David's parents Roger and Wanda, and \nhis sister Bethany, I hope that this knowledge can help ease the \npainful sorrow each of you feel. While your anguish from his loss may \nnever fully pass, I hope that you can take comfort in the knowledge \nthat David's service and sacrifice on behalf of each and every American \nwill be forever honored by a humble and grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S224-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S224-S225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RETIREMENT OF DR. PHILIP ROYAL SHIPP, JR.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today to honor the \ncareer of Dr. Philip Royal Shipp, Jr., a devoted public servant who has \nserved the Congress for nearly 30 years at the Congressional Research \nService, CRS. During his tenure at the CRS, Dr. Shipp has served in \nseveral key management and leadership roles, demonstrating \nextraordinary levels of competence, intelligence, and intellectual \ncreativity in each of these positions.\n  Most recently, Dr. Shipp has served as the Director of the Domestic \nSocial Policy Division. The Domestic Social Policy Division offers the \nCongress research and analysis in many programs and policies that under \nthe jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee, including the \nMedicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance Programs, as \nwell as Social Security, pensions, welfare, child welfare programs.\n  I have been honored to serve as chairman of the Finance Committee for \n4 years and am pleased to continue my service as the ranking Republican \non the committee. Analysts under Dr. Shipp's supervision have worked \nclosely with my Finance Committee staff, briefing them on complex \nprograms and policies, helping them in the drafting of legislation and \nparticipating in Senate Finance Committee hearings.\n  We Members of Congress simply could not do our work effectively \nwithout the support we recelve from organizations like the \nCongressional Research Service. There is simply no other organization \nwith the reputation and the credibility of CRS. The work provided by \nCRS is always first rate, oftentimes quantitative and impeccably \nnonpartisan. Dr. Shipp, throughout his career, has embodied these \ncharacteristics.\n  Dr. Shipp began his Federal service in 1964 as an economist with the \nFederal Reserve. He was subsequently a progr analyst with the Office of \nManagement and Budget and later the Acting Administrator of the Food \nand Nutrition Service. Dr. Shipp made significant contributions to the \nFood and Nutrition Service, including an expanded view of the public \npolicy purposes of food assistance programs such as food stamps. He \nalso was instrumental in establishing and expanding the agency's in-\nhouse capacity to analyze programs, study their effects, and estimate \nthe impact of legislative and regulatory changes.\n  Dr. Shipp joined the Congressional Research Service in 1977 as a \nSenior Specialist in Social Legislation in the former Education and \nPublic Welfare, EPW, Division. He spent a significant part of the next \ndecade leading teams of CRS analysts in high-level, committee-\nrequested, legislatively relevant research studies focused on health \nand income issues. Topics included health insurance for the uninsured, \nretirement income for an aging population, and work incentives in \nincome support programs. Under Dr. Shipp's direction, CRS developed a \nframework and quantitative model to compare legislative options for a \nnew retirement system for Federal workers; this model was used in the \ndevelopment of the Federal employee retirement system that is in place \ntoday. During this period, in 1984, Dr. Shipp also served as Executive \nDirector of the Congressional Panel on Social Security Organization, \nwhich was charged with developing an organizational and management \nframework for an independent agency for Social Security. The panel's \nprincipal recommendations were reflected in the legislation that \neventually created the independent Social Security Administration.\n  In 1989, Dr. Shipp became Associate Director of CRS for Research \nPlanning and Coordination, where he guided efforts to evaluate and \nimprove CRS services and operations and led several of tge agency's \nfirst strategic management reviews. He returned to EPW as\n\n[[Page S225]]\n\nDivision Chief in 1994 and became head of the expanded Domestic Social \nPolicy Division in 1999. As Assistant Director for Domestic Social \nPolicy, the largest research division within CRS, Dr. Shipp emphasized \nthe building of analytic capacities, with a special focus on empirical \nanalysis, as a way to enhance CRS' legislative support to Congress. He \nwas instrumental in building CRS capacities in all areas of domestic \nsocial policy, in particular health policy analysis, Social Security \nand disability analysis, homeland and border secur, public health \npreparedness, and housing and welfare policy. He organized and staffed \nthe division to respond to new challenges, in particular the heightened \nneed for expertise in domestic intelligence and counterterrorism after \nthe attacks of September 11, 2001. Dr. Shipp also conceived and \nimplemented an initiative to enhance CRS' strong analytic work in \nissues associated with the aging of the population, by expanding the \ndivision's staff to include new analysts with expertise in specific \nrelevant disciplines. Under Dr. Shipp's leadership, CRS also obtained \nand developed the capacity to use a micro-simulation model for analysis \nof the distributional impact of alternative policy options for Social \nSecurity reform.\n  I am informed that Dr. Shipp was an exceptional manager with a clear \nvision of how CRS should be of service to the Congress. He leaves a \nstrong legacy that will have a profound effect on the Congress for \nyears to come. I know that my colleagues join me in thanking him for \nhis service and wishing him well as he embarks on new challenges ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S225-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VERMONT COMPANY BRIDGES THE DIGITAL DIVIDE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I wish to tell my colleagues in the \nSenate about a family-owned telephone business in Vermont that has once \nagain led the industry in customer service and technological advances. \nWaitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom has successfully delivered \nhigh-speed broadband Internet service capability by way of Digital \nSubscriber Line, DSL, technology to every single one of its customers \nsomething most of its competitors have found difficult, if not \nimpossible, to do.\n  The beautiful rural and mountainous landscape that makes Vermont such \na wonderful place to live has proven to be a stubborn barrier in \ndelivering broadband access to every Vermonter. Moreover, as one of the \ncountry's most rural States, Vermont struggles to implement large \nbroadband infrastructure investments that reach relatively small \npopulation densities. Yet in the Mad River Valley--where Mother Nature \nhas deposited plenty of these beautiful yet stubborn barriers and \npeople settled where they wanted to and not where the roads told them \nto--Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom found a way to ensure that \ntheir customers have an access ramp to the information super highway.\n  By making this significant investment in their own network, \nWaitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom has invested in the economic \nvitality of every household it serves. Broadband access is a necessity \nfor the company looking to move to Vermont, for the student writing a \nresearch paper, or for the family doing research on an upcoming \nvacation. So much of our country's economy depends upon high-speed \nInternet access, and making this access available to every American \nwill require more companies willing to follow the lead of Vermont's own \nWaitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom.\n  Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom is a growing company, but it \nremains independently owned and operated by the Haskin family, under \nthe leadership of Gregg Haskin. My wife Marcelle and I are proud to \ncall the Haskins close friends, and we are even prouder of the deep \ncommitment they have to their community. We wish them continued \nsuccess, and I hope that my friends in the Senate will take this story \nback to their home States and point to this company's model as a key \nfactor toward bridging the digital divide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S225-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN HONOR OF BRUCE JAMES\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a Nevadan whose \ningenuity and leadership has changed the way that government operates. \nBruce James has served as Public Printer for 4 years, but the impact of \nhis service will be felt indefinitely.\n  President Bush chose Bruce to head the Government Printing Office \nbecause of his extensive experience in the printing industry, beginning \nwhen Bruce was 11 years old and set up a basement print shop in \nCleveland, OH. His lifetime of work as a printer and executive has been \nfull of great success and accolades, and, combined with his inspiring \ncommitment to public service, he has earned the respect of Nevadans and \nleaders and organizations around the world.\n  While businesses in this country have been rapidly transforming and \nchanging to accommodate technology, many sectors of our government have \nfallen drastically behind. While it is easy to blame bureaucracy and \nthe slow speed at which government generally operates, we must focus \nour work on keeping pace. That is exactly why Bruce James was ideal for \nthe job of transitioning the Government Printing Office from a 19th \ncentury print shop mentality and reputation to a 21st century digital \ntool for keeping Americans informed.\n  Bruce has successfully developed and managed printing and publishing \nventures driven by technology for more than 30 years. With the same \nleadership and zeal that he put into private sector enterprises for all \nthose years, Bruce was determined to turn the Government Printing \nOffice into a state-of-the-art information machine by today's \nstandards.\n  When Bruce took over the Government Printing Office, the agency had \nlost $100 million over the last 5 years. By 2004, Bruce had turned \ndevastating losses into an $11 million gain. As a staunch fiscal \nconservative looking to make government as efficient as possible, I \napplaud Bruce's efforts and ingenuity in turning this agency upside \ndown and making it run more like a business--a successful business. He \ndid so with compassion for the employees, a determination to succeed, \nand the vision to make it happen.\n  This country is fortunate to have had Bruce at the helm of the \nGovernment Printing Office. He made the agency more fiscally \nresponsible, and he also has made great progress in making government \ndocuments more accessible. By the end of 2008, nearly every Federal \nGovernment document published since our Nation was founded will be \navailable online.\n  It is a remarkable achievement, especially considering how far Bruce \nhad to bring the agency to reach this point. In the position for only 4 \nyears, he set a standard for all government agencies today and in the \nfuture. When Bruce first spoke to the White House about taking the \nposition, he told them he could not get this sort of transformation \ndone in less than 3 years, and if it took him more than 5, he was not \nthe right person for the job. Turns out he was the perfect person for \nthe job.\n  As he prepares to complete his term as the Nation's 24th Public \nPrinter, I want to thank Bruce James for his commitment to the job, his \nrespect for the position, and his tremendous contributions to \nfurthering the core mission of the Government Printing Office--keeping \nAmerica informed.\n  Nevadans welcome you and Nora home with open arms and great pride for \nthe work you have done. Thank you and God bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S225-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S225-S227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING SENATORIAL SERVICE\n\n Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, it is an honor indeed to pay tribute \nto a number of fine individuals who I am fortunate to call not just my \ncolleagues, but also dear friends: Senators Bill Frist, George Allen, \nConrad Burns, Lincoln Chafee, Mike DeWine, Rick Santorum and Jim \nTalent.\n\n\n                               Bill Frist\n\n  One of the greatest losses to the Senate is the departure of our \nmajority leader, Dr. Bill Frist. I first became acquainted with Bill \nwhen he called me during my time as president of the American Red Cross \nto say that he would travel to Africa with us to volunteer as a \nsurgeon.\n  Back then, I immediately recognized Bill's intelligence, integrity \nand compassion for others. I saw how dedicated he was about sound \npolicy--especially\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\nhealth care policy--and how dedicated he was to helping those most in \nneed, whether they be in America, in Africa, or anywhere in the world. \nAnd I saw how his colleagues quickly came to respect him, to rely on \nhis judgment, and to value his counsel.\n  In the fall of 2001, when terrorism hit home in the United States \nCapitol, we saw how Bill's colleagues immediately turned to him for his \nguidance and expertise, and Bill responded to the challenge. For \nexample, he quickly transformed his Senate website into the best source \nof information for Senate staff on the issues surrounding possible \nanthrax exposure. And he was willing to speak with each and every \nMember of the Senate community to allay concerns with accurate medical \ninformation. Bill utilized his expertise to write legislation to help \nprotect the entire Nation from the scourge of bioterrorism.\n  For the past 2 years, I was honored to serve as a member of Bill's \nleadership team. As our leader, Bill displayed extraordinary integrity, \ncare and thoughtfulness in dealing with every Senator, and he worked \ntirelessly to bring together his colleagues for the betterment of our \nNation.\n  Bill's record of achievement as our majority leader is exemplary. As \na result of his steady leadership, we succeeded in securing historic \ntax relief that has helped put more money in the pockets of hard-\nworking Americans while paving the way for today's stunning economic \nrecovery. His leadership improved life for our seniors by lowering the \ncost of prescription drugs. He helped spearhead important reforms of \nour tort system and bankruptcy code. Under Bill's leadership, we passed \na comprehensive energy bill that reduces our reliance on foreign oil. \nAnd to help keep our Nation's fiscal house in order, Bill led the fight \nto pass a landmark deficit reduction plan that put some brakes on \nmandatory Federal spending. Perhaps most importantly, Bill's leadership \nwas indispensable in helping place men and women on our Federal courts, \nincluding the United States Supreme Court, who will strictly interpret \nthe law rather than try to legislate from the bench.\n  During Bill's 12 years in the Senate, our Nation faced many \nchallenges and many changes. But Bill retained his strong sense of \ndirection, his dedication to reaching out to those most in need, and \nhis devotion to his family--Karyn, Harrison, Jonathan, and Bryan. As he \nhas done in medicine and in public service, I know that in future \nendeavors Bill will continue to serve and help his fellow man.\n\n\n                              George Allen\n\n  It has also been a privilege to serve alongside my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator George Allen. In the Senate, George built on an \nalready remarkable record of service to the people of Virginia, where \nhe served as a Member of the House of Delegates, a Member of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives and as one of the most respected and \nsuccessful Governors in the history of the Commonwealth.\n  As a Senator, George continued his common sense, ``Jeffersonian'' \nstyle of conservative leadership. He proved time and again that he is a \ntremendous ally of Virginia's defense communities and military \nfamilies. In 2005, George was a strong proponent of helping families of \nfallen soldiers by raising the death gratuity for next-of-kin from \n$12,000 to $100,000. And as a member of the Commerce Committee, George \nAllen was the Senate leader in working to maintain America's \ncompetitive advantage in technology and innovation. George founded the \nSenate Competitiveness Caucus to promote an agenda that ensures that \nthe United States continues to create high paying jobs and produce the \nvery best engineers and scientists in the world.\n  One of George's best attributes as a Senator was that he did more \nthan just talk the talk--George delivered real results. He advocated \nfor increased funding for math and science education, in particular at \nhistorically black colleges and other minority institutions. He has \nbeen a leader in the Senate on improving health savings accounts by \nincreasing the amount individuals can contribute each year to their \nHSAs, thus allowing them to save more money for current and future \nhealth care needs. George also secured more than $3.5 million in \nFederal funding for cutting-edge nanotechnology research and \ndevelopment. And he led the fight to ban Internet access taxes and make \nthe internet tax moratorium permanent, as he understands that saddling \nconsumers with high taxes will stifle innovation and expand the digital \ndivide.\n  Throughout his career, George Allen has served the people of Virginia \nwith courage and distinction, and he has provided a wonderful example \nfor public servants who follow in his footsteps. I wish all the best to \nGeorge, his dear wife Susan, and their three children.\n\n\n                              Conrad Burns\n\n  For the past 18 years, Montanans were extremely fortunate to be \nrepresented by Conrad Burns. There is no question that Conrad delivered \ntime and again for the people of his State.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Conrad secured \nmore than $2 billion in Federal funds for Montana. And as chairman of \nthe Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, he was a tireless \nadvocate of programs that benefit all Montanans, such as protecting \ndrinking water and defending his State's wilderness and wildlife. \nConrad also fought hard for Malmstrom Air Force Base and Montana's \nmilitary presence during the base realignment and closure process in \n2005.\n  As chairman of the communications subcommittee of the Commerce \nCommittee, Conrad fought for deregulation and new Internet and mobile \nphone technologies. And he worked to ensure that rural Montana \ncommunities have access to the technologies that will keep them \ncompetitive in today's global marketplace.\n\n  Throughout his time in the Senate, Conrad was a strong proponent of \ngovernment accountability, fiscal responsibility and lower taxes. He \nworked diligently to decrease America's dependence on foreign oil. And \nhe was an early backer of the Medicare prescription drug benefit that \nis now helping millions of seniors afford their medicines.\n  Conrad's legacy will live on, across Montana, and in the halls of the \nSenate, long after he has shut the door to his office. He leaves behind \nan extraordinary record of service to the people of his State. My \nwarmest wishes to my friend Conrad Burns, his wife Phyllis, and their \nfamily.\n\n\n                             Lincoln Chafee\n\n  Senator Lincoln Chaffee also will be greatly missed in this Chamber. \nlin served the people of Rhode Island with the utmost honor, integrity \nand compassion.\n  I have great respect for lin Chafee for his commitment to the \nprinciples of personal freedom, individual responsibility and fiscal \ndiscipline. Well-known for his reputation as a fierce deficit hawk, he \nhas been a vocal advocate for responsible government spending, and a \nstrong supporter of abolishing the marriage tax penalty and increasing \nthe child tax credit. Linc also took a very active interest in \npromoting the health care of women and children.\n  Lincoln Chafee also has been tirelessly dedicated to improving his \nhome state. As a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, he secured more than $1 billion in Federal funding for \nRhode Island's infrastructure, including the Warwick Station project \nand the development of the East Providence shoreline. And as chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife and Water, he worked \ndiligently to protect air and water quality in his State.\n  Linc was a principled, independent Member, adamant about doing what \nhe believed was right for the families he represented. Throughout his \nSenate career, he demonstrated a willingness to listen to all sides of \nan issue and work with members of both political parties. He is a man \nwho speaks his mind, votes his conscience, and treats others with the \ndignity and respect they deserve.\n  Linc is a refreshing politician, a diligent public servant, and a \ndevoted family man to his wife Stephanie and their three children. It \ngoes without saying that my colleagues in the Senate--and the people of \nRhode Island--will greatly miss Senator Lincoln Chafee.\n\n\n                              Mike De Wine\n\n  Among the Senate's most effective legislators, Senator Mike DeWine of \nOhio will use his many talents and expertise to tackle new endeavors. \nMike's career is truly an American success story. As a boy, he learned \nthe values of hard work and perseverance in the\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\nfields and the mill of his family's small agricultural business in \nYellow Springs, OH. It is those principles that have guided him \nthroughout a stellar career in public service, in which he has served \nas prosecutor, an Ohio State Senator, a Member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and as Lieutenant Governor.\n  As a Senator, Mike made his mark in a number of policy areas. He was \na strong proponent of education and children's health care. In \nparticular, he advocated for children's hospitals because he \nunderstands that these hospitals are important centers for pediatric \nresearch.\n  During more than a decade of service on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, Mike worked doggedly to investigate intelligence failures \nand revamp our intelligence community. As the chairman of the \nRetirement Security and Aging Subcommittee of the HELP Committee, he \nfocused his efforts on modernizing our Nation's pension system. And as \nthe first Ohio Senator in six decades to serve on the Appropriations \nCommittee, Mike was committed to ensuring that our Nation's first \nresponders have the resources they need. On the Judiciary Committee, \nMike took the lead on a number of antiterror and anticrime initiatives, \nsuch as the Patriot Act, as well as proposals to curb drunk driving, to \nhelp keep all Americans safe.\n  Perhaps what I admire most about Mike is that this terrific father of \neight, and grandfather of nine, always puts his family first. As a \npublic servant, Mike has used his positions to contribute to the \ngreater good, and he has brilliantly served the people of Ohio \nthroughout his career. May God bless Mike DeWine, his wife Fran, and \ntheir family for many, many years to come.\n\n\n                             Rick Santorum\n\n  It goes without saying that it pulls at my heartstrings to bid \nfarewell to Senator Rick Santorum. On issue after issue--tax relief, \neducation, affordable health care, national security Rick has stood \ntall for Pennsylvanians and all Americans.\n  Rick is a man of conviction, deep faith, and integrity--qualities \ninstilled in him growing up in Pennsylvania as the son of an Italian \nimmigrant. He doesn't beat around the bush, and you never have to \nwonder where he stands. His word is his bond, and he expresses his \nviews with great passion and expertise.\n  Since his early days in the Senate, Rick was an inspirational leader. \nOne of the qualities I admired most about him as a legislator was that \nhe never was one to dodge the tough issues; in fact, he readily took \nthe lead on those issues and set out to find solutions to very serious \nchallenges. For example, he spearheaded the passage of welfare reform \nin 1996, which to date has helped more than 1 million Americans go from \nreceiving welfare checks to paychecks. Rick fought hard for No Child \nLeft Behind, and as a result, today math and reading scores in \nPennsylvania schools are on the rise. He also fought hard to ensure \nthat all Pennsylvanians have access to high quality, affordable health \ncare. He is a strong supporter of Federal cancer research, including \nincreased funding for breast cancer research. And he led the charge to \nreform our medical malpractice laws to curb lawsuit abuse and ensure \nthat patients continue to receive the critical care they need. Rick \nalso recognizes that hard-earned dollars belong to families and small \nbusinesses, not Uncle Sam.\n  In addition, Rick was one of Congress's most dedicated and \nknowledgeable Members when it came to developing antipoverty \ninitiatives. He was the driving force behind legislation that would \nprovide a tremendous boost to charitable-giving through a series of \ntargeted tax incentives aimed at helping the homeless, the drug \naddicted, and the less fortunate in our society. And he committed \nhimself to working to eradicate the global HIV/AIDS pandemic. In short, \nRick Santorum is the embodiment of what it means to be a compassionate \nconservative.\n  Rick was so attentive to the needs of those he represented and always \nput Pennsylvania first. For example, he helped secure $100 million to \nbuild America's first ever coal to ultra-clean fuel plant in \nPennsylvania, which not only creates jobs but also provides more \naffordable energy and benefits the environment. I often joked with Rick \nthat he should hold another title, the ``Mayor of Pennsylvania.'' It's \nno surprise that he made it a point each year to visit all of \nPennsylvania's 67 counties. On so many issues, Rick has been a \nprincipled advocate for his constituents.\n\n  While Rick works incredibly hard, there is no question that he is \nfirst and foremost a dedicated family man to his wife Karen and their \nsix children. It has been a privilege indeed to work closely with \nRick--sometimes literally, as our offices were on the same hall. He is \nan all-around class act, and with his numerous accomplishments and \nexemplary record of service to his constituents, he will certainly be a \ntough act to follow.\n\n\n                               Jim Talent\n\n  Senator Jim Talent has been an outstanding representative of the \npeople of Missouri. A dedicated public servant, he served for 8 years \nin the State House of Representatives, as well as 8 years in the U.S. \nHouse. Jim was the lead author in the House of the landmark 1996 \nwelfare reform bill that has moved more than a million Americans off \nwelfare and into work and self-sufficiency.\n  Jim is man of impeccable character and a natural leader, and in the \nSenate he held a number of leadership posts in his freshman term--as \nthe chairman of the Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee, as the \nchairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Marketing, Inspection, and \nProduct Promotion, and as a deputy whip. He also demonstrated a \nremarkable ability to make things happen legislatively, with many of \nhis bills passed by Congress and signed into law. Jim's amazing \nlegislative record reflects not just his abilities but also the respect \nhe earned from his colleagues.\n  Jim delivered on his promises to Missourians to help create jobs, \ngrow the economy and strengthen our national defense. He also worked to \nimprove health care, and he advocated on behalf of those who suffer \nfrom sickle cell disease and breast cancer.\n  It has been my pleasure to serve with Jim on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. I have seen him in action and know that there is no \none more committed to ensuring that our country's defenses remain \nstrong. I was proud to work closely with him to enact legislation to \nprevent predatory lenders from targeting our brave men and women in \nuniform and their families. There is no question that he is a steadfast \nsupporter of our service members, their families, and their livelihood.\n  This Chamber needs more members like Jim, who understand that the \nonly way to really make a difference is to put partisan concerns aside \nand work across the aisle. Throughout his public service career, Jim \nTalent has certainly made a positive difference, and he will surely be \nmissed in the U.S. Senate.\n  As these men--Bill Frist, George Allen, Conrad Burns, Lincoln Chafee, \nMike DeWine, Rick Santorum and Jim Talent--conclude their service in \nthe U.S. Senate, let me say that I am so proud to have worked with \nindividuals of such character, strength, and intellect. Our Nation is \ngrateful for their many contributions. And as they each will \nundoubtedly continue to contribute to our country's greatness, their \nleadership and vision will be missed here in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S227-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S227-S228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       A TRAGIC LOSS FOR IDAHOANS\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

I had the pleasure of working with Dan \nin recent years as he promoted arts in Idaho and truly changed the face \nof the Idaho Commission on the Arts.

I respectfully submit a portion of his obituary, \nwritten by his good friend and fellow Idaho artist, Cort Conley, that \ndescribes, in detail, Dan's remarkable achievements in Idaho.\n\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\n\n       In November 2000, Dan was unanimously singled out from a \n     field of 36 distinguished candidates as the new executive \n     director of the Idaho Commission on the Arts. Although chosen \n     for his reputation and recognition earned elsewhere, he was \n     also selected for his optimistic, companionable disposition \n     and pragmatic views, his ability to build bridges and get \n     things done. Chair Marilyn Beck's estimate that he was the \n     perfect person for the job proved astute. He came to inhabit \n     Idaho arts the way paint does a painting. Dan thrived on the \n     lives and challenges around him on what is now called \n     networking. His attitude and leadership led to a legacy of \n     accomplishments on behalf of the arts in Idaho. Not a little \n     of it was his talent for consensus or accord, which he once \n     attributed to being the seventh of ten children: When you're \n     in a big family, you learn to negotiate for your life, he \n     quipped. While in Idaho, Dan served on the executive \n     committee of the board of directors for the National Assembly \n     of State Arts Agencies and was elected president in 2005. He \n     also served as trustee for the Western States Arts \n     Federation. Among the exceptional achievements of his legacy: \n     uniting the Idaho Congressional Delegation not only in \n     support of the budget for National Endowment for the Arts, \n     but for its first increased appropriation in over a decade; \n     bringing the annual conference of the National Assembly of \n     State Arts Agencies to Boise, 2005; statewide Arts Matter \n     conferences; pursuit of strategies for a cultural trust and \n     for art in public places; more recently, the unanimous \n     support of the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee and the \n     Idaho Legislature for a significant one-time increase in the \n     Commission s budget; and, finally, being awarded, in \n     memoriam, the Chairman's Medal from the chair of the NEA for \n     serving the National Endowment for the Arts and arts in \n     America with distinction.\n\n  I was glad to hear of the NEA Chairman's Medal that Dan's family will \nreceive on his behalf this month, but not the least bit surprised. I \nhad the opportunity to recognize Dan's remarkable abilities and \naccomplishments in this Chamber almost a year ago when he was chosen to \nbe president of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies. Dan fully \ndeserved this and all accolades that he received over the years. His \nlove of the arts, his work promoting their appreciation in Idaho and \nhis ability to provide leadership, vision, insight, and compassion \nlives on unmistakably in his legacy. Cort Conley concludes his tribute \nto Dan's life by stating:\n\n       In summary, then: love, laughter, courage. All estimable \n     indeed. Still, as a tombstone in County Kerry reads, ``Death \n     leaves a heartache no one can heal/Love leaves a memory no \n     one can steal.'' Nothing more appropriate can be said.\n\n  My wife Susan and I offer our condolences to his family and \nespecially to his young children, Hunter and Fiona, at this difficult \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S228-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PEACE OFFICER: KEN JORDAN\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise to praise the service of a \npolice officer from Colorado Springs: Officer Ken Jordan. Ken Jordan \nwas killed in the line of duty early last month during a traffic stop. \nHe was only 34.\n  As anyone in law enforcement can tell you, there is no such thing as \na ``routine'' traffic stop. Every time you pull a driver over, there is \nthe risk that something could go wrong, that this could be the one that \nproves too much for even your training and judgment. And yet, Ken \nJordan, like countless other peace officers around this Nation do every \nday, set these fears aside and carried out his job with professionalism \nand courage.\n  In the Colorado Springs Police Department, Officer Jordan was a DUI \nspecialist. His work removed unsafe drunk drivers from our roads, \nsaving lives every time he was on duty. He was an outstanding example \nof his job, known to sometimes have three or four suspects lined up at \nMemorial Hospital in Colorado Springs, waiting to be tested for their \nblood alcohol level.\n  Ken Jordan was a native of Chicago, and graduated from Western \nIllinois University, where he studied law enforcement. In 2000, he \njoined the Colorado Springs Police Department and called Colorado his \nhome.\n  Mr. President, I have every confidence that if Ken Jordan were here \nwith us today, he would undoubtedly tell us of his love for the \noutdoors and adventure sports. He reveled in the joys of life, be it \nkayaking in Fiji or playing pranks on family members. His smile was as \nbig as all the Rockies and just as ever-present.\n  One Denver police officer summed it up best: ``He was the person you \nwould want to have as a friend.''\n  Every time we lose a peace officer, our entire Nation grieves for \nthem, and for their families, and loved ones. To Officer Jordan's \nparents and sister Sue, and to his beloved Heidi, I know that no words \ncan ease the pain you feel at this difficult time. But through your \nsorrow, I hope that you can find solace in this police officers' \nprayer:\n\n       Lord I ask for courage,\n       Courage to face and conquer my own fears, Courage to take \n     me where others will not go.\n       I ask for strength,\n       Strength of body to protect others and strength of spirit \n     to lead others.\n       I ask for dedication,\n       Dedication to my job, to do it well, dedication to my \n     community, to keep it safe.\n       Give me Lord, concern\n       For others who trust me and compassion for those who need \n     me.\n       And please, Lord,\n       Through it all, be at my side.\n\n  Officer Ken Jordan's service to his community will always be honored \nand never forgotten. Our entire Nation stands humbled by his sacrifice, \nin awe of his courage, honor, and character.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S228-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO VERNON ASHLEY\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the many \nand great achievements of Vernon Ashley. Vernon proudly served his \ncountry in World War II and later went on to graduate from Dakota \nWesleyan College at the age of 34. He proceeded to be elected tribal \nchairman of the Crow Creek Indian Reservation and was later appointed \nSouth Dakota's Indian Affairs Coordinator under three different \nGovernors.\n  Mr. Ashley's achievements do not end there however. Vernon served as \nthe executive director for Vista for both North and South Dakota and \nsupervised all volunteer service during the recovery of the Rapid City \nflood disaster. Vernon was also a founding member of the American \nIndian Veterans Association and is a dedicated husband and the loving \nfather of seven.\n  Mr. President, today with Vernon's friends and family, I congratulate \nhim on his many and most recent accomplishments. I have known Vernon \nfor many years. He is a man of impeccable character and integrity. \nGovernor Rounds and the State legislature of South Dakota have rightly \ndeclared that in South Dakota, January 15, 2006, is Vernon Ashley Day. \nToday I join the Governor and members of the legislature in \ncongratulating this great American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S228-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to improve the disaster loan program of the Small \nBusiness Administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we all know, there was a tremendous \namount of criticism of the Federal Government's response to Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita last year. Things are better now and the region is \nslowly recovering. But, having just finished the 2006 hurricane season, \nand with the 2007 season a few months away, we must be sure that if we \nhave another disaster, the Federal Government's response will be better \nthis time around. Disaster response agencies have to be better \norganized, more efficient, and more responsive in order to avoid the \nproblems, the delays, mismanagement, and the seeming incompetence that \noccurred in 2005.\n  Today, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of legislation to \nimprove the disaster response of one agency that had a great deal of \nproblems last year, the Small Business Administration, SBA. This bill, \nthe ``Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act'' \nmakes major improvements to the SBA's disaster response and provides \nthem with essential tools to ensure that they are more efficient and \nbetter prepared for future disasters--big and small. I should also note \nthat this bill is a result of intensive bipartisan work over the past \ncouple of months and was introduced shortly before the 109th Congress \nadjourned as S. 4097. Unfortunately, there was no action on that bill \nso it must be reintroduced in the new Congress. I strongly believe \nthough we can secure passage during this Congress as the bill is \nreflective of the priorities from Senators Kerry and Snowe, \nrespectively, Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, as well as Senators Landrieu and Vitter. For my part, I have \nheard loud and clear from our impacted businesses that SBA reforms \nshould be implemented as soon as possible. That is why in September, I \nsent a letter to the new SBA Administrator Steve Preston, expressing \nconcerns on the lack of progress on SBA disaster reforms, which were \nincluded in S. 3778, the FY07 SBA Reauthorization bill reported out of \nthe Senate Small Business Committee. In this letter, I requested his \ncooperation, along with our committee to pass this important \nlegislation before Congress adjourns at the end of the year. The \nintroduction of this bill today, shows the progress that the committee \nmade since September on this issue. I hope that this spirit of \nbipartisanship continues into the 110th Congress and that I can \ncontinue to work with my colleagues on the Senate Small Business \nCommittee to reform SBA.\n\n  This legislation offers new tools to enhance SBA's disaster \nassistance programs. In every disaster, the SBA Disaster Loan program \nis a lifeline for businesses and homeowners who want to rebuild their \nlives after a catastrophe. When Hurricane Katrina hit, our businesses \nand homeowners had to wait months for loan approvals. I do not know how \nmany businesses we lost because help did not come in time. Because of \nthe scale of this disaster, what these businesses needed was immediate, \nshort-term assistance to hold them over until SBA was ready to process \nthe tens of thousands of loan applications it received.\n  That is why this legislation provides the SBA Administrator with the \nability to set up an expedited disaster assistance business loan \nprogram to make short-term, low-interest loans to keep them afloat. \nThese loans will allow businesses to make payroll, begin making \nrepairs, and address other immediate needs while they are awaiting \ninsurance payouts or regular SBA disaster loans. However, I realize \nthat every disaster is different and could range from a disaster on the \nscale of Hurricane Katrina or 9-11, to an ice storm or drought. This \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\ngives the SBA additional options and flexibility in the kinds of relief \nthey can offer a community. When a tornado destroys 20 businesses in a \nsmall town in the Midwest, SBA can get the regular disaster program up \nand running fairly quickly. You may not need short-term loans in this \ninstance. But if you know that SBA's resources would be overwhelmed by \na storm--just as they were initially with Hurricane Katrina--these \nexpedited business loans would be very helpful.\n  This legislation also would direct SBA to study ways to expedite \ndisaster loans for those businesses in a disaster area that have a \ngood, solid track record with the SBA or can provide vital recovery \nefforts. We had many businesses in the Gulf Coast that had paid off \nprevious SBA loans, were major sources of employment in their \ncommunities, but had to wait months for decisions on their SBA disaster \nloan applications. I do not want to get rid of the SBA's current \npractice of reviewing applications on a first-come first-served basis, \nbut there should be some mechanism in place for major disasters to get \nexpedited loans out the door to specific businesses that has a positive \nrecord with SBA or those that could serve a vital role in the recovery \nefforts. Expedited loans would jump-start impacted economies, get vital \ncapital out to businesses, and retain essential jobs following future \ndisasters.\n  This bill also makes an important modification to the collateral \nrequirements for disaster loans. The SBA cannot disburse more than \n$10,000 for an approved loan without showing collateral. This is to \nlimit the loss to the SBA in the event that a loan defaults. However, \nthis disbursement amount has not been increased since 1998 and these \ndays, $10,000 is not enough to get a business up and running. That is \nwhy this bill increases this collateral requirement to $14,000 and \ngives the Administrator the ability to increase that amount, in the \nevent of another large-scale disaster. I believe this is a reasonable \nand fiscally responsible increase, and at the same time gives the \nAdministrator flexibility for future disasters which will inevitably \noccur.\n  As you may know, I pushed to get language in the last Hurricane \nSupplemental Appropriations bill in June 2006 to require SBA to develop \na disaster plan and report to Congress on its contents by July 15, \n2006. SBA provided this status report in July and I am pleased that, \nsince then, SBA has been working on a comprehensive disaster response \nplan. That said, I believe that with the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season \nfast approaching, and other disasters possible before then, the SBA \nshould be looking at additional ways to improve upon this plan. This \nlegislation requires SBA to report to Congress, by March 15, 2007 on \nthe current status of its response plan and to provide us with a \nsnapshot of where they were with Hurricane Katrina and where they are \nnow. The report also requests SBA feedback on suggested improvements. \nThese improvements include better incorporating State disaster \nassistance efforts into SBA's response, as well as better coordination \nwith Federal response agencies like FEMA.\n  The Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act will \nprovide essential tools to make the SBA more proactive, flexible, and \nmost important, more efficient during future disasters. Again, I look \nforward to working with both Senator Snowe and Senator Kerry during \nthis new session of Congress to ensure that the SBA has everything it \nneeds to meet these goals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my September 27, 2006 letter \nto SBA be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 27, 2006.\n     Hon. Steven C. Preston,\n     Administrator, U.S. Small Business Administration, \n         Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Administrator Preston: Let me take this opportunity to \n     again congratulate you on your confirmation as Administrator \n     of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). Your \n     management experience and passion to serve will prove \n     extremely helpful to you in this challenging position.\n       I write you today because as a member of the Senate \n     Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, as well as \n     senator from a state hit hard by both Hurricanes Katrina, and \n     Rita. I believe it is my duty to ensure that we implement \n     substantive changes to SBA's Disaster Assistance Program \n     during this session of Congress.\n       The SBA's response to Katrina and Rita was too slow and \n     lacking in urgency--threatening the very survival of our \n     affected businesses. A year has passed since Hurricanes \n     Katrina and Rita, yet while Congress is currently acting on \n     extensive reforms for the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     (FEMA), there has been only incremental changes to SBA's \n     Disaster Assistance Program. That is why I am pleased to \n     learn that you have recently created the Accelerated Disaster \n     Response Initiative to identify and help implement process \n     improvements to enable the SBA to respond more quickly in \n     assisting small businesses and homeowners in need of \n     assistance after a disaster. I applaud these efforts and your \n     leadership on this issue. But much more must be done to \n     address the systemic problems that led to delays and inaction \n     post-Katrina and Rita.\n       For our part, the Senate is also attempting to address the \n     multiple problems that hampered SBA's ability to assist \n     impacted Gulf Coast small businesses and homeowners. Under \n     the leadership of the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate \n     Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, Senators \n     Snowe and Kerry, the committee voted unanimously to approve \n     S. 3778, the ``Small Business Reauthorization and \n     Improvements Act of 2006'' and sent it to the full Senate for \n     consideration. A copy of the bill is attached for your \n     convenience. This bipartisan legislation reauthorizes SBA \n     programs, and also of great importance to me and my \n     constituents, makes essential reforms to SBA's Disaster \n     Assistance Program. However, since S. 3778 was introduced on \n     August 2, 2006, almost nine weeks ago, it has been blocked \n     from consideration and the Committee is still waiting for \n     budget information so that it may file its report on the \n     bill. It is my understanding that the administration and SBA \n     has several concerns about this bill in its current form.\n       I am very concerned at this apparent deadlock, a deadlock \n     which threatens our bipartisan efforts to implement \n     comprehensive SBA Disaster Assistance reforms before the end \n     of the year. In particular, I believe that there must be SBA \n     reforms in the following areas:\n       Short-Term Assistance: Following Katrina and Rita small \n     businesses waited, on average, four to six months for \n     approvals and disbursements on SBA Disaster Loans, In order \n     to ensure the long-term survival of small businesses impacted \n     by a catastrophic disaster, SBA needs to be in the business \n     of short-term recovery--by providing either emergency bridge \n     loans or grants.\n       Disaster Loan Process for Homeowners: While SBA's mission \n     is to ``aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is \n     possible, the interests of small business concerns'' it also \n     has the added responsibility of helping affected homeowners \n     rebuild their housing post-disaster. Katrina and Rita \n     resulted in record numbers of SBA Disaster Loan applications \n     from homeowners, which strained SBA's existing resources and \n     personnel. If the SBA must bear this responsibility, the \n     agency should improve the process as well as possibly seek \n     greater coordination and cooperation with the U.S. Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development on disaster housing \n     assistance.\n       Expedited Disaster Loans to Businesses: The SBA currently \n     has no mechanism in place to expedite Disaster Loans to \n     impacted businesses that are either a major source of \n     employment or that can demonstrate a vital contribution to \n     recovery efforts in the area, such as businesses who \n     construct housing, provide building materials, or conduct \n     debris removal. The SBA needs the ability to fast-track loans \n     to these businesses, in order to jumpstart local economies \n     and recovery efforts.\n       Economic Injury Disaster Loans: Although Katrina and Rita \n     directly affected businesses along the Gulf Coast, additional \n     businesses in the region, as well as the rest of the country, \n     were economically impacted by the storms. The SBA must have \n     the ability to provide nationwide, or perhaps regional, \n     economic injury disaster loans to businesses which can \n     demonstrate economic distress or disruption from a future \n     major disaster.\n       Loss Verification and Loan Processing: Following the Gulf \n     Coast hurricanes, the SBA struggled for months to hire enough \n     staff to inspect losses and process loan applications. \n     Although SBA now has trained reserves to handle such surges \n     in demand, the SBA also needs the permanent authority to \n     enter into agreements with qualified private lenders and \n     credit unions to process Disaster Loans and provide loss \n     verification services.\n       Administrator Preston, I was impressed by your expressed \n     willingness to be a bridge between Congress and the White \n     House. For the SBA to truly bring its disaster capabilities \n     to the next level, I believe that it must work in concert \n     with the Congress. Together, we must remove layers of \n     bureaucracy and red tape, which, following Katrina and Rita, \n     both overwhelmed and frustrated dedicated SBA employees and \n     those affected by the hurricanes. We must also give the SBA \n     new tools to ensure that problems that occurred post-Katrina \n     and Rita never happen again.\n       Last month we marked the one-year anniversary of Hurricane \n     Katrina, and now mark the one-year anniversary of Hurricane \n     Rita. It is essential that we take action now to make \n     substantive reforms to the SBA Disaster Assistance Program. \n     We owe nothing less to our small businesses. I ask that you \n     continue working with my office on this important issue and \n     respond to our approach in\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\n     writing no later than October 31, 2006. This will help us \n     develop a proposal which can address the concerns of the SBA \n     as well as provide a better and more responsive SBA Disaster \n     Assistance Program for our Small businesses.\n       Thank you in advance for your assistance with this request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary L.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 1300 North Frontage Road West in Vail, Colorado, as \nthe ``Gerald R. Ford, Jr. Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, as my good friend and colleague from \nColorado just mentioned, we are introducing S. 194 naming the post \noffice in Vail, CO, after former President Gerald R. Ford. As this vote \njust showed, we are all aware that when Gerald Ford passed away last \nmonth, our country lost a great man. Much has been said recently about \nPresident Ford: How he selflessly came to the aid of this country in \none of its most trying times, how he governed through his beliefs about \nwhat was the best decision for the Nation regardless of the personal \nconsequences, and his lifelong pursuit of bipartisanship and debate.\n  The defining characteristic of President Ford was his ability to \nremain humble and a man of the people. As testimonies poured in across \nthe Nation, we were reminded about how he played selflessly as center \nat the University of Michigan, worked as a busboy while attending law \nschool, and often hosted barbecues for his neighbors at his home in \nAlexandria, VA, while serving as House minority leader.\n  President Ford's charm and likability were shown all over the \ncountry, but away from his home State and the microscope of Washington, \nDC, Gerald Ford and his family also touched Colorado. As a Congressman \nfrom Michigan, the Ford family visited Colorado to ski in 1968 and \nsince then have remained a constant presence in that community. He \nskied there, he built a house in nearby Beaver Creek, and he hosted a \ngolf tournament for 20 years.\n  Following President Ford's passing, more than 2,500 people gathered \nat the base of Vail Mountain to witness a touching tribute to the \nPresident that included 500 ski instructors and a torchlight parade on \nVail's Golden Peak. In Vail, like many other communities, President \nFord was regarded as a tremendous asset and a man who treated everyone \nas an equal. Several residents remarked that one would never know he \nwas a former President.\n  As a lasting tribute to this tremendous man, I cannot think of a more \nappropriate honor than to have Vail's post office bear the name of \nGerald R. Ford, Jr. A post office is the point in every community that \nbrings all people together, and there is no better way to symbolize the \nvirtues President Ford demonstrated through his public and private \nlife. I encourage the Senate to pass legislation entitled ``Senate Bill \n194'' in recognition of President Ford and his contributions to Vail, \nCO.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of a bill \nthat will be introduced by Senator Allard and myself to name the post \noffice in Vail, CO, after President Gerald R. Ford.\n  I call myself fortunate because I worked with President Ford. In our \nbrief time together, it was obvious to me he was a man of honor, \nintegrity, and courage.\n  Gerald Ford was a man who loved the State of Colorado, who loved its \npeople and its culture. So it is a fitting tribute that the post office \nin his adopted town of Vail should bear his name.\n  President Ford led a remarkable life--remarkable not only for his \ngreat success but for the humility, dignity, and candor which were the \nhallmarks of his career. And what a career it was: from the University \nof Michigan to Yale Law School to service in the Navy to a leadership \nposition in the U.S. Congress, and eventually, of course, to the \nPresidency of these United States, to say nothing of a long and \nproductive post-Presidential career.\n  Of course, it is his time in the White House which people will \nremember most, and for good reason. It was President Ford who, through \nhis leadership, brought the country together during a time of crisis. \nHe was not only the right man at the right time for a very difficult \njob, he was a perfect man to deal with circumstances, the likes of \nwhich this country had never seen.\n  But I will remember President Ford not only for his good deeds in \npublic office but for his unending commitment to justice and equality \nwell after he left the White House behind. In 1999, when our shared \nalma mater, the University of Michigan, had its diversity policies \nchallenged in court, President Ford wrote an op-ed piece in the New \nYork Times about diversity, and he talked about an inclusive America \nwhich was essential to the future and the strength of the United \nStates. In his op-ed piece, which was widely circulated, about which he \nand I spent time talking one day, he wrote the following:\n\n       Of all the triumphs that have marked this as America's \n     century--breathtaking advances in science and technology, the \n     democratization of wealth and dispersal of political powers \n     in ways hardly imaginable in 1899--none is more inspiring, if \n     incomplete, than our pursuit of racial justice.\n\n  President Ford bravely defended the University of Michigan's \ndiversity program with the same elegance and bravery with which he \nconfronted the tribulations of the Watergate era and, in the process, \nleft behind a legacy of tolerance and justice which will not soon be \nforgotten.\n  Of course, no tribute to President Ford would be complete without \nmention of his extraordinary family, particularly his wife, Betty, and \nas President Ford famously said:\n\n       I am indebted to no man, and only to one woman--to my dear \n     wife.\n\n  Betty Ford's bravery and her candor has inspired millions upon \nmillions of Americans, and we are grateful for her service, and we wish \nher and the Ford family the very best.\n  The people of Colorado thank Gerald Ford for his service, and we are \nproud to move forward in helping the post office in Vail, CO, bear his \nname.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 196. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to deny Federal \nretirement benefits to individuals convicted of certain offenses, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Salazar and I are the \nCongressional Pension Accountability Act legislation to deny Federal \npensions to Members of Congress who are convicted of white collar crime \nsuch as bribery. A similar provision passed the House of \nRepresentatives during the 109th Congress. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to include this legislation in the ethics reform \nlegislation to be considered by the Senate this week.\n  I strongly believe that all Members of Congress must be held to the \nhighest ethical standards and those who violate the public trust must \nbe held accountable for their actions. Last year, a series of scandals \nexposed Washington lobbyists and Members of Congress who used undue and \nimproper influence to represent special interests in their dealings \nwith the Federal Government.\n  In 2005, the now infamous Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff pleaded \nguilty to conspiracy, mail fraud and tax evasion charges in a plea \nagreement. The Justice Department is currently investigating his \nattempts to influence Federal Government policy in both Congress and \nthe Executive Branch.\n  Last November, Representative Bob Ney resigned from the House of \nRepresentatives after pleading guilty to conspiracy and making false \nstatements. In a plea agreement, former Representative Ney acknowledged \ntaking trips, tickets, meals and campaign donations from Mr. Abramoff \nin return for taking official actions on behalf of Abramoff clients.\n  In March 2002, Representative Ney inserted an amendment in the Help \nAmerica Vote Act to lift an existing Federal ban against commercial \ngaming by a Texas Native American tribal client of Abramoff. In return, \nRepresentative Ney received all-expense-paid and reduced-price trips to \nScotland to play golf, a trip to New Orleans\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\nto gamble and a vacation in Lake George, NY, all courtesy of Mr. \nAbramoff.\n  In the largest bribery case in the Congress since the 1980s, \nRepresentative Randy ``Duke'' Cunningham recently resigned from the \nHouse of Representatives after pleading guilty in Federal court to \nreceiving $2.4 million in bribes from military contractors and evading \nmore than $1 million in taxes. In a plea agreement, former \nRepresentative Cunningham admitted to a pattern of bribery lasting \nclose to 5 years, with Federal contractors giving him Persian rugs, a \nRolls-Royce, and antique furniture and paying for travel and hotel \nexpenses, use of a yacht and a lavish graduation party for his \ndaughter.\n  These stories are outrageous and they sicken me. As elected \nrepresentatives, we must hold ourselves and all those who represent the \nFederal Government to the highest ethical standards. The principle is a \nsimple one: Public servants who abuse the public trust and are \nconvicted of ethics crimes should not collect taxpayer fmanced \npensions.\n  Under current law, former Representatives Cunningham, Ney and others \nconvicted of serious ethics abuses will receive a Congressional pension \nof approximately $40,000 per year--paid for by American taxpayers. Only \na conviction for a crime against the United States, such as treason or \nespionage, will cost a Member of Congress their pension. This law must \nbe changed to ensure that Congress does not reward unethical behavior.\n  The Congressional Pension Accountability Act will bar Members of \nCongress from receiving taxpayer-funded retirement benefits after they \nhave been convicted of bribery, conspiracy, perjury or other serious \nethics offenses.\n  It is my understanding that there is some concern about how this \nlegislation may affect innocent spouses and children of Members of \nCongress who lose their pensions as a result of this legislation. Even \nafter this legislation is enacted, the Member will still receive a \nrefund of all contributions into either the Federal Employees \nRetirement System (FERS) or the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) \nand will retain all benefits from the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).\n  The Congressional Pension Accountability Act is supported by the \nNational Taxpayers Union and a similar provision is supported by \nTaxpayers for Common Sense, the Family Research Council and Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste.\n  Together we can significantly improve our government by changing the \nway business is done in Washington. I believe this legislation will \nhelp ensure that our government once again responds to the needs of our \npeople, not special interests. I ask all my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 198. A bill to improve authorities to address urgent \nnonproliferation crises and United States nonproliferation operations; \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction Act of 2007. This legislation is based on \na bill I first offered in 2005. It is focused on facilitating \nimplementation of the Nunn-Lugar program and removing some of the self-\nimposed restrictions that complicate or delay the destruction of \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  In 2005, the Senate approved this legislation in the form of an \namendment I offered to the National Defense Authorization Act by an \noverwhelming vote of 78 to 19. Last year, the Senate adopted a similar \namendment by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, these provisions were \nnot included in either conference agreement.\n  While well-intentioned, the congressionally-imposed conditions on \nNunn-Lugar have inhibited the amount of work that can be done to \neliminate and safeguard weapons of mass destruction in the former \nSoviet Union. Each year, a six month, thirteen step certification and \nwaiver process must be completed before appropriated funds can be \nobligated to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. This annual process \nwastes money and valuable time--time lost in the fight against \nproliferation. In the field, it can prevent the availability of funds \nalready authorized and appropriated by Congress for the Nunn-Lugar \nProgram, thus delaying critical dismantlement work.\n  To date, the Nunn-Lugar program has deactivated for destroyed: 6, 934 \nnuclear warheads; 637 ICBMs; 485 ICBM silos; 81 ICBM mobile missile \nlauchers; 155 bombers; 906 nuclear air-to-surface missiles; 436 \nsubmarine missile launchers; 601 submarine launched missiles; 30 \nnuclear submarines; and 194 nuclear test tunnels.\n  Perhaps most importantly, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan emerged \nfrom the Soviet Union as the 3rd, 4th, and 8th largest nuclear weapons \npowers in the world. Today, all three are nuclear weapons free as a \nresult of cooperative efforts under the Nunn-Lugar program.\n  The Nunn-Lugar Program currently has a permanent waiver authority, to \nbe used on an annual basis, for the congressionally-imposed \ncertifications on the Nunn-Lugar program. While the waiver permits the \nprogram to continue its important work, the waiver does not solve the \nunderlying problem.\n  In 1991, concerns surrounding Russian commitments to nonproliferation \nled the original Nunn-Lugar legislation to require President to certify \nannually that each recipient is ``committed to'' meeting six \nconditions: 1. Making a substantial investment in dismantling or \ndestroying such weapons; 2. forgoing any military modernization program \nthat exceeds legitimate defense requirements and forgoing the \nreplacement of destroyed weapons of mass destruction; 3. forgoing any \nuse of fissionable and other components of destroyed nuclear weapons in \nnew nuclear weapons; 4. facilitating United States verification of \nweapons destruction carried out under the program; 5. complying with \nall relevant arms control agreements; and 6. observing internationally \nrecognized human rights, including the protection of minorities.\n  At the time, these conditions were important to defining the U.S. \nstrategic relationship with each Nunn-Lugar recipient. The question we \nmust answer today is, what national security benefit do the \ncertification requirements provide the American people? Do the \nconditions make it easier or harder to eliminate weapons of mass \ndestruction in Russia or elsewhere? Do the conditions make it more \nlikely or less likely that weapons are eliminated?\n  Congress imposed an additional six conditions on construction of the \nchemical weapons destruction program at Shchuchye. These conditions \ninclude: 1. Full and accurate Russian declaration on the size of its \nchemical weapons stockpile; 2. allocation by Russia of at least \n$25,000,000 to chemical weapons elimination; 3. development by Russia \nof a practical plan for destroying its stockpile of nerve agents; 4. \nenactment of a law by Russia that provides for the elimination of all \nnerve agents at a single site; 5. an agreement by Russia to destroy or \nconvert its chemical weapons production facilities at Volgograd and \nNovocheboksark; and 6. a demonstrated commitment from the international \ncommunity to fund and build infrastructure needed to support and \noperate the facility.\n  Some will suggest that the certification process is, at most, an \nannoyance, but not a serious programmatic threat. I disagree. While \nwell intentioned, these conditions delay and complicate efforts to \ndestroy weapons of mass destruction. If the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction is the number one national security threat facing our \ncountry, we cannot permit any delays in our response.\n  The Bush Administration withheld Russia's certification in 2002 \nbecause of concerns in the chemical and biological weapon arenas. \nPresident Bush recognized the predicament and requested waiver \nauthority for the Congressionally-imposed conditions. While awaiting \ntemporary waiver to be authorized in law, new Nunn-Lugar projects were \nstalled and no new contracts were finalized between April 16 to August \n9, 2002. This delay caused numerous disarmament projects in Russia to \nbe put on hold, including: 1. Installation of security enhancements at \nten nuclear weapons storage sites; 2. initiation of the dismantlement \nof two strategic missile submarines and thirty submarine-launched \nballistic missiles; and 3. initiation of the dismantlement of SS-24 \nrail-mobile and SS-25 road-mobile ICBMs and launchers. Clearly,\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\nthese projects were in the national security interest of the United \nStates, but they were delayed because of self-imposed conditions and \nbureaucratic red tape. A second period of delay began on October 1, \n2002, with the expiration of a temporary waiver. Again, U.S. national \nsecurity suffered with the postponement of critical dismantlement and \nsecurity activities for some six weeks until Congress acted.\n\n  The events of 2002 are not the exceptions: They are the rule. In some \nyears, Nunn-Lugar funds are not available for expenditure until more \nthan half of the fiscal year has passed, and weapons of mass \ndestruction slated for dismantlement await the U.S. bureaucratic \nprocess. This means that the program is denied access to these funds \nfor large portions of the fiscal year in which they were intended to be \nspent while critical nonproliferation projects are put on hold. The \nbureaucracy generates reams of paper and yet ultimately produces an \noutcome that was never in doubt; namely, that it is in the national \nsecurity interests of the United States to eliminate weapons of mass \ndestruction in Russia and elsewhere.\n  The certification and waiver processes consume hundreds of man-hours \nof work by the State Department, the Intelligence Community, the \nPentagon, as well as other departments and agencies. This time could be \nbetter spent tackling the proliferation threats facing our country. \nInstead of interdicting WMD shipments, identifying the next AQ Khan, or \nlocating hidden stocks of chemical and biological weapons, our \nnonproliferation experts spend their time compiling reports and \nassembling certification or waiver determinations. Even more \nfrustrating is the fact that the majority of these reports are \nrepetitive, in that the Department of State already reports on most of \nthese issues in other formats.\n  Some will argue that the certification process provides the \nAdministration with leverage on Russian behavior. I disagree. I do not \nbelieve any of the certification subjects are a good reason to stop the \ndestruction and safeguarding of weapons of mass destruction. I would \nargue just the opposite; these are reasons for us to accelerate our \nefforts and become more vigilant in our approach.\n  These programmatic delays have given Russia, and others, cover to \nhide behind, pointing the finger of blame on the United States for slow \nprogram implementation and taking the spotlight off their failure to \nprovide access and transparency. While we call on President Putin to \nspeed up dismantlement and open more sites for security upgrades, \ncongressionally-imposed conditions and funding delays are used as \narguments against accelerating Nunn-Lugar projects.\n  I have concluded that despite the best intentions of Congress, the \ncertification requirements on the Nunn-Lugar program have outlasted \ntheir utility. While the goals of the conditions are pure, they simply \ndo not belong on nonproliferation programs. I would point out that the \nequally important nonproliferation programs at the Departments of \nEnergy and State do not have these conditions. They do not suffer from \nthe annual certification and waiver process. Why should the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram, focused on the dismantlement of nuclear, chemical and \nbiological weapons, be singled out for this treatment or need for \nleverage.\n  I am pleased that a number of administration officials and groups \nhave endorsed the elimination of the certification and waiver process. \nThe 9/11 Commission Report weighed in with an important endorsement of \nthe Nunn-Lugar program, saying that ``Preventing the proliferation of \n[weapons of mass destruction] warrants a maximum effort--by \nstrengthening counter-proliferation efforts, expanding the \nProliferation Security Initiative, and supporting the Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program.'' The Report went on to say that ``Nunn-Lugar \n. . . is now in need of expansion, improvement and resources.'' More \nrecently, the follow-on 9/11 Public Discourse Project wrote that the \nelimination of the certification requirements ``is an important step \nforward in protecting the United States against catastrophic attack.''\n  Secretary Rice has testified that the Administration strongly \nsupports my efforts pointing out that ``flexibility in being able to \nadminister the program would be most welcome.'' Bob Joseph, the Under \nSecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, also \nexpressed his support saying pointedly to me that ``the fact that there \nare 13 steps that can take . . . six months or longer to get through \ncertainly . . . underlines the rationale for [this legislation] . . . \nWhatever we can do, Senator, to improve the efficiency of the process, \nto reduce the time lines involved, and to provide greater flexibility \nfor action, I would be in favor of.''\n  Charles Boyd, USAF (Ret.) and Stanley Weiss, the Chief Executive \nOfficer and Chairman, respectively, of the Business Executives for \nNational Security, wrote to the Armed Services Committees of the House \nand Senate expressing support for the elimination of the certification \nrequirements on the Nunn-Lugar program. They wrote in part: ``Even \nthough conditions can be waived, doing so diverts time and effort that \ncould otherwise be used to meet proliferation challenges. Relying on \nwaivers also preserves the risk that funding delays could threaten \nexisting projects and investments.''\n  In sum, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the \nnumber one national security threat facing the United States today. The \nNunn-Lugar program is making tremendous contributions to the \nelimination of potentially vulnerable stockpiles. While the Congress' \nintentions in imposing annual certification requirements were pure, the \nprocess has evolved into a bureaucratic quagmire in to which months of \nwork by numerous departments, agencies and bureaus are sunk. The \nAdministration toils to produce a forgone conclusion; namely, that it \nis in U.S. interests to eliminate and secure weapons and materials of \nmass destruction. The funds for these operations are delayed while \nthreats remain unaddressed. This is red-tape that we can do without. \nThe only practical effect is unnecessary delays to our response to the \nnumber one national security threat facing the United States.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Amendments of 1996 to \nmodify the grant program to improve sanitation in rural and Native \nvillages in the State of Alaska; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nallow the Environmental Protection Agency to continue to provide grant \nfunding and technical assistance to remote communities in Alaska for \ncritical water and sewer projects. These remote communities are only \naccessible by either aircraft or boat.\n  This important funding was originally authorized as part of the Safe \nDrinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 and was reauthorized in 2000. \nEvery fiscal year, the EPA transfers funding authorized by this program \nto the State of Alaska's Village Safe Water Program, which is managed \nby the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation.\n  The water and sewer conditions in the villages in Alaska that still \nneed this critical funding rival the conditions in rural communities in \nthird world countries. For example, residents in some villages in \nAlaska have to go to a central source in the community to get fresh \nwater. Instead of flushing toilets, residents of some villages have to \nuse a device called a ``honeybucket.'' This device is a large bucket \nwith a toilet seat on top. When the honeybucket is full, it is usually \ndumped in a lagoon or on land. Sometimes, these dump locations are near \nsources of drinking water.\n  The Village Safe Water program has been a success over the years. \nMany homes in Alaska's remote communities now have plumbing due to \nfunds authorized by this program. However, 34 percent of homes in these \ncommunities still do not have indoor plumbing. It is unacceptable that \nthese Americans still do not have access to conventional plumbing in \ntheir homes in 2007.\n  Previously, the Office of Management and Budget published a Program \nAssessment Rating Tool report concerning this program. This report \nfound several deficiencies concerning the administration of this \nprogram. In response to that report, the Alaska Department of \nEnvironmental Conservation has put in place several changes to correct \nthese deficiencies, including hiring additional accounting staff and \ninitiating a memorandum of understanding with EPA Region 10 regarding \nprogram procedures and requirements.\n  This legislation reauthorizes the program through fiscal year 2010 \nand increases the authorized funding level from $40 million to $42 \nmillion, a modest five percent increase. Also, the legislation requires \nthe State of Alaska to mandate that grant recipients clearly identify \nthe scope and the goal of the project for which funding is sought and \nhow the funds will be used to meet the specific, stated goal of the \nproject; establish long-term goals for the program and carry out \nregular reviews of grantees to determine if the stated scope and goal \nof each grant are being met. This bill also requires the State of \nAlaska to submit an annual report to the EPA that addresses these \nissues. If a project-specific problem included in the report is not \nrectified within an amount of time agreed to by the State of Alaska and \nthe EPA or if both entities are not able to agree on a timetable to fix \nthe problem, the EPA will not disburse any additional funding for the \nproject in question.\n  It is imperative that we reauthorize this critically important \nprogram soon. The health and well-being of rural Alaskans is at stake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 200. A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior, acting \nthrough the Bureau of Reclamation and the United States Geological \nSurvey, to conduct a study on groundwater resources in the State of \nAlaska, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in 2005 I first introduced a measure of \nbenefit to my home State of Alaska, the Alaska Water Resources Act, for \na number of reasons. While the bill easily passed the U.S. Senate in \n2005, it did not complete its journey to final passage, which is why I \nam reintroducing the bill today. The importance of water resource data \ncollection to a State that has a resource-based economy cannot be \noverstated. Economic development is predicated on access to an adequate \nwater supply, and in my State there is inadequate hydrologic data upon \nwhich to secure both economic development and the health and welfare of \nAlaskan citizens.\n  Alaska is an amazing State from a hydrological viewpoint. It is home \nto more than 3 million lakes--only about 100 being larger than 10 \nsquare miles--more than 12,000 rivers and uncounted thousands of \nstreams, creeks and ponds. Together these water bodies hold about one-\nthird of all the fresh water found in the United States.\n  Alaska is home to a number of large rivers. The Yukon, which \noriginates in western Canada, runs 1,400 miles--discharging from 25,000 \ncubic feet of water per second in early spring to more than 600,000 \ncubic feet per second in May during the spring thaw. The Yukon drains \nroughly 330,000 square miles of Alaska and Canada, about one-third of \nthe State. Besides the Yukon, Alaska is home to nine other major rivers \nand creeks all running more than 300 miles in length: the Porcupine, \nKoyukuk, Kuskokwim, Tanana, Innoko, Colville, Noatak, Kobuk and Birch \nCreek.\n  Alaska residents from early spring to fall face substantial flood \nthreats, from spring flooding caused by breakup and ice damming to \nfall's heavy rains, but the State has fewer than 100 stream gaging \nstations operated by the U.S. Geological Survey--Alaska having less \nthan 10 percent of the stream flow information that is taken for \ngranted by all other States in the Nation. Alaska averages one working \ngage for each 10,000 square miles, while, as an example, Pacific \nNorthwest States average one gage for each 365 square miles. To \nemphasize the lack of data now available for Alaska, I would point out \nthat to equal the stream gage density of the Pacific Northwest States \nmy State would need to have over 1,600 total gage sites.\n  Alaska also supports the Nation's least modern and undeveloped \npotable water distribution system. Water for Alaska towns outside of \nthe more densely populated ``Railbelt'' comes predominately from \ngroundwater sources. Surface water sources often result in supply/\nstorage problems since these surface sources freeze and are not readily \navailable for up to half of the year. The chances for water-borne \ncontaminants to affect potable water supplies, including fecal matter \nfrom Alaska's plentiful wildlife populations, human waste from inquate \nor nonexistent sewage treatment facilities, and natural mineral \ndeposits, natural arsenic levels in mineralized zone creeks frequently \nexceeding EPA standards) are present and increasing. In areas that \npredominately depend on groundwater sources, such as the ``Railbelt'' \nthere is only very limited knowledge of the nature and extent of \naquifers that support those critical groundwater supplies. Extensive \npermafrost further complicates the potential for adverse impacts to \nAlaska. In portions of Southcentral Alaska where there is a dependence \non groundwater as the source for an adequate healthy water supply, the \navailability of that supply is starting to be in jeopardy. Allocations \nof water need to be based on scientific data, and the data needed upon \nwhich the allocations are made is unavailable. Users of water are only \nbeginning to realize the potential conflicts that may arise, and the \nlimits on future economic development that may result from inadequate \nknowledge of the water resource, particularly in the Matanuska-Susitna \nBorough, on the Kenai Peninsula, and to a lesser extent in portions of \nthe municipality of Anchorage and in the Fairbanks area, where \ngroundwater provided by wells is a crucial part of the State's water \ndistribution system, and where there is little known about the size, \ncapacity, extent and recharge capability of the aquifers that these \nwells tap.\n\n[[Page S240]]\n\n  Alaska, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental \nConservation, still has some 16,000 homes in 71 generally Native \nvillages not being served by piped water or enclosed water haul \nsystems. There are still 55 villages in Alaska where up to 29 percent \nof the residents are not served by sanitary water systems, with more \nthan 60 percent of residents not being served in 16 villages. Even \nthough, since statehood in 1959, the State and Federal governments have \nspent $1.3 billion on rural water-sanitation system improvements, the \nState still has an estimated need for nearly $650 million in additional \nfunding to complete installation of a modern water-sanitation system.\n  Planning and engineering for those locations cannot be easily \ncompleted without better information as to the availability and extent \nof supply of water and better analysis of new technologies that could \nbe used for water system installations, including possible desalination \nfor some island and coastal communities.\n  For all these reasons today I have reintroduced legislation \nauthorizing the Department of the Interior's Commissioner of \nReclamation and the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to conduct a \nseries of water resource studies in Alaska. The studies will include a \nsurvey of water treatment needs and technologies, including \ndesalination treatment, which may be applicable to water resources \ndevelopments in Alaska. The study will review the need for enhancement \nof the National Streamflow Information Program administered by the U.S. \nGeological Survey. The Streamflow review will determine whether more \nstream gaging stations are necessary for flood forecasting, aiding \nresource extraction, determining the risk to the state's transportation \nsystem, and for wildfire management. Groundwater resources will also be \nfurther evaluated and documented to determine the availability of \nwater, the quality of that groundwater, and the extent of the aquifers \nin some urban areas.\n  This type of study, already conducted for most all other States in \nthe Nation, should help Alaska better plan and design water systems and \ntransportation infrastructure and also better prepare for floods and \nsummer wildfires.\n  There is literally ``water, water everywhere'' in Alaska, but too \noften, especially in communities such as Ketchikan that take water from \nsurface sources, or the rapidly growing Mat-Su Valley where there may \nbe less water to drink during unusually dry summers, there is a real \nand growing problem of maintaining an adequate healthy supply of pure \nwater. This problem is only going to grow more severe with a growing \npopulation and economy. This bill is designed to provide more \ninformation to help communities plan for future water needs and to help \nState officials plan for flood and fire safety concerns and further \neconomic development.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 205. A bill to grant rights-of-way for electric transmission lines \nover certain Native allotments in the State of Alaska; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President. Today I reintroduce legislation which \nwill resolve an ongoing dispute in my State concerning rights of way in \nthe Copper River Valley region.\n  In the 109th Congress, both the Senate and House of Representatives \nheld hearings on this bill. It is my hope that we can move this \nimportant legislation quickly through the Senate.\n  When Congress attempted to settle outstanding land claims in Alaska, \nit unintentionally created a land dispute between Native allotees and \nutility companies. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Federal Government and \nthe State of Alaska granted rights of way to the Copper Valley Electric \nAssociation to run power lines across areas in our state that were \nlater claimed by Alaska Natives. These rights were conveyed before \nAlaska Native allotment claims had been filed and processed.\n  In 1980, Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act in 1980, which legislatively ratified native allotment \nland claims subject to the valid existing rights of other land holders. \nHowever, several Native allottees challenged the existing rights of \nother land holders and claimed that the Copper Valley Electric \nAssociation was trespassing on their lands. In 1987, the Department of \nInterior's Interior Board of Land Appeals affirmed this position, \nfinding native allotees have priority over other competing uses of \nland--in this case, those of the utility company--regardless of the \nfact that the rights of way were granted prior to the conveyance of the \nproperty in question to the allotees. This situation is still \nunresolved and has resulted in years of litigation.\n  We have been unable to settle these disputes through existing \nremedies. These conflicts now jeopardize existing transportation and \nutility corridors and threaten future infrastructure development in the \nregion.\n  At my request, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed \nthis situation. The GAO issued its report and recommended solutions. \nThis bill incorporates the GAO's recommendation. It compensates the \nowners of the Native allotments, while ensuring that the utility \ncompanies are able to provide residents with the infrastructure and \nservices they need. I believe this is the most equitable solution \navailable, and I urge the Senate to pass this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S240-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 21--RECOGNIZING THE UNCOMMON VALOR OF WESLEY AUTREY \n                         OF NEW YORK, NEW YORK\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Schumer) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I direct to the attention of all Senators \nthat tomorrow afternoon Senators who have amendments to the ethics \nlobbying earmark reform legislation, S. 1, be prepared to start \noffering them. We are going to work until we complete this legislation. \nIt is my goal to complete the bill the following week.\n  I remind Senators that Monday is the Dr. Martin Luther King holiday; \ntherefore, of course there will be no votes on Monday. The first vote \non Tuesday will be at 5:30 on that day, Tuesday; the 16th, I think, is \nthe date. It is Tuesday, a week from tomorrow. I will indicate the \nreason I am not moving more quickly is I have had a number of Senators \ntell me they have events on Monday dealing with the commemoration of \nthe Dr. King holiday and that they could not be here in time for work \non Tuesday.\n  We are going to work hard. We are going to finish the bill the \nfollowing week. I advise Senators we are going to finish the bill the \nfollowing week. Everyone should be aware that we will finish it. Even \nif we have to go past Friday at noon, we are going to finish this bill \nbecause we are going to move thereafter to minimum wage. Thereafter, it \nappears at this stage we are going to move to either the stem cell \nlegislation and then the negotiating for lower prescription drug prices \nfor Medicare. I don't know if we are going to do stem cell first or the \nMedicare negotiation bill, but one of those will be the third matter.\n  We have a lot to do. Today the Senate voted to adopt a resolution \nhonoring the late President Gerald Ford. Tomorrow we are beginning the \nethics bill at 11, as under a previous order. Tomorrow will be a full \nday for debate and amendments to that bill.\n  As I mentioned, the bulk of the bill is under the auspices of the \nRules Committee. Senators Feinstein and Bennett will be ready to go \ntomorrow at 11. We also will see Senators Lieberman and Collins \nmanaging certain parts of that bill when the Senate Homeland Security \nCommittee's jurisdiction is primary.\n\n\n              Order for the Expiration of the Morning Hour\n\n  I ask, Mr. President, that the morning hour be deemed to have expired \ntomorrow morning when we reconvene.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Completion of Votes\n\n  Mr. President, as I indicated in our conversations that we have had \nabout the conduct of the Senate, one of the things that I have seen \nover the years is how much time is wasted, waiting for Senators to come \nfrom committee meetings, from airports and other places, causing the \nSenate, in effect, to be in lockdown until a vote is complete. We have \nhad votes that take a long time--an hour. We had a first vote today. We \nfinished the 15 minutes, the 5 minutes--the vote is over. That is the \nway it is going to be.\n  Today at least one Democratic Senator missed that vote. I hope that \nSenator doesn't miss any more votes. We are going to get in the habit \nof completing the votes on time.\n  I have told my counterpart, Senator McConnell, if there is an issue \nthat is one vote here, one vote there, it is 50 to 50 and people are \nmoving around trying to get someone to change a vote, we will extend \nthe time. But 98 percent of the votes are not close; 98 percent of the \ntime we are going to finish the vote in 20 minutes. Everyone should be \naware of that, Democrats and Republicans. This applies to Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Reid. If we are not going to be here, the vote \nwill be closed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/08/senate-section/article/S241-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
