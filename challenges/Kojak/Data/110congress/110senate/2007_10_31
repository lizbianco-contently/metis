Mr. President, children's health is a tremendously \ndifficult issue because children all over America need to be able to go \nto a doctor when they are sick or hurt. The way this body is operating \nnow basically is that we are not going to be able to complete, it \nappears, our legislation. The President has vetoed the bill once. We \nwere told that if certain changes were made, Republicans in the House \nwould look to this legislation favorably. We did make some changes. We \ntightened down the legislation so it is virtually impossible for anyone \nwho is here illegally to obtain benefits from this program. We changed \nthat.\n  We also limited the legislation so parents or adults without children \nwould be off the program in 1 year. Also, there could be no waivers for\n\n[[Page S13590]]\n\nthose over 300 percent of poverty. Ninety-two percent of the \nindividuals getting benefits from the legislation are 200 percent above \npoverty.\n  We made those changes, hoping it would bring some around. After that \nwas done and it passed the House and came over here, we were told by a \nnumber of individuals if we would hold off on this legislation, there \nwould be an agreement reached, and I thought that was a good \nsuggestion. As the Record indicates, yesterday I asked that that be the \ncase. Obviously, that was not the case. An objection was heard and we \nwere unable to delay the vote.\n  This morning, we heard something from the President that is totally \ndifferent. He keeps changing the ball here. First of all, he indicated \nto Leader Pelosi and me that he would like to sit down and talk to us. \nHe said that publicly in the press. After the veto vote, he said he \nwould like to come down and talk to us. Then he said, no, I am not \ngoing to talk to you; talk to my staff. Obviously, he wasn't leveling \nwith the American people then.\n\n  Today, he came up with a new deal. He doesn't like the way it is paid \nfor. I guess his term of reference is that we don't pay for much around \nhere. That is why we have these staggering deficits. But he said in the \npress today he didn't like the way it is paid for. Remember, we are on \na pay-go program around here. Any new spending has to be paid for. This \nchildren's health program is paid for with tobacco taxes. So the \ngoalposts keep being moved.\n  What are the consequences? Is it a bunch of talk by Government \nofficials, of which I am one? It is very serious. Twenty-one States \nwill run out of money for childrens' health insurance in the coming \nyear. At least nine of those States will exhaust their allotments in \nMarch if Congress continues spending at current levels.\n  There is a report that came out today in the New York Times \nnewspaper. California is adopting rules, in case that happens, to \ncreate a waiting list and remove more than a million children who are \nalready on the rolls. These are kids. The nine states that will run out \nof money by March are Alaska, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island. This comes from a \nnonpartisan, nonpolitical organization, the Congressional Research \nService.\n  So there are real consequences to what we are not doing. We are going \nto go ahead with the vote today and complete this legislation, as I \nindicated, sometime this week. If we have to work into the weekend, we \nwill. I have alerted the Republican leader of that. If necessary, we \ncan, of course, condense that time, but it would take consent of all \nthe Senators.\n  We are, in good faith, trying to protect children--children who are \nalready receiving the benefits of this program that was adopted 10 \nyears ago on a bipartisan basis, led by Senators Kennedy and Hatch. Now \nwe are trying to further this legislation, led by Senators Baucus, \nGrassley, Rockefeller and Hatch and their counterparts in the House.\n  I think it is a real shame that we are at the point where we are. Ten \nmillion children, if we pass this legislation, would have the benefits \nof this insurance. If we don't pass it, as indicated in some of the \nstatistics I gave a minute ago, 9 States will run out of money in March \nand 21 States will run out next year sometime.\n  The program now has 5.5 million children on it. If we don't do \nanything by year's end, it will be down to about 3 million children. \nThat is what I am told. If we pass our legislation--and it doesn't cost \nthe American people any money--we would wind up having 10 million \nchildren covered. As I have indicated, most all adults will be off the \nprogram, as I have indicated to the chair and to those within the sound \nof my voice.\n  This is a good program. This doesn't take into consideration \napproximately 50 million people who have no health insurance, but it \ntakes care of a few of the children--the little people--who need help \nwhen they are sick and hurt. This allows them even to go get some \npreventive care, which is badly needed, which will save our country a \nlot of money in the so-called outyears.\n  We are ready and willing to be reasonable, but it appears we have no \nalternative, based on what we did yesterday, to proceed forward and \nsend the bill to the President again. The only thing that would come in \nthe way of that is if the Republicans use whatever excuse they can come \nup with to try to satisfy the President.\n  As I said yesterday, in the 7 years this man has been President, he \nhas had the strings on his puppets in the Senate. Maybe people who \nvoted for this on more than one occasion will switch and say we don't \nlike the way we are being treated. Remember, we have given them \neverything they wanted, and they could not take yes for an answer \nyesterday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13590-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

MUKASEY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today marks the 40th day since the \nnomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General.\n  The Mukasey nomination was the culmination of a process in which the \nPresident was extremely solicitous of the views of the Democratic \nmajority.\n  Let's recap. Our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle did not \nwant the former Attorney General to continue in office and, as we all \nknow, he resigned.\n  Our Democratic colleagues wanted to be consulted on whom the next \nAttorney General should be. Well, the administration consulted \nextensively with our Democratic friends.\n  Our Democratic colleagues did not want the former Solicitor General, \nTed Olson, to be nominated. He, in my view, would have made an \noutstanding choice. But the administration did not nominate him.\n  Our Democratic colleagues said if, instead, the President ``were to \nnominate a . . . conservative . . . like Mike Mukasey,'' he ``would get \nthrough the Senate very, very quickly.'' Well, the President didn't \nnominate somebody like Mike Mukasey; the President nominated Mike \nMukasey himself. He received widespread acclaim for taking that step.\n  So it is apparent the President acted in a very bipartisan fashion in \nreaching the decision he did to nominate Judge Mukasey.\n  So did our Democratic colleagues reciprocate to that act of good \nfaith? At this point, it is kind of difficult to say they have. First, \nthey held up the nomination for weeks before even scheduling a \nhearing--an action--or, more precisely, an inaction--which the \nWashington Post termed ``irresponsible.''\n  Then, despite the fact that Judge Mukasey testified for 2 days and \nanswered 250 questions in the process, our Democratic colleagues asked \nhim to answer an additional 500 written questions. By contrast, \nAttorney General Reno did not receive any written questions until after \nshe was confirmed. Then it took over 2 weeks for a markup to be \nscheduled. I understand one now has been scheduled for next Tuesday, \nand I am certainly glad that has finally occurred, but it shouldn't \nhave taken nearly this long.\n\n  Months ago our Democratic colleagues told us ``this Nation needs a \nnew Attorney General and it can't afford to wait.'' That was the cry on \nthe other side: We need a new Attorney General and we can't afford to \nwait. Unfortunately, since then, we have been waiting and waiting and \nwaiting. We have been waiting so long that Judge Mukasey's nomination \nis the longest pending Attorney General nomination in two decades.\n  Now the good news is that the markup has been set. We need to get \nJudge Mukasey's nomination to the floor for an up-or-down vote as soon \nas possible.\n  I think we have seen some unfortunate flareup of partisanship. \nHopefully that will not continue and we can get Judge Mukasey to work \ndown at the Justice Department where we all agree his services are very \ngreatly needed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13590-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday the President of the United \nStates stood on the steps of the White House and had the audacity to \nlecture Congress about how to do our work. It is precisely a lack of \nPresidential leadership, potentially a lack of policy interest, and \ncertainly a lack of understanding of responsible Government that is \ngetting in the way of solving our Nation's problems--the President.\n  This Congress inherited a growing deficit from Mr. Bush--his created \ndeficit, not his father's; his--and Congress has committed to live by a \npay-as-you-go way of spending which makes life very tough. It is the \nabsolute height of hypocrisy to have a President who effectively \nfrittered away, gave away, to his rich friends a $5.6 trillion surplus \nand to have him lecturing the Congress about skyrocketing spending.\n  Did all of that go to his rich friends? No; most of it did. Some of \nit went to his brilliantly conceived war in Iraq which has made America \na much less safe place to live, while the Taliban and others grow \nstronger in Afghanistan.\n  America needed, when he took office and especially after 9/11, to \nmake some substantial investments in our defense and intelligence \ninfrastructure, as well as very new and very good homeland security \ninitiatives to respond to the September 11 attacks and ongoing threats. \nThat spending was required for our national security.\n  Generally speaking around here, we take national security pretty \nseriously. We do on the Intelligence Committee. But that is not where \nthe bulk of taxpayers' dollars has gone under this administration. \nInstead, we have given trillions of dollars away in tax cuts to \nmillionaires and billionaires, and we are in year 5 of an \nastronomically expensive Iraq war with a failed strategy that is, as I \nsaid, making America less safe.\n  I am going to say to the President, this is not a political speech. I \ndo not often come to the floor of the Senate to speak. I prefer to do \nmy work in committees and in conferences. But I am fed up and outraged \nat what has transpired from the White House.\n  Meanwhile, on the home front, our domestic priorities, such as \nchildren, we have met a concrete wall of resistance. The veto of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program rests with him and it rests with \nhim, President Bush, alone.\n  The Democratic leader was talking about some of the falsehoods the \nPresident has used in arguing against--publicly, constantly, all the \ntime--the Children's Health Insurance Program, none of which are true. \nAll of those who not only created the program, as I did along with John \nChafee and Orrin Hatch, but those of us who are working on it now, in \nan extraordinarily bipartisan way amongst ourselves and with the House, \nare trying to make it work. But over all that, there is this looming \nunderstanding that no matter what we do, the President is going to veto \nthe bill. I will get into that later.\n  So now the President is threatening to veto and then veto again and \nthen veto again appropriations bills aimed at investing in other \npressing domestic needs. While, at the same time he is pushing to make \nthe tax cuts for billionaires and millionaires, that I referred to \nbefore, permanent while advocating little to nothing for hard-working, \nmiddle-class families.\n  Congress is keeping its promise to the working-class families in West \nVirginia and around the Nation. We try to put the best interests of our \nsoldiers, our children, our veterans, and our families first, and we \nhave done so. We are the ones who have done that. If the President \nthinks that vetoing bill after bill and threatening to do so, setting \nthe tone to do so, somehow achieves his goals, it is going to make him \neven less relevant to the American people than he is now.\n\n  Let me comment a little bit more on his statement regarding CHIP, the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. It is certainly the best program \nsince Medicaid in terms of health care and one which is working, \naccording to all analysis, efficiently and effectively and humanely.\n  As we all know, after months of intense negotiations between \nRepublicans and Democrats, Congress presented a bill to the White House \nthat would continue the health care coverage of the 6.6 million \nchildren currently covered and add on approximately 4 million more. It \nwould give 10 million-plus children insurance, little children who have \nno health insurance, and we want to tend to that problem.\n  It has been an entirely bipartisan process. Chuck Grassley, the \nhonorable senior Senator from Iowa, Max Baucus, the honorable senior \nSenator from Montana, Jay Rockefeller, the honorable junior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, and Orrin Hatch, the honorable senior Senator from \nUtah have worked for months, more importantly have our staffs, on a \nbipartisan basis, have worked for months, 7 days a week, through the \nnight, to try to make this bill work.\n  The President wanted to put $5 billion into it, which would have cut \na lot of children out of health insurance. Obviously, the Democrats \nwanted to put in $50 billion into it. The Republicans wanted to put $22 \nbillion into it. What we did, the four of us Senators who are doing \nthis, met every single afternoon for weeks and for months from 5 to 7 \nto figure out a way, arguing, walking out sometimes, negotiating, and \nfinally coming to the figure of $35 billion, and we were all happy. We \nall shook hands with pride because we knew we were doing something good \nfor America's children. There were no politics there. It was pure \nnegotiations in the interest of the people who don't start wars, who \ndon't get our Nation into trouble, and who don't have any health \ninsurance.\n  Congress met its responsibility. We did the right thing by our \nchildren. The President perhaps didn't understand the policy involved. \nI don't know. As the leader indicated, he didn't want to talk about it. \nBut he certainly deliberately told a lot of falsehoods about the \nprogram, and the leader also discussed that situation, never mentioning \nthat 91 percent of all children retrospectively and prospectively--the \n6.6 million plus the 4 million--are at 200 percent of poverty or \nbelow--91 percent, 9 out of 10.\n  I see them with my eyes in West Virginia. I see them as a VISTA \nvolunteer. I see them now as a relatively senior, though still junior, \nSenator because they are people. When their teeth are not fixed, their \nlives are changed. When their baby teeth are not fixed, don't worry \nabout the adult teeth to follow; they are already compromised. And \nimmunizations, EPSDT, all kinds of other health care needs.\n  We did the right thing by our children. The President--and it was the \nPresident who decided to veto this bill--it was the President who \nabdicated his moral responsibility to our children in favor of tobacco \nand partisan politics, or ideology. It doesn't matter, does it, if he \nis going to veto the bill. I just came from a meeting a half hour ago \nwhere Republicans and Democrats from the House and Senate were trying \nto work out a compromise, but there was this looming sense that \nwhatever we do was going to get vetoed, so it didn't make any \ndifference.\n  Ten million children--this isn't some controversial dam or earmark. \nThis is uninsured children. Some of them had been previously uninsured \nand now are, and 4 million more who are uninsured. They are children. \nIf you don't get a healthy start in life, everything is compromised--\nyour health, your self-esteem, your prospects, your future, your life. \nIt starts with health care.\n  It is the President who continues to tell these falsehoods about our \nbill to take attention away from the real issue. This is not about the \ncost of the bill, this is not about uninsured adults, this is not about \nillegal immigrants. This is about not wanting to give poor and low-\nincome children and children whose parents cannot afford private \ninsurance access to something monumental called health care.\n  The President said so himself in a statement which I can barely get \nout of\n\n[[Page S13592]]\n\nmy mouth. He said to a Cleveland audience on July 10 of this year:\n\n       I mean, people have access to health care in America, after \n     all. You just go to the emergency room.\n\n  Mr. President, you cannot understand health care, you cannot \nunderstand any of its intricacies, you cannot understand any of its \nbroad oversweeps and ever, not even once in your life, make a statement \nsuch as that. The last time as a Senator I was in a waiting room in an \nemergency room with a child was about 1 or 2 years ago, and we waited 9 \nhours. So that statement, which is hard for me to say, alone, speaks \nvolumes about his less than compassionate intentions.\n  Yesterday, the President accused Democrats in Congress of going it \nalone without seeking input from Republicans. There is absolutely \nnothing that could be further from the truth. We sought input from him, \nand we were turned down. We have done nothing but work with \nRepublicans. We were working with Republicans 45 minutes ago in an \nhour, hour and a half long meeting--I don't know how long. I think we \nare meeting again this afternoon--from the House. We are trying to \nresolve this, all at the same time understanding that at the end of the \nday it is probably all going to get vetoed. But we don't care because \nwe do care about children. It is about children. It is about children \nand their right to have health care, and we are in a position to do it.\n\n  I went to a high building in New York at the invitation of somebody, \nand I walked in and I was greeted very coldly. I sat down. I was stared \nat very coldly. I became moderately unhappy. So I decided to start out \nthe conversation, which he had asked for.\n  I said: How much are you going to make this year?\n  He said: $183 million.\n  But he said: If you people on the Finance Committee would do \nsomething about deferred compensation, I could make more.\n  Now, this put me in a real kind of quandary. I didn't want to be \nimpolite--I did want to be impolite, but I didn't want to show it--and \nso I said to him: How is it that I describe something called the United \nStates of America? How is it that I deal with income disparity? How is \nit that I come from your $183 million, plus whatever it is if we did on \nthe Finance Committee would give you more, to the fact that the average \nworking family who pays taxes and works and has children in West \nVirginia has an income of $26,600 a year? How do I get from $26,000 a \nyear to $183 million-plus a year and still call this the United States \nof America, which is trying to resolve income disparity and treat \npeople fairly?\n  I couldn't do it. The conversation was not pleasant, and I got up and \nwalked out. I am happy to say the gentleman was fired a week later.\n  So we have tried to get the attention of the White House. We have \ntried to engage the White House. We have tried to do it not for the \nsake of just simply crafting a bill, but because we have a passionate \nbelief that goes back to 1996--a passionate belief that we are speaking \non behalf of millions of American families who cannot afford something \nso basic as health care and that we can fix it for them for $35 \nmillion, and that is over a period of years, but we were rebuffed. We \nwere vetoed, and we have actually been vetoed verbally five or six \ntimes since.\n  CHIP is a bipartisan program. The bill passed by the Congress is a \nbipartisan bill. It does have strong Republican support. There were a \nlot of Republicans in the House who voted for their version of the bill \ndespite very obvious arm-twisting by the White House. If there is any \nhope left of enacting a children's health insurance bill this year, it \nis because there is still a bipartisan group of Senators and \nCongressmen who are working to keep it together.\n  But if the President continues to mischaracterize our bill and engage \nin disinformation, then I would say to my colleagues: Enough is enough. \nEnough is enough. Either you are for giving kids a healthy start in \nlife or you are not. It is that simple. Money is not the problem. \nPaying is the problem. Injustice is the problem. Poverty is the \nproblem. Money is not.\n  Well, the President has made his choice. For him, children evidently \ndon't really need health care. They can just go to the emergency room. \nIt is really a poignantly horrible statement for him to have made. I \ndon't know if he has ever been to an emergency room. I have. He is \nentitled to his conscience, of course, and he is entitled to his \nopinion. He is entitled to protecting tobacco over protecting children. \nThat is his right. He is the President. He has the veto pen, and he can \nsign or veto. He chooses to veto. But let us be very clear: He will \nhave this as his legacy.\n  As a nation, we have always done what is right by our most vulnerable \npopulations, not sometimes as efficiently or as swiftly as we could, \nbut as we could. Our seniors and our children have always been at the \ntop of that. Now our veterans are sacred. Veterans, when they go to \nserve our country, are soldiers for their entire lives, and we protect \nthem. If this President won't live up to that ideal, then it is time to \nget one who will.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I just inquire now, would we be beginning the \nRepublican time for morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still 9\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nDemocratic time.\n  Mr. KYL. I understand we have permission to proceed, and I thank the \nmajority for that and would note that when speakers come on their side, \nthen they would be entitled to their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13592-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13592-S13595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOMINATION OF JUDGE MICHAEL MUKASEY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to urge the swift confirmation of \nJudge Michael Mukasey as Attorney General. It has been 6 weeks now, and \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee has not even taken up the nomination. It \nis past time to fill this vacancy.\n  There is no question this nominee is qualified to serve. I don't need \nto recite his qualifications. They were mentioned by many Members at \nJudge Mukasey's nomination hearing.\n  The distinguished majority leader said:\n\n       Judge Mukasey has strong professional credentials and a \n     reputation for independence. A man who spent 18 years on the \n     Federal bench surely understands the importance of checks and \n     balances and knows how to say no to the President when he \n     oversteps the Constitution.\n\n  There is no question, the Nation would be well served by Judge \nMukasey's confirmation. Indeed, in recommending Judge Mukasey to serve \non the Supreme Court, Senator Schumer noted that Judge Mukasey, and the \nothers he recommended:\n\n       . . . were legally excellent, ideologically moderate, \n     within the mainstream, and have demonstrated a commitment to \n     the rule of law.\n\n  Surely, if a man is qualified and independent enough to be on the \nSupreme Court, we should have far fewer concerns when nominating him to \nserve the remaining time of about 1 year as Attorney General.\n  It seems to me that what this debate boils down to is politics. Some \nMembers want more information about his views. I would note that he \ntestified for 2 full days and has answered nearly 500 written \nquestions. The initial reaction from many of my Democratic colleagues \nwas that he was extremely forthcoming and they were pleased with his \ncandidness. But for some Senators, apparently this is not enough. It \nalmost seems to me as if some of my colleagues are willing to hold this \nnomination hostage until he gives them exactly the answers they want, \neven when he is unable as a legal matter to do that.\n  Let me explain why. Judge Mukasey has not been briefed on classified \nprograms, and he will not be briefed on classified programs until he \nbecomes the Attorney General, but some of my colleagues now seem to be \nsaying he should have to make pronouncements about the legalities of \nthose programs even when he doesn't know their details--can't know \ntheir details. How is this independent?\n  I would suggest this: My colleagues don't want an Attorney General \nwho is independent; they want an Attorney General who will kowtow to \ntheir views and make pronouncements over\n\n[[Page S13593]]\n\nissues on which he is not legally allowed to opine. That is, of course, \nthe opposite of independence.\n  Since the beginning of this Congress, Democratic Senators have \nrepeatedly called for new leadership at the Department of Justice. They \nhave said the work of the Department is too important to delay \nconfirmation of a new Attorney General. Well, now is the time for them \nto act.\n  Before the nomination, Senator Schumer said:\n\n       Let me say, if the President were to nominate somebody, \n     albeit a conservative, but somebody who put the rule of law \n     first, someone like a Mike Mukasey, my guess is that they \n     would get through the Senate very, very quickly.\n\n  Well, my colleague would have guessed wrong. It hasn't been quick. \nThe Senate Judiciary Committee has not moved quickly, and this is all \nthe worse because the average amount of time between nomination and \nconfirmation of the last nine Attorneys General has been 21 days. \nAlready Judge Mukasey has been pending for about twice that period of \ntime--6 weeks--longer than any Attorney General nominee in 20 years. If \nthese delays continue, obviously new records are sure to be broken.\n  The bottom line here is that President Bush has nominated a \ndistinguished and nonpolitical candidate to be the next Attorney \nGeneral. The Senate should reciprocate by using the confirmation \nprocess not to settle old scores or to politicize the nomination. \nIndependence has to mean something. We do not want an Attorney General \nwho refuses to give his honest legal opinions to the President, and we \ndon't want one who is forced to make commitments to the Senate that are \nnot grounded in facts or law.\n  The Department of Justice needs an Attorney General with the \nforesight and experience to resolve the issues the Nation's top law \nenforcement agency faces and to tackle the difficult challenges \nespecially presented in a post-\n9/11 world. The qualities and background of Judge Michael Mukasey, \ncombined with his extensive experience in national security and \nterrorism cases, commend him to serve as Attorney General in these \nchallenging times. It is important for the Senate to move on with this \nimportant business of the Nation so that Judge Mukasey can be voted on \nby the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to be associated with the remarks of \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona. I think he summed it up pretty \nwell, but let me just make some comments myself about the Mukasey \nnomination.\n  Just when you thought it might be safe to venture back into the \nconfirmation water, the partisan sharks rush in and push you right back \nonto the beach. Today is 40 days--40 days--since the Senate received \nthe nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General of the \nUnited States, 40 days in the partisan wilderness for a man who is \nsuperbly qualified and widely respected and whose service is \ndesperately needed.\n  Before addressing what is being done to Judge Mukasey, let me remind \nmy colleagues who he is. Michael Mukasey has spent four decades serving \nthe law and the country. He spent 16 years in private legal practice, 4 \nyears as a Federal prosecutor, and 19 years as a Federal district court \njudge. He was head of the Official Corruption Unit during his service \nas assistant U.S. attorney and chief judge during his last 6 years as a \nU.S. district judge, both in the Southern District of New York.\n  Judge Mukasey's service in that particular jurisdiction gave him the \nexpertise in national security issues that makes him especially \nqualified to lead a Justice Department that is being retooled for the \nwar on terrorism and especially since the war on terrorism continues as \nwe stand here on the floor. He presided over the 9-month trial of Omar \nAbdel Rahman and sentenced him to life in prison for the 1993 plot to \nblow up the World Trade Center.\n  When the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed Judge \nMukasey's decision, it took the unusual step of commenting on how he \nhandled the trial. These are the appeals court's words. Judge Mukasey:\n\n       . . . presided with extraordinary skill and patience, \n     assuring fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant \n     and helpfulness to the jury. His was an outstanding \n     achievement in the face of challenges far beyond those \n     normally endured by a trial judge.\n\n  That was the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on August \n16, 1999.\n  That is a remarkable statement. Appeals courts review district court \ndecisions, but rarely do they comment in this manner on district court \njudges.\n  Both generally and specifically, by any reasonable or objective \nstandard, Judge Mukasey is eminently qualified to be our next Attorney \nGeneral. By the standards set by my Democratic colleagues themselves, \nJudge Mukasey should by now have become Attorney General Mukasey. My \nDemocratic colleagues have repeatedly said that the Justice Department \nneeds new leadership and needs it now. The Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer, whom my colleague from Arizona quoted, is a Judiciary \nCommittee member and a serious one. He has said:\n\n       We can't afford to wait because justice is too important.\n\n  He is not alone in making that statement among the Democrats. The \nDemocratic mantra is, justice is too important to wait; we need a new \nAttorney General now. My Democratic colleagues also offered criteria, \noffered a description of the kind of Attorney General we need right \naway. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, said:\n\n       We want the best man or woman who can run the place, \n     restore the sense of commitment and restore the sense of \n     integrity to the Department of Justice.\n\n  The Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, who knows him well, said the \nnominee would have to be someone of unimpeachable integrity, \nexperience, and someone who could hit the ground running.\n  I respectfully say to my Democratic colleagues that Judge Mukasey \nfits your bill. He can run the place. He is a man of integrity and \nexperience. He certainly can hit the ground running.\n  It appeared for a short, brief time that my Democratic colleagues \nthought so too. After a full day of testimony, Chairman Leahy told \nJudge Mukasey that his answers showed his independence and his \nagreement that political influence has no place in law enforcement.\n  Mr. Schumer, the distinguished Senator from New York, said:\n\n       The most important qualities we need in an Attorney General \n     right now are independence and integrity, and looking at \n     Judge Mukasey's career and his interviews that we have all \n     had with him, it seems clear that Judge Mukasey possesses \n     these vital attributes.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that these and some other quotes be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. We need a new Attorney General now. In fact, we needed him \n40 days ago. Justice is too important to wait. Judge Mukasey meets the \ncriteria. He is qualified. He is ready to lead. Then why is Judge \nMukasey not already on the job leading the Justice Department to where \nAmericans think it needs to be? Why is his nomination stalled, 40 days \ninto the confirmation process, without even a committee vote?\n  It is certainly not because this is the way Attorney General nominees \nhave been treated in the past. In my 31 years in this body, we have \ntaken an average of 3 weeks to move an Attorney General nominee from \nnomination to confirmation. It has already been twice that long--40 \ndays and counting--for Judge Mukasey, and he was only today put on the \nJudiciary Committee agenda for next week.\n  Let me rewind the confirmation clock to 1993, the last time a \nDemocratic Senate evaluated a nominee for Attorney General. Janet Reno, \nthe Democratic nominee, received very different treatment than this \nRepublican nominee is receiving today. Miss Reno's nomination went \nthrough the entire confirmation process from initial receipt to final \nconfirmation in less time than Judge Mukasey's nomination has been \nsitting in the Judiciary Committee since this hearing.\n  While the Judiciary Committee will not vote on Mukasey's nomination \nuntil at least next week, the committee did not even wait for a markup \nto approve the Reno nomination.\n  I was the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, and I supported\n\n[[Page S13594]]\n\nthen-Chairman Biden's request to vote on Miss Reno's nomination at the \nend of the hearing. I knew Janet Reno was very liberal. I knew she \ndidn't agree with most Republican Senators. But she was qualified. She \nwas a decent person. To be honest with you, the Senate unanimously \nconfirmed her the very next day after the hearing, without even a \nmarkup.\n  While Senators gave Judge Mukasey nearly 500 written questions, after \n2 days of oral testimony--500 written questions, the answers to which \nhe already has provided, I might add--no Senators gave even a single \nquestion to Miss Reno.\n  What happened? Why such radically different treatment when a \nDemocratic nominee for Attorney General comes up? It is simply because \na Republican rather than a Democrat is in the White House and because \nwe have a different approach toward matters.\n  Most of us believe when a President is elected, that President, he or \nshe, should have the right to the nominees they put up, as long as they \nare competent and decent.\n  The need for new Justice Department leadership remains. Judge \nMukasey's obvious qualifications are the same. What happened that his \nnomination is now being obstructed, slowed down, and delayed? The \nlatest excuse is that Judge Mukasey will not state on the fly a legal \nconclusion for a Justice Department he has not yet led about whether \nthe coercive interrogation technique known as waterboarding constitutes \ntorture. He will not come to legal conclusions before he can apply \nappropriate legal standards to appropriate facts. I think that is a \nmark in his favor. He should be praised, not criticized, for taking \nthis approach.\n  Rather than focusing on his refusal to answer a question that he \nshould not answer, I want to remind my colleagues what Judge Mukasey \nhas said on this subject. Everyone appeared pleasantly surprised when \nJudge Mukasey denounced torture during his hearing. He went so far as \nto explain how torture violates not only statutes or treaties but the \nUnited States Constitution itself.\n  Judge Mukasey said if waterboarding properly can be labeled torture, \nthen it too is unconstitutional. In a letter dated yesterday, Judge \nMukasey said he considers techniques such as waterboarding personally \nrepugnant. But personal conclusions are not the same as legal \nconclusions. So Judge Mukasey outlined in detail the kind of analysis \nhe would follow to decide whether such interrogation techniques \nconstitute torture prohibited by the Constitution, or cruel, inhuman, \nor degrading treatment prohibited by statute and the Geneva \nConventions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Judge Mukasey wrote:\n\n       Legal questions must be answered based solely on the actual \n     facts, circumstances and legal standards presented.\n\n  How can he possibly be criticized for making legal judgments by \napplying legal standards to appropriate facts? What kind of crazy, \ntopsy-turvy confirmation process is this? My Democratic colleagues \ndemanded over and over that, if confirmed, Judge Mukasey must exercise \nhis own independent judgment and that he must answer legal questions on \nhis own; that he must not base advice on political pressure. But now \nthey criticize him for doing precisely what they told him to do. \nDemocrats now criticize Judge Mukasey for saying he will exercise his \nown independent judgment and answer legal questions on his own, without \nbasing his advice on political pressure. My Democratic colleagues \ncannot insist that Judge Mukasey be independent toward a Republican \nPresident but compliant toward a Democratic Senate. They cannot declare \nthat the Constitution is not whatever President Bush says it is, but \ndemand Judge Mukasey's agreement that the Constitution is whatever \nSenate Democrats say it is.\n  We should stop playing partisan political games with this nomination. \nThe Justice Department is too important for this type of stuff. Judge \nMukasey is eminently qualified to provide the leadership the Department \nneeds now. His insistence that independent legal judgment rather than \nemotion or partisan pressure will guide him only enhances his fitness \nfor taking the helm at the Justice Department.\n  Forty days into the partisan wilderness is more than enough. We \nshould confirm Judge Michael Mukasey without further delay.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n     democrats say the justice department needs new leadership now\n\n       Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY): May 24, 2007: ``This nation \n     needs a new Attorney General, and it can't afford to wait.''; \n     August 27, 2007: ``the Justice Department . . . desperately \n     needs new leadership.''\n       Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI): June 11, 2007: ``the \n     U.S. Department of Justice is a precious institution in our \n     democracy . . . and we need to take some action.''\n\n\n                     Democrats Praise Judge Mukasey\n\n       Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY): May 22, 2007: ``If the \n     president were to nominate somebody . . . like a . . .

Patrick J. Leahy, Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr., Hon. Dianne \n       Feinstein, Hon. Charles E. Schumer, Hon. Benjamin L. \n       Cardin, Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Hon. Herb Kohl, Hon. \n       Russell D. Feingold, Hon. Richard J. Durbin, Hon. Sheldon \n       Whitehouse,\n       Dear Chairman Leahy, Senators Kennedy, Biden, Kohl, \n     Feinstein, Feingold, Schumer, Durbin, Cardin and Whitehouse: \n     Thank you for your letter of October 23, 2007. I well \n     understand the concerns of the Senators who signed this \n     letter that this Country remain true to its ideals, and that \n     includes how we treat even the most brutal terrorists in U.S. \n     custody. I understand also the importance of the U.S. \n     remaining a nation of laws and setting a high standard of \n     respect for human rights. Indeed, I said at the hearing that \n     torture violates the law and the Constitution, and the \n     President may not authorize it as he is no less bound by \n     constitutional restrictions than any other government \n     official.\n       I was asked at the hearing and in your letter questions \n     about the hypothetical use of certain coercive interrogation \n     techniques. As described in your letter, these techniques \n     seem over the line or, on a personal basis, repugnant to me, \n     and would probably seem the same to many Americans. But \n     hypotheticals are different from real life, and in any legal \n     opinion the actual facts and circumstances are critical. As a \n     judge, I tried to be objective in my decision-making and to \n     put aside even strongly held personal beliefs when assessing \n     a legal question because legal questions must be answered \n     based solely on the actual facts, circumstances, and legal \n     standards presented. A legal opinion based on hypothetical \n     facts and circumstances may be of some limited academic \n     appeal but has scant practical effect or value.\n       I have said repeatedly, and reiterate here, that no one, \n     including a President, is above the law, and that I would \n     leave office sooner than participate in a violation of law. \n     If confirmed, any legal opinions I offer will reflect that I \n     appreciate the need for the United States to remain a nation \n     of laws and to set the highest standards. I will be mindful \n     also of our shared obligation to ensure that our Nation has \n     the tools it needs, within the law, to protect the American \n     people.\n       Legal opinions should treat real issues. I have not been \n     briefed on techniques used in any classified interrogation \n     program conducted by any government agency. For me, then, \n     there is a real issue as to whether the techniques presented \n     and discussed at the hearing and in your letter are even part \n     of any program of questioning detainees. Although I have not \n     been cleared into the details of any such program, it is my \n     understanding that some Members of Congress, including those \n     on the intelligence committees, have been so cleared and have \n     been briefed on the specifics of a program run by the Central \n     Intelligence Agency (``CIA''). Those Members know the answer \n     to the question of whether the specific techniques presented \n     to me at the hearing and in your letter are part of the CIA's \n     program. I do not.\n       I do know, however, that ``waterboarding'' cannot be used \n     by the United States military because its use by the military \n     would be a clear violation of the Detainee Treatment Act \n     (``DTA''). That is because ``water-\n\n[[Page S13595]]\n\n     boarding'' and certain other coercive interrogation \n     techniques are expressly prohibited by the Army Field Manual \n     on Intelligence Interrogation, and Congress specifically \n     legislated in the DTA that no person in the custody or \n     control of the Department of Defense (``DOD'') or held in a \n     DOD facility may be subject to any interrogation techniques \n     not authorized and listed in the Manual.\n       In the absence of legislation expressly banning certain \n     interrogation techniques in all circumstances, one must \n     consider whether a particular technique complies with \n     relevant legal standards. Below, I provide a summary of the \n     type of analysis that I would undertake, were I presented as \n     Attorney General with the question of whether coercive \n     interrogation techniques, including ``waterboarding'' as \n     described in your letter, would constitute torture, cruel, \n     inhuman or degrading treatment, or a violation of Common \n     Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions.\n       The statutory elements of torture are set forth in 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2340. By the terms of the statute, whether a \n     particular technique is torture would turn principally on \n     whether it is specifically intended to cause (a) severe \n     physical pain or suffering, or (b) prolonged mental harm \n     resulting from certain specified threats or acts. If, after \n     being briefed, I determine that a particular technique \n     satisfies the elements of section 2340, I would conclude that \n     the technique violated the law.\n       I note that the Department of Justice published its \n     interpretation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340 in a December 30, 2004 \n     memorandum to then-Deputy Attorney General James B. \n     Comey, which superseded the memorandum of August 1, 2002 \n     that I testified was a ``mistake.'' I understand that the \n     December 30, 2004 memorandum remains the Department's \n     prevailing interpretation of section 2340. Although the \n     December 30, 2004 memorandum to Mr. Comey does not discuss \n     any specific techniques, it does state that ``[w]hile we \n     have identified various disagreements with the August 2002 \n     Memorandum, we have reviewed this Office's prior opinions \n     addressing issues involving treatment of detainees and do \n     not believe that any of their conclusions would be \n     different under the standards set forth in this \n     memorandum.''\n       Even if a particular technique did not constitute torture \n     under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340, I would have to consider also \n     whether it nevertheless would be prohibited as ``cruel, \n     inhuman or degrading treatment'' as set forth in the DTA and \n     the Military Commissions Act (``MCA'')--enacted after the \n     Department of Justice's December 30, 2004 memorandum to Mr. \n     Comey--which extended the Convention Against Torture's \n     prohibition on ``cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment'' to \n     individuals in United States custody regardless of location \n     or nationality. Congress specified in those statutes, as the \n     Senate had in consenting to the ratification of the \n     Convention Against Torture, that the Fifth, Eighth, and \n     Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution would control \n     our interpretation of the phrase ``cruel, inhuman or \n     degrading treatment.''\n       The Fifth Amendment is likely most relevant to an inquiry \n     under the DTA and MCA into the lawfulness of an interrogation \n     technique used against alien enemy combatants held abroad, \n     and the Supreme Court has established the well-known ``shocks \n     the conscience'' to determine whether particular government \n     conduct is consistent with the Fifth Amendment's due process \n     guarantees. See County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, \n     850 (1998); Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165, 174 (1952). A \n     legal opinion on whether any interrogation technique shocks \n     the conscience such that it constitutes cruel, inhuman or \n     degrading treatment requires an understanding of the relevant \n     facts and circumstances of the technique's past or proposed \n     use. This is the test mandated by the Supreme Court itself in \n     County of Sacramento v. Lewis in which it wrote that ``our \n     concern with preserving the constitutional proportions of \n     substantive due process demands an exact analysis of \n     circumstances before any abuse of power is condemned as \n     conscience shocking.'' 523 U.S. 833, 850 (1998) (emphasis \n     added). As the Supreme Court has explained, a court first \n     considers whether the conduct is ``arbitrary in the \n     constitutional sense,'' a test that asks whether the conduct \n     is proportionate to the governmental interests involved. Id. \n     at 847. In addition, the court must conduct an objective \n     inquiry into whether the conduct at issue is ``egregious'' or \n     ``outrageous'' in light of ``traditional executive behavior \n     and contemporary practices.'' Id. at 847 n.8. This inquiry \n     requires a review of executive practice so as to determine \n     what the United States has traditionally considered to be out \n     of bounds, and it makes clear that there are some acts that \n     would be prohibited regardless of the surrounding \n     circumstances.\n       I would have to ensure also that any technique complies \n     with our Nation's obligations under the Geneva Conventions, \n     including those acts, such as murder, mutilation, rape, and \n     cruel or inhuman treatment, that Congress has forbidden as \n     grave breaches of Common Article 3 under the War Crimes Act. \n     With respect to any coercive interrogation technique, the \n     prohibition on ``cruel or inhuman treatment'' would be of \n     particular relevance. That statute, similar in structure \n     to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2340, prohibits acts intended (a) to \n     cause serious physical pain or suffering, or (b) serious \n     and non-transitory mental harm resulting from certain \n     specific threats or acts. Also, I would have to consider \n     whether there would be a violation of the additional \n     prohibitions imposed by Executive Order 13440, which \n     includes a prohibition of willful and outrageous personal \n     abuse inflicted for the purpose of humiliating and \n     degrading the detainee.\n       As I testified, any discussion of coercive interrogation \n     techniques necessarily involves a discussion of and a choice \n     among bad alternatives. I was and remain loath to discuss and \n     opine on any of those alternatives at this stage for the \n     following three principal reasons: First, to repeat, I have \n     not been made aware of the details of any interrogation \n     program to the extent that any such program may be \n     classified, and thus do not know what techniques may be \n     involved in any such program that some may find analogous or \n     comparable to the coercive techniques presented to me at the \n     hearing and in your letter. Second, I would not want any \n     uninformed statement of mine made during a confirmation \n     process to present our own professional interrogators in the \n     field, who must perform their duty under the most stressful \n     conditions, or those charged with reviewing their conduct, \n     with a perceived threat that any conduct of theirs, past or \n     present, that was based on authorizations supported by the \n     Department of Justice could place them in personal legal \n     jeopardy. Third, for the reasons that I believe our \n     intelligence community has explained in detail, I would not \n     want any statement of mine to provide our enemies with a \n     window into the limits or contours of any interrogation \n     program we may have in place and thereby assist them in \n     training to resist the techniques we actually may use.\n       I emphasize in closing this answer that nothing set forth \n     above, or in my testimony, should be read as an approval of \n     the interrogation techniques presented to me at the hearing \n     or in your letter, or any comparable technique. Some of you \n     told me at the hearing or in private meetings that you hoped \n     and expected that, if confirmed, I would exercise my \n     independent judgment when providing advice to the President, \n     regardless of whether that advice was what the President \n     wanted to hear. I told you that it would be irresponsible for \n     me to do anything less. It would be no less irresponsible for \n     me to seek confirmation by providing an uninformed legal \n     opinion based on hypothetical facts and circumstances.\n       As I testified, if confirmed I will review any coercive \n     interrogation techniques currently used by the United States \n     Government and the legal analysis authorizing their use to \n     assess whether such techniques comply with the law. If, after \n     such a review, I determine that any technique is unlawful, I \n     will not hesitate to so advise the President and will rescind \n     or correct any legal opinion of the Department of Justice \n     that supports use of the technique. I view this as entirely \n     consistent with my commitment to provide independent judgment \n     on all issues. That is my commitment and pledge to the \n     President, to the Congress, and to the American people. Each \n     and all should expect no less from their Attorney General.\n\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael B.

Mr. President, I realize today is Halloween, so millions \nof children all over the globe will be showing up at our homes, saying \n``trick or treat.'' Unfortunately, Congress has been up to more tricks \nthan treats lately. I say that with a sense of irony but also a sense \nof great disappointment.\n  Almost 3 weeks ago, on October 11, I sent a letter to Senator Reid, \nthe Senate majority leader, and the Speaker of the House, Congresswoman \nPelosi, urging them to work across the aisle with Republicans and \nDemocrats to come up with a sensible compromise on the reauthorization \nof the State Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Today, as we know, is October 31, Halloween, and we have still not \nbeen able to come up with a compromise that is reasonable and fiscally \nresponsible which the President will sign. The families and the \nchildren in my State of Texas who are, unfortunately, put on edge and \nsuffering some sense of anxiety wondering whether this important \nprogram will continue to serve the needs of low-income children are \nbeing unfortunately taken advantage of and disadvantaged.\n  Why in the world would Congress play this kind of game and make those \nwho are the most vulnerable among us the most anxious about their \nfuture and whether they will be able to get the health care which \neveryone in Congress believes low-income children ought to receive?\n  Instead of negotiating and trying to come up with a sensible \ncompromise,\n\n[[Page S13596]]\n\nwe find the leadership in the House of Representatives rushing through \na bill with little bipartisan input. Rather than trying to hammer out a \nmeaningful compromise, we find a bill that actually costs just as much \nbut serves fewer children and which otherwise makes minor tweaks to the \nlegislation.\n  This bill clearly misses the mark and fails to reauthorize the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program according to the original intent of \nthe program, which is putting low-income children first, low-income \nchildren whose families earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid--\nthat is up to 100 percent of the poverty level--but who make up to 200 \npercent of the poverty level. Unfortunately, due to the inaction of the \nU.S. Congress, we have 700,000 low-income Texas children who qualify \nfor Medicaid, who qualify for SCHIP, but who are currently not signed \nup and receiving those benefits. Instead, Congress is taking its eye \noff the ball and exploding this sensible program that deserves to be \nauthorized by raising the eligibility cap to 300 percent of the poverty \nlevel but doing nothing--I reiterate--nothing to ensure that low-income \nchildren, including 700,000 low-income children in Texas, have coverage \nfirst before we grow the program to higher income levels and cover \nadults as well.\n  In fact, this legislation repeals the requirement that 95 percent of \nlow-income children below 200 percent of the poverty level be covered \nfirst before extending coverage to children from higher income \nfamilies. I do not believe this provision has the interests of the \nchildren this legislation was designed to serve put first. Instead, I \nthink it puts partisan political interests ahead of the interests of \nlow-income children.\n  All of this has come, of course, in response to the President's veto \nof the original SCHIP reauthorization, a proposal that failed to \nencourage participation among the poorest of our children, and instead \nexpanded coverage to children of higher income families as well as \nadults. Rather than being an obstacle, the President's veto should be \nlooked at as an opportunity to reengage on a bipartisan basis to come \nup with a solution. It is no wonder that Congress's approval ratings \nare around the 11-percent range. When the people across America look to \nWashington to find solutions to their problems, what do they find? They \nfind partisan posturing and precious few results.\n  This is an opportunity to deliver a result and to keep a promise that \nwe, on a bipartisan basis, have made to the poorest children in our \ncountry. What should we have asked ourselves as to what we should do? \nWhile we leave our children and their families blowing in the wind, \nwill we turn their lives into campaign promises or will we, instead, \nkeep our word that we came here to serve the needs of the American \npeople, and particularly the most vulnerable among us, by continuing \nthis important program and making sure that poor kids get health care \nfirst, before we look at growing this program to cover other more well-\nto-do children or perhaps even adults as are covered currently in four \nStates.\n\n  The recent debate on SCHIP has focused too much on our political \ngains and not enough on the well-being of our poor children. This bill \nhas become another political football in a game that has been raging \nfor months, but, unlike any other game that I am familiar with, this \ngame has only an imaginary scoreboard, the results are arbitrary, and \nnothing--nothing--it appears, is out of bounds.\n  Whenever a health care package for low-income children is delayed \nbecause some want to engage in partisan games and political posturing, \nyou know things have gone too far.\n  They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and \nover again and yet expecting different results. Well, by that \ndefinition, this is insanity. We know the original bill that was vetoed \nby the President was because it strayed far from the original \nobjectives. It was not funded on a source of revenue that could be \nexpected to pay for this radical expansion of the current program by \n140 percent.\n  Well, we know the reasons the President vetoed that legislation. And \nwhat does the leadership in the House of Representatives decide to do? \nWell, they decide to essentially do the same thing again and dare the \nPresident, one more time, to veto this legislation.\n  It is clear this is not, by definition, good-faith negotiation and \nattempt, on a bipartisan basis, to solve this very real problem. Rather \nthan give voice to those who want to find a better and more sensible \nsolution to this problem, we will find ourselves this afternoon simply \nvoting on another substantially flawed bill, which the President has \nlikewise promised to veto.\n  Of course, when the bill returns from its short and uneventful trip \nto the White House, we will not fail to see the video cameras paraded \nout for the press conferences to talk once more about how the President \nand those who voted against this bill have heartlessly blocked it.\n  It has become a cynical ploy. Everybody gets it. Only people inside \nthe beltway in Washington or inside this Chamber who continue to engage \nin partisan posturing do not get it. The American people see through it \nas clearly as you would expect.\n  The truth is no one wants to see SCHIP reauthorized more than the \nMembers of the Congress, on a bipartisan basis. It is an enormously \nsuccessful program passed with broad bipartisan support in 1997, and it \nshould be continued. As a matter of fact, those of us who voted against \nthe bill the President vetoed believe we should continue the program, \nand we should add at least $10 billion to the original funding in order \nto cover more and more low-income kids.\n  But even more important than that, in my State of Texas, half of the \nuninsured children in Texas who are eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP \nunder the current program are not signed up. What is Congress doing to \nmake sure those children are reached out to, that their parents are \nassisted in filling out the paperwork so they can qualify for this \nprogram? Precious little. Precious little.\n  Congress continues to add 140 percent to the current authority under \nthis program, to take money out of necessary outreach to reach out to \nthe low-income kids and to explode this program into one that covers \npeople making much more money than double the Federal level of poverty.\n  I will do everything in my power to ensure these children get the \nhealth care they need. The problem is, as I and many of my colleagues \nhave pointed out numerous times, this bill does not make these children \na priority. It does not make these children a priority but, rather, an \nafterthought.\n  Instead, it puts other children, many of whom already enjoy the \nbenefits of private health insurance, in competition with these low-\nincome children for CHIP coverage. The result is that children who most \nneed it get crowded out in favor of children who already have private \nhealth insurance.\n  This bill simply does not fix the problem. It raises the eligibility \nfor CHIP enrollment without a concerted effort to enroll those children \nwho are currently eligible first. Additionally, this new bill does \nnothing to close the loopholes on income disregard. Now, that is a \nfancy way of saying disregarding the rules. You say the rules are one \nthing, but you come behind it later on and say: Well, forget some of \nthese rules when it comes to qualifying income.\n  This bill is another example of that kind of gamesmanship under the \ntitle of income disregards which allows States the ability to, in \neffect, define a family's income by saying: We will not take into \naccount all income. We are going to disregard some so you will qualify \nfor this Federal Government taxpayer-paid-for benefit.\n  This loophole would allow States to actually exceed 300 percent of \npoverty level by disregarding part of the family's income.\n  Neither does this bill address the crowd-out effect which is expected \nto shift 2 million children from private coverage to government-run \nhealth care. There are a number of other problems with this bill that \ndo nothing to eliminate the document fraud and identity theft that \nwould allow noncitizens to qualify for the benefits under this \nlegislation.\n  We can do better. We must do better. But we cannot do better as long \nas we continue to engage in this partisan gamesmanship and political \nposturing. Unfortunately, it is the low-income children, among the most \nvulnerable in our country, who are the ones who are left wondering: Is \nCongress going to act in their best interests?\n  Unfortunately, they have seen very little evidence so far that they \nare our\n\n[[Page S13597]]\n\nNo. 1 priority, as they should be. Instead, partisan politics appear to \nbe the No. 1 priority, and those children appear to be something left \nbehind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, right up the street from here, right up \nPennsylvania Avenue, is the White House. It is not far, a little over a \nmile. But what has been made abundantly clear over the past 10 months \nsince Congress changed hands, what has been made abundantly clear is \nthat when it comes to the priorities of the families of this Nation, \nwhen it comes to the values they hold, the distance between here and \nthe White House is many miles.\n  Americans have seen for themselves what we in Congress want to do for \nthem. They have seen some truly meaningful and landmark initiatives \nachieved on behalf of American families: The 9/11 Commission bill, \nbringing security to all our communities; the most sweeping ethics \nreform in a generation, extracting lobbying influence from the policies \nthat affect all of us; the first increase in the minimum wage, the \nfirst raise for American workers in more than a decade; and the most \nsignificant college affordability package since the GI bill, because we \nrecognize that a good education is the great equalizer.\n  But that is not all we are trying to do for middle-class Americans, \nfor working Americans, for families in this country. That is the tip of \nthe iceberg. We want to help American families by investing in \nsecurity, education, and health care, and we have legislation to do \nthat. Yes, there will be plenty more ideas, plenty more initiatives, \nplenty more investments in the people of this country whom we stand \ntogether to support but only to have the President and his friends in \nCongress block our progress.\n  Time after time, a majority of the Members of this body have lined up \nbehind truly important legislation, only to have the President take out \nhis veto pen or our Republican colleagues in the Senate strike up a \nfilibuster.\n  Yesterday I saw President Bush, flanked by some of his top allies \nfrom Congress, complaining about what he claims Congress has not done \nthis year. It takes a lot of nerve for the President to say that, when \nhe received from this Congress landmark security legislation, landmark \neducation legislation, landmark ethics reforms, and the first minimum \nwage raise in a decade. He signed them all into law, all within 10 \nmonths.\n  It takes a lot of nerve for President Bush to say we are wasting \ntime, when he, along with his allies, has refused the children's health \nlegislation, stem cell research legislation, and legislation to change \nthe course in Iraq.\n  I know it is Halloween, but the legislative graveyard for which the \nPresident is the grim reaper is not a trick or a treat. It is downright \nscary that the President can be so disconnected from the values and \nhopes of mainstream America.\n  Ask the American people: What would they rather us do in Washington--\nstand up for lifesaving research, lower energy costs, get our troops \nout of Iraq or kill initiative after initiative that would benefit \nAmerican families? In Congress, we are going to try to give the \nPresident what we call in golf a mulligan on one of the most important \ninvestments we can make in our country, the health of our children. The \nfirst time, he vetoes it, sending the message that millions of children \nwho have nowhere else to turn are unworthy of a strong Federal \ncommitment.\n  We believe that is fundamentally wrong. The President has to choose \nif he is going to sign it into law or again write a big ``no'' on an \ninvestment in America's children. This is a President who says, no, no, \nno, when it comes to investing in our families, but yes, yes, yes, when \nit comes to more troops, more time, more money for his stay-the-course \nplan in Iraq.\n  This is a President who does not see the irony in sticking out the \none hand to ask for $200 billion for Iraq this year, while using the \nother hand to veto health coverage for poor American children. This is \na President who has no problem with killing a child's health bill that \nwould have been paid for with 3\\1/2\\ months of Iraq funding. This is a \nPresident who says: We are fighting them over there so we do not have \nto fight them over here, when what he means is: We are spending all our \nmoney over there, and we do not have it to spend here.\n  In Congress, we want a strong investment in children's health care, \nin stem cell research, in changing the course in Iraq. We have offered \nthose to the President. He has rejected it. The President and his \nallies seem to want to stay the course in Iraq and not much else.\n  Well, America is going to see a lot of ghouls and goblins tonight. \nBut what is truly scary is that the legislative grim reaper that \nthreatens millions of families without health care insurance, the demon \nof oil addiction, and the specter of an endless war, are not going to \nbe gone when we wake up. That is the reality we face. That is why we \ncontinue to challenge to change the course.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our Nation's haphazard trade policy too \noften allows contaminated food and dangerous toys onto our shelves and \ninto our homes, and this administration has done little to curb the \ntoxic tide.\n  Earlier this month, I asked Ohio's Ashland University chemistry \nProfessor Jeff Weidenhamer to test 22 Halloween products for lead. \nThree products tested were found to contain high lead levels. \nAcceptable levels of lead, according to the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, are 600 parts per million for adults. According to CPSC, \nthere is no acceptable lead level for children. A Halloween \nFrankenstein cup that Professor Weidenhamer tested--presumably a cup \nthat may end up in a child's mouth--contained 39,000 parts per million \nversus 600, which is acceptable for an adult, and zero acceptable for a \nchild.\n  For more than 40 years, parents trusted that their children's toys \nwere safe from lead. The safety net secured to help our families is \nbeing systematically dismantled, as the Presiding Officer, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, has pointed out so well, by our Nation's failed \ntrade policies and an apathetic administration. Forty years ago, we \nbanned lead in paint. Now we must ban lead in toys. I am a cosponsor of \nlegislation with Senator Obama that would do that.\n  While a ban on lead in toys is an important step, it doesn't get at \nthe heart of the problem--our failed trade policy. Until we get tough \non enforcing safety standards abroad, we won't be able to prevent \ncontaminated products from ending up on store shelves across the \ncountry and in our homes.\n  Distributors seeking low-cost products stretch supply chains to China \nand cut costs; that is, American companies that import go to China and \nother countries and push them to cut costs, to cut corners, and then \nthose products are brought back into the United States. That means lead \npaint in toys because it is cheaper to buy and to apply, it means too \noften contaminated products in our homes, and it means zero \naccountability.\n  We have not made the importers, the contractors, or the Government \naccountable because of cuts at the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nand because we have a top Commissioner there who has simply weakened \nthat agency and abdicated responsibility. As yesterday's report \nhighlighted, we must do more to ensure the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission has what it needs to do its job.\n\n[[Page S13598]]\n\n  I am a cosponsor of legislation sponsored by Senator Pryor that would \nreauthorize and strengthen the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Its \nbudget is half what it was when it began in the 1970s in real dollars. \nThe staff has dwindled over the years from 1,000, including inspectors, \nto 420. We must instead increase funding and staff at the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission. We must increase coordination between the \nCPSC and Customs officials. We must give the Commission the authority \nto examine and approve other nations' regulatory systems before imports \nfrom a country get onto our store shelves.\n  When we buy tens of billions of dollars of toys, tires, and other \nconsumer products from a country that has weak environmental laws, weak \nfood safety laws, weak consumer protection laws and, at the same time, \nwhen our companies that import from other countries push subcontractors \nin those countries to cut costs, this is what we end up with. That is \nwhy we must give the CPSC the authority to examine and approve other \nnations' regulatory systems.\n  Unfortunately, as imports from China and other trading nations rise \nand the recall of toxic products at home increases, the Bush \nadministration continues to call for more Consumer Product Safety \nCommission cuts.\n  Yesterday, the Times reported that Chairwoman Nord of the CPSC plans \nto actively work to kill the Pryor legislation. That is unacceptable. \nThis administration's apathy for policies that protect our families is \nat best shameful and at worst potentially deadly.\n  One thing I am sure of: It is time for Nancy Nord of the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission chair to step aside. She is the acting \nchairperson but, unfortunately, we have seen a lot more inaction than \nwe have action. It is time to put a chairperson in place who is not \nsatisfied with ``we are doing the best we can.'' We need a chairperson \nwho fights for the authority and the resources the Commission needs to \ndo the job it is supposed to.\n  Her response to the wave of product recalls has been, to put it \ncharitably, underwhelming. She is fighting efforts to make more \ninformation available to the public about product hazards. She opposes \nprotections for whistleblowers who identify shoddy products, and, most \nimportantly, in the face of recall after recall, she has offered no \nplan to equip the CPSC to fulfill its role in product safety. She \nspends most of her time trying to make sure her agency isn't \nscrutinized or held accountable for doing its job. We need a permanent \nchairperson dedicated to doing the most important thing the CPSC is to \ndo--protecting families and our children, not protecting corporate \ninterests.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 3963, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the bill (H.R. 3963) to amend title \n     XXI of the Social Security Act to extend and improve the \n     Children's Health Insurance Program, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to the children's health insurance bill, \nH.R. 3963, occur at 3:45 p.m. today, and that if cloture is invoked it \nbe considered invoked as if the vote had occurred at 6:30 p.m. today \nand concluded at 6:50 p.m., with the time following the conclusion of \nmorning business prior to the vote equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to yield to myself 30 minutes, and \nI also ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy be yielded 30 minutes \nof the majority's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to talk about a couple subjects \nthis afternoon. I am going to begin, however, talking about the issue \nof children's health insurance.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program will be the subject of the \ncloture vote later this afternoon, and it is a very important issue. We \nhave a lot of children in this country who do not have health insurance \ncoverage. Ten years ago, we put together a piece of legislation called \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. It has worked. It has been \nvery successful. Millions of children who otherwise would not have had \nhealth insurance coverage now have health insurance coverage.\n  The President, when he campaigned for office a couple of years ago, \nsaid he supported and wanted to expand the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram to cover more children. The Congress, on a bipartisan basis, \nhas now passed the Children's Health Insurance Program reauthorization \nthat would provide additional coverage for nearly 4 million additional \nchildren in this country--3.8 million additional children, to be exact. \nThe President vetoed it--this after he campaigned saying he supported \nexpanding the program. In fact, not only did he veto the expansion of \nthe program--that was done on a bipartisan basis in the Congress, and \nfully paid for, I might say--but he sent Congress a budget that left 21 \nStates without enough money to continue to cover the existing kids in \nthe program.\n  So this administration has it wrong. That is not just me saying it, \nit is a bipartisan group of Members of Congress who believe very \nstrongly we need to do what is right to try to get health insurance to \nchildren. We should try to make sure every American has health \ninsurance. That is very important. But it seems to me if you do not \nhave legislation that does that, at least start with the children.\n  I have said before, I do not know what is in second or third or \nfourth place in most people's lives in terms of what is important, but \nI know what is in first place in the lives of most people. It is their \nchildren and their children's health. If this is not a priority, if it \nis not a priority at the White House--it passed the Senate with a wide \nmargin, passed the House with a wide margin, but we did not have 67 \npercent of the votes in the House to override the veto--if it is not a \npriority at the White House, I ask what is a priority? If providing \nhealth care for an additional 3.8 million children is not a priority, \nwhat are the priorities at the White House? What is more important?\n  Once again, this may be unfamiliar territory to the President because \nthis is a piece of legislation that is fully paid for, unlike much of \nwhat we get from the White House these days. I am going to talk about \nthat in a bit. But before us here in Congress, the President has two \nrequests. In addition to his regular budget, the President has said to \nus: I want another $196 billion for the purposes of continuing the war \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. And he said: I want the $196 billion declared \nan emergency. I do not propose we pay for it. I propose we put it all \non top of the debt. That will take us to almost two-thirds of a \ntrillion dollars the President has asked for--none of it paid for, all \nof it requested by the President as an emergency.\n  Contrast that, by the way, a $196 billion emergency request--none of \nit paid for--with a bipartisan group in the Congress that says: We \nbelieve the priority is our children. We propose to cover 3.8 million \nadditional kids with health insurance coverage, and we fully pay for \nit. That is a very significant departure from what we hear at the White \nHouse these days.\n  Now the President gases up Air Force One, flies all over the country, \nand flew\n\n[[Page S13599]]\n\ndown to Arkansas not many days ago and said: I am the fiscal policy \nPresident. I am going to get tough. I am vetoing bills. Interestingly, \nhe did not veto a bill in the 6 years his party controlled both \nbranches of Congress. He did not veto bills in the 6 years in which, in \nnearly every case, the appropriations coming out of the Congress \nexceeded his request or at least were dramatically changed from his \nrequest.\n  It is now, only in the shadows, the evening hours of his Presidency \nhe decides he wants to be a fiscal policy President, tough on fiscal \npolicy. The problem is, it is not so much what you say that matters, it \nis what you do that matters, and he has before us one more \ndemonstration of the reckless fiscal policy we have seen now for some \nyears, turning a very significant budget surplus, when he took office--\nand, yes, we had a budget surplus of about $240 billion in that year--\nturning that into a stream of fiscal policy budget deficits, adding $3 \ntrillion to the Federal debt, and asking us, once again: Please give me \nanother $196 billion above all the regular appropriations.\n\n  By the way, even as he asks for the additional $196 billion, he says \nwe cannot afford providing insurance coverage for 3.8 million kids whom \nwe fully pay for in a bipartisan bill.\n  I am telling you, I think the President is wrong. I admire the fact \nthis is a bipartisan bill. We did it the right way. The President will \nhave a second opportunity to have a bill on his desk. My hope is he \nwill understand the good faith and goodwill of bipartisan Members of \nCongress who have the right priorities, saying our children come first \nand children's health insurance is very important.\n\n\n                   Indian Health Care Improvement Act\n\n  Mr. President, that leads me to talk about a health insurance issue \nthat includes the Children's Health Insurance Program but is much more \nthan that. It is a bill that is going to come to the floor of the \nSenate soon, and thanks to the commitment by Senator Reid, the majority \nleader, it is the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct.\n  It has been 8 years since Congress should have reauthorized the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act--8 years--long past due, long past \nthe time for us to have done this. The fact is, in this country we have \n2 million of the first Americans--they were here greeting the folks who \ncame to this country--American Indians, and many of them live in Third \nWorld conditions, and many of them experience health care rationing, \nwhich I think is a scandal.\n  It is not written much about these days, unfortunately. But there is \na full-blown scandal, in my judgment, with respect to health care that \nis not available to American Indians--health care that was promised, \nhealth care that was committed, and health care that is our trust \nresponsibility as a government to American Indians. We made that \ncommitment, and we are not keeping it.\n  Indian children will benefit from children's health insurance as \nwell. But also, Indian children live--and in some cases die--with the \nresults of the Indian health care system.\n  This young lady shown in this picture is a 5-year-old beautiful young \ngirl--sparkling eyes, with a beautiful dress, dancing in the \ntraditional Indian dress--5 years old. Her grandmother, who testified \nat the Crow Indian Reservation, at a hearing I headed with Senator \nTester, held this picture up. Her name is Ta'shon Rain Littlelight--5 \nyears old.\n  Ta'shon died. Her grandmother brought her photograph to the hearing \nand held it high. She talked about her granddaughter. She said Ta'shon \nlived the last 3 months of her life in unmedicated pain, and died of \nterminal cancer. She was taken and taken and taken again to the Indian \nHealth Service, was diagnosed with depression, and treated for \ndepression. Ultimately, it was discovered she had terminal cancer--not \ndepression, terminal cancer.\n  She was flown to Billings, MT, and then to Denver, CO, and this young \n5-year-old is gone. Her grandmother asks the question: Would better \nhealth care have saved her? Should she have been diagnosed in a \ndifferent manner? I don't know the answer to that. I do know this: \nThere are too many children like Ta'shon Rain Littlelight who do not \nhave the same health care as others have, and Ta'shon lost her life.\n  It is not just this beautiful little girl. This is the photograph of \na young girl whose photograph I have shown my colleagues before. Her \nname is Avis Littlewind. Avis Littlewind is also dead--14 years old. \nShe took her own life. Her sister took her own life. Her father died at \nhis own hand. She was in a fetal position in bed in her bedroom for 90 \ndays at age 14, and somehow no one quite figured out this young lady \ndesperately needed mental health treatment. So she took her life.\n  I went to that Indian reservation. I talked to the school officials. \nI talked to Avis Littlewind's classmates. I talked to the tribal \nofficials to try to understand: How does a 14-year-old child fall \nthrough the cracks?\n  Well, there was not mental health treatment available in any \nsignificant way for this young child. The people who would get her \nhealth care would have to beg and borrow a car to drive her someplace. \nBut she is gone. This young girl apparently felt hopeless and helpless \nand took her own life.\n  The question I ask with respect to the mental health treatment she \nshould have gotten--with respect to so many other kinds of health care \nthat should be available to American Indians--the question I ask is: \nWhen? When will they get the health treatment they deserve?\n  This is a picture of a woman from the Fort Berthold Indian \nReservation. I have described her situation to my colleagues previously \nas well. Suspected of having a heart attack, she was put in an \nambulance and driven to a hospital--the nearest hospital off the Indian \nreservation. Arriving at the hospital, as they were carrying her into \nthe hospital, transferring her to a hospital gurney, they discovered at \nthe hospital something taped to her thigh with an ordinary piece of \ntape.\n  Here, as shown on this chart, is what was taped to this woman's \nthigh, as she was taken into the hospital off of a gurney, suspected of \nhaving a heart attack. What they found taped to her thigh was a letter \nfrom the Department of Health and Human Services, and it described that \nthis woman was not going to be eligible for contract health funding \nbecause they were out of money: So if you admit this woman to your \nhospital, understand, you are on your own. Financially, you are on your \nown. We are warning you.\n  That is what the letter taped to this woman's thigh said. That is \nhealth care today in modern America on Indian reservations.\n  Now let me describe why there is an urgency to pass Indian health \ncare legislation, to reauthorize the Act that should have been \nreauthorized 8 years ago.\n  We spend twice as much money per person on health care for Federal \nprisoners incarcerated in our Federal prisons as we do for American \nIndians, and we have a responsibility, a trust responsibility, for \nhealth care for American Indians. This is not being generous. This is \nmeeting a promise America made to Indians. This country made the \npromise over and over again that we would provide for their health \ncare. But we have not met that promise.\n  If you take a look at what we spend per capita for American Indians, \nwhat you will discover is, we spend half as much per person for \nAmerican Indians as we do for Federal prisoners. We have a \nresponsibility for health care for those we incarcerate. I understand. \nIf you stick someone in a Federal prison, you have to take care of \nthem, provide for their health care.\n  Why do we spend twice as much for a Federal prisoner's health care as \nwe did for Ta'shon Rain Littlelight's or Avis Littlewind's or, in per \ncapita expenditures, we do for American Indians? We spend $6,700 a \nyear, per capita, on Medicare expenditures, veterans, $4,600; Medicaid, \n$4,300; Federal prisoners, $3,200; Indian health program; $2,100 per \ncapita. We have to do better than that. We have significant \nresponsibilities, significant problems, and regrettably, full-scale \nhealth care rationing on many of America's Indian reservations, and I \nthink it is a scandal and an outrage and we have to fix it.\n\n  Senator Murkowski and I, as chairman and ranking member of the Indian \nAffairs Committee, have written in our committee a piece of legislation \ncalled the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. We are ready to bring \nthat to the\n\n[[Page S13600]]\n\nfloor of the Senate at last, at long last. Lives will be saved if we \ncan pass this piece of legislation. Senator Reid has given us a \ncommitment that we will have this piece of legislation on the floor of \nthe Senate, and when we do, I think it will be a day of some \ncelebration for American Indians who have been promised health care \nand, regrettably, have not received the benefit of the promises that \nwere made. I am not suggesting there aren't some talented men and women \nwho work in the Indian health care system and who work in public \nhealth. I am not suggesting there aren't some very talented people out \nthere. But I can tell horror stories that are almost unbelievable.\n  A woman goes to the doctor on an Indian reservation, and she has a \nknee that is unbelievably painful--bone on bone. It is the kind of knee \nthat if it belonged to a Member of the Senate or one of the Senator's \nfamilies, they would go and get a knee replacement. Bone on bone, \nunbelievably painful.\n  This woman is told: Wrap your knee in cabbage leaves for 4 days, and \nit will be fine. Well, that is not fine, and that is not medicine. That \nisn't what we should expect in terms of meeting our responsibilities in \nthis country to the first Americans.\n  Again, I asked the grandmother of Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight if I could \nuse her image, and I do so respectfully and I do so understanding the \ndelicacy of it. But when the grandmother came to the hearing and held \nup the picture of this beautiful young girl with the sparkling eyes, \nand said: My granddaughter died, and here is how she died. In 3 months \nof unmedicated pain after her terminal cancer had not been diagnosed \nfor months and months and months.\n  I think it is important for us to ask the question: Does this matter? \nDo we care? I hope the answer is yes, it does matter and, yes, this \nCongress does care and, yes, this Congress is going to meet its \nresponsibility. I hope in the coming weeks that certainly will be the \ncase, starting here in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 minutes remaining.\n\n\n                             Fiscal Policy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to speak about the subject I \nreferenced briefly, and that is fiscal policy and this President. It \ngives me no joy to come and be critical of the President's fiscal \npolicy. But it should give the American people no joy either to \nunderstand the consequences of a fiscal policy that turned very large \nbudget surpluses, which took us a long time to begin to see, into very \nlong-term Federal budget deficits and three trillion dollars of \nadditional debt. That is a reckless fiscal policy and one that has to \nbe fixed.\n  When he recently asked the Congress for an additional $196 billion--\nnone of it paid for, all emergency--the President said: Now we will see \nwhether the Congress supports the troops. Well, the fact is, not all \nthat money goes to the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. A substantial \nportion of that money goes to contractors.\n  I wanted to go through with my colleagues some examples of what we \nare finding with respect to the spending of taxpayers' money for \ncontractors. I believe I have held 17 hearings over the recent 4 years \nas chairman of the Policy Committee on these issues.\n  Let me put up a couple of charts to describe where we are headed.\n  This is a Congressional Budget Office estimate of October of this \nyear. The U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could cost taxpayers a \ntotal of $2.4 trillion by 2017 when you count the very large interest \ncosts because this is being financed with borrowed money. Again, a \nPresident who says he is a conservative borrowing all of this money, \ninsisting it be borrowed and not paid for, and we end up in this \ncountry paying a fortune for the war costs.\n  So the question is, is this money for the troops? Well, let me \ndescribe what we have. Last month, military officials said contracts \nworth $6 billion to provide essential supplies to American troops in \nKuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan--including food, water, and shelter--were \nunder review by criminal investigators. In addition, $88 billion in \ncontracts and programs, including those for body armor for soldiers and \nmaterial for Iraqi and Afghan security forces, are being audited for \nfinancial irregularities.\n  Think of that: $88 billion; $6 billion under criminal investigation; \n$88 billion, financial irregularities by these contractors.\n  Once again, under this President, last month the Army reported that \nit had 78 cases of fraud and corruption under investigation, had \nobtained 20 criminal indictments, and had uncovered over $15 million in \nbribes.\n  Another $196 billion, while those who prance around this money have a \nfield day. It doesn't seem like conservatism to me.\n  Again, in August, 2 months ago, the New York Times reported:\n\n       The enormous expenditures of American and Iraqi money on \n     the Iraq reconstruction program, at least $40 billion over \n     all, have been criticized for reasons that go well beyond the \n     corruption cases that have been uncovered so far. Weak \n     oversight, poor planning, and endless security problems have \n     contributed to many of the program failures.\n\n  So we ante up money from the United States Congress--billions and \nbillions of dollars. We are going to provide health care clinics for \nthe Iraqis. We are going to build 142 health care clinics. We hire the \ncontractor. The money is gone, but the clinics aren't there. An Iraqi \ndoctor--a very courageous Iraqi doctor--testified at one of my \nhearings. He said: I went to the Health Minister in Iraq and said: You \nknow, we had these contracts with an American contracting company that \nwas going to do these 142 health care clinics in Iraq. I would like to \nvisit them. The Iraqi Health Minister said to this physician: You don't \nunderstand. Most of those are imaginary clinics.\n\n  Well, the American taxpayer got fleeced. The money is gone. The \ncontractor got the money. The clinics don't exist.\n  We can't even keep track of the guns that are being sent to Iraq. We \nsent Iraq 185,000 AK-47s, and at this point we know where 75,000 of \nthem are; 110,000 are gone and unaccounted for. We sent them 170,000 \npistols, 90,000 of them we can't account for. Are some of these AK-47s \nand pistols being aimed at American troops? Of course they are. How is \nit that we fund with American taxpayers' money the shipment of massive \nquantities of weapons to Iraq and don't keep track of where they are? \nAgain, there are 110,000 AK-47s, we don't know where they are, and \n80,000 pistols, we don't know where they are. This is almost staggering \nincompetence, in my judgment.\n  Saddam Hussein is dead. He was hanged by the neck. The Iraqi people \nno longer have Saddam Hussein in their lives. The Iraqi people voted \nfor their own new constitution, and they voted for a new government. \nAll that is left for the Iraqi people is to provide for their own \nsecurity. The question is, when will the Iraqi people demonstrate the \nwill to provide for their own security?\n  We have trained 360,000 Iraqis in the interior forces and defense \nforces, soldiers and police men and women--360,000 have been trained, \nand they can't provide for their own defense, for their own security. \nIs there not a will in this country in which Saddam Hussein is gone, a \nnew constitution, a new government exists, and they have 360,000 people \ntrained, and that training was paid for by this country--is there not a \nwill, then, to provide for security? If they can't, we can't. We are \nnot going to provide security in Iraq for the next 5 or 10 years. We \nshould not be going door to door in Baghdad in the middle of a civil \nwar with U.S. soldiers.\n  But it seems to me we should reasonably ask the question: If we have \ntrained 360,000 for security in Iraq, and they can't provide for their \nown security, where are they? We are now told that up to 50 percent of \nthose we have trained are probably not on the job anymore. We don't \nknow where they are.\n  I also just saw information a couple of days ago that the number of \npeople\n\n[[Page S13601]]\n\nwe are training has dropped by two-thirds. I mean, everyone talks \nabout--including the President--the way out of Iraq is to train the \nIraqis for their own security. We have trained a third of a million of \nthem and now we have reduced the amount of training by two-thirds and \nnow we have a surge of American soldiers going door to door in Baghdad \nin the middle of a civil war. I am just saying I don't think that adds \nup in the context of what this administration is asking of this \nCongress.\n  Between April 2003 and June of 2004, $12 billion in U.S. currency, \nmuch of it in one-hundred-dollar bills, was dispersed by the Coalition \nProvisional Authority. That is us. We airlifted billions of dollars in \nC-130s. Some of it was shoveled out the back of pickup trucks in \nBaghdad. You think that doesn't attract flies and people who want to \ncheat and steal? It does. What happened? About $9 billion has gone \nmissing, unaccounted for, in a frenzy of mismanagement and greed, it is \nsaid.\n  ADM David Oliver, who was a senior official of the Coalition \nProvisional Authority was asked by a reporter about what happened to \nthe cash that was airlifted to Baghdad. Our official said:\n\n       I have no idea. I can't tell you whether the money went to \n     the right things or didn't. Nor do I actually think it's \n     important.\n\n  Oh, really? You don't think it is important whether billions of \ndollars was used for the proper purpose?\n  An independent oversight agency reported this month that it could not \ncomplete an audit of a $1.2 billion contract to train Iraqi police \nbecause records kept by the State Department and by DynCorps \nInternational, the contractor, were inaccurate and in disarray, \ndocuments not sufficient to do any kind of an audit.\n  The State Department paid $43.8 million for manufacturing and \ntemporary storage of a residential camp that has never been used. They \npaid $36.4 million for weapons and equipment, including body armor, \narmored vehicles, and communications equipment that couldn't be \naccounted for.\n  Among the problems identified before an audit--this is a New York \nTimes story of this month--were duplicate payments, the purchase of a \nnever-used $1.8 million x-ray scanner, and payments of $387,000 to \nhouse DynCorps officials in hotels rather than other available \naccommodations.\n  My colleagues get my point. I could show 100 charts which would all \nshow in my judgment massive, staggering incompetence and lack of \noversight of these contracts.\n  The President says: I want $196 billion in emergency funding, none of \nit paid for, and by the way, if you don't support that, you are not \nsupporting the troops. Well, a substantial amount of this money is \nsupporting contractors, not troops, and there is substantial evidence \nthat there is dramatic waste, fraud, and abuse of these contracts, and \nno one seems to care. No one seems to be watching the store. That goes \nfor the Defense Department, the Secretary of State, and many others, \nincluding the White House.\n  Finally, when we vote on the issue of whether we should provide \nadditional emergency funding for the President, and yes, for the \ntroops, and also for these contractors, I am going to suggest something \nvery different. Some things are habit forming, and one of them, it \nseems to me, is to ask the Congress to increase spending substantially \nand not pay for it. This President has done this now to the tune of \ntwo-thirds of $1 trillion for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Aside from the fact that I think it is wrong because it doesn't have \nthe country going to war with the soldiers--it seems to me if you send \nsoldiers to war, you also ought to ask the country to be with those \nsoldiers, not just with their thoughts and prayers but also to pay for \nthe cost, rather than charge it to some future generation and have the \nsoldiers fight the battle, and then come back to our country and pay \nthe bills for those battles.\n  So I have said to my colleagues, and I would say to the President, \nwhen we consider this issue of additional funding, I am going to offer \nthis time some ways to pay for a portion of it, and I am going to give \nsome examples. I have used many of these before, but this time, we will \nhave a chance to vote on them. Maybe I will win, maybe I will lose, I \ndon't know. But it seems to me we ought to do some things that are \nthoughtful and patriotic, even as we decide that we are going to \nprovide support to our troops.\n  Let me give an example.\n  Let me give you an example. I have used this many times. This is a \nfive-story white building in the Cayman Islands. A very enterprising \nreporter from Bloomberg named David Evans went to that building. It is \non Church Street. That five-story white building is home to 12,748 \ncorporations. They are not actually there, of course; it is legal \nfiction that was created by smart lawyers to give corporations an \naddress in the Cayman Islands so they can avoid paying U.S. taxes. I \nhave legislation that says it doesn't matter if you are living in this \nbuilding, you are not going to be able to avoid taxes by doing that; if \nyour operations are not there, you cannot attempt to ``move'' your \noperations there to avoid paying U.S. taxes. I will attempt to close \nthat.\n  This is one of the most egregious. Wachovia Bank in the United States \nis one of the most prominent companies to do this. They purchased a \nsewage system in Bochum, Germany. It is not because they have a special \ninterest in sewage systems. They don't want a sewage system. They \nbought it and immediately leased it back to the German city, which \nnever lost it, and the Wachovia Bank never got it. They just had a \nfinancial transaction that gave an American bank a $175 million tax \nwriteoff for the sham of buying a sewer system in Germany.\n  Mr. President, only a portion of this practice has been shut down. I \nwill give my colleagues a chance to shut that down and also raise \nrevenue to begin to pay for some of the costs of the war as well.\n  This one is a streetcar in Dortmund, Germany. We had First Union Bank \nlease streetcars there--not for the purpose of running a streetcar \nsystem; they wanted to avoid paying U.S. taxes. That is a scandal.\n  I will also offer a piece of legislation that will shut down the tax \nscam that says if you fire your workers, close your plant, and move \nyour jobs overseas, as Huffy Bicycles did, we will give you a tax cut. \nIt is unbelievable that we provide that tax cut in this country. If you \nget rid of your American workers, shut down your plant, move overseas, \nand then ship the product back here, you get a tax deferral. Huffy is \nnow a Chinese bike company. All the workers in Ohio got fired, and the \nAmerican tax system gave a reward to this company for moving to China.\n  We have had a chance--four times--to vote on this, and a majority in \nthe Senate supported that tax break. One of these days, it will get \nclosed. We will vote on that in the context of paying for some of the \ncosts the President is asking us to pay for.\n  Finally, just two more.\n  This is, as you know, a picture of the dancing grapes from Fruit of \nthe Loom. We have seen the television commercials. I don't know why \nsomeone would dress up as a grape and dance, but they made an imprint \nfor Fruit of the Loom underwear before they left America. I assume they \nare still dancing, but I assume those who lost their jobs when Fruit of \nthe Loom went to Mexico and other countries are not dancing. It is not \nthat people stopped wearing underwear, but they are not making them in \nthe United States.\n  Finally, the little red wagon--Radio Flyer, a Chicago company for \nover a century--is now made in China. It was for the same purpose: tax \ncuts and low wages in China. I am going to close that loophole with \nrespect to the description I have just given of moving your company to \nChina and getting a tax cut.\n  The point is, the President wants $196 billion in emergency funding. \nI don't know whether the Congress will do that. When the President asks \nfor funding in the future, saying he wants to charge this, leave \noffice, and then somebody else can pay the bill, we in Congress ought \nto say that there are easy baby steps to at least begin raising some \nfunding. I have named three of them. We can stop American companies \nfrom benefitting from buying sewage systems or streetcars in other \ncountries, stop paying an incentive for people to move American jobs \noverseas, and stop allowing companies to set up sham offices on Church \nStreet in the Cayman Islands to avoid paying U.S. taxes.\n\n[[Page S13602]]\n\n  It doesn't take a giant step or a lot of courage to decide to shut \ndown those tax scams and those wrongheaded, perverse economic \nincentives. Doing that will raise money and allow us to offset some of \nthese war costs. And I hope that perhaps--I know better than to say \nthis. I was going to say that perhaps the President will support this. \nBut this administration opposes most of the proposals I have described \nthat would raise funding by shutting down some of these terrible \nloopholes.\n  This issue of if the President asks the Congress for $196 billion--\nwhich he has now done in emergency money, with none of it paid for, and \nsays: Now we will see whether the Congress supports the troops, I want \nmy colleagues to understand that a substantial portion of this money is \nnot going to troops, but it is going to contractors. I think this is \nthe most substantial waste, fraud, and abuse that has existed in the \nhistory of this country, with respect to what is going on with the \ncontractors. That is something we should be considering or a portion of \nwhat we should consider as well as we react to the President's \nproposal. Who is minding the store? Who is providing real oversight? \nWhy have we allowed this to happen? Those represent the hard questions \nI believe Congress has a responsibility to ask.\n  We all want the right thing for this country. I think we all want to \nbe able to extract ourselves from a war in the Middle East, to be \nsuccessful in the fight against terrorism, to expand opportunities with \nan economy that provides jobs and expand the middle class in this \ncountry. We all want to fix the health care system and provide \nsolutions to our energy needs so that we are not so unbelievably \ndependent on foreign sources of energy. We all want that. I hope in the \ncoming weeks, particularly as we end this year, we can find ways to \ndecide to work together. There ought to be common purpose and a common \nset of goals for us to advance the interests of this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum \nand ask unanimous consent that the time be equally charged to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair advises the Senator--no one else is on the floor--the \nmajority has 24 minutes remaining. Senator Kennedy had reserved 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor 10 minutes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Congressional Approval Ratings\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, there are reports in the newspaper about \nthe approval ratings of politicians and political institutions. \nCertainly, the President has had some problems, has had better days. \nHis numbers are low. The numbers for Congress, in many respects, as an \ninstitution, are even lower.\n  Those of us who serve in the Congress are asked from time to time: \nWhat does this all mean? Why are the American people so critical of \nCongress, and what is it doing?\n  I think it reflects several points. First, the last election, which \nchanged control of Congress from Republicans to Democrats, many people \nbelieved would be a watershed, a real change in direction. They have \nlooked and haven't seen it, particularly when it comes to the war in \nIraq. Despite our best efforts in the Democratic majority in the \nSenate, with only 51 out of 100 Members, we sent the President an \nopportunity to change the direction of his policy and start bringing \nAmerican troops home. The President used his power in the Constitution \nto veto that legislation.\n  We tried over and over, with all-night sessions, long debates, a \nvariety of amendments and have not been able to break through and come \nup with a solid enough, strong enough bipartisan majority to change the \npolicies in Iraq.\n  It is frustrating--frustrating, I am sure, to the American people, \nfrustrating to us in Congress, for some who voted against the war and \nnow believe this war has no end in sight and should be ended soon in a \nresponsible way.\n  I think that is an indication of one of the reasons why the \ndisapproval numbers for Congress are what they are today.\n  We tried, however, when it comes to our budget and spending in the \nCongress, to focus resources on the needs of America. We have a chance \nto do that. But, unfortunately, we face another veto threat from \nPresident Bush.\n  Our budget that we passed includes a lot of spending that will make a \nbig difference--more Border Patrol agents to protect America, \nexplosives detection machines in airports, research into cancer, \ndiabetes, heart disease, other major killers of Americans, a much \nstronger food safety inspection system, an issue near and dear to me, \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy projects and tax cuts for \nmiddle-class families.\n  The total difference between our spending and what the President \nrequested is $22 billion out of a national budget that borders on \npassing a trillion, depending on how one counts. That is eight-tenths \nof 1 percent of the Federal budget, the difference between the \nPresident's request and what we are appropriating. That is less than we \nspend in 2 months on the war in Iraq. The money we want to spend in \nAmerica is less than 2 months of the war in Iraq. It is less than half \nof what the President wants to spend next year for tax breaks for the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  We have passed a lot of appropriations bills to meet long-needed, \nlong-neglected wants of middle-class and working families. \nUnfortunately, the President's priorities are different. There is no \nclearer contrast in our priorities and the President's priorities than \nthe issue of children's health insurance.\n  Senator Kennedy has come to the floor, and I am going to yield to him \nin a moment. He has been a national leader, certainly a Senate leader \nwhen it comes to the issue of children's health insurance. Think about \nthis: A great and good and prosperous Nation, America, with 300 million \npeople, has 15 million people without health insurance.\n  Ten years ago, we said: Let's move forward and do something about it. \nA Republican Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program, \nand we managed to find coverage for 6.6 million of those kids. Now with \na Democratic Congress, we want to continue the program and expand it to \ncover more children. So we set a goal of 10 million children. That \nstill leaves 5 million uninsured. But 10 million would be insured over \nthe next 5 years. The cost? An additional $35 billion. The way we pay \nfor it is direct: an increase in the Federal tobacco tax with proceeds \ngoing to insure children.\n  We believe this is sensible, keeping in mind the kids we are talking \nabout are not the poorest kids in America. The poorest kids in America \nare covered by Medicaid. They get help, and I am glad they do. It says \nsomething good about our Nation. The kids who are well off, with \nparents in jobs that have health insurance, have no concern. How about \nthose kids right in the middle? Mom and Dad go to work every single day \nand don't have the benefit of health insurance. They may make minimum \nwage or a little better. They don't have any benefits and the kids have \nno protection.\n  A child without health insurance is less likely to have a regular \ndoctor, regular checkups, regular immunizations, and less likely to \nhave detected in their early lives medical problems which, if left \nuntreated, become very serious and very expensive.\n  We wanted to help those kids. So we put a bill together with the \nsupport of 18 Republican Senators, all 51 Democrats. We had 69 Senators \ncommitted to it. We sent it to the President, and he vetoed it. He said \nit was socialized medicine. I am not sure what that term means today. \nForty years ago, it was the suggestion of too much Government.\n  What the President doesn't tell us, and should, is this program is \nnot about a government health insurance program. Overwhelmingly, the \nhealth insurance for these kids will be provided by private companies \nthat will receive some subsidies, some incentive from the Government to \nprovide this\n\n[[Page S13603]]\n\ncare with the State governments. So it is not socialism, if that is the \nPresident's concern.\n  Secondly, he worried about whether it is fiscally responsible. We pay \nfor it. The President and his war of $169 billion a year is unpaid for. \nHe heaps it on our children and their children by adding to the \nnational debt. We pay for this program.\n  Finally, this notion that somehow we are going to discourage private \ninsurance for these kids, if the private insurance market was so \nanxious to cover these kids, they would have been there long ago. These \nkids have gone months and years without coverage. Now is the time to \nchange it.\n  The President used his veto pen four times since he was elected 7 \nyears ago--once to veto a change in the war in Iraq, two other times to \nveto bipartisan-passed stem cell research, and now in vetoing the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  Senator Reid, the majority leader, came to the floor yesterday and \nsaid: We will give you a little more time to work out our differences \nwith the Republicans, we will have an effort at compromise. They \nobjected to being given a little more time to work this out.\n  We have tried. We have had good bipartisan support for this bill. We \nwant to bring it across the line. We want to pass a bill either the \nPresident will sign or we override his veto, and we are trying to do \nthat.\n  In closing, because I see Senator Kennedy is here and prepared to \nspeak, it will not be long now, maybe a matter of days, before this \nPresident asks for $196 billion for the war in Iraq. Some of us who \nvoted against it are troubled that we continue to see the cost of this \nwar go up in human terms, with almost 3,900 Americans killed, with tens \nof thousands injured, and who knows how many innocent Iraqis lost their \nlives, and the war continues to go on.\n  The good news from Iraq? Oh, they like to tell us the administration \nhas all sorts of good news. The good news is the death rate is down. We \nhave seen ethnic cleansing in neighborhoods and now the vacant \nneighborhoods where 4 million Iraqis have become refugees. These empty \nneighborhoods don't have as much fighting. Is that a victory? I am not \nsure it is.\n  We need to be more honest with the American people. If the President \nbelieves he can ask with a straight face for $196 billion for the war \nin Iraq, if he can ask for that kind of money to help the people of \nIraq, he ought to step back and sign a bill that helps the children of \nAmerica.\n  A strong America begins at home. It begins with strong American \ncitizens, strong families, strong neighborhoods, strong communities, \nand a strong Nation. The President can move us in that direction.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate this week will join us. Let's pass \nthis Children's Health Insurance Program. Let's send it back to the \nPresident. Let's hope, as he considers $196 billion unpaid for his war \nin Iraq, he can find $35 billion paid for the children of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts. The Chair \nadvises the Senator that 15\\1/2\\ minutes remain.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask if the Chair will let me know when there is 2 \nminutes remaining.\n   Mr. President, I wish to first of all thank our friend and colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Durbin, for again making an excellent statement \nabout the Nation's priorities, the priorities we have before us in \nterms of making a judgment about the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. He has spoken frequently, eloquently, and passionately about \nthe issue. He and I are hopeful that across the country Americans are \nable to take a few minutes and really absorb the arguments that are \nmade in the case that is before the Senate and also understand the \njudgments many of us have made on this side of the aisle--virtually all \nof us on this side of the aisle, and some very courageous Republicans--\nabout what our responsibilities should be to the future of our country. \nIt is a future that expects, that demands, and that requires us to give \nattention and assistance, when we can, to our children. This is the \nright thing to do not only from a health point of view, as has been \npointed out so many times, but it also is imperative in terms of \ngetting a handle on health care costs in the future by having a \nhealthier generation, and, importantly, it is imperative as we are \nlooking to the education of this generation.\n   We have made the case time and time again, and we are making \ndifferent points this afternoon, but the fact is if a child can't see \nthe blackboard or hear the teacher or is unable to read the assignment \nbecause they are in need of glasses, that child is not going to be able \nto learn, that child has a better chance of dropping out, and that \nchild has a better chance of living a life that is not constructive, \nproductive, or useful in so many ways. So this case has been made time \nand again, and it is important.\n   We hope, those of us who are supporting this legislation, that we \nwill be able to garner the votes that are essential to getting this \nlegislation into law. So I thank those who have spoken and spoken so \nwell on this issue.\n   Mr. President, as I and others have mentioned, this is really an \nissue of priorities. Nothing points out the issue of priorities more \nclearly than the choice we have between investing in our children--\nAmericas's children here at home, the sons and daughters of working \nfamilies--and investing in the war in Iraq. This point is made \nfrequently but can never be made enough: 41 days of conflict in Iraq at \n$12 billion is 10 million children who could be insured for virtually 1 \nyear. That points to the difference in the choice. On the one hand, we \nhave a President and administration that virtually gives open-endedness \nto the number of days we are going to continue to be in Iraq. Yet, when \nit comes to the question of these 10 million children for the year, he \nsays: Absolutely no. There is no way. We will not permit it, we will \nnot accept it, and we will veto any proposal that comes our way that \nrecommends and suggests it.\n   The administration is quick to highlight their achievements on \nhealth care for children in Iraq, but they won't show the same \ncommitment to the health of our own children. In Iraq, American money \nhas renovated 52 primary care clinics and re-equipped 600 others, but \nin America, children are denied essential medical services in the name \nof fiscal discipline; in Iraq, we have provided 30 million doses of \nchildren's vaccines, but in America we are told we cannot afford basic \npreventive care for 10 million children.\n   The Web site of the U.S. Agency for International Development \nproudly notes the remarkable accomplishment--and I commend them for \nit--that they have successfully vaccinated 98 percent of all Iraqi \nchildren against measles, mumps, and rubella. If only we could do as \nmuch. If only we could do as much for our own children. According to \nthe Centers for Disease Control, only 91 percent of American children \nhave received the same vaccine by the recommended age. The \nadministration should be as concerned that children growing up in \nBoston or Birmingham get their recommended vaccines as they are about \nthe children in Baghdad and Basra.\n   The same Web site proudly notes that the USAID has improved the \nhealth of vulnerable populations in Iraq by increasing access to high-\nquality, community-based primary health care. That is just what we are \ntrying to do in America with this bill. In Iraq, it is an \naccomplishment; in America, it is a veto.\n   A bipartisan majority in Congress has made a judgment too. Our \njudgment is that we must make room for decent health care for America's \nchildren. We must stand up to the empty rhetoric and hollow slogans of \nthe White House and give all children in America the healthy start in \nlife they deserve. We need to know who is for working families across \nAmerica and who will stand in their way to getting quality, affordable \nhealth care.\n  We need to know who is for families such as the Vega family in \nGreenfield, MA. CHIP helps Flora Vega, a working mother, buy an extra \ninhaler for her 5-year-old daughter so she can have one at school and \nthe other at home. CHIP also helped her afford a nebulizer--the small, \nportable device that pumps the asthma medicine into her lungs when an \ninhaler isn't effective. That means her daughter doesn't face sudden \ndangerous attacks of asthma that require her to go to an emergency \nroom.\n\n[[Page S13604]]\n\n   We need to know who is for families such as the Lewis family in \nSpringfield, MA. I met Dedra Lewis and her daughter, Alexsiana, when \nthey came to talk about the difference CHIP has made in their lives. \nAlexsiana has a rare eye disease that requires expensive drops every \nhour of each day. To take care of her daughter, Dedra had to cut back \non her hours at work and lost her insurance. Without CHIP, she would be \nchoosing between paying the mortgage for their home and paying for the \nmedicine the child needs to keep her vision.\n  Family after family, from coast to coast, can tell similar stories. \nThat is why families across America are calling on Congress to renew \nthe promise of CHIP. The task has not been easy, but we will not be \ndeterred or deflected. When Medicare was first proposed in the 1960s to \nallow the Nation's senior citizens to live their retirement years in \ndignity, its supporters were attacked with much the same harsh rhetoric \nas we hear about CHIP--it is socialized medicine, it is a Government \ntakeover. But Congress rejected that absurd rhetoric, and hundreds of \nmillions of senior citizens have benefited immensely ever since. \nAmerica's families face real challenges--higher mortgages, soaring gas \nprices, the ever-increasing cost of health care, and many other \nburdens. They deserve real solutions, but the White House offers only \nhollow slogans.\n\n  Our opponents failed to stop Medicare, and they won't stop CHIP now. \nMedicare didn't pass on the first attempt, but its supporters came back \nagain and again with the force of the American people behind them to \nask--to demand--that Congress act. And the 1964 election made it all \npossible. That is just what we will do with CHIP, even if it takes the \n2008 election to do it. We will keep at it until the children of \nAmerica get the health care they need and deserve and that the American \npeople are demanding.\n  As we have pointed out, at the time we saw this legislation \ndeveloped, when it was initially proposed, it was a compromise between \nRepublicans and Democrats. Those of us who wanted to give attention to \nthe uninsured sons and daughters of working families recognized that we \nhad a unique situation in America: We had resources as a result of the \ntobacco settlement, which provided hundreds of billions of dollars as a \nbonus to America, and we could decide how we were going to expend those \nresources. I saw in my own State of Massachusetts, the determination to \nuse those resources to provide a health insurance program for the sons \nand daughters of working families.\n  That was a very important model that was replicated here over 10 \nyears ago in the Senate, where we used much of the resources that were \nallocated to us to be able to develop the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. There were Republicans on that side who said: Look, we don't \nwant to just extend Medicaid; we want a separate program that will be \nresolved in the States. There were those of us on this side saying: \nMedicaid provides very good health assistance for children; the \npreventive programs are model programs, and they do an enormous amount \nin providing quality health care for children in a wide variety of \nareas and functions. No, our Republicans said, we want the States to be \nable to develop those; we will take guidelines, but we will let the \nStates do it. A compromise was reached between Republicans and \nDemocrats, and that was acceptable.\n  Secondly, it was determined that the States would have the ability to \nmake judgments and decisions about deductibles and copays. We said: No, \nwe want a standard way to make sure all working families are going to \nbe able to acquire it. But, no, we worked out that program, and again \nit was a compromise. It was a judgment and decision of the sponsors of \nthat legislation that we were going to use the private insurance \ncompanies--private insurance companies--to make sure of the delivery \nsystem. Many of us thought it would take a long time to get this \nprogram up if we went that route, but nonetheless it was a compromise. \nIt was a compromise. Democrats and Republicans came together in this \ncompromise program. Very important compromises were made at that time. \nIt reflected the best judgment of the Members of the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives, and that legislation has been an \nextraordinary success.\n  The area where it has not been successful is that we have not reached \nall the children out there who are eligible and should be able to \nreceive it. If we are looking for legislation that really reflects the \nbest of Republicans and Democrats, if we are looking for legislation \nthat basically reflects the best in terms of our priorities, this is \nthat legislation, and now is the time to move ahead.\n  We have a budget of $2.9 trillion. The question is, Can we afford--\ncan we afford--the few billion dollars to provide the type of health \ncoverage in this legislation? We are not even taking the resources from \nthe existing budget. We are saying: What is going to be the result of \nthat, by increasing the cost per package, the 61 cents? The result of \nthat is going to be more children are going to stop smoking. That is \nthe result.\n  If you take the increase in the cost of a pack of cigarettes, we have \nthe real opportunity to see a very important public health \nachievement--discouraging children, the 3,000 children who start \nsmoking every single day, the thousand who become effectively addicted \nfrom their earliest contacts with it. We discourage them from moving \ndown that pathway. So this is a positive health development both in \nterms of the resources and in terms of the outcome. Unique. Unique.\n  Just to finalize here, we are enacting new legislation--those of us \nwho believe in it--to address some of the real challenges and make this \na fairer and more equitable country. We have the example of the \nexisting program in place now. It works. It works. It is successful. \nParents need it, and parents want it. The only issue--the only issue, \nthe only issue--is whether we have the willingness and the will to \nimplement it and to make it achievable for families in this country. We \nare talking about those working families, those mothers who hear a sick \nchild cry in the night and wonder whether that child is $423 sick, \nbecause that is the average cost of going to the emergency room; those \nfamilies who pray their child, who has an earache or a throat ache, \nwill be better in the morning. How do you put a cost on that? How do \nyou put a cost on that? Well, we recognize that as a real value, and we \nare not prepared to let parents make that kind of judgment call and \nfeel that kind of pain and that kind of fear and that kind of anguish.\n  This legislation does the job, and it is important that we get a \nstrong, overwhelming vote this afternoon that really reflects the good \njudgment of the American people, who say children should be first in \nthis Nation. That has been a founding value of our Nation since the \nPilgrims settled up in my part of the country, and I believe it is a \nvalue that is shared today. We will have an opportunity to vote on this \nin a short time. Hopefully, it will be accepted overwhelmingly in the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation in \nwhich the Senate finds itself at this moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the majority has expired. The \nRepublicans have 59\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes. Should a Member of the Republican side of the aisle seek the \nfloor, I will be happy to yield at that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the reauthorization \nof the Children's Health Insurance Program and why those who are \nopposing the bill are making this a nightmare for children. When I \nfirst came to the floor in support of the bill on July 31, I knew there \nwere those who did not share my support, but I thought they would \nmerely be a road bump to reauthorization. Now it seems we have a \nroadblock to children getting critical care they need.\n  How many times can you veto or vote against children receiving health \ncare and not raise a question as to your role as a representative of \nthe people? How many times can you veto or vote against children \nreceiving health care and then turn around and take pictures with \nbabies and families back in your\n\n[[Page S13605]]\n\nhome State? How many times can you veto or vote against children \nreceiving health care and then still argue that you care about the \nwell-being of children other than your own?\n  I don't understand how we have gotten to this point, but let me make \nthis very simple. The bill at its core provides health care for poor \nchildren. Yet there are those in Congress and the White House who are \nmissing that bottom line. More important, their votes are hurting our \nNation's children.\n  There are 9 million children in America who suffer in silence because \nthey do not have health care; 6 million of them are eligible for the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program or Medicaid, but they are not \nenrolled.\n  That keeps me up at night. I hope it keeps up at night others who \nhave to cast a vote soon as well.\n  I want to be sure we know the families and children we are talking \nabout. The families we seek to cover work every day at some of the \ntoughest jobs in America--some of them jobs none of us would want to \ndo, but they work at it every day. They work at jobs that offer no \nhealth care coverage whatsoever and they do not make enough money from \ntheir employment to afford private coverage. It is the children in \nthese families we are trying to cover. So let's talk about the reasons \nwhy there are those who continue to vote to bar children from health \ncare.\n  That is strong language, but I have had enough of sugar-coating this \nissue. The new bill includes substantial revisions to try to reach out \nto colleagues who have raised issues and directly addresses a number of \nthe concerns they have talked about. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the new bill would continue to cover nearly 4 million \nuninsured children by 2012, at a cost of about $35 billion over 5 \nyears. That is a fraction of what we spend in Iraq. That is in addition \nto the over 6 million children already covered by this program.\n  Those opposed to this bill have been shouting about how the bill \nneeds to cover more low-income children. Good news, the new bill would \nfurther increase our focus on covering the lowest income uninsured \nchildren. The new bill would prohibit any coverage above 300 percent of \nthe poverty line, except for some who have already been grandfathered \nin. Limiting new coverage to 300 percent is a harder line than the \noriginal bill, and it is a concrete ceiling for new coverage. It also \nchanges the financial incentives States receive to enroll more \nchildren, and it ensured we are targeting the enrollment of low-income \nchildren.\n  The new bill only provides these incentives to States when they \nenroll Medicaid-eligible children and no longer includes incentives for \nenrolling SCHIP children, as was in the original bill.\n  In fact, this new bill will cover an additional 100,000 children as \ncompared to the original bill, for a grand total of 3.9 million \nchildren gaining coverage under the bill on which we will be voting \ncloture. Of these children, essentially half are Medicaid eligible. \nThese children are the low-income children many of our colleagues are \ntalking about. This new bill brings in 200,000 more Medicaid-eligible \nchildren than the first bill.\n  We have listened and we have made changes. But compromising on \nchildren's health can only go so far. The second issue I have heard, \nand it makes my blood boil, is the argument that undocumented \nimmigrants would gain coverage under this bill. I know it is Halloween \nso we are going to scare the American people as best we can, but this \nis a tactic that cannot stand. Let's make it clear: Undocumented \nimmigrants are not eligible for Medicaid and CHIP, they have never \nbeen, and nothing in this bill changes that. Nothing in this bill \nchanges that. It is a shame there are Members who still come on the \nfloor using that argument.\n  In fact, the new bill tightens citizenship requirements. States will \nseek to verify names and Social Security numbers but also have to \nverify citizenship with information from the Social Security \nAdministration. The Social Security Administration will check the \ninformation received from the States to determine that the information \nmatches and also check to see if the database shows that the applicant \nis a citizen. If they can confirm--great. We have another citizen with \nhealth care. If not, the State has to require original documents to \nprove citizenship. This is in no way an open door, and in no way should \nwe allow this to continue to be used as a false reason to not give \nhealth care to children in this country.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to stop tying up this issue, trying to make \nchildren's health care an immigration debate so we can have it every \nnight on the nightly news being about immigration. Oh, it is about \nimmigration. It is not about immigration. It is about children's health \ncare; children who do not have it, cannot afford it, and will not have \nit unless this Congress acts.\n  Some have also raised the question about adults. The reality is we \ncover some parents. This administration gave us waivers to do it \nbecause they said it is a good thing: Let's cover parents who are also \nin these jobs, working hard, not able to afford health care, not \ngetting it at work--because we are getting more children involved \nthrough their parents. By the way, we happen to cover more Americans--\nisn't that a terrible thing? We happen to cover more Americans, of the \n47 million who have no health care coverage whatsoever. It is a \nterrible thing.\n  I think it is quite a good thing. I have seen it succeed in my home \nState of New Jersey. We have found a strong correlation between \nenrollment of parents and enrollment of children.\n  Finally, if values match our actions, this bill needs to be supported \nby all Members in the House and Senate and signed into law by the \npresident. It is time for President Bush to stop making his fiscal \nconservative bones on the health care of children. It is time for the \nPresident to put away the veto pen and allow doctors to take out their \nstethoscopes to make our children healthier. It is time to give the \nchildren of America what the President and every Member of the Senate \nand Congress has, health care coverage, health care for America's most \nprecious asset but also its most vulnerable asset--our children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes of time \nspeaking about the ``revised'' SCHIP bill and what it means to the \nAmerican people. The rhetoric associated with the bill is that we want \nto cover children. That is a laudable goal. But that is not what this \nbill is about. If that were what this bill is about, what we would be \ndoing is having a bill on the floor that expands the current payments \nof $5 billion a year to $7 billion a year, which is what is required by \nthe CBO to truly cover the kids whose parents make $41,000 a year or \nless. That is not what this bill is about.\n  The bill is about having the American taxpayers, and especially the \npoor American taxpayers, pay $133 billion over the next 10 years to \ncover families presently with insurance.\n  What does the Congressional Budget Office say about this bill? First \nof all, it spends $400,000 more than the bill the President vetoed; it \ncovers 500,000 fewer kids. It still maintains that 10 percent of the \npeople in 2012 on SCHIP will be adults. It gives exemptions for the \nState of New Jersey--a family of five earning $89,00 a year, they will \nstill be covered. It creates loopholes where rural hospitals get paid \nthe same as metropolitan hospitals, as a favor or an ``earmark'' to \ncertain Members of Congress.\n  What it does not do is solve the problem. What is going on here? \nThere is not anybody in America who does not think we corporately \nshould be helping poor children with their health care. But this isn't \na bill about helping poor children with their health care; otherwise, \nwe would not be taking 1.2 million middle-income kids and putting them \non SCHIP, at the same time the only increase we see on the poor kids, \nfamilies making under $40,000, is $800,000. So what is going on? What \nis going on is this is a political campaign. It is a political campaign \nthat, under the guise of helping children, what we want to do is start \nthe march toward single-payer, government-run health care. That is OK \nif you believe that and you want to put that out. But this idea of, we \nare going to wink and nod to the American public under the name of poor \nchildren when, in fact, this bill will cover not poor children and 10 \npercent of the people covered will be\n\n[[Page S13606]]\n\nadults 5 years from now and we are going to take kids off their \nparents' insurance.\n  One of the things people will not talk about is in 35 States, the \nSCHIP program is Medicaid. Of those 35 States, over 50 percent of the \ndoctors will not see a Medicaid child. Why is that? Because Medicaid \nwill not pay a rate at which the doctor can pay their overhead and \nstill see the child. So what we are going to do is we are going to take \nthe parents' right away to choose the doctor they want for their kids, \nand we are not going to lower their insurance premium at all by taking \nthe kids off--the ones who have insurance, the 1.2 million who the CBO \nsays will come off private insurance--and then we are going to take \naway the parents' right to pick the doctor to care for their kid.\n  What this is, is moving to single-payer, government-run health care. \nWhat I would say is, if that is what we want to do, let's call it that. \nBut that is not what we are calling this. We are claiming we want to \nhelp poor children.\n  President Bush got it right. Before we expand to families of $60,000 \nor $80,000 a year who have insurance and put them on a Government \nprogram, shouldn't we make sure the program we have now has enough \nmoney to cover the kids whose families make under $41,000 a year? And \nshouldn't we make sure that, when we say we are giving you coverage, we \nare giving you coverage?\n  The other thing we ought to ask is: Why aren't the American people \ngoing to get value out of this? The cost in this program, to buy $2,300 \nworth of insurance--and that is the highest level at which the average \nkids cost, the average is probably around $1,700--why would we be \nspending $4,000 in this bill to buy $2,300 worth of insurance? The \nAmerican people have to look at that and say: What is wrong with this \npicture?\n  The other side of it is we are going to get all the money, we say, by \ntaxing tobacco. Who pays tobacco taxes? Who are the majority of people \nin this country who pay tobacco taxes? I will tell you who they are, \nthey are disproportionately poor. They are disproportionately the \ndisadvantaged. They are disproportionately those people who can least \nafford to pay a tax. So it is no wonder the CBO, in this evaluation of \nthis program, said: This is the most regressive tax we have seen in \nyears. It is going to hurt the very people we say we want to cover. \nDoes the Senator have a question?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Will the Senator yield for a couple of questions?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. You know, the Senator from Oklahoma and I agree about \nan awful lot when it comes to fiscal discipline, but I am having a \nlittle trouble. I am hoping he can help me with this problem I am \nhaving. I am willing to bet the Senator from Oklahoma may have been one \nof the Senators who said no to Medicare Part D. I am guessing. I would \nhave to check the vote.\n  Mr. COBURN. I wasn't in the Senate or the Congress.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I forget the Senator is a newcomer. I would be \ncurious. This is where I don't understand the Senator's concerns about \npolitical gamesmanship and trying to make this about the children, and \nso forth.\n  On the other hand, I am trying to figure out the President's \nposition, and maybe the Senator can explain to me why no means testing. \nYou know, $170 billion and basically no way to pay for it was not a \nproblem for the President of the United States with Medicare Part D. \nThey were jumping up and taking credit for it then. There was \nabsolutely no means testing, and it was much more expensive than this \nprogram.\n  The question is, what is the difference? Why is it that the President \nhas a problem with this program, when Medicare Part D, with no means \ntesting, no way to pay for it, was just fine?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would be remiss if I thought I could speak for the \nPresident. But I will tell you what this Senator thinks. Medicare Part \nD hung on the shoulders of our children $8.3 trillion worth of unfunded \nliabilities.\n  So today we are giving prescription drugs to seniors, and we are \ntaking away future opportunity from our kids. Had I been here, I would \nnot have voted for Medicare Part D. In fact, I lobbied a lot of my \nformer friends from the House to vote against Part D. That is not what \nwe are talking about today.\n  What we are talking about today is, if we are going to have a program \nfor poor children, which I support, we at least ought to cover up to 95 \npercent of the kids who are eligible before we expand the eligibility. \nThat is where the $7.8 billion over the next 5 years needs to be added \nto this program, and then with the caveat that says: States, you cannot \ngo to the higher income until you cover the poor.\n  This is a typical example of what Washington does and America rejects \nall the time. We do not measure what we are doing to see if we are \naccomplishing things. What we do know about SCHIP is that in many \nplaces it has been a valuable lifesaving tool for the poor people in \nthis country. But, in fact, the States have done a poor job of \nenrolling many of those kids.\n  What we also know about SCHIP is that 35 of the States put their kids \non SCHIP into Medicare. Now, what does that mean? Since you get no \nchoice of half the doctors who are out there who are eligible to care \nfor the kids, what we have said is, we are going to give you care, but \nyou get no choice. You get care, but you get no choice. You get no \nfreedom when the Government helps you with who your child is going to \nsee.\n  So I do not doubt that there are inconsistencies in any President's \nposition. I can debate Medicare Part D all day. I am with you. I am on \nyour side. But the point is, this debate is not about helping kids. \nThis debate is about changing the underlying structure of our health \ncare and starting to build a Medicare from the ground up, and we have a \nMedicare here and merging them in the middle.\n  I am willing to debate that, too, but I want us to be honest about \nwhat we are debating; otherwise, we would not have a family of five in \nNew Jersey making $89,000 a year eligible under this program, someone \nwho already has insurance.\n  So here is the question for the American people: Do you want to pay \ntaxes to buy health insurance for 1.2 million kids, for parents who \nalready have it, and give them a program that is subpar to what they \nalready have with no decrease in the insurance cost to parents for the \ninsurance they are covering now? That is the question.\n  And do we have a way of covering poor kids that would be better? I \nwould propose to the Senator from Missouri that a refundable tax credit \nto poor children, allowing their parents to have enough money to buy a \npolicy, which the average is truly $1,700 per year, per kid, a \nrefundable tax credit that gives them the freedom to choose any doctor \nthey want, that does not put a Medicaid on their forehead, that \nautomatically excludes 50 percent of the physicians in this country, is \na far better way to do it and a more equitable way to do it.\n  If we did that, that would pay for itself without raising taxes \nanywhere because you would eliminate the cost shifting that goes on in \nthe health care industry for the kids who do not have care today. And \nwe will not raise taxes on the poorest of the poor because that is who \nis going to be paying for this.\n  Plus, we all know, 21 million new Americans are not going to start \nsmoking. We all know that. But yet that is how we chose to meet the \nrequirements of pay-go here, through a false claim that we will have \nenough revenue to pay for it by raising the tax on cigarettes.\n  So I am all for having a debate on national health care. Senator \nWyden and I and Senator Bennett and Congressman Conyers and myself and \nSenator Burr had that debate in New York this week at the New School. \nThat is a good debate to have. But this is a slight. This is a slight \nabout what we are doing. And the question to the American people has to \nbe: Do you really think, if you are making $45,000 a year or $65,000 a \nyear, that your taxes ought to go up to pay for somebody who is making \n61,000 or less, and at the same time limit the availability of those \nsame children to have the physician of their choice? That is what we \nare talking about. I believe we ought to cover poor children. I think \nthat the SCHIP program now ought to be held accountable to cover the \npoor children. If we are going to pay for it, I am willing to\n\n[[Page S13607]]\n\nput the money and find offsets somewhere else to pay for it, if we do \nnot do a tax credit.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield for a \nsecond, as he well knows, I voted with him. I voted with the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma to try to pull some of the earmarks out of the bill, to \npull all of that money out of children's health insurance. I think he \nand I both agree on the goal.\n  The problem is, the question I wanted to ask--and he is not in a \nposition to answer it because, unfortunately, he is not someone who was \nhere who voted for Medicare Part D, but the inconsistency as to what I \nhear from the White House and what I think people in this Chamber are \nhearing from the Senators who voted for Medicare Part D is, every \nargument they are using for SCHIP is true but exponentially higher in \nMedicare Part D.\n  By the way, the only difference is in Medicare Part D the people who \nare making the money are the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance \ncompanies, and it is not funded and multimillionaires and billionaires \nget it. So it is so unfair to say that the President is taking a \nprincipled stand because if it were a principle, it would have been \nconsistent for both SCHIP and Medicare Part D. That is the question \nthat you are unable to answer, and I have yet to hear anybody answer \nthat question.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I reclaim my time to say the following: I \nthink the Senator from Missouri makes a good point on consistency. I \nthink they are finally awakened to what the American people want at the \nWhite House. I think they are finally starting to pay attention that \nbeing efficient in the Federal Government is important.\n\n  But having not been, maybe, efficient with Medicare Part D, I applaud \nthe President for now taking a stand on something that is common sense \nthat would say: If we are going to have a program for poor children, \nlet's make sure it covers poor children. Let's make sure it covers poor \nchildren. Right now it does not. Right now it does not.\n  Rather than expand the program that is not meeting what it is \nsupposed to do and raise taxes on the poorest of the poor, I think the \nPresident's response and the CBO's score, which is $7.8 billion more \nover the next 5 years instead of $35 billion more over the next 5 \nyears, is a reasonable response to really cover poor children.\n  And what we know, by what CBO says, is that will do it. Now, let's \ntalk about the difference in what we are going to be having the cloture \nvote on now versus the bill that the President just vetoed. This bill \ncovers 400,000 less kids; it spends $500 million more. So we are not at \n$4,000 anymore, we are at about $4,200 to buy $2,300 worth of health \ninsurance. It does not fix the fast lane for illegal immigrants as the \nauthors claim. It does not fix adults on the SCHIP program.\n  CBO says in 2012, at least at a minimum, 10 percent of the enrollees \nwill still be adults. It does not fix the crowdout issue. This bill \nwill cause 2 million people to lose private insurance coverage and come \nin a government-run program, crowding them out of the private insurance \nmarket. Despite a fix for the problem of enrolling more higher income \nkids than currently eligible kids in SCHIP, the CBO still projects only \n800,000 currently eligible, currently eligible SCHIP kids, will get \nenrolled.\n  But 1.2 million kids of families making more than $60,000 will get \nenrolled. So for every two kids we enroll who are poor, we are going to \ntake three kids out of the private sector. We have talked about what \nkids lose when they go to the Medicaid Program.\n  What are the other problems? In this bill are earmarks for specific \nhospitals to violate CMS payment rules to pay those hospitals more than \nwhat the rules say because some Congressman or Senator thinks they \nshould not have to live within the rules. I would love to be able to \ntell that to people in a community in Oklahoma who just had to shut \ndown their hospital because they could not make it under what CMS rules \npay.\n  So what we have is about seven of those in here, where we are going \nto take care of the little hospitals of seven Members of Congress, but \nwe are going to ignore all of the rest of the community hospitals in \nthis country that are struggling under a payment system that does not \npay for the care of people they are supposed to be caring for.\n  There is still an income disregard loophole, which means it does not \nmatter what you said because we have a loophole that says if States \nwant to, they do not have to follow the income guidelines. You can \nstill enroll families making more than $100,000 a year in the SCHIP \nprogram.\n  Well, that is in there by design because the desire and design of \nthis bill is to move to single-payer, national health care.\n  I think the Presiding Officer sitting in the chair right now probably \nbelieves that is where we should go. I do not have any problem debating \nthat. But the incrementalism and the real effort of this bill is to \nexpand SCHIP to a point where Americans who have insurance are going to \npay higher taxes so everybody can get covered. If you look at the mess \nthat is trying to be created by these five or six hospitals in here \nright now, how are we going to solve that problem when everything is \nMedicare?\n  Some say we are going to take the profit motive out of medicine. We \nare going to take the profit motive out of the drug industry. We are \ngoing to have a 220,000-physician shortage in 15 areas in this country. \nThe applications for enrollment at medical school are diving. Why are \nthey diving? Because they cannot afford the education and then have an \nincome to pay off their student loan, let alone pay for housing and \nincome to feed their kids.\n  How did that come about? It could have been Medicare creating that. \nIt could have been that we were not willing to pay. What else is going \nto happen? Eighty percent of all innovation in health care in the world \ncomes from this country. Eight out of every ten new ideas that are \nlifesaving, eight out of ten of every new treatments, eight of ten new \ndevices are developed in this country.\n  Why are they developed? Because we still have 48 percent of the \nhealth care system that is not run by some government program. And \nthrough there, there is enough risk taken, based on the reward that can \nbe gained, to invest in capital and research to develop these \nlifesaving treatments.\n  We say we want to move SCHIP in the name of kids, but what we really \nwant to do is to have national health care. Well, we better think about \nthat hard and long because here are the statistics on cancer treatment \nin this country compared to everywhere else in the world. It does not \nmatter what cancer you get in this country, you have a 50-percent \ngreater chance of living 5 years than anywhere else in the world.\n  Why is that? Is it those big, bad pharmaceutical companies that have \nto spend a billion dollars just to get through the maze at FDA? Is that \nwhat it is? Is that why? I am a two-time cancer survivor. I am so \nthankful for the pharmaceutical industry. I would not be here without \nthem. Two times they have developed, researched, and made drugs that \nhave saved my life.\n  I do not disagree that we have some excesses in corporations in this \ncountry. But the pharmaceutical industry, with all the negatives that \nare out there, still leads one of the most positive responses we have \never seen in this country to solving real problems for real \nAmericans. So we can beat them up and we can beat the President up and \nsay Medicare Part D. I do regularly on Medicare Part D. I don't think \nwe ought to steal from our children to have drugs paid for. But this \nbill steals from everybody. It also steals from the poorest. It steals \nfrom the poor, blue-collar, low-income worker who has the benefit of a \nlot of other programs. It says: We are going to raise your taxes \nbecause you happen to be addicted to nicotine. We are going to steal \nfrom you to pay for somebody who is making $61,000 a year who already \nhas insurance. Do we want to do that? Do we want to steal from the \npeople who are working, barely getting by, so we can pay for people who \nalready have insurance? Is that what we are doing? That is what we are \ndoing.\n\n  I have listened to the debate. I offered some ways to change this. \nSenator Burr and I offered an amendment. We didn't get a vote on it. It \nsolves through tax credits a way to insure, not go into a Medicaid \nprogram but insure with choice, so you take the stigma of Medicaid off \npatients' foreheads.\n\n[[Page S13608]]\n\nWe offered a way that every kid could get covered. It is called a \nrefundable tax credit. It can only be spent on health insurance or \nhealth care. But people don't want to do that. Why would those who are \nmore progressive in thought not want to do that? Because they offered \nthe original income tax credit. Why would they not want to do that? It \nis because the agenda is different than we say it is. The agenda is to \nstart toward a nationalized, single-payer, government-run, no-choice \nhealth care system that will eliminate that 80 percent of innovation in \nthe world made by American ingenuity, American capitalism, American \nidea that ``I will invest some of mine to see if I can come up with an \nidea that will help somebody else and, by the way, I will profit from \nit.''\n  What we are saying is, we don't want markets to work. We want the \nGovernment to run it. If you think about everything else we have today, \neverything with the exception of health care and primary and secondary \neducation, we believe in markets. They have been very good to us. They \nhave given us the highest standard of living of any society ever in the \nhistory of the world. They have advanced causes in terms of treatment \nof disease more than any advancement ever in the history of the world. \nWhat this bill is about is saying: We don't believe markets ought to \napply.\n  Myself, Richard Burr, and five others have a bill called the Health \nCare Quality and Choice Act. It creates a tax credit for everybody to \nbuy their health care. We treat everybody the same. Everybody gets the \nsame amount. Everybody gets to buy a private health insurance plan. We \ncreate a market so the insurance industry doesn't steal 25 percent of \nthe cost of that. We set up a way to create markets. The Every Child \nInsured Act, legislation offered by Richard Burr, creates a way where \nevery kid is covered. Senator Martinez and Senator Voinovich have a \nbill that covers up to 300 percent with tax credits of all the kids in \nthe country who don't presently have health insurance. This bill isn't \nabout covering kids. This bill is about putting the Government in \ncontrol of the last 48 percent of health care. As P.J. O'Rourke says, \nif you think health care is expensive now, wait until it is free.\n  A couple other things the American people should know is that England \nis pouring billions of dollars into their national health care system \nnow. Why? Because on average when you get cancer in England, up until \n18 months ago, once you were diagnosed, you waited at least 12 months \nbefore treatment started. They have a goal by 2010 to get to 3 months \nto start your treatment. Do you know what the average length of time, \ninsured or uninsured, in this country is from the time you have a \ndiagnosis of cancer until you start getting treated? It is 3 weeks and \n2 days. Why do you think we are doing better than they are on these \nthings?\n  We are about to go into a system that destroys innovation, destroys \nquality. I agree, there is plenty wrong in health care. I have a bill \nthat changes us toward prevention. I am all for working on the problems \nwe have in health care. But the question the American people ought to \nask is, do we want to tax ourselves to pay for care for kids who are \nalready covered in the name of not doing a good job under the SCHIP \nbill now, and should we have the kids who need to be covered covered \nbefore we start reaching beyond those who already have care? They are \nnot going to answer that question. Because the real debate is, the \nfirst step is to get away from your choice of choosing a doctor, your \nchoice of what facility you will go to, your choice in getting to \nchoose what drugs you will take and what options you will have, because \nthe Government bureaucrats are going to decide all that for you.\n  If you believe that is not true, look at what Medicare is doing right \nnow for women who have osteoporosis. They get diagnosed with a DEXA-\nscan. They get treatment. But because doctors in this country have \nordered too many DEXA-scans, according to the bureaucracy in Washington \nknown as the Center for Medicare Services, we have now limited \nphysicians. You can't check to see if the medicine you are giving is \nworking and maybe change the medicine to give them one that might be \nworking, because a bureaucrat has decided we are doing too many tests. \nThat is called rationing. That is why health care costs are lower \naround the world, because they let people die from cancer. They let \npeople die with a broken hip. They let people die with congestive heart \nfailure.\n  We don't. We value individual lives and we are willing to put the \nresources in for the best, longest, and best quality life. Don't be \nfooled about what this bill is about. This bill is the first step \ntoward national health care. This bill fails to address the problems in \nSCHIP as they are today. This bill raises taxes on the poorest of the \npeople in the country--all in the name of having a political issue in \n2008 to say those people who oppose this don't care about kids. I have \nspent my whole life delivering babies, 4,000 of them now. That is a \nfalse claim. If you care about these kids, you will balance the budget, \npay for the war by the expensive, duplicative, wasteful programs we \ncould eliminate. We would have a balanced budget, and we wouldn't be \ncharging the very thing we are getting ready to pass on to our kids, \nwhich is a $300 billion deficit this year alone. Caring about kids \nmeans you will make the tough choices, that means you go against the \ninterest groups to do what is right for the future, not what is best \nfor the next election.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I believe on the Democratic side we may be \nout of time. On the Republican side, there is time left. I ask \nunanimous consent to borrow some of the Republican time.\n  Mr. COBURN. There is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I have a limited amount of time, but I want to highlight a couple of \nthings about the State Children's Health Insurance Program legislation. \nAll of America knows about it. We have been debating this for weeks, \nand we will continue. Obviously, there are differences of opinion about \nwhat to do about health care generally. I will focus on one argument \nthat has been made against this, that somehow if the Federal Government \ncontinues the State Children's Health Insurance Program and adds \nfunding--we had an overwhelming vote here in the Senate, and we will \nhave that again today, a veto-proof endorsement of the program and the \ndollars to back it up by an increase in the cigarette tax--what has \nbeen debated back and forth is the coverage and who gets covered and \nwho doesn't.\n  People across America have heard a lot about 200 percent of poverty, \n300 percent of poverty. These numbers get thrown around. Two hundred \npercent of poverty means a family of four is making $41,300. Most of \nthe families covered by this program and that would continue to be \ncovered or would be added to the coverage are in that range and below \n200 percent of poverty. I want to put up a chart that walks through \nthis in terms of a family. If we look at 32 States, we have about 32 \nStates that set the income eligibility for the Children's Health \nInsurance Program at 200 percent of poverty, $41,300. Of course, 201 \npercent would be 1 percentage point above that. So let's say a State \ndoesn't allow and the Federal Government won't allow States to go above \n200 percent of poverty. Here is what families are facing, getting by on \n$41,507, for an example, in a rural county in Pennsylvania. If you look \nat a family of four with two children, take-home income is $2,893; \nhousing, $726; childcare, $1,129--even if you got a child credit, it \nwould still be a big number; $609 for food; $446 for transportation; \nphone service, $45; total $2,955. That is their expenses. Then you add \nin the number from up top, the income level, the monthly income, the \ndifferential between the income and the expenses, you get a minus of \n$62. Let's say that is off by a couple hundred dollars. Let's say those \nnumbers are off by a few hundred dollars give or take. It doesn't \nmatter. Because either way you cut it, if a family is faced with the \nbasic necessities of life, not factoring in school supplies, not \nfactoring in an emergency for a child hospitalization, not factoring in \nother things that families have to deal with every day, whether it is \nan extra rent payment or an increase in rent, whether it is a pair of \nshoes or sneakers for a child, none of that is\n\n[[Page S13609]]\n\nfactored in there, this family is still behind at 201 percent of the \npoverty level.\n  I have been hearing for weeks from the President--we have all heard \nfrom him when he makes public pronouncements--that somehow this program \nis going to families who don't need it; their incomes are too high; it \nwill go above that. Yet now you have Senate and House negotiators who \nhave worked out an agreement where they put a ceiling at 300 percent \nbecause of objections that were raised. I don't know what more we can \ndo. The President apparently thinks this program works. He says he \nsupports it. His measly increase would actually lead to a reduction of \nthe number of American children who are covered. But he says he \nsupports the program. He says he wants to increase it. He said, when \ncampaigning, that we should add millions more. Yet he is the roadblock \nin front of progress on this issue.\n  This illustration is right on target in terms of what a real family \nfaces. One more point about this. Think about what it costs; even if \nyou have a family who has coverage through their employer, that family \nmay have to deal with a similar situation. We all know that the average \nmonthly premium for family coverage is about $300. In either scenario, \nthey are up against a lot paying for children's health insurance, and \nthis is at a fairly low income level for a family of four. That \nargument makes no sense.\n  I will conclude with one other argument. There were representations \nmade over many weeks now by the President. He kept pointing to States \nsuch as New York and New Jersey as examples of how these numbers would \nget too high and the income levels would get too high. I can debate him \non that point, but I will put that aside for a moment. What he didn't \ntalk about and what some of his allies have not talked about is the \nfact that this isn't just about what happens to children in urban \nareas. We know from history, from 10 years of evidence, this program \nnot only works generally, but it works particularly well for poor kids. \nIt works particularly well for African-American children. We have cut \nthat rate of uninsured a lot. It works particularly well for urban \nchildren who happen to be Hispanic. But what the President doesn't want \nto admit is that it also helps a lot for rural children.\n  Today in America one-third of all rural children--we have a lot in \nPennsylvania, a lot of children who live in rural communities--get \nMedicaid or SCHIP. Thank God we have those programs for rural kids and \nfor urban kids and all the rest.\n\n  I will give you two examples, and then I will conclude. Pennsylvania \nhas a broad middle. We have a lot of smaller counties, many of them \nrural. To give you two examples: Clarion County and Huntingdon County--\none is in the middle of Pennsylvania toward the southwest and one, \nClarion, is up almost in the northwestern part of our State.\n  Under the Bush plan, if the President were to get his way, under his \nchildren's health insurance proposal, here is what would happen in \nClarion County, PA. Between fiscal year 2008 and fiscal year 2012, it \nis estimated 146 children would lose coverage. OK. Go a couple counties \naway to Huntingdon County--a small rural county--and in that same time \nperiod of 2008 to 2012, 129 kids would lose their coverage.\n  Now, I think it is a tragedy for 1 kid or 5 kids or 10 kids to lose \ncoverage, but now you are talking about hundreds of kids in two small \ncounties in terms of population.\n  What is the comparison to the bipartisan children's health insurance \nproposal? Clarion County would gain 278 children, Huntingdon County \nwould gain 247. So instead of losing about 130 to 150 in each of those \nsmall counties, we gain 250 children or more, maybe as high as 280 \nchildren.\n  So that is the difference. We can talk all we want about percents of \nincome in all the States. I am looking at two counties in Pennsylvania \nthat happen to be smaller in population and that happen to be largely \nrural, and I know hundreds of children who get coverage now will not \nget that coverage in those two counties; and hundreds of children would \nget coverage under the bipartisan children's health insurance \nlegislation.\n  I do not know what more the Senate and the House can do on both sides \nof the aisle to plead with the President to go along with what the \nAmerican people have told us overwhelmingly. There are a lot of things \nwe disagree about in the Senate and across the country, but very few \nAmericans now disagree that investing in children in the dawn of their \nlives is a good idea for that child, for his or her community, and for \nour economy long term.\n  So we will continue to make the case up until and through the vote \ntoday. But I think this is critically important for the children of \nAmerica, all the children of America--urban, suburban, rural or any \nother way we classify where our children live. For their sake, and for \nthe sake of the long-term economic future of the country, I believe the \nState children's health insurance legislation is urgently needed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, to quote Yogi Berra: It feels like deja \nvu all over again.\n  Here we are again debating the State children's health insurance \nbill, or SCHIP as we all know it by. I know colleagues are tired of \nthis issue and frustrated by the process.\n  I do think, though, we have an opportunity to move forward and to \nbring this issue to closure. I think my colleagues should be aware of \nmany of the improvements that have been made to the bill that has \npassed the Senate twice. These improvements were negotiated in a \nbipartisan manner with the Senate and the House in order to help \npersuade Members who have indicated a willingness to support the SCHIP \nbill.\n  A lot has been said about who is or is not negotiating the bill. Some \nhave been critical because they have not been part of those \ndiscussions. To them I would say: Stop trying to kill the bill if you \nwant to be a part of the negotiations. It makes no sense to negotiate \nwith Members who have said they are never going to vote for the bill.\n  So we have been trying to figure out a way to make the bill better. \nHere is where we are so far:\n  There is more of an emphasis upon poor kids. Everybody has been \nsaying: We ought to emphasize getting kids under 200 percent of poverty \ninto the program. We have rewritten the bill to make that more certain. \nIt is probably still not satisfactory to some people so far, but we \nwill continue to work on that.\n  Then there is the whole New York $83,000 red herring issue, and that \nwas in the President's veto address. But remember, it was not in our \nbill. But somehow somebody told the President it was in the bill, and \nthen the President, in his veto message, referred to a reason for \nvetoing the bill was the $83,000 issue with New York. That has been in \nthe law for 10 years. What we did--so the President could not say that \nanymore--is we made clear this was not going to happen in any State.\n  Then we took care of the childless adult issue. In the original bill, \nyou remember, we phased out childless adults covered by the SCHIP \nlegislation, and we phased them out in that bill over a 2-year period \nof time. We now have that down to a 1-year period of time.\n  Premium assistance is strengthened. A technical clarification to the \ncitizenship documentation provision in the bill has been made. That is \nnot all. More work yet this morning--with Senator Baucus and me and \nsome House Members--more work is underway trying to work with those who \nare sincerely wanting to vote for a children's health insurance bill.\n  We are working on a potential amendment to this bill that will go \nfurther to address putting kids under 200 percent of poverty first, \nstrengthening the private coverage options, and further clarifying that \nno illegals can get onto the program.\n  Now, you understand, all these things are what our intention is. But \nsomehow, through statutory language, we have not been able to make it \nclear enough. So we are going back and trying to make it more clear as \na practical matter, maybe doing in a real\n\n[[Page S13610]]\n\nway what we intended to do that maybe when we wrote the language \nunintentionally was not accomplished.\n  Now, to the point of illegals, Members who are working to kill this \nbill have tried to make it seem like this bill opens the floodgates to \npeople who are in our country illegally getting onto the health \nprograms. To keep asserting this is as responsible as yelling ``fire'' \nin a crowded movie theater.\n  The latest assault is being leveled at the provision based on a bill \nauthored by no other than Senator Lugar. It is a provision called \nExpressLane, which allows States the option--just the option--to \nestablish income eligibility based on eligibility for other means-\ntested programs. ``ExpressLane'' is the new poster child now for those \nwho scream ``illegals'' as a way to kill the bill.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the ``ExpressLane'' option in the bill \nclearly requires a State to confirm the citizenship of applicants. I \nwant to make that clear. The ``ExpressLane'' makes sure you have to be \na citizen of the United States.\n  Since some Members clearly are not reading the bill, let me read from \nthose provisions:\n\n       Verification of citizenship or Nationality status: The \n     State shall satisfy the requirements of section 1902(a) \n     (460)(B) or section 2105(c)(10), as applicable for \n     verifications of citizenship or nationality status.\n\n  I don't know how much more clear it can be, and I hope it puts to \nrest a very sad mischaracterization of the bill.\n  To sum up, the bill before us now is an improvement on the bill that \npassed the Senate. It strengthens the number of provisions that \nRepublicans have been concerned about. I hope with the amendment I am \nworking on with Chairman Baucus, Senator Hatch, Senator Rockefeller, \nand Members of both parties from the House of Representatives, that we \nwill be able to increase the number of Republicans who vote to support \nthis bill here in the Senate.\n  I support cloture in the vote just coming up and I ask my colleagues \nto do it so we can proceed on this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote \nthe same way.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 450, H.R. 3963, Children's Health \n     Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007.\n         Max Baucus, Harry Reid, Benjamin L.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to H.R. 3963 to amend title XXII of the Social \nSecurity Act to extend and improve the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Bayh), the \nSenator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. \nObama), and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nDelaware (Mr. Biden) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 62, nays 33, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 401 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--62\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n\n                                NAYS--33\n\n     Allard\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Obama\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 62, the nays are \n33. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, while everybody is here, there will be no \nmore rollcall votes today. I am going to be meeting shortly with \nSenator McConnell to find out when the next vote will be. The next vote \ncan only come about with a unanimous consent request. I will work with \nSenator McConnell to see if we can come up with an easier lift than \nwhat is required under the rules.\n  Under the rules, we will vote at approximately 1 a.m. Friday morning \non the next aspect of this procedure we have on the CHIP bill. We will \nvisit in a short time to see if we can change that time in any way. \nAgain, that would have to be done by unanimous consent. As we know, if \nany one person doesn't like it, it will not happen. Otherwise, the next \nvote will be likely at 1 a.m. Friday morning.\n  As I said, I will do everything I can to see if we can make it more \nconvenient for the Members, as I am sure Senator McConnell will. We \nhave, on this most important issue, to make sure that the necessary \nparties are contacted and that everybody knows exactly what they are \ndoing. So until further notice, the next vote will be at 1 a.m. Friday \nmorning.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator cannot reserve the right to \nobject.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the Senate is now considering what is \nessentially a do-over bill. The majority seems to believe that what \ndidn't pass muster the first time and was vetoed by the President can \nnow be successful. Well, it can't be, and my friends on the other side \nof the aisle know that.\n  The reason we have this do-over bill before us is because, I believe, \nthis process has become more about scoring political points than making \ngood policy. When the other Chamber passed this bill--and they rammed \nit through, in essentially 1 day--not only did they not pick up any \nvotes, they actually lost one vote on the House side.\n  Then the majority in this body bypassed the committee process where \nboth parties would have had a chance to strengthen the bill and brought \nit directly to the floor.\n  Last Friday, the majority filed cloture on the motion to proceed, \nforcing this vote today. It is the majority that wanted to vote on this \ndo-over bill, not my side of the aisle.\n\n[[Page S13611]]\n\n  The majority is also expected to fill the amendment tree to prevent \nRepublican Senators from offering amendments and closing loopholes in \nthe bill. All of that suggests to me that this is about politics, \nreally, and not policy.\n  So the bill before us is almost like a sequel of the bill that was \nvetoed the last time. And like any sequel, it is even worse the second \ntime around.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office estimates, this bill \nactually covers 400,000 fewer children than the original SCHIP bill. \nYet it costs more--a half billion dollars more.\n  Our friends on the other side argue that their do-over bill will \nserve low-income children first. But instead of requiring that low-\nincome children be served first before expanding the program to cover \nthose beyond 200 percent of the Federal poverty level, this bill \nexpands the program to cover families making as much as 300 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level.\n  This will repeal the requirement that the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, Mike Leavitt, just recently put in place that States \ncover 95 percent of low-income kids before they expand.\n  This bill also contains an ``income disregard loophole'' that would \nallow States to ignore thousands of dollars of income when determining \nSCHIP eligibility. States could essentially define a family's income at \nwhatever level they see fit.\n  Democrats also argue this do-over bill will only serve children, not \nadults. Even that is not the case. While this legislation would phase \nchildless adults out of the program within 1 year, parents would still \nbe eligible.\n  Put it all together, and we have a bill born out of a process that is \nfocused more on scoring political points than making good policy, and \nit is certainly not one I intend to support.\n  I urge my colleagues to re-engage in communication and consultation \nwith this side of the aisle. Together, we can craft a bill that keeps \nits focus on low-income children and can actually receive a \nPresidential signature. That is the way to accomplish real results for \nthe American people. We Republicans stand ready and willing to do just \nthat.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, what is the matter before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed to the Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak as in morning \nbusiness, and I speak out of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I commend and offer my wholehearted \nsupport for the resolution that Senator Durbin has submitted. His \nresolution, which I am proud to cosponsor, is a simple, clear statement \nof a fundamental constitutional principle; namely, that the Congress \nand only the Congress has the power to declare war. As this resolution \nstates:\n\n       Any offensive military action taken by the United States \n     against Iran must be explicitly approved by Congress before \n     such action may be initiated.\n\n  The President is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. But the \nPresident of the United States, although Commander in Chief of the \nArmed Forces, is not a dictator. The President is not an emperor. He is \nPresident, who, like all Presidents, takes an oath of fealty to the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  It is the American people--the American people--who pay the price of \nwar in blood and in treasure. And it is the American people, through \ntheir representatives in Congress--that means us--who must give their \napproval--the approval of the American people--for such a momentous \ndecision. That is the system that George Washington recognized when he \npresented his resignation to the Continental Congress. That is the \nsystem that the wise Framers of the Constitution created when they \ndrafted our most basic and sacred document. That is the system that \nevery Senator takes an oath to defend.\n  Today is a fitting day to discuss the issue of Iran. Today is All \nHallows Eve--Halloween--a day when people don masks and costumes to \nfrighten others. The White House has been busy unleashing its \nrhetorical ghosts and goblins to scare the American people with claims \nof an imminent nuclear threat in Iran, as they did with Iraq. But while \nfew people doubt the desire of some in the Iranian regime to attain a \nnuclear bomb, there is little evidence that Iran is close to acquiring \nsuch a weapon. Fear, panic, and chest-pounding do not work well in the \nconduct of foreign policy. This is a time to put diplomacy to work. \nThere is ample opportunity to coordinate with our allies to constrain \nIran's ambitions. But instead of working with our partners, the Bush \nadministration has unveiled new unilateral sanctions against Iran. \nInstead of direct diplomatic negotiations with Iran, the Bush \nadministration continues to issue ultimatums and threats.\n  We have been down that path already. We know where it leads. Vice \nPresident Cheney recently threatened ``serious consequences''--serious \nconsequences--if Tehran does not acquiesce to U.S. demands--the exact \nphrase that he, the Vice President, used in the runup to the invasion \nof Iraq. The parallels are all too chilling. President Bush warned that \nthose who wished to avoid World War III should seek to keep Iran from \nobtaining nuclear weapons. Secretary of Defense Gates has admitted in \nthe press that the Pentagon has drafted plans for a military option in \nIran. The President's $196 billion request for emergency war funding \nincluded a request for bunker buster bombs that have no immediate use \nin Iraq. Taking all of this together--the bellicose rhetoric, the \nneedlessly confrontational unilateral sanctions, the provocative \nstationing of U.S. warships in the region, the operational war \nplanning, and the request for munitions that seem designed for use in \nIran--these are all reasons for deep concern that this administration \nis once again rushing headlong into another disastrous war in the \nMiddle East.\n  The Bush administration apparently believes it has the authority to \nwage preemptive war. It believes it can do so without prior \nCongressional approval. That is why the resolution of Senator Richard \nDurbin of Illinois is so critical--namely, the White House must be \nreminded of the constitutional powers entrusted to the people's \nbranch--that is us, the House of Representatives and the Senate. I urge \nmy colleagues to join Senator Durbin and me on this important \nresolution and halt--halt--this rush to another war. Let us not make \nthe same disastrous mistake as we did with Iraq.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, may I speak for 12 minutes as in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13611-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13611-S13617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ON THE NOMINATION OF MICHAEL MUKASEY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, the Senate is now called upon to \nconsider President Bush's nominee to succeed Alberto Gonzales as \nAttorney General of this Nation the person we must rely on to repair \nwhat has been left broken to uphold the rule of law where political \nloyalties once ruled and to lead the Department of Justice forward at a \ntime of upheaval; and of urgency.\n  In many ways, President Bush has made a fine appointment in Judge \nMichael Mukasey; far better than we have come to expect in this \nadministration. He is not a political hack. He is not a partisan \nideologue. He is not an incompetent crony. We have had our share of \nthose. No, he is a brilliant lawyer, a distinguished jurist, and by all \naccounts a good man.\n  And no one feels more keenly than do I the need for repair and \nrecovery of the Department of Justice. In a small way, I served this \nDepartment, as a U.S. Attorney, and I feel how important this great \ninstitution is to our country; and how important an Attorney General--\nsuch as Judge Mukasey could be--is to this great institution.\n  I wish it were so easy. But there are times in history that rear up, \nand become a swivel point on which our direction as a Nation can turn.\n  The discussion of torture in recent days has made this such a point. \nSuddenly, even unexpectedly, this time has come.\n  It calls us to think--What is it that makes this country great? \nWhence cometh our strength?\n\n[[Page S13612]]\n\n  First, of course, is a strong economy, to pay for military and \nforeign aid activities; to attract the best and the brightest from \naround the world to our land, and to reward hard work and invention, \nboldness and innovation.\n  Now is not the time to discuss how we have traded away our heartland \njobs, how our education system is failing in international competition, \nhow a broken health care system drags us down, how an unfunded trillion \ndollar war and the borrowing to pay for it compromise our strength. For \nnow, let me just recognize that a strong economy is necessary to our \nstrength.\n  But a strong economy is only necessary, not sufficient. Ultimately, \nAmerica is an ideal. America for centuries has been called a ``shining \ncity on a hill.'' We are a lamp to other nations. A great Senator on \nthis floor said ``America is not a land, it's a promise.''\n  Torture breaks that promise; extinguishes that lamp; darkens that \ncity.\n  When Judge Mukasey came before the Judiciary Committee, he was asked \nabout torture and about one particular practice which has its roots in \nthe Spanish Inquisition. Waterboarding involves strapping somebody in a \nreclining position, heels above head, putting a cloth over their face \nand pouring water over the cloth to create the feeling of drowning. As \nSenator John McCain, who spent years in a prison camp in North Vietnam, \nhas said, ``It is not a complicated procedure. It is torture.''\n  The Judge Advocates General of the United States Army, Navy, Air \nForce and Marines have agreed that the use of simulated drowning would \nviolate U.S. law and the laws of war. Several Judge Advocates General \ntold Congress that waterboarding would specifically constitute torture \nunder the Federal Anti-Torture Statute, making it a felony offense.\n  Judge Mukasey himself acknowledged that ``these techniques seem over \nthe line or, on a personal basis, repugnant to me.'' He noted that \nwaterboarding would be in violation of the Army Field Manual.\n  But in our hearing last week, asked specifically whether the practice \nof waterboarding is constitutional, he would say no more than: ``if it \namounts to torture, it is not constitutional,'' and since then he has \nfailed to recognize that waterboarding is clearly a form of torture, is \nunconstitutional, and is unconditionally wrong.\n  There are practical faults when America tortures. It breaks the \nGolden Rule--do unto others as you would have them do unto you, \nenshrined in the Army Field Manual with the question, if it were done \nto your men, would you consider it abuse?\n  There are practical concerns over whether torture actually works, \nwhether it is sound, professional interrogation practice. I am not an \nexpert, but experts seem to say it is not.\n  But the more important question is the one I asked earlier--whence \ncometh our strength as a nation? Our strength comes from the fact that \nwe stand for something. Our strength comes from the aspirations of \nmillions around the globe who want to be like us, who want their \ncountry to be like ours. Our strength comes when we embody the hopes \nand dreams of mankind.\n  September 11 was a terrible catastrophe that rocked our Nation to its \ncore. But tens of thousands of Americans, nearly 30,000 men, died in \nthe Argonne Forest, and we did not lose our character as a nation. Are \nwe not as strong now as then?\n  September 11 was a terrible catastrophe that challenged our economy, \nour politics, and our way of life. But Japan withstood two nuclear \nexplosions, and it is today an economically and culturally vibrant \ncountry. Are we not made of stuff as strong as they?\n  September 11 was a terrible catastrophe, and it lives on as a test \nfor our Nation. But the real catastrophe would be if we sell our \nbirthright for a mess of pottage, if we sell our destiny as a lamp to \nother nations and a beacon to a suffering world, for bits of coerced \nintelligence.\n  I don't think anyone intended this nomination to turn on this issue. \nSo many of us saw with relief an end to the ordeal of the Department of \nJustice, and wished this nomination to succeed.\n  But for whatever reason, this moment has appeared, unbidden, as a \nmoment of decision on who we are and what we are as a nation. What path \nwill we follow? Will we continue America's constant steady path toward \nthe light?\n  Will we trust in our ideals? Will we recognize the strength that \ncomes when men and women rise in villages and hamlets and barrios \naround the world and say, that is what I want my country to be like; \nthat is the world I choose, and turn their faces toward our light?\n  Or, to borrow from Churchill, will we head down ``the stairway which \nleads to a dark gulf. It is a fine broad stairway at the beginning, but \nafter a bit the carpet ends. A little farther on there are only \nflagstones, and a little farther on still these break beneath your \nfeet''? Will we join that gloomy historical line leading from the \nInquisition, through the prisons of tyrant regimes, through gulags and \ndark cells, and through Saddam Hussein's torture chambers? Will that be \nthe path we choose?\n  I hope not.\n  I am torn--deeply torn between this man and this moment. This is a \ngood man, I believe. But this moment can help turn us back toward the \nlight, and away from that dark and descending stairway. If this moment \ncan awaken us to the strength of our ideals and principles, then, with \nwhatever strength I have, I feel it is my duty to put my shoulder to \nthis moment, and with whatever strength God has given me, to push \ntoward the light.\n  One might argue that this makes Mr. Mukasey an innocent victim in a \nclash between Congress and the President--that no nominee for Attorney \nGeneral will be able to satisfy Congress or the American people on the \nquestion of torture, because the President or perhaps the Vice \nPresident will not allow any nominee to draw that bright line at what \nwe all know in our hearts and minds to be abhorrent to our Constitution \nand our values.\n  That is exactly the point. If we allow the President of the United \nStates to prevent, to forbid, a would-be Attorney General of the United \nStates--the most highly visible representative of our rule of law--from \nrecognizing that bright line, we will have turned down that dark \nstairway. I cannot stand for that. I will oppose this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, it is my understanding that we are in the \n30 hours of postcloture on the motion to proceed on SCHIP. Am I \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thought it might be a good idea for somebody to actually \ntalk about that. To quote from Shakespeare:\n\n       A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\n\n  But the so-called new SCHIP plan is essentially the same as the old \none, and it still stinks.\n  I rise today to speak about the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, or what people on Capitol Hill are calling SCHIP.\n  SCHIP was created by a Republican Congress in 1997 to help low-income \nkids get health insurance. The goal of the program is to help kids who \ndo not qualify for Medicaid but also cannot afford to get health \ninsurance on their own, receive the care they need. This program was \ntemporarily extended until November 16, 2007, which is coming up \nshortly. I am here today to speak about how important it is for \nCongress to work with the President to reauthorize this critical \nprogram in a way that gets every single low-income child who needs \ninsurance insured.\n  If it were not for politics, this would have been solved last week. \nIt would have been solved last month.\n  We have been working on this issue in the Senate for a few months \nnow. And the longer we work on it, the more political it becomes. I \nworried that some Members in this Chamber have lost sight of the goal: \nmaking sure all the low-income children in this country have health \ncare.\n  The press has been reporting that Members of the body have claimed \nthat all the concerns were addressed in the last version of the bill \nthe House voted on last week. That is not correct. The concerns were \nnot addressed. This so-called new bill still fails to put low-income \nchildren first by gutting the administration's requirement to enroll at\n\n[[Page S13613]]\n\nleast 95 percent of the kids below 200 percent of poverty before \nexpanding the program to cover the higher income population.\n  This so-called new bill still expands the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram to higher income families by using income disregards, which is \nclarifying certain expenses so they do not count toward income. How \nmuch are we going to let people exclude and still consider them poor?\n  When the House debated this bill last week, Representative Dingell, \nthe chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, participated in the \ncolloquy with Representative Burgess and explained how the income \ndisregard loophole works.\n  What this means in plain English is, the majority party knows there \nis a provision in the bill that could lead to children from families \nearning over $100,000 going into Government health care. This is \nexactly what I mean when I say we have lost focus when it comes to this \nbill. This program is intended to help low-income kids, not kids in \nfamilies earning as much as $100,000 a year.\n  The so-called new bill still allows the enrollment of adults, though \nthe bill does transition childless adults off the SCHIP into Medicaid. \nParents still receive SCHIP coverage.\n  The so-called new bill still removes 2 million individuals from \nprivate coverage and puts them on Government-run health care at the \ntaxpayer's expense.\n  Congress needs to ensure this program is paying for health insurance \nfor kids who do not currently have health insurance, not switching kids \nfrom private insurance to Government-run health insurance.\n  We need to help all Americans get health insurance, but there are \nbetter, more efficient ways than spoiling a good children's plan. I \nhave introduced a first-class, 10-step plan that would help us achieve \nthe goal of comprehensive health care reform for every American. Any \none of those steps would improve the situation for almost all \nAmericans. All 10 steps would improve it for every American.\n  But to get back to what is wrong with this new bill, the so-called \nnew bill still expands SCHIP to illegal immigrants by weakening \ncitizenship verification requirements. Let me repeat that. This so-\ncalled new bill still expands the SCHIP program to illegal immigrants \nby weakening citizenship verification requirements.\n  Now, the so-called new bill still is not paid for. It is relying on a \nbudget trick to get around the budget rule. I am the only accountant in \nthe Senate. I am sure there are others who can count. There are \ndocuments that show this information, but this so-called new bill still \nincludes a tobacco tax increase, and the proposed tax hike is highly \nregressive, with much of the tax burden being shouldered by low-income \ntaxpayers.\n  Now, I am not a fan of tobacco. I have spoken on this floor many \ntimes about why I am so adamantly against tobacco usage. But using a \ntobacco tax to pay for children's health insurance does not make sense \nbecause you have to keep the program funding level stable in the \nfuture, and that would require 22 million more smokers.\n  We are going to help children's health by talking 22 million more \npeople into smoking and keeping the ones who are smoking now from \nquitting? It does not sound like a health care plan to me.\n  The so-called new bill still contains district-specific earmarks. \nAgain, we know we have lost focus on children's health insurance when \nthe bill contains earmarks for certain districts. Clearly, the so-\ncalled new bill has not changed that much from the previous bill. We \nhave to put low-income kids first, and this bill does not do that.\n  I have cosponsored the Kids First Act, S. 2152. The bill would \nprovide Federal funding for children in need and require the money \nactually be spent on children from families with lower incomes.\n  This bill is a good step in the direction of the compromise, and I \nhope the majority will see that and start working with the minority to \npass something the President can sign rather than putting the kids in \njeopardy by continuing to play politics.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention what a great job my home State \nof Wyoming is doing in the way that they are administering SCHIP. \nWyoming first implemented its SCHIP program, called Kid Care CHIP, in \nWyoming in 1999. In 2003, Wyoming formed a public-private partnership \nwith Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Wyoming and Delta Dental of Wyoming to \nprovide health, vision, and dental benefits to nearly 6,000 kids in \nWyoming. That is a pretty significant part of our population. Wyoming \nis the least populated State in the Nation.\n  These partnerships have made Kid Care CHIP a very successful program \nin Wyoming. All children enrolled in the program receive a wide range \nof benefits, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, lab \nand x ray services, prescription drugs, mental health and substance \nabuse services, not to mention dental and vision services.\n  Families share in the cost of the children's health care by paying \ncopayments for a portion of the care provided. These copays are capped \nat $200 a year per family--not per child, per family.\n  Wyoming is also engaged in an outreach campaign targeted to find and \nenroll the additional 6,000 kids who are eligible for the Kid Care CHIP \nbut are not enrolled. I am proud of the great job Wyoming is doing in \nimplementing its program.\n  I am proud to say that even if the program were not reauthorized, \nWyoming has enough money to run its program for another year because \nfolks there know how to budget and plan. I sure hope it does not come \nto that. We need to get it extended. We need to get it extended right \nnow.\n  I hope Congress will be able to set the politics aside and put the \nkids first. We have a job to do for all the kids in the States that are \nnot as fiscally responsible as Wyoming. They will start running out of \nmoney, so we owe it to them to work across the aisle and with the \nPresident and get a bill signed into law. I will cover this some more \ntomorrow when more have spoken and there are some arguments to counter.\n\n  There is a way that we can come to a compromise and arrive at a \nsolution. In fact, some of the negotiations I was involved with last \nweek I thought had been reached. And then when I saw the bill that was \nvoted out by the House, I saw a little recidivism there. I thought we \nhad done better than that. But, obviously, we had not. Obviously, we \nneed to keep working.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Mukasey Nomination\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my great honor to serve in the \nSenate and represent my State of Illinois. It is a singular honor and \nresponsibility.\n  Unlike the House of Representatives where I was honored to serve for \n14 years, in the Senate we are often called on to judge people; not \nideas, not bills, not expenditures, but people. I think it defines one \nof the fundamental differences between the House and the Senate.\n  So often when it comes to the President's appointments and Cabinet \nofficials, those who serve us in public life, we have to take the \nmeasure of a person and decide whether that person is the right one for \nthe moment, if that person has the integrity and the skill and the \nvalues to serve this great Nation.\n  It is a heavy burden. Sometimes I am sure I have gotten it wrong, and \nother times right. You are never quite sure. In this situation, as a \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am faced with this question \nabout filling the vacancy after the resignation of Attorney General \nAlberto Gonzales.\n  I was not a fan of Attorney General Gonzales. I voted against his \nnomination. There were many reasons. I will not go through the long \nlitany. But I did not believe he was the right person for the job. I \nthought his appointment to lead the Department of Justice was the \nappointment of a man more loyal to a President than to our Constitution \nand his special responsibility in our Cabinet.\n  But even beyond that, I was haunted, haunted by the involvement of \nAttorney General Gonzales in a historic decision made by the Bush \nadministration.\n  America has never been the same since 9/11/2001. We can all recall \nexactly where we were at that moment, the\n\n[[Page S13614]]\n\nhorror that came over us as we realized how many innocent Americans \nwould lose their lives with this unprovoked terrorist attack on the \nUnited States, the grief we shared with families and friends after that \nloss, witnessing all of the funerals and hearing all of the sad \nstories.\n  Determined, this Congress came together in a matter of days and \ndeclared war on those responsible. Now there have been many times in my \npublic career when I have been called on to decide whether to go to \nwar. These are the decisions which may look easy from the outside but \nare never easy.\n  You know that when a nation goes to war, people will die. You hope it \nwill be the enemy, but you know it will be some of our own, and \ninnocent people as well. You find yourself tossing and turning thinking \nabout what is the right thing to do.\n  When it came to the declaration of war on the Taliban and al-Qaida \nfor what happened on 9/11, there was no tossing and turning. With \nresolve, the Senate unanimously voted to embark on that war, to make it \nclear that the United States would not tolerate what had happened on 9/\n11.\n  Of course, shortly thereafter, another challenge presented itself to \nthe Senate when it came to the war in Iraq. I thought that was a much \ndifferent issue. In fact, I thought it was an unwise policy decision to \ngo forward. I joined 22 of my colleagues in voting against the \nauthorization for the use of military force by President Bush.\n  I think history has shown that the decision to go to war in Iraq was \none that was ill-fated and may go down as one of the worst decisions in \nthe history of our Nation. But what happened in addition to those two \ndeclarations of war is also going to be written in the annals of \nhistory.\n  What did we do to protect America? Well, if you look back in our \nhistory, you will find that whenever we are insecure and frightened and \nbelieve we are in danger, we make a number of decisions to find \nsecurity and peace of mind. Then over time we reflect on those \ndecisions. And over time some of them do not stand the test of being \nconsistent with our basic values.\n  We were debating some of those decisions even today in the Judiciary \nCommittee. The question of warrantless wiretapping, the conflict \nbetween privacy and security. It is almost always an issue when America \nis at war or there is a question of our security. It is an issue today: \ntelephone records, records of e-mail traffic, and so forth.\n  What right does the Government have, and under what circumstances can \nthe Government violate the privacy of an individual in an effort to \nprotect our Nation? That debate will continue. It is far from resolved.\n  But there was another debate involved after 9/11 that I did not \nanticipate. I did not imagine at the time, in all of my grief and all \nof my concern, that this administration would actually call into issue \nthe question of how America would treat its prisoners after 9/11.\n  The reason it never dawned on me was the fact that for decades now \nthe United States has been in a position of global leadership when it \ncomes to the morally right position on the treatment of prisoners.\n  We have prided ourselves on our coauthorship of the Geneva \nConventions, an international standard of conduct relative to the \ntreatment of prisoners in a time of war. We have prided ourselves on \nour own Constitution which bars cruel and unusual punishment. We have \nsaid that a democracy, the one we revere, the one that is part of our \nvery national being, is a civilized nation, a nation that will draw \nlines and live by those lines when others might not.\n  Other countries in the world think perhaps we get on a high horse \nsometimes when it comes to this. Each year the Department of State puts \nout a human rights scorecard on the world. We grade the world on issues \nsuch as torture, treatment of prisoners, treatment of political \ndissent, use of child soldiers, genocidal policies. The United States \nmakes an announcement: These are the countries that are not living up \nto those standards. We stand in judgment of other nations. That is why \nit came as a surprise to me, as slowly the information trickled out \nfrom this White House and this administration, that the Bush \nadministration was raising fundamental questions about whether we would \nchange the way we treated prisoners, detainees in the so-called war on \nterrorism.\n  As we learned, some of the decisions of this administration were \nparticularly troubling. They called the Geneva Conventions, which had \nguided us for almost half a century, quaint, and some referred to them \nas obsolete; they said that we had to do more when it came to terror. \nIt appears at some point there was a change of heart in the \nadministration and they backed off some of the early harsh language in \nthe so-called Bybee memo and went on to revert to some standards closer \nto where our Nation had always been. The fact is, there was not only \nactive discussion, but it appears there was active conduct involved in \nthe treatment of prisoners far different than what we had said to the \nworld was our standard of treatment and our standard of care.\n  I am old enough to recall the Vietnam war. I often say to groups I \nspeak to in Illinois and other places that certain words bring certain \nimages. When the words ``Vietnam war'' are brought to mind and I am \nasked of the first snapshots in my mind, the first one that presents \nitself is the black-and-white grainy photograph of the mayor of a South \nVietnamese hamlet shooting pointblank at the head of a political \nprisoner. The second image is of a little girl stripped naked running \ndown a road with her arms extended, burned from napalm. I will never \nget those images out of my mind.\n  I am afraid there are images of the war in Iraq that will stay with \npeople for a long time as well. One of them, sadly, will be images from \nAbu Ghraib prison and the treatment of Iraqi prisoners. A prisoner on a \nstool with his head covered with a bag, his arms extended with \nelectrodes connected; I am afraid that is an image that will be with us \nfor a long time and in the minds of many will be an unfair \ncharacterization of America and what we are about.\n  That was one of the reasons why I could not vote for the nomination \nof Attorney General Gonzales. I knew he was complicit in these \nconversations, these policies, this change when it came to the issue of \ntorture. I find it difficult to rationalize how a person whose job it \nis to uphold the rule of law could be party to that.\n  Now comes a vacancy, an opportunity to consider a successor--Judge \nMichael Mukasey, former Federal judge from New York, a person who has \ngiven his life to the law, an extraordinarily gifted, talented, able \njurist, who left the bench for private practice. Some have described \nJudge Mukasey as aspiring to the role of caretaker because it is a year \nand a few months away from the President's end of office. But the \nperson confirmed to fill that job has a much bigger responsibility than \ncaretaker. He will bear a heavy burden of doing his part to restore \nhonor and dignity to the Department of Justice.\n  I believe Michael Mukasey could do that if he not only brought the \nskills of a judge and the administrative skills that he might bring to \nthe job, but also brought with him a clear break from Attorney General \nGonzales's views on the issue of torture. It is the Attorney General's \nrole to uphold the law and American values. Former Attorney General \nGonzales failed in that role.\n  The late historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. said this about the \nJustice Department's legal defense of torture:\n\n       No position taken has done more damage to the American \n     reputation in the world--ever.\n\n  That is a powerful statement from a man who made his life as a \nhistorian and close adviser to President John Kennedy and close \nconfidant of many others at the highest levels of public life, to say \nthat no position taken has done more damage to America's reputation in \nthe world than this administration's position on torture.\n  Judge Mukasey has a distinguished record. I had hoped his background \nas a member of the Federal judiciary would give him the independence \nand integrity necessary for the job of Attorney General. On the first \nday of his testimony I was so relieved and refreshed; he answered \nquestions. He didn't say ``I don't know'' and duck and dodge. When \nconfronted with hard questions, such as will you be prepared to walk \naway from this President if asked to do something that you feel \ninconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the\n\n[[Page S13615]]\n\nland, he was resolute and firm in his answers. I thought maybe this is \nthe right person. This is a man who, because of his background and \nstation in life, doesn't need this job but would take it for public \nservice and be willing to stand up for principle. It was so refreshing.\n  Then came the second day of questions. I had a chance to ask him a \nquestion toward the end of the hearing. The room was almost empty. \nPeople had come to the conclusion on the second day that it was \na foregone conclusion that Judge Mukasey would be approved as the \nnominee by the Judiciary Committee and submitted to the Senate. I asked \nhim late in the questioning about the issue of torture. In fact, I was \nspecific. I went beyond the general questions of torture because the \nadministration said clearly: We do not have a policy of torture. We \ndon't engage in torture.\n\n  I then went to specific forms of torture, things that have been done \nto prisoners in detention over the centuries which are commonly \nregarded as torture. I asked him about waterboarding. Judge Mukasey \nrefused to answer the question and said:\n\n       I don't know what's involved in the technique. If \n     waterboarding is torture, torture is not constitutional.\n\n  Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island is my colleague. He called this \nresponse by Judge Mukasey ``a massive hedge.'' I think Senator \nWhitehouse was kind. For those who heard his remarks a few minutes ago, \nI told him it was one of the most powerful statements I had heard as a \nSenator in analyzing the challenge we now face on the Judiciary \nCommittee with this nomination.\n  I had hoped I would have heard from Judge Mukasey words that were \nspoken to me and to the committee and to America by people who have \ngiven their lives to considering this difficult topic.\n  Retired RADM John Hutson, former Navy Judge Advocate General, \ntestified at Judge Mukasey's confirmation hearing. He was asked about \nJudge Mukasey's statements and position on waterboarding. This is what \nhe said:\n\n       Other than, perhaps the rack and thumb screws, water-\n     boarding is the most iconic example of torture in history. It \n     was devised, I believe, in the Spanish Inquisition. It has \n     been repudiated for centuries. It's a little disconcerting to \n     hear now that we are not quite sure where waterboarding fits \n     in the scheme of things. I think we have to be very sure \n     where it fits in the scheme of things.\n\n  Those are the words of Admiral Hutson. I was troubled by Judge \nMukasey's position on waterboarding. I joined with all of my Democratic \ncolleagues in the Judiciary Committee and sent him a letter. I wanted \nto give him a fair opportunity to reflect on the questions and his \nanswers and to give us a complete statement of his views on this issue. \nI felt it was important and only fair to give him that chance. Last \nnight we received his reply. To say the least, it was disappointing. We \nasked Judge Mukasey a simple, straightforward question. Is \nwaterboarding illegal? His response took four pages. In it was very \nlittle.\n  He said waterboarding was ``on a personal basis, repugnant to me.'' \nBut he refused to say whether waterboarding was illegal because \n``hypotheticals are different from real life'' and it would depend on \n``the actual facts and the circumstances.''\n  With all due respect, that is an evasive answer. Frankly, while Judge \nMukasey has not been confirmed yet, that answer sounds too reminiscent \nof his predecessor. For the past 5 years, whenever we have asked the \nadministration whether torture techniques such as waterboarding are \nillegal, they always have the same response: That is a hypothetical \nquestion, and it depends on the facts and circumstances.\n  Let's be clear. Waterboarding is not a hypothetical. Waterboarding or \nsimulated drowning is a torture technique that has been used at least \nsince the Spanish Inquisition and is used today by repressive regimes \naround the world. I have come to the floor, Senator McConnell has come \nto the floor, and many others, to decry what is happening in Burma \ntoday where the military junta is not only killing innocent Burmese \npeople in the streets but engaging in torture and detention of citizens \nwho are only trying to speak their heart. The Burmese military has \nreportedly used waterboarding against democracy activists as they \nviolently repressed demonstrations in recent weeks. Whether \nwaterboarding is torture is certainly not a hypothetical question to \nthese Burmese democracy activists. These are some techniques that are \nso clearly illegal that it doesn't depend on facts and circumstances. \nThey should always be off limits. Would it depend on the facts and \ncircumstances whether it is torture to pull out someone's fingernails? \nDo you want to know more? Would it depend on facts and circumstances \nwhether rack-and-thumb screws are torture?\n  Judge Mukasey refused to say whether waterboarding is illegal, but \nmany others have answered this question and they didn't need four pages \nto do it. Following World War II, the United States prosecuted Japanese \nmilitary personnel as war criminals for waterboarding American \nservicemen. The Judge Advocates General, the highest ranking military \nlawyers in each of the U.S. military's four branches, told me \nunequivocally waterboarding is illegal.\n  To take one example, BG Kevin M. Sandkuhler, Staff Judge Advocate to \nthe Commandant of the Marine Corps, stated:\n\n       Threatening a detainee with imminent death, to include \n     drowning, is torture.\n\n  Senator John McCain, a Republican colleague from Arizona, who knows \nmore than anyone on this floor about being a prisoner and being treated \nas a prisoner, spoke to this issue with credibility and clarity. This \nis what he said of waterboarding:\n\n       In my view, to make someone believe that you are killing \n     him by drowning is no different than holding a pistol to his \n     head and firing a blank. I believe that it is torture, very \n     exquisite torture.\n\n  Earlier this week Senator McCain was asked about Judge Mukasey's \nrefusal to say whether waterboarding was torture. This is how he \nresponded:\n\n       Anyone who says they don't know if waterboarding is torture \n     or not has no experience in the conduct of warfare and \n     national security.\n\n  Senator John Warner, one of the authors of the Military Commissions \nAct, during the floor debate on the same legislation said that \nwaterboarding is ``in the category of grave breaches of Common Article \n3 of the Geneva Conventions'' and would be ``clearly prohibited'' by \nthe Military Commissions Act.\n  Our own State Department has long recognized that waterboarding is \ntorture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The State \nDepartment has repeatedly criticized other countries for using \nwaterboarding in its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.\n  How can we on one hand say our Secretary of State is going to look at \nthe conduct of the world and issue a report every year and find that if \nthey are engaged in waterboarding and the torture of prisoners, they \nhave violated human rights, and have a nominee for Attorney General of \nthe United States of America uncertain until he knows a little bit more \nabout the facts and circumstances surrounding the use of waterboarding?\n  It is important to note that although Judge Mukasey was equivocal and \nevasive on the issue of waterboarding, there were other issues he was \nhappy to volunteer strong opinions on. For example, I asked him whether \nhe believes the Second Amendment secures an individual right to bear \narms. Unlike waterboarding, which is widely condemned, this is an \nunsettled legal question.\n  The Bush administration takes the position that the Second Amendment \nprotects an individual right to bear firearms, but that view has been \nrejected by most Federal appeals courts and conflicts with the holding \nof the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Miller. Judge Mukasey did \nnot hesitate and ask for facts and circumstances. He said:\n\n       Based on my own study, I believe that the Second Amendment \n     protects an individual right to keep and bear arms.\n\n  On this contentious, debated, constitutional issue about the Second \nAmendment, he wasted no time coming to a legal conclusion. But when it \ncomes to the issue of waterboarding he refuses.\n  Every reason Judge Mukasey has offered in his letter to us for his \nfailure to take a position on waterboarding\n\n[[Page S13616]]\n\nfalls short. He says he has not been briefed on the administration's \ninterrogation programs. Isn't it ironic, because if he were briefed, he \nwould have refused to answer the question, saying it is classified. \nWhat I am asking about are basic principles, and he refuses to answer.\n  Now he argues he cannot answer the question because he has not been \nbriefed. As we made clear in our letter, we are not asking Judge \nMukasey's views of the administration's interrogation program. We are \nasking him for his personal opinion on waterboarding.\n  He also argues he cannot take a position on waterboarding because it \nwould ``provide our enemies with a window into the limits or contours \nof any interrogation program.''\n  With all due respect, what does that say about us? If you would go to \nthe Internet now and run a search on the term ``waterboarding,'' you \nwould find there are 18 million references to it--18 million. This is \nnot a term shrouded in mystery. It is a term well known and well \ndiscussed across the world.\n  If the argument is being made by Judge Mukasey that we want to leave \nour enemies in doubt as to whether we engage in waterboarding, what \ndoes it say about us? If the United States does not explicitly and \npublicly condemn waterboarding, it is certainly more difficult to argue \nthat enemy forces cannot use the same tactics. That has always been the \ngold standard. If this tactic of interrogation were applied to an \nAmerican soldier, would the United States cry foul? Would we say it is \ntorture, cruel, inhuman, and degrading?\n  There is no doubt in my mind we would say any American soldier \nsubjected to waterboarding is a victim of torture. We said it after \nWorld War II, and we prosecuted those Japanese military officials \nresponsible.\n  Why now in the 21st century is there any doubt in Judge Mukasey's \nmind? Sadly, if the Senate confirms Judge Mukasey, it will tell the \nworld the American Attorney General has not made up his mind about a \nform of torture that has been repudiated for centuries.\n  Many of us have a vision of America after this administration. We \nlook beyond January 20, 2009. We hope we will live in a better and \nsafer world. We hope the next President, whoever that may be, will \nrebuild alliances with countries that have stood by our side through \nthick and thin throughout our history--countries which are now \nestranged by the policies of this administration.\n  We hope whoever the next President will be, that person will seek to \nrestore the image of America in the world, tell people who we are, \nbecause many have such wrong and bad impressions of this great Nation. \nWe certainly expect the next President to reestablish the values that \ndefine us: fairness and justice, clarity of purpose--a caring nation, \ndedicated to peace.\n  When the history of this war on terror and this Bush administration \nis written, I am afraid many of the actions of this administration will \nfall into a sad and regretful category--a category that includes the \nsuspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War, the Sedition Act of \nWorld War I, the Japanese internment camps in World War II, the Army-\nMcCarthy hearings of the Cold War, the enemies list of the Nixon \nadministration--overreactions by a government so consumed with the idea \nof security that that government lost its way when it came to our basic \nand fundamental values.\n  We cannot lose our way when it comes to the choice of the next \nAttorney General. As good a person as he may be, his response to this \nquestion--this basic and fundamental question on policies of the \ninterrogation of prisoners leaves me no alternative but to oppose Judge \nMukasey's nomination to be Attorney General of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, back in August, I stood right here on the \nSenate floor and shared the story of a little girl from my home State. \nI did that because I wanted to illustrate why it is our moral \nobligation as Americans to renew and improve the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or CHIP.\n  Shortly afterward, the Senate approved the CHIP bill by an \noverwhelming margin because Senators on both sides of the aisle agreed \nthat all children should be able to see a doctor when they are sick. \nThey supported reauthorizing CHIP because it would reduce the number of \nuninsured American children by a third.\n  Well, President Bush vetoed it.\n  Now it is 3 months later, and I am frustrated and angry that I have \nto stand here again talking about CHIP and that we are still trying to \nget the White House to understand.\n  The supporters of this bill have agreed to a compromise. We want to \nmake this program work. We are back with another bill now that we think \nmeets everyone's needs. So today I come back to the floor to remind \nPresident Bush and anyone else who still questions how important it is \nto approve this program now--about that little girl from Yakima, WA, \nbecause it is time for the President to stop blocking her health care.\n  The little girl I want to tell you about is Sydney. She is 9 years \nold. In many ways, Sydney is like any other happy child in America. She \nloves to sing. She loves to dance. She does well in school. She has a \nlot of friends. But Sydney is different in one way. She has a life-\nshortening genetic condition called cystic fibrosis. It requires her to \ntake and I quote from her a ``bucketful'' of medicine every day.\n  She has already spent weeks of her young life in the hospital hooked \nup to an IV of antibiotics which help her to live another day. All of \nthat is possible because of the health care she has received as part of \nthe CHIP program.\n  Her mom, Sandi DeBord, told me about Sydney because she was very \nfrightened that CHIP might no longer be available for her daughter. She \nwrote to me and said:\n\n       I know for a fact that without this bit of assistance, her \n     life would end much sooner due to the inability to afford \n     quality health care for her.\n\n  Her life would end because she could not afford health care. What a \nsad note. I am here to tell the story again because, sad to say, 3 \nmonths later I cannot assure Sydney's mom that CHIP will always be \nthere. In fact, the news has become even more worrisome.\n  Just today, in the New York Times, it reported that because of the \nPresident's refusal to work with Congress on this bill, several States \nare now planning to start dropping children from the program in order \nto save money. Unless something changes, California says it is going to \nstart dropping 64,000 kids a month in January--64,000 kids a month.\n  A study from the Congressional Research Service found that nine \nStates--Alaska, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, New Jersey, and Rhode Island--are all going to run out \nof money by March. Twelve more States are going to run out between \nApril and September. This is a tragedy, and it is our moral obligation \nto fix this. That is what we are trying to do now in the Senate.\n  As Sydney's story shows us, the need for the Children's Health \nInsurance Program is clear. It does not matter if you are a Republican \nchild or a Democrat child or a progressive or a conservative; making \nsure our children get health care is the right thing to do.\n\n       When a child gets a cut that requires stitches or comes \n     down with a fever or has an earache or any other imaginable \n     problem, they ought to be able to get help, period. This is \n     the United States of America. But, unfortunately, today, in \n     this country, that is not the case. Millions of kids do not \n     get the medicine or the care they need.\n\n  We know the ranks of our uninsured children are growing because as \nthe cost of living rises and wages remain stagnant, more and more \nparents are struggling to afford any health care.\n  Most of us in the Senate know this. The CHIP program has had strong \nRepublican support, and I particularly thank Senator Grassley and \nSenator Hatch, who cosponsored the original 1997 bill, and have been \nworking so hard with Senator Baucus and Senator Rockefeller since.\n  But even with that bipartisan support in the Senate, President Bush \nhas complained about the bill that passed. As an excuse to delay the \nprogram, he and a few Republican supporters say we have been unwilling \nto work with them. They say it will increase costs. I am here to say \nthat is not the case. Despite what the President says, we listened to \ntheir concerns, and in this bill that is now before the Senate we \naddress those concerns.\n  This bill we are now considering addresses the concerns we heard over \nand\n\n[[Page S13617]]\n\nover that children of illegal immigrants will be covered by requiring \nthat States not only verify names and Social Security numbers, but they \nalso check citizenship information in the Social Security \nAdministration's database. So that issue is gone.\n  Secondly, it ends the coverage of childless adults by the end of 1 \nyear. So that issue is gone.\n  Finally, this bill concentrates on making sure the poorest kids get \ncovered first. So that issue is gone.\n  This bill also helps bridge the gap for another 3.9 million children \nwhose parents cannot afford insurance. And this program is paid for. I \nwant to say that again. This program is paid for.\n  President Bush just asked us to borrow $196 billion for the war in \nIraq and Afghanistan for this year alone. But he opposes children's \nhealth insurance, even though we found a way to pay for every penny of \nit for the next 5 years. The $35 billion cost for CHIP's initiatives \ncomes solely from a 61-cent excise tax increase on cigarettes and other \ntobacco products. No other programs are cut. Social Security is not \nraided. We are not increasing the deficit. Not only will this provide \nmillions of children with health care, experts actually estimate it is \ngoing to get 1.7 million adults to quit smoking and prevent millions of \nkids from ever getting hooked. So this is good for our kids' health \ncare now, and it is going to make a lot of kids healthier in the \nfuture.\n  Children's health should not be about politics. I have said this over \nand over. It is about making sure kids see a doctor when they need to. \nKids are not Democrats; they are not Republicans. They are just kids \nwho deserve health care.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush has let health care for our children \nget caught up in a desperate attempt to appeal to his dwindling number \nof supporters.\n  We know CHIP is the right thing to do. Americans know it is the right \nthing to do. More than 65 percent of them oppose President Bush's veto.\n  So to President Bush--and to any of our colleagues out there who \nstill see this as a debate over politics and numbers--I want to remind \nyou once more of a little girl who is 9 years old whose name is Sydney \nand the millions of other kids out there who depend on us to do the \nright thing.\n  Sydney is still fighting cystic fibrosis, and her mom is still \nwondering whether she will be able to take care of her in the future. I \nhope we can tell her that we will.\n\n  So on behalf of Sydney, on behalf of the 73,000 uninsured children in \nmy State alone, and the more than 8 million children in this country, I \nthank all of my colleagues who worked so hard on this bill and \nsupported it to this point. I urge the President to stop blocking this \ncritical program for our kids.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13617-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I am in support of the Passenger Rail \nInvestment and Improvement Act of 2007.\n  The passage of this critical legislation is truly a great \nachievement. For New Yorkers, Amtrak is not just a commodity but a life \nsource. Passenger rail is an essential element of our transportation \nnetwork that provides irreplaceable capacity and mobility to New York \nand the Nation. For the past near 7 years, we have had to fight the \nadministration's constant attempts to privatize and dismantle our \nNation's premier passenger rail service, Amtrak. Eliminating Amtrak \nservice would be an economic disaster and an irresponsible policy.\n  Today, as gas prices continue to climb and airline delays are at an \nalltime high, Amtrak not only provides a necessary and affordable \nalternative to our congested airways, it links commuters to local \nlocations not serviced by the airline industry. The enactment of \nPassenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2007 will end the \nstop-gap funding process for Amtrak and will provide the traveling \npublic with the security of a comprehensive plan for improving our \nnation's passenger rail system.\n  No country in the world has ever developed and maintained a \nsuccessful passenger railroad system without assistance from their \nnational government. Without offering an alternative, President Bush \nhas aimed to simply shut down passenger rail in the US.\n  This plan will authorize $19.2 billion in Federal funds for Amtrak by \nproviding $3.2 billion over the next 6 years and will allow Amtrak to \nmake critical repairs and improvements to its service. Funding under \nthis legislation will allow Amtrak to implement a comprehensive plan \nthat will enhance rail security, reduce train delays, and improve \ncustomer service. It will also provide sufficient funding and direction \nto bring the Northeast corridor up to a ``state-of-good-repair,'' \nincluding vital tunnel life safety work in the Hudson River Tunnels.\n  In recent years, attempts by Congress to improve and modernize \nAmtrak's operations were stalled by the Republican-controlled House, \nand earlier this year the President proposed cutting $493 million, more \nthan 38 percent of Amtrak's operating funds. This sort of backward \nthinking would have severely jeopardized Amtrak's ability to serve \ntheir passenger lines in New York and throughout the Northeast.\n  Mr. President, in the State of New York, Amtrak operates 140 routes, \nemploys more than 1,900 people, and has 2 of the top 10 busiest \nstations in their rail system. Amtrak is an integral part of our \ntransportation infrastructure and continues to service parts of the \nState that need the influx of tourists, business travelers, and others. \nThe future without Amtrak for New York would be devastating.\n  I am proud that the full Senate has rejected the administration's \napproach to Amtrak. As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I \ncommend Senator Lautenberg and Senator Lott for their leadership in \nsteering this critically important legislation through the Senate. As \nan original cosponsor of this legislation, I am pleased that my Senate \ncolleagues have voted overwhelmingly to continue to provide critical \nfunding for Amtrak, and I look forward to this legislation being signed \ninto law.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate made a strong \nand long-overdue investment in the future of public transit in Rhode \nIsland and throughout the country. I am pleased to have cast my vote \nfor the passage of the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of \n2007 (PRIIA), which will guide the maintenance, growth, and funding of \nthe railroad through Fiscal Year 2012.\n  Each year, over 12 million business and leisure travelers depend on \nAmtrak's Northeast Corridor service, which connects the great cities of \nNew England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Providence is a vital link on \nthis route, with more than half a million Amtrak passengers boarding \nand departing Amtrak trains in the city each year. Also on the \nNortheast corridor route are Kingston and Westerly, Rhode Island. \nKingston is home to the University of Rhode Island, and Amtrak gives \nstudents, faculty, researchers, and visitors direct access to this \nthriving college town. The Westerly station provides rail service to \nresidents of both Rhode Island and Connecticut who rely on public \ntransportation.\n  Despite its importance to millions of travelers, the Northeast \nCorridor has fallen into a state of disrepair in recent years. The \ninfrastructure on this route is some of the oldest in the Nation, and a \nrevitalization plan has been necessary for some time. This new Amtrak \nbill includes a strategy to restore the route to good condition by \nSeptember of 2012--the first capital development plan put in place \nsince Amtrak's previous authorization expired 5 years ago--and \nauthorizes full federal funding of necessary repairs and upgrades. The \nAmtrak bill also authorizes the formation of a commission to oversee \nthe operation and maintenance of the Northeast Corridor. The commission \nwill include Amtrak, the Federal Railroad Administration, and each \nstate along the route. I am pleased that Rhode Island will have a voice \nin future planning for a resource so vital to us.\n\n[[Page S13618]]\n\n  In addition to funding operations and capital improvements, the \nAmtrak bill also addresses the congestion experienced on so many of the \nsystem's routes. By law, Amtrak passenger trains have the right of way \nover private freight trains, but this preference is often ignored. The \nbill the Senate passed today permits the Surface Transportation Board \nto assess fines against non-compliant freight railroads and to \ndistribute damages to Amtrak. Congestion has increased in recent years, \nespecially along the Northeast Corridor, and this provision should lead \nto fewer and shorter delays for passengers.\n  Finally, let us celebrate a piece of good Rhode Island news--I have \nbeen informed that the escalators in the Providence train station, \nwhich have been broken and covered with dust since early 2005, are \nscheduled to be reopened and in service by the week of November 12.\n  I congratulate Senators Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Trent Lott \nof Mississippi on the passage of this critical piece of legislation. I \nalso want to recognize the contributions of Rhode Island's own Senator \nJack Reed, who has been a strong and constant advocate for Amtrak. The \nnew resources and clear development plan outlined in this bill reaffirm \nCongress's commitment to passenger rail service in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13618-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MATTHEW SHEPARD ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate \ncrimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes \nlaw, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  In the early hours of October 19, 2007, a 28-year-old man was shot at \nallegedly because of his sexual orientation. The victim and a friend \nleft a gay bar in Midtown Atlanta, GA, for a gas station down the \nstreet at about 3 a.m. At that time, a sport utility vehicle with three \nmen inside pulled into the gas station's parking lot. One of the \nvehicle's passengers was allegedly intoxicated and complaining to \ncustomers about the number of gay people at the gas station, using \nantigay epithets. Some of the man's behavior is caught on surveillance \ntapes at the station. The victim and his friend began to walk back to \nthe bar after a short stay at the gas station and were followed by the \nmen in the vehicle. As they walked by the bar, the man who appeared \nintoxicated shot at them four or five times, grazing the victim with a \nbullet that had ricocheted off the building. While Georgia does not \nhave a hate crime law, the shooting is being investigated as an antigay \nincident.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Matthew \nShepard Act is a symbol that can become substance. I believe that by \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13618-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FIRES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 2007\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, over the past 2 weeks, residents of San \nBernardino, San Diego, Orange, Los Angeles, Ventura, Riverside, and \nSanta Barbara counties in southern California have faced some of the \nmost horrific wildland fires in California's recorded history. At one \npoint, as many as 1 million Californians were forced from their homes \nand communities by flames driven by Santa Ana winds of up to 100 miles \nper hour.\n  To date, 14 people have lost their lives, almost 3,000 structures, \ntwo-thirds of them homes, have been destroyed and more than 500,000 \nacres have burned. Over 100 people have been injured, some seriously. \nThe consequences to people's lives will be long term, and we will do \neverything we can to bring comfort to victims and regeneration to \naffected communities.\n  Throughout these fires, which are only now being subdued, thousands \nof firefighters, mostly Californians, but some from other States, have \nbeen on the front lines working around the clock to defeat the fires. \nThey have been tireless and fearless. We owe these California \nfirefighters, and those who traveled across the country, our deepest \nthanks and appreciation. Whether it was saving the lives of people in \nthe path of the flames, or making a stand to protect a neighborhood or \na whole town, these brave men and women were there selflessly doing \ntheir duty. CalFire, the California National Guard, county and local \nfire agencies worked tirelessly to get the job done.\n  Thankfully, there has been no loss of firefighter lives, though \nseveral of our firefighters were injured, and to them I send my best \nwishes for a full recovery.\n  I hope that today we all can recognize our firefighters' valor and \nsteadfastness in the face of the threat. We must also commit ourselves \nto standing up for their health and welfare as they face health \nchallenges that sometimes last a lifetime. They do a very difficult job \nand we must do everything possible to assure they have all the support \nnecessary so that they can continue to be there when the next threat \npresents itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13618-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13618-S13619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SOMALIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have come to this floor many times \nover the years to urge increased U.S. attention and resources to \nSomalia. Meanwhile, the United States and the international community \nat large have continued to respond sporadically and clumsily to the \nsteady deterioration of Somalia's security, humanitarian, and political \nsituations. In January, I said that we had only a very limited window \nto establish the conditions necessary for stability in Somalia and the \nvolatile Horn of Africa region, but I fear that opportunity may soon be \nlost. Events over the past few days suggest that strong but inclusive \nleadership is needed now if Somalia is to avoid the worst descent into \nchaos of its tumultuous history.\n  This weekend saw a massive setback in Somalia's security and \nhumanitarian situation as a fresh outbreak of fighting which aid \nworkers describe as the worst violence in months--forced tens of \nthousands more Somalis from their homes in Mogadishu. Most of these \npeople are seeking refuge in communities whose coping capacities are \nalready at the breaking point due to the strain of providing food, \nwater, protection, shelter, and basic services to more than 300,000 \nexisting internally displaced persons. Some of the newly displaced have \nfled to areas where there is little or no access by humanitarian \nagencies.\n  Forty of these aid organizations that are operating against all odds \nin Somalia released a statement yesterday highlighting the dramatic \ndeterioration of the humanitarian situation and their increasing \ninability to effectively respond due to security and access \nconstraints. They are calling on the international community and all \nparties to the present conflict to demonstrate a commitment to protect \ncivilians, to facilitate the delivery of aid, and to respect \nhumanitarian space and the safety of humanitarian workers. I want to \ntake this moment to honor the courageous individuals and their \nsponsoring organizations for their persistent service to the innocent \ncivilians most affected by the ongoing instability in Somalia and to \necho their appeal for concerted action to support their work and the \nbroader objective of peace for Somalia.\n  Amidst this dark backdrop there is a glimmer of hope for progress. On \nMonday, the embattled Foreign Minister of Somalia's fragile \ntransitional federal government, Ali Mohamed Gedi, resigned amid \nfeverish political infighting. Since its formation 3 years ago, the TFG \nhas suffered from a lack of public legitimacy due to its inability to \neffectively represent and provide security and services to the Somali \npeople. The appointment of a new Prime Minister is likely to be the \nlast chance for this transitional government to restore some \ncredibility and move forward with political reconciliation. I encourage \nall parties to seize this opportunity for progress towards a solution \nto the country's deepening crisis.\n  In January, I warned that without concerted international and \nnational action, Somalia could deteriorate into what it has been since \nthe early 1990s--a haven for terrorists and warlords and a source of \ncrippling instability in a\n\n[[Page S13619]]\n\ncritical region. But as tensions between Ethiopia and Eritrea rise once \nagain, the ongoing humanitarian needs of civilians in the Ogaden region \nof Ethiopia reach international attention, and the Comprehensive Peace \nAgreement in Sudan stands on extremely fragile ground, I fear that our \nfailure to protect civilians, defeat extremists, and build conditions \nfor stability in Somalia could result in an even more disastrous \noutcome with consequences that extend far beyond the porous borders of \nthis besieged nation. We cannot afford to squander this chance for \nprogress towards peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13619-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13619-S13621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INAUGURAL ADDRESS OF DREW GILPIN FAUST\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to draw the attention \nof my colleagues to the inauguration earlier this month of Dr. Drew \nGilpin Faust as the 28th president of Harvard University.\n  Unfortunately, because of my recent surgery, I was not able to attend \nthe ceremony, but I read with great interest the eloquent and inspring \naddress of Dr. Faust at that ceremony.\n  Dr. Faust, an historian of the Civil War and former dean of the \nRadcliffe Institute, made history herself by becoming the first woman \nto serve as president of this outstanding university.\n  Others who spoke on this occasion included our Massachusetts \nGovernor, Deval Patrick, historian John Hope Franklin, University of \nPennsylvania president Amy Gutmann, where Dr. Faust spent much of her \nbrilliant career, and author Tony Morrison.\n  Present also were three of Dr. Faust's distinguished predecessors, \nDerek Bok, Neil Rudenstine, and Lawrence Summers, as well as \ndistinguished representatives of other major colleges and universities \nin the United States and throughout the world.\n  Last month, Senator Dole, Congressman Petri, Congressman Frank, \nCongressman Capuano, and I had the privilege of hosting a reception in \nthe Senate's Mansfield Room to honor and welcome Dr. Faust. A number of \nour colleagues attended as well, and we all look forward to working \nwith Dr. Faust, especially on higher education issues, in the years \nahead.\n  Dr. Faust is obviously an excellent choice by Harvard. She grew up in \nthe Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, and attended Concord Academy in \nMassachusetts. After earning her BA from Bryn Mawr College, she \ncontinued her education at the University of Pennsylvania, where she \nearned her M.A. and Ph.D. in American civilization and served on the \nfaculty there for 26 years, earning wide renown as a leading historian \nof the Civil War and the American South. In 2001 she became the first \ndean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard, and was \nappointed as Harvard's Abraham Lincoln Professor of History.\n  Her scholarship has been focused on the past, but almost from the \nbeginning she has been committed as well to solving the problems of the \npresent and making the world a better place for the future.\n  As a child in Virginia, she was appalled by the racism in her own \ncommunity. At the age of nine, she wrote a letter to President \nEisenhower opposing segregation.\n  In high school, she went to Eastern Europe one summer and spent \nweekends volunteering in a program to help the poor. She was elected \nsenior class president and was so widely respected that the school's \nnew headmaster sought her advice about the school.\n  In her freshman year at Bryn Mawr College, she was outraged when \npeaceful protesters against segregation in Selma were brutally clubbed \nand gassed by the police--so she skipped her midterm exams to go there \nand join the protest.\n  At the University of Pennsylvania, she dedicated much of her time and \nenergy to the cause of women in academic life. She chaired the \nuniversity's Women's Studies Program, and worked skillfully to see that \nwomen candidates for the faculty were considered fully and fairly.\n  Through it all, Dr. Faust won well-deserved renown for her \nscholarship. She became one of the Nation's preeminent historians of \nthe South, bringing new light to topics such as plantation agriculture \nand the life of southern intellectuals. Her landmark 1996 book, \n``Mothers of Invention,'' made her the first to demonstrate that women \nhad a significant impact on the outcome of the Civil War. For that \npioneering study, she received the Francis Parkman Prize for the year's \nbest work of history.\n  For the past 7 years, Dr. Faust has been the ``mother of invention'' \nat the Radcliffe Institute, skillfully guiding Radcliffe's \ntransformation into one of the Nation's foremost research centers for \nestablished and emerging scholars in all disciplines, and still \nmaintaining its special and long-standing role in the study of women, \ngender and society.\n  As Dr. Faust has said, our shared enterprise now, as people connected \nto Harvard, is to make the future of this extraordinary university even \nmore remarkable than its past. And with the distinguished leadership of \nDr. Faust, there is no doubt it will be.\n  I still remember the old inscription on the Dexter Gate in Harvard \nYard: ``Enter to grow in wisdom. Depart to serve better thy country and \nall mankind.'' I am sure President Faust will give new power to these \nwords in our day and generation.\n  I wish President Faust well as she assumes this extraordinary \nresponsibility, and I believe all of us in Congress will be interested \nin her eloquent and inspiring address on the historic occasion of her \ninauguration. It is an auspicious new beginning for Harvard, and I ask \nunanimous consent that her address be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Unleashing Our Most Ambitious Imaginings\n\n   (Inaugural Address of President Drew Gilpin Faust as President of \n    Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, October 12, 2007)\n\n       I stand honored by your trust, inspired by your charge. I \n     am grateful to the Governing Boards for their confidence, and \n     I thank all of you for gathering in these festival rites. I \n     am indebted to my three predecessors, sitting behind me, for \n     joining me today. But I am grateful to them for much more--\n     for all that they have given to Harvard and for what each of \n     them has generously given to me--advice, wisdom, support. I \n     am touched by the greetings from staff, faculty, students, \n     alumni, universities, from our honorable Governor, and from \n     the remarkable John Hope Franklin, who has both lived and \n     written history. I am grateful to the community leaders from \n     Boston and Cambridge who have come to welcome their new \n     neighbor. I am a little stunned to see almost every person I \n     am related to on earth sitting in the front rows. And I would \n     like to offer a special greeting of my own to my teachers who \n     are here--teachers from grade school, high school, college \n     and graduate school--who taught me to love learning and the \n     institutions that nurture it.\n       We gather for a celebration a bit different from our June \n     traditions. Commencement is an annual rite of passage for \n     thousands of graduates; today marks a rite of passage for the \n     University. As at Commencement, we don robes that mark our \n     ties to the most ancient traditions of scholarship. On this \n     occasion, however, our procession includes not just our \n     Harvard community, but scholars--220 of them--representing \n     universities and colleges from across the country and around \n     the world. I welcome and thank our visitors, for their \n     presence reminds us that what we do here today, and what we \n     do at Harvard every day, links us to universities and \n     societies around the globe.\n\n\n                             NEW BEGINNINGS\n\n       Today we mark new beginnings by gathering in solidarity; we \n     celebrate our community and its creativity; we commit \n     ourselves to Harvard and all it represents in a new chapter \n     of its distinguished history. Like a congregation at a \n     wedding, you signify by your presence a pledge of support for \n     this marriage of a new president to a venerable institution. \n     As our colleagues in anthropology understand so well, rituals \n     have meanings and purposes; they are intended to arouse \n     emotions and channel intentions. In ritual, as the poet \n     Thomas Lynch has written, ``We act out things we cannot put \n     into words.'' But now my task is in fact to put some of this \n     ceremony into words, to capture our meanings and purposes.\n       Inaugural speeches are a peculiar genre. They are by \n     definition pronouncements by individuals who don't yet know \n     what they are talking about. Or, we might more charitably dub \n     them expressions of hope unchastened by the rod of \n     experience.\n       A number of inaugural veterans--both orators and auditors--\n     have proffered advice, including unanimous agreement that my \n     talk must be shorter than Charles William Eliot's--which ran \n     to about an hour and a half. Often inaugural addresses \n     contain lists--of a new president's specific goals or \n     programs. But lists seem too constraining when I think of \n     what today should mean; they seem a way of limiting rather \n     than unleashing our most ambitious imaginings, our \n     profoundest commitments.\n\n[[Page S13620]]\n\n       If this is a day to transcend the ordinary, if it is a rare \n     moment when we gather not just as Harvard, but with a wider \n     world of scholarship, teaching and learning, it is a time to \n     reflect on what Harvard and institutions like it mean in this \n     first decade of the 21st century.\n       Yet as I considered how to talk about higher education and \n     the future, I found myself--historian that I am--returning to \n     the past and, in particular, to a document I encountered in \n     my first year of graduate school. My cousin Jack Gilpin, \n     Class of '73, read a section of it at Memorial Church this \n     morning. As John Winthrop sat on board the ship Arabella in \n     1630, sailing across the Atlantic to found the Massachusetts \n     Bay Colony, he wrote a charge to his band of settlers, a \n     charter for their new beginnings. He offered what he \n     considered ``a compass to steer by''--a ``model,'' but not a \n     set of explicit orders. Winthrop instead sought to focus his \n     followers on the broader significance of their project, on \n     the spirit in which they should undertake their shared work. \n     I aim to offer such a ``compass'' today, one for us at \n     Harvard, and one that I hope will have meaning for all of us \n     who care about higher education, for we are inevitably, as \n     Winthrop urged his settlers to be, ``knitt together in this \n     work as one.''\n\n\n                    AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION TODAY\n\n       American higher education in 2007 is in a state of \n     paradox--at once celebrated and assailed. A host of popular \n     writings from the 1980s on have charged universities with \n     teaching too little, costing too much, coddling professors \n     and neglecting students, embracing an ``illiberalism'' that \n     has silenced open debate. A PBS special in 2005 described a \n     ``sea of mediocrity'' that ``places this nation at risk.'' A \n     report issued by the U.S. Department of Education last year \n     warned of the ``obsolescence'' of higher education as we know \n     it and called for federal intervention in service of the \n     national interest.\n       Yet universities like Harvard and its peers, those \n     represented by so many of you here today, are beloved by \n     alumni who donate billions of dollars each year, are sought \n     after by students who struggle to win admission, and, in \n     fact, are deeply revered by the American public. In a recent \n     survey, 93 percent of respondents considered our universities \n     ``one of [the country's] most valuable resources.'' Abroad, \n     our universities are admired and emulated; they are arguably \n     the American institution most respected by the rest of the \n     world.\n       How do we explain these contradictions? Is American higher \n     education in crisis, and if so, what kind? What should we as \n     its leaders and representatives be doing about it? This \n     ambivalence, this curious love-hate relationship, derives in \n     no small part from our almost unbounded expectations of our \n     colleges and universities, expectations that are at once \n     intensely felt and poorly understood.\n\n\n                         THE POWER OF EDUCATION\n\n       From the time of its founding, the United States has tied \n     its national identity to the power of education. We have long \n     turned to education to prepare our citizens for the political \n     equality fundamental to our national self-definition. In \n     1779, for example, Thomas Jefferson called for a national \n     aristocracy of talent, chosen ``without regard to wealth, \n     birth, or other accidental condition of circumstance'' and \n     ``rendered by liberal education . . . able to guard the \n     sacred deposit of rights and liberties of their fellow-\n     citizens.'' As our economy has become more complex, more tied \n     to specialized knowledge, education has become more crucial \n     to social and economic mobility. W.E.B. DuBois observed in \n     1903 that ``Education and work are the levers to lift up a \n     people.'' Education makes the promise of America possible.\n       In the past half century, American colleges and \n     universities have shared in a revolution, serving as both the \n     emblem and the engine of the expansion of citizenship, \n     equality and opportunity--to blacks, women, Jews, immigrants, \n     and others who would have been subjected to quotas or \n     excluded altogether in an earlier era. My presence here \n     today--and indeed that of many others on this platform--would \n     have been unimaginable even a few short years ago. Those who \n     charge that universities are unable to change should take \n     note of this transformation, of how different we are from \n     universities even of the mid 20th century. And those who long \n     for a lost golden age of higher education should think about \n     the very limited population that alleged utopia actually \n     served. College used to be restricted to a tiny elite; now it \n     serves the many, not just the few. The proportion of the \n     college age population enrolled in higher education today is \n     four times what it was in 1950; twelve times what it was \n     before the 1920s. Ours is a different and a far better world.\n       At institutions like Harvard and its peers, this revolution \n     has been built on the notion that access should be based, as \n     Jefferson urged, on talent, not circumstance. In the late \n     1960s, Harvard began sustained efforts to identify and \n     attract outstanding minority students; in the 1970s, it \n     gradually removed quotas limiting women to a quarter of \n     the entering college class. Recently, Harvard has worked \n     hard to send the message that the college welcomes \n     families from across the economic spectrum. As a result we \n     have seen in the past 3 years a 33 percent increase in \n     students from families with incomes under $60,000. \n     Harvard's dorms and Houses are the most diverse \n     environments in which many of our students will ever live.\n       Yet issues of access and cost persist--for middle-class \n     families who suffer terrifying sticker shock, and for \n     graduate and professional students who may incur enormous \n     debt as they pursue service careers in fields where salaries \n     are modest. As graduate training comes to seem almost as \n     indispensable as the baccalaureate degree for mobility and \n     success, the cost of these programs takes on even greater \n     importance.\n       The desirability and the perceived necessity of higher \n     education have intensified the fears of many. Will I get in? \n     Will I be able to pay? This anxiety expresses itself in both \n     deep-seated resentment and nearly unrealizable expectations. \n     Higher education cannot alone guarantee the mobility and \n     equality at the heart of the American Dream. But we must \n     fully embrace our obligation to be available and affordable. \n     We must make sure that talented students are able to come to \n     Harvard, that they know they are able to come, and that they \n     know we want them here. We need to make sure that cost does \n     not divert students from pursuing their passions and their \n     dreams.\n       But American anxiety about higher education is about more \n     than just cost. The deeper problem is a widespread lack of \n     understanding and agreement about what universities ought to \n     do and be. Universities are curious institutions with varied \n     purposes that they have neither clearly articulated nor \n     adequately justified. Resulting public confusion, at a time \n     when higher education has come to seem an indispensable \n     social resource, has produced a torrent of demands for \n     greater ``accountability'' from colleges and universities.\n\n\n     UNIVERSITIES ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE\n\n       Universities are indeed accountable. But we in higher \n     education need to seize the initiative in defining what we \n     are accountable for. We are asked to report graduation rates, \n     graduate school admission statistics, scores on standardized \n     tests intended to assess the ``value added'' of years in \n     college, research dollars, numbers of faculty publications. \n     But such measures cannot themselves capture the achievements, \n     let alone the aspirations of universities. Many of these \n     metrics are important to know, and they shed light on \n     particular parts of our undertaking. But our purposes are far \n     more ambitious and our accountability thus far more difficult \n     to explain.\n       Let me venture a definition. The essence of a university is \n     that it is uniquely accountable to the past and to the \n     future--not simply or even primarily to the present. A \n     university is not about results in the next quarter; it is \n     not even about who a student has become by graduation. It is \n     about learning that molds a lifetime, learning that transmits \n     the heritage of millennia; learning that shapes the future. A \n     university looks both backwards and forwards in ways that \n     must--that even ought to--conflict with a public's immediate \n     concerns or demands. Universities make commitments to the \n     timeless, and these investments have yields we cannot predict \n     and often cannot measure. Universities are stewards of living \n     tradition--in Widener and Houghton and our 88 other \n     libraries, in the Fogg and the Peabody, in our departments of \n     classics, of history and of literature. We are uncomfortable \n     with efforts to justify these endeavors by defining them as \n     instrumental, as measurably useful to particular contemporary \n     needs. Instead we pursue them in part ``for their own sake,'' \n     because they define what has over centuries made us human, \n     not because they can enhance our global competitiveness.\n       We pursue them because they offer us as individuals and as \n     societies a depth and breadth of vision we cannot find in the \n     inevitably myopic present. We pursue them too because just as \n     we need food and shelter to survive, just as we need jobs and \n     seek education to better our lot, so too we as human beings \n     search for meaning. We strive to understand who we are, where \n     we came from, where we are going and why. For many people, \n     the four years of undergraduate life offer the only interlude \n     permitted for unfettered exploration of such fundamental \n     questions. But the search for meaning is a never-ending quest \n     that is always interpreting, always interrupting and \n     redefining the status quo, always looking, never content with \n     what is found. An answer simply yields the next question. \n     This is in fact true of all learning, of the natural and \n     social sciences as well as the humanities, and thus of the \n     very core of what universities are about.\n       By their nature, universities nurture a culture of \n     restlessness and even unruliness. This lies at the heart of \n     their accountability to the future. Education, research, \n     teaching are always about change--transforming individuals as \n     they learn, transforming the world as our inquiries alter our \n     understanding of it, transforming societies as we see our \n     knowledge translated into policies--policies like those being \n     developed at Harvard to prevent unfair lending practices, \n     or to increase affordable housing or avert nuclear \n     proliferation--or translated into therapies, like those \n     our researchers have designed to treat macular \n     degeneration or to combat anthrax. The expansion of \n     knowledge means change. But change is often uncomfortable, \n     for it always encompasses loss as well as gain, \n     disorientation as well as discovery. It has, as \n     Machiavelli once wrote, no constituency. Yet in facing the \n     future, universities must embrace the unsettling change \n     that is fundamental to every advance in understanding.\n\n\n                      OUR OBLIGATION TO THE FUTURE\n\n       We live in the midst of scientific developments as dramatic \n     as those of any era since\n\n[[Page S13621]]\n\n     the 17th century. Our obligation to the future demands that \n     we take our place at the forefront of these transformations. \n     We must organize ourselves in ways that enable us fully to \n     engage in such exploration, as we have begun to do by \n     creating the Broad Institute, by founding cross-school \n     departments, by launching a School of Engineering and Applied \n     Sciences. We must overcome barriers both within and beyond \n     Harvard that could slow or constrain such work, and we must \n     provide the resources and the facilities--like the new \n     science buildings in both Cambridge and Allston--to support \n     it. Our obligation to the future makes additional demands. \n     Universities are, uniquely, a place of philosophers as well \n     as scientists. It is urgent that we pose the questions of \n     ethics and meaning that will enable us to confront the human, \n     the social and the moral significance of our changing \n     relationship with the natural world.\n       Accountability to the future requires that we leap \n     geographic as well as intellectual boundaries. Just as we \n     live in a time of narrowing distances between fields and \n     disciplines, so we inhabit an increasingly transnational \n     world in which knowledge itself is the most powerful \n     connector. Our lives here in Cambridge and Boston cannot be \n     separated from the future of the rest of the earth: we share \n     the same changing climate; we contract and spread the same \n     diseases; we participate in the same economy. We must \n     recognize our accountability to the wider world, for, as John \n     Winthrop warned in 1630, ``we must consider that we shall be \n     as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us.''\n\n\n                     HARVARD AS A SOURCE AND SYMBOL\n\n       Harvard is both a source and a symbol of the ever expanding \n     knowledge upon which the future of the earth depends, and we \n     must take an active and reflective role in this new geography \n     of learning. Higher education is burgeoning around the globe \n     in forms that are at once like and unlike our own. American \n     universities are widely emulated, but our imitators often \n     display limited appreciation for the principles of free \n     inquiry and the culture of creative unruliness that defines \n     us.\n       The ``Veritas'' in Harvard's shield was originally intended \n     to invoke the absolutes of divine revelation, the \n     unassailable verities of Puritan religion. We understand it \n     quite differently now. Truth is an aspiration, not a \n     possession. Yet in this we--and all universities defined by \n     the spirit of debate and free inquiry--challenge and even \n     threaten those who would embrace unquestioned certainties. We \n     must commit ourselves to the uncomfortable position of doubt, \n     to the humility of always believing there is more to know, \n     more to teach, more to understand.\n       The kinds of accountability I have described represent at \n     once a privilege and a responsibility. We are able to live at \n     Harvard in a world of intellectual freedom, of inspiring \n     tradition, of extraordinary resources, because we are part of \n     that curious and venerable organization known as a \n     university. We need better to comprehend and advance its \n     purposes--not simply to explain ourselves to an often \n     critical public, but to hold ourselves to our own account. We \n     must act not just as students and staff, historians and \n     computer scientists, lawyers and physicians, linguists and \n     sociologists, but as citizens of the university, with \n     obligations to this commonwealth of the mind. We must regard \n     ourselves as accountable to one another, for we constitute \n     the institution that in turn defines our possibilities. \n     Accountability to the future encompasses special \n     accountability to our students, for they are our most \n     important purpose and legacy. And we are responsible not just \n     to and for this university, Harvard, in this moment, 2007, \n     but to the very concept of the university as it has evolved \n     over nearly a millennium.\n       It is not easy to convince a nation or a world to respect, \n     much less support, institutions committed to challenging \n     society's fundamental assumptions. But it is our obligation \n     to make that case: both to explain our purposes and achieve \n     them so well that these precious institutions survive and \n     prosper in this new century. Harvard cannot do this alone. \n     But all of us know that Harvard has a special role. That is \n     why we are here; that is why it means so much to us.\n       Last week I was given a brown manila envelope that had been \n     entrusted to the University Archives in 1951 by James B. \n     Conant, Harvard's 23rd president. He left instructions that \n     it should be opened by the Harvard president at the outset of \n     the next century ``and not before.'' I broke the seal on the \n     mysterious package to find a remarkable letter from my \n     predecessor. It was addressed to ``My dear Sir.'' Conant \n     wrote with a sense of imminent danger. He feared an impending \n     World War III that would make ``the destruction of our cities \n     including Cambridge quite possible.'' ``We all wonder,'' he \n     continued, ``how the free world is going to get through the \n     next fifty years.''\n\n\n                            HARVARD'S FUTURE\n\n       But as he imagined Harvard's future, Conant shifted from \n     foreboding to faith. If the ``prophets of doom'' proved \n     wrong, if there was a Harvard president alive to read his \n     letter, Conant was confident about what the university would \n     be. ``You will receive this note and be in charge of a more \n     prosperous and significant institution than the one over \n     which I have the honor to preside . . . That . . . [Harvard] \n     will maintain the traditions of academic freedom, of \n     tolerance for heresy, I feel sure.'' We must dedicate \n     ourselves to making certain he continues to be right; we must \n     share and sustain his faith.\n       Conant's letter, like our gathering here, marks a dramatic \n     intersection of the past with the future. This is a ceremony \n     in which I pledge--with keys and seal and charter--my \n     accountability to the traditions that his voice from the past \n     invokes. And at the same time, I affirm, in compact with all \n     of you, my accountability to and for Harvard's future. As in \n     Conant's day, we face uncertainties in a world that gives us \n     sound reason for disquiet. But we too maintain an unwavering \n     belief in the purposes and potential of this university and \n     in all it can do to shape how the world will look another \n     half century from now. Let us embrace those responsibilities \n     and possibilities; let us share them ``knitt together . . . \n     as one;'' let us take up the work joyfully, for such an \n     assignment is a privilege beyond measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13621-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LOSS OF SOUTH CAROLINA STUDENTS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, it is with great pride that I join all of \nConnecticut in extending congratulations to the many young athletes who \ncompeted in the 15th Pan American Games, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For \nover half a century, these games have brought together athletes from \nacross the Western Hemisphere. This year 5,648 athletes from 49 \ncountries came together in Rio to compete in 38 sports.\n  The Pan American games, similar to the Olympics, provide us another \nvaluable opportunity to enjoy international athletic competition \nundertaken for pride and the love of the sport. By participating in the \n15th Pan American Games, these young Americans have had an opportunity \nthat few of their fellow Americans ever will--to join in competition \nwith other young people from North, Central, and South America.\n  I would like to commend the 14 athletes from Connecticut who competed \nin the games: John Ball, Andrew Bolton, Eliza Cleveland, Reilley \nDampeer, Robert Merrick, Alyssa Naeher, Todd Paul, Cara Raether, \nGeoffrey Rathgeber, Sarah Trowbridge, Karen Scavotto, Cameron \nWinklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, Bartosz Wolski. It is with great pleasure \nand pride that I offer further congratulations to the Connecticut \nathletes who brought home three gold and five silver medals and one \nbronze medal. Without a doubt, the nine medals won by Connecticut's \nathletes contributed to America's overall victory at the 15th Pan \nAmerican Games. It is my hope that these kinds of events will further \nunite our hemisphere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13621-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13621-S13622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          CELEBRATING THE CENTENNIAL OF THE WAILUKU COURTHOUSE\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, this month, the county of Maui \ncelebrated the centennial anniversary of the historic Wailuku \nCourthouse. Built in 1907, the Wailuku Courthouse served as\n\n[[Page S13622]]\n\nthe center of the judicial system on Maui for more than 80 years. \nToday, it is home to Maui County's Department of the Prosecuting \nAttorney.\n  The Hawaiian Organic Act, passed by Congress in 1900, created a \nsystem of governance for the new Territory of Hawaii. County \ngovernments were established along with a territorial court system. The \ntown of Wailuku was selected as the seat of Maui's county government, \nmaking it the logical place to construct a new courthouse and other \npublic buildings.\n  The contract to build the Wailuku Courthouse, at the cost of \n$23,312.40, was awarded to Angus P. McDonald in September 1907. \nConstruction began the next month and was completed a year later. In \n1909, the Honorable Judge Aluwae Noa Kepoikai became the first judge to \npreside over cases presented in the new Wailuku Courthouse.\n  As Hawaii and the county of Maui grew, so did the demand for legal \nservices and the needs of the judiciary. In 1988, the State judicial \nsystem on Maui moved into a new building, and in 1991, plans were made \nto gut the courthouse. However, the county of Maui intervened and took \ncontrol of the courthouse by way of a land swap with the State, saving \nthe historic building and its interior. A $1.8 million restoration \nfollowed, and in 1993, Maui's Department of the Prosecuting Attorney \nmoved into the newly renovated courthouse.\n  The historic courthouse has served the people of Maui for 100 years. \nThe fact that it remains as both a working government building and as \nan architectural treasure of Hawaii's past is the result of the efforts \nof the many people who are to be commended and honored as we celebrate \nthe centennial of the Wailuku Courthouse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13622-1", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING MAJOR GENERAL HARRY B. BURCHSTEAD, JR.\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I ask the Senate to join me \nin recognizing Major General Harry B. Burchstead, Jr. on the occasion \nof his retirement from the South Carolina Army National Guard. Since \nentering the United States Army as a commissioned officer through the \nROTC program at Clemson University, General Burchstead has remained a \ndedicated serviceman for his entire career. Immediately after his \ngraduation from Clemson, General Burchstead loyally answered his call \nof duty and deployed for combat service in the Vietnam War.\n  After leaving active duty in 1971, General Burchstead went on to \npursue his law degree at the University of South Carolina. While in law \nschool, General Burchstead continued his military service by joining \nthe South Carolina Army National Guard in 1972. For the next thirty-\nfive years, General Burchstead proudly served the State of South \nCarolina as a traditional citizen soldier through many levels of \nmilitary service.\n  In 1997, General Burchstead was appointed to serve as the Deputy \nAdjutant General of South Carolina. In this capacity, he was critical \nin advising the Adjutant General's oversight of the South Carolina Army \nand Air National Guard. For six years, General Burchstead's strategic \nand diligent counsel was integral to the effective military operations \nof our state's full-time servicemen and women.\n  As a distinguished leader, General Burchstead was selected to command \nthe 263rd Army Air and Missile Defense Command in 2003. In his role as \nCommander, General Burchstead led Joint Task Force Cobra in its \nexecution of the Juniper-Cobra Missile Defense Exercise in Israel. \nAdditionally, General Burchstead was successful in commanding the Joint \nProject Optical Windmill Air and Missile Defense Exercise in Europe, as \nwell as the U.S.-Russian Federation Missile Defense Exercise at Fort \nBliss, Texas.\n  A dedicated patriot, General Burchstead formally retired from the \nSouth Carolina Army National Guard on September 30th, 2007. Over his \nthirty-five years of service General Burchstead has amassed numerous \nawards and decorations including the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star \nMedal with two oak leaf clusters, the Purple Heart, the U.S. \nMeritorious Service Medal and the Army Commendation Medal. His military \ncareer will be forever marked by his selfless devotion and sacrifice to \nboth our country and the State of South Carolina. I wish General \nBurchstead the very best in his retirement and ask that the United \nStates Senate join me in thanking him for his lifelong career of \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13622-2", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING FLOTATION TECHNOLOGIES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Flotation \nTechnologies, an extraordinary global leader in the design and \nproduction of deepwater buoyancy products from my home State of Maine. \nFlotation Technologies of Biddeford recently received the Manufacturing \nExcellence Award from the Maine Manufacturing Extension Partnership, \nMEP, for ``superior manufacturing practices'' that have successfully \npropelled the firm into the international market.\n  Flotation Technologies creates and manufactures syntactic foam \nbuoyancy and polyurethane elastomer products for the offshore, \noceanographic, and seismic industries, as well as for the U.S. \nmilitary. Founded in 1979, the enterprise has been manufacturing \nsyntactic foam longer than any other company in business today. This \nyear, to meet the company's rapid expansion, Flotation Technologies \nrelocated to a 45,000-square-foot facility in the Biddeford Industrial \nPark. The new facility will allow Flotation Technologies to install \nstate-of-the-art automated production equipment that will triple \nproduction capacity.\n  This pioneering company makes extraordinarily resilient products for \nextreme environments. Flotation Technologies' buoys are lowered miles \nbelow the ocean surface, where they face up to 10,000 pounds of \npressure per square inch, equivalent to the weight of a truck. They are \nas dense as oak, yet still relatively lightweight, and the buoys can \nsurvive under the frigid polar ice in the Arctic and under the searing \nheat in West Africa. These high-quality products were even relied upon \nto help shoot the 1997 Oscar-winning blockbuster movie ``Titanic.''\n  Flotation Technologies began as a small family enterprise, primarily \nserving scientists engaged in oceanographic and earthquake research. In \n2002, as energy prices rose sharply, interest in offshore exploration \ngrew rapidly. Flotation Technologies' buoyancy products are crucial to \nsupport the miles of flexible piping needed to extract resources from \nthe ocean floor. In the last few years, the company has become a major \nsupplier of these products, and most recently, Flotation Technologies \nwon a $4.1 million contract to build buoyancy modules for Frontier \nDrilling, a Houston oil company.\n  Expansion into this business has been a rewarding endeavor, and \nFlotation Technologies is setting its sights on further growth. The \nfirm currently employs 42 people in Maine, and they expect to add at \nleast 10 more employees by the end of the year. Revenues are expected \nto hit $10.5 million this year, and management is aiming for $30 \nmillion in sales within 3 years. Flotation Technologies recently worked \nwith the Maine MEP to develop a strategic business plan that \ndramatically improved the efficiency of its operations. The Maine MEP \nis part of a nationwide network of technical, manufacturing, and \nbusiness specialists linked together through the U.S. Department of \nCommerce. By implementing the Maine MEP's streamlining techniques, the \ncompany was able to double sales for 2006.\n  Despite such impressive growth, Flotation Technologies has remained \nin the hands of a tightly-knit group of family members. Tim Cook, the \ncurrent president, is the son of the company's founder, David Cook. As \nTim notes, his family has ``put it all on the line'' for this venture \nfor nearly 30 years. I congratulate Tim and his family on their success \nand wish them well in the years to come. Their dedicated \nentrepreneurial spirit is very much a part of what makes our Nation \ngreat, and I am proud to have them in my home State of Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13622-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13622-S13623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 2295.

A bill to include health centers in the list of entities \neligible for mortgage insurance under the National Housing Act; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nCommunity Health Center Capital Investment Act. I also thank my \ncolleague, Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, for joining me in \nsponsoring this critical legislation. Health centers in both our states \nare committed to serving more people, and our legislation will give \nthem a little help to do just that.\n  One of our most important investments in our health-care system is\n\n[[Page S13626]]\n\nfunding the Community Health Center program. According to the National \nAssociation of Community Health Centers, health centers provide \ncomprehensive primary and preventive care to over 16 million people--\nincluding nearly 7 million uninsured--each year in more than 6,000 \nurban and rural communities.\n  One of my initial pledges when I first ran for the Senate was to \nincrease the number of community health centers in Michigan. Since I \nbecame a Senator, there are new 15 community health centers or access \npoints in Michigan. I am also so pleased to have had the support of so \nmany of my colleagues in increasing funding for community health center \ngrants. This year, 64 Senators signed the Stabenow-Bond funding \nrequest, and we were pleased that the Senate Labor-HHS-Education \nAppropriations bill will provide an additional $250 million increase \nfor community health centers. This increased funding will help reach \nnearly 2 million people next year.\n  But even as we provide assistance to community health centers for \noperations, we cannot forget their capital needs such as renovating \nolder buildings, purchasing new equipment, and investing in health \ninformation technology. But in general, without specific authorization \nin Federal law, health centers cannot use current grant dollars for \nconstruction, modernization, or expansion of facilities.\n  According to NACHC, one out of three health centers currently \noperates in buildings that are 30 years old or older. The average cost \nof a facility project is estimated to be $2.3 million. Many centers \nborrow funds for these purposes at rates that could be, and should be, \nlower.\n  Kim Sibilsky, the executive director of the Michigan Primary Care \nAssociation, wrote me: ``The majority of Michigan's 34 community Health \nCenter organizations were founded in the middle and late 1970s, and \nmany of their 160 community-based sites are located in facilities that \nrequire renovation to meet the changing health care needs of their \ncommunities. More readily available renovation dollars will assist \nMichigan Health Centers in improving access to quality health care for \nMichigan residents.''\n  One simple solution would be granting access for community health \ncenters to use the facility assistance programs at the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. If health centers were able to access \nHUD's loan guarantee and mortgage insurance program through the Title \nXI Small Medical Group Facilities Program, they would have an important \ntool with which to address facility concerns.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is a small clarification to \nthe Title XI Program to ensure that health centers can obtain mortgage \ninsurance under the program. But this small change will have a huge \nreward for our safety-net providers. It will allow them to lower the \ninterest rate on the money they borrow, and therefore lower the cost of \nthe project for the center. This savings will be translated directly to \nincreased patient care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                               Community Health Centers, Inc.,\n\n                                                 October 25, 2007.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Stabenow and Senator Cochran: On behalf of the \n     National Association of Community Health Centers, the \n     advocate voice for our nation's Community, Migrant, Public \n     Housing and Homeless Health Centers and the 16 million \n     patients they serve, I am writing to offer our strong \n     endorsement of your bipartisan legislation the ``Community \n     Health Center Capital Investment Act.''\n       America's Health Centers commend you for your leadership in \n     introducing this important legislation to expand access to \n     federal grants for capital improvements in the nation's 1,100 \n     federally qualified health centers. As the health care home \n     for 16 million people in more than 6,000 urban and rural \n     locations, health centers provide high quality, comprehensive \n     primary and preventive care for children and adults. Each \n     year as the number of patients served at health centers \n     continues to increase, so will the need for modernization and \n     construction of new health center facilities.\n       Your proposal is a significant step forward toward \n     improving access to primary health care across the country. A \n     recent survey in twelve states found that nearly two-thirds \n     of health centers need to expand or modernize their current \n     buildings, while some areas need to construct new facilities \n     to treat the growing number of patients in their communities. \n     Today, health centers have limited access to federal grants \n     for facility improvements and struggle to raise sufficient \n     capital to meet the $2.3 million average cost of facility \n     projects. By ensuring that health centers have access to the \n     Housing and Urban Department's loan guarantee and mortgage \n     insurance program through the Title XI Small Medical Group \n     Facilities Program, health centers will have an important \n     tool to address these facility concerns.\n       We greatly applaud your legislation to ensure that the \n     nation's health centers will be authorized to access HUD's \n     loan guarantee and mortgage insurance programs for the \n     construction, modernization and expansion of their \n     facilities. Your leadership on this issue will significantly \n     improve the health and well-being of our nation's medically \n     underserved.\n       Again, thank you for your sponsorship of the ``Community \n     Health Center Capital Investment Act.'' America's Health \n     Centers are proud to endorse your legislation and offer their \n     active support in helping to secure its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Craig A. Kennedy, MPH,\n\n                                         Associate Vice President,\n                                        Federal and State Affairs.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, community health centers provide care for \nover 15 million patients nationwide each year and are a critical part \nof our country's health care network. Many of these centers operate out \nof buildings that are in need of modernization or expansion. Current \nlaw limits access to federal funds to community health centers for any \ntype of construction, modernization, or expansion. Therefore, the only \nfunds available to community health centers for facilities are through \ncongressionally directed spending.\n  We are introducing a bill today to include community health centers \nas eligible recipients for funding through the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development's Small Medical Group Facilities Program. Under \nthis competitive program, community health centers will be able to \naccess loan guarantees and mortgage insurance, thus giving them a tool \nto address their facility concerns and by doing so, better serve their \npatients.\n  I am pleased to offer this legislation that will help improve access \nto and quality of community health center care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Durbin, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 2274. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to prevent the \nabuse of dextromethorphan, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, ``Robotripping,'' ingesting large amounts \nof cough suppressants containing a common over-the-counter ingredient \ncalled Dextromethorphan, or ``DXM,'' is a dangerous, potentially \nlethal, threat to our Nation's children. That is why today I am \nintroducing the Dextromethorphan Abuse Reduction Act of 2007, which \ntakes significant steps towards countering this alarming problem.\n  DXM is a cough suppressing ingredient found in many over-the-counter \nproducts. While DXM is safe at the recommended dosage, it can produce a \nhallucinogenic effect similar to that of PCP if ingested in abnormally \nhigh doses. Because many drugs containing DXM are legal and widely \navailable over-the-counter, too many teens have the perception that \nthey are not dangerous regardless of the amount ingested. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth; overdosing on DXM can cause a rapid \nheartbeat, high blood pressure, seizures, brain damage, elevated body \ntemperatures, and even death.\n  Recent studies reveal troubling rates of DXM abuse. The number of \nreported cases in California has increased ten-fold since 1999 and \nexperts believe that this mirrors national trends. Moreover, the \nPartnership for a Drug-Free America estimates that 2.4 million teens--1 \nin 10--got high on over-the-counter cough medicines in 2005. Children \nages 9 to 17 are the fastest growing group of DXM abusers. Indeed, the \nlatest Monitoring the Future survey revealed that\n\n[[Page S13627]]\n\nnearly 7 percent--or one in about every 14--12th graders reported \nabusing cough or cold medicines to get high during the past year. Mr. \nPresident, these shocking numbers speak for themselves.\n  To be certain, this is not the first time we have seen the abuse of \nover-the-counter medications. As you will recall, we spent much of the \n109th Congress debating how to address the dangers posed by \npseudoephedrine, which can be used to manufacture methamphetamine. We \npassed the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, which took the \nimportant step of moving medications containing pseudoephedrine behind \nthe counter and closely regulating their sales. While this move was \ncontroversial at the time among those who believed it imposed an \nunnecessary inconvenience on law-abiding Americans, it has worked: \ndomestic manufacture of methamphetamine has been reduced dramatically \nand there is no indication that people who legitimately need medicines \ncontaining pseudoephedrine are not receiving them.\n  My bill takes two key steps to combat the abuse of medicines \ncontaining DXM. First, it regulates bulk DXM--the powder that has not \nbeen combined with any other ingredients--by placing it in Schedule V \nof the Controlled Substances Act. Cough medicine with codeine is also a \nSchedule V substance. This gives DEA the authority to monitor and \ncontrol DXM in its unfinished form. While DXM-containing commercial \nend-products like Robitussin and Coricidin Cough and Cold will not be \nscheduled, the bill requires that any would-be purchaser of a DXM-\ncontaining product be 18 years of age, a move that many grocery stores \nand pharmacies have already voluntarily taken.\n  Second, and equally important in my view, the bill infuses \nsubstantial funding into efforts to raise public awareness about the \nproblem of prescription and over-the-counter drug abuse, and it \nestablishes coordinated efforts to educate teens and parents about \nmedicine abuse. I have always said that tough enforcement efforts must \nbe coupled with equally tough prevention and treatment measures. \nPrevention is a key component to solving the problem of rising medicine \nabuse, and my bill provides robust funding for educational television \nadvertisements, community awareness and prevention programs, and \ntargeted grants made available to local community coalitions to develop \ncomprehensive strategies to reverse the rise in medicine abuse in a \nparticular community.\n  Senators Grassley, Durbin, and Feinstein are original cosponsors of \nthe legislation. The bill is also supported by a number of retail \norganizations including the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, \nNACDS, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, CHPA, and the Food \nMarketing Institute, FMI. The Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America, \nCADCA, and the Partnership for a Drug-Free America also support the \nbill.\n  I would like to thank Senators Grassley, Feinstein, and Durbin for \ntheir support on this and many other important drug issues facing our \ncountry, and I hope all members of this body will join us in this \neffort and support this bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Biden, in introducing the Dextromethorphan Abuse Reduction Act \nof 2007. As senior members of the U.S. Senate, and as chairman and co-\nchairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, we \nhave seen firsthand how trends in drug abuse have changed over the \nyears and we have worked to provide effective solutions to the drug \nproblem whether the matter is foreign or domestic.\n  Together, we have been monitoring the recent reports in the media and \nin the health community detailing new and emerging trends in drug abuse \namong teens. The reports have established that the fastest rising area \nof drug abuse among teens is the abuse of prescription drugs that are \navailable in the drug cabinets of parents, family, and friends. These \nreports indicate that there is also a trend among teens to abuse \nnonprescription cough and cold medicines that are available without a \nprescription, over the counter, OTC, at pharmacies and grocery stores \nacross the country. These trends highlight a new danger to America's \nyouth as these products are readily available and are often times \nperceived to be safe even if used outside their intended use. We cannot \nafford to ignore this trend and need to ensure that we are doing all we \ncan to protect our kids. If we don't address this problem now, the use \nof prescription drugs and OTC cough and cold medicines could become \nmore prevalent than the use of traditional illegal narcotics such as \nmarijuana, cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine.\n  To illustrate this point, the 2006 University of Michigan annual \nsurvey of U.S. adolescents found that while illicit drug use among \nteens is down, use and abuse of prescription drugs remains high. This \nincludes the abuse of powerful painkillers such as OxyContin and \nVicodin. Another survey by the Partnership for a Drug Free America \nreleased just last year also found similar results stating that 1 in 5 \nteens admitted to abusing prescription drugs.\n  These surveys also included new questions on nonprescription drugs. \nThe University of Michigan survey found that nearly 1 in 14 12th grade \nstudents had used nonprescription drugs to get high. The Partnership \nfor a Drug Free America also found that nearly 10 percent of teens have \nabused cold and cough medicines that contain dextromethorphan or DXM, \nthe active ingredient in OTC cough suppressants. Taken together, these \nsurveys are further evidence that abuse of both prescription and \nnonprescription OTC drugs is more common than abuse of many illicit \ndrugs. As such, it is our duty to ensure that the laws on the books are \nadequate to address the new trends in drug abuse.\n  Of particular concern to me is the abuse of medicines that are \navailable OTC because of how prevalent these products are. Further, \nmany parents may not know about the abuse of such products. For \ninstance, many parents have never heard of dextromethorphan or DXM and \nare unaware that there is a problem with the abuse of this drug. For \nthose unfamiliar, DXM is the main active ingredient in a number of OTC \nproducts, primarily in cough medicines. DXM is the active ingredient \nand is generally available in two forms, a ``finished dosage form'' and \nan ``unfinished dosage form''. Finished dosage form means a product \ncontains DXM and other inactive ingredients that are approved for human \nuse, such as cough and cold syrups and pills. Unfinished dosage form \nrefers to the raw chemical DXM in any concentrated amount that is not \nin finished dosage form for consumption. Unfinished DXM is generally \nnot available at local pharmacies and grocery stores; however, it is \navailable over the Internet and finding its way into our communities. \nBecause both forms, finished and unfinished, are readily available to \nteens, we need to ensure that reasonable controls are put in place to \nensure that access to DXM is limited to those who need the products for \ntrue medicinal purposes.\n  So why regulate DXM at all? Aside from the increasing number of teens \nabusing the product, the potential dangers are cause enough. Abuse of \nDXM produces a hallucinogenic effect similar to that of PCP or LSD. To \nget this effect, teens must often ingest large quantities of DXM and \ngiven the uncertain dosage to reach this hallucinogenic effect, \noverdosing on the product is a real danger. If an overdose occurs, the \neffects can include an irregular heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, \nseizures, brain damage, and even death. In fact, both the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, SAMSHA, have posted warnings about the abuse of DXM in \nOTC finished dosage form and the unfinished dosage powdered form that \nkids are obtaining over the Internet.\n  Because of these dangers that abuse and overdose pose, we are here \ntoday introducing legislation that will place reasonable restrictions \non the sale of DXM. The Dextromethorphan Abuse Reduction Act of 2007 \nstrikes the appropriate balance of regulating access to DXM and \nproducts that contain DXM for those under 18 years old while making \nsure these products remain available for those who have a legitimate \nmedical need.\n  First, our legislation will regulate the sale of unfinished DXM by \nplacing it on Schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act. This is the \ntier of the controlled substances list that currently\n\n[[Page S13628]]\n\nregulates other forms of cough syrup that contains codeine. As a \nSchedule V product, DXM will be regulated by the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, DEA, and will allow the Attorney General to regulate \nthe sale of unfinished DXM over the Internet.\n  Second, the legislation provides civil penalties for retailers who \nknowingly or intentionally sell DXM in finished dosage form to an \nindividual under the age of 18. This requirement will ensure that \nstores and retailers sell products containing DXM in a responsible \nmanner. However, to ensure that retailers are not improperly fined, the \nbill contains an affirmative defense for those who are presented false \nor fraudulent identification. The bill also provides the Attorney \nGeneral the authority to tier the scheduled fines to reduce the \npenalties for retailers who provide an effective employee training \nprogram.\n  Lastly, this legislation provides vital funding to three important \nprograms for the prevention of abuse of prescription and \nnonprescription drugs. The legislation authorizes funding to the \nNational Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign for education to children under \nage 18 about the dangers of prescription and OTC drug abuse. I have \nbeen an outspoken critic about the National Youth Anti-Drug Media \nCampaign's latest efforts; however, there is a clear need for further \neducation to parents and communities across the country about the \ndangers of prescription drug abuse and the abuse of nonprescription \ndrugs such as DXM. These funds should help provide an immediate impact \nin informing parents of the danger that can be found in a medicine \ncabinet at home.\n  This bill also authorizes funding for the Community Anti-Drug \nCoalitions of America, CADCA, to provide education to children under 18 \nabout prescription and OTC drug abuse. It also creates a small federal \ngrant program under SAMHSA at the Department of Health and Human \nServices to provide communities across the country funding if they \ndemonstrate a major prescription or OTC drug problem and have an \neffective strategy to deal with that problem.\n  This legislation is part of an ongoing effort to prevent the abuse of \nDXM, along with other nonprescription and prescription drugs. This \nlegislation is supported by number of groups including the National \nAssociation of Chain Drug Stores, NACDS, the Food Marketing Institute, \nFMI, their member organizations, and the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions \nof America among others. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation and help prevent the abuse of prescription and OTC drugs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2275. A bill to prohibit the manufacture, sale, or distribution in \ncommerce of certain children's products and child care articles that \ncontain phthalates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to ban \nthe use of phthalates in toys.\n  This legislation will ban the use of six types of phthalates in toys, \nwhich are linked to birth defects. Phthalates are plasticizing \nchemicals used in a variety of everyday products, including cosmetics, \nnail polish, paint, and shower curtains. Alarmingly, they are used in a \nvariety of children's toys, such as rubber ducks, teething rings, and \nbath toys.\n  This legislation will ban the manufacture, sale or distributions of \ntoys and childcare articles that contain more than .1 percent of DEHP, \nDBP, or BBP.\n  It will also ban the manufacture, sale, or distribution of toys and \nchildcare articles for use by children 3 years old or younger that \ncontain more than .1 percent of DINP, DIDP, or DnOP.\n  It clearly states that phthalates cannot be replaced with other \ndangerous chemicals identified by the Environmental Protection Agency \nas carcinogens, possible carcinogens, or chemicals that cause \nreproductive or developmental harm.\n  Phthalates are used in a variety of PVC, polyvinyl chloride, plastic \nproducts to make them soft and pliable. Phthalates are not chemically \nbonded to PVC molecules. When a child places a plastic toy with \nphthalates into his or her mouth, these phthalates leach out of the \nplastic product and into the child's system.\n  Phthalates are found in many common children's toys: rubber ducks, \nsoft bath books, teethers, and even dolls. In 2006, the San Francisco \nChronicle sent 16 common children's toys to a Chicago lab for testing \nto see if they exceeded the .1 percent limit proposed in this \nlegislation. The results should alarm parents everywhere. One teether \ncontained a phthalate at five times the proposed limit. A rubber duck \nsold at Walgreens had 13 times the proposed limit of DEHP, a \ncarcinogenic phthalate. The face of a popular doll contained double the \nproposed phthalate limit.\n  While the science is still evolving, we know that exposure to \nphthalates can cause serious long-term health effects. Phthalates \ninterfere with the natural functioning of the hormone system, and can \ncause reproductive abnormalities, many resulting from low levels of \ntestosterone.\n  In 2005, Dr. Shanna Swan of the University of Rochester School of \nMedicine found that pregnant women with high levels of phthalates in \ntheir urine were more likely to give birth to boys with a birth defect \nthat is a key indicator of low testosterone levels.\n  Men with high phthalate levels have lower sperm counts and damaged \nsperm DNA.\n  Phthalate exposure has also been linked to premature birth and the \nearly onset of puberty. They may be a factor in some cancers.\n  Young children, whose bodies are still growing and developing, are \nparticularly vulnerable when exposed to phthalates in the toys around \nthem.\n  In the face of this troubling science, at least 14 other nations have \nacted to ban or restrict the use of phthalates in children's products. \nExamples include: the European Union's ban, upon which this legislation \nis modeled, has been in effect since 2006; the Argentina Ministry of \nHealth imposed a ban in 1999; and Japan banned toys containing DEHP and \nDINP intended to be put in the mouth of children up to the age of 6.\n  My home State of California recently became the first state to ban \nphthalates in toys and other products intended for children. California \nparents will now know that the toys they give their children are not \nplacing them at risk for serious health problems.\n  It is time for the rest of the country to follow the lead of \nCalifornia, the European Union, and other nations. Without action, the \nU.S. risks becoming a dumping ground for phthalate laden toys that \ncannot legally be sold elsewhere. American children deserve better.\n  Opponents of this ban will argue that we cannot safely replace \nphthalates, and that these replacements could place children at an even \ngreater risk. The experience in the European Union certainly suggests \notherwise.\n  Facing the phthalate ban, European manufacturers began to develop \nalternatives. Danisco, a Danish company, has introduced a phthalate \nalternative that has been approved for use in both the U.S. and the \nEuropean Union.\n  Manufacturers have found ways to make safe, phthalate free toys for \nEuropean Union children, and there is no reason that they should not do \nthe same for American children.\n  There is much we do not know about the chemicals that surround us. \nEvidence is demonstrating that phthalates are posing a risk to \nchildren. I strongly believe that products not known to be safe should \nnot be in the hands and mouths of children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and to provide all \nAmerican children with the same safe toys available in Europe and \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2275\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Chemical Risk \n     Reduction Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. BAN ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS CONTAINING PHTHALATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n\n[[Page S13629]]\n\n       (1) phthalates are a class of chemicals used in polyvinyl \n     chloride (PVC) plastic to improve flexibility and in \n     cosmetics to bind fragrance to the product and are used in \n     many products intended for use by young children, including, \n     teethers, toys, and soft plastic books; and\n       (2) there is extensive scientific literature reporting the \n     hormone-disrupting effects of phthalates and substantial \n     evidence of phthalates found in humans at levels associated \n     with adverse effects.\n       (b) Banned Hazardous Substance.--Effective January 1, 2009, \n     any children's product or child care article that contains a \n     phthalate shall be treated as a banned hazardous substance \n     under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261 et \n     seq.) and the prohibitions contained in section 4 of such Act \n     shall apply to such product or article.\n       (c) Prohibition on Use of Certain Alternatives to \n     Phthalates in Children's Products and Child Care Articles.--\n       (1) In general.--If a manufacturer modifies a children's \n     product or child care article that contains a phthalate to \n     comply with the ban under subsection (b), such manufacturer \n     shall--\n       (A) use an alternative to phthalates that is the least \n     toxic; and\n       (B) not use any of the prohibited alternatives to \n     phthalates described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Prohibited alternatives to phthalates.--The prohibited \n     alternatives to phthalates described in this paragraph are \n     the following:\n       (A) Carcinogens rated by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency as Group A, Group B, or Group C carcinogens.\n       (B) Substances described in the List of Chemicals Evaluated \n     for Carcinogenic Potential of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency as follows:\n       (i) Known to be human carcinogens.\n       (ii) Likely to be human carcinogens.\n       (iii) Suggestive of being human carcinogens.\n       (C) Reproductive toxicants identified by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency that cause any of the following:\n       (i) Birth defects.\n       (ii) Reproductive harm.\n       (iii) Developmental harm.\n       (d) Definitions.--As used in this Act--\n       (1) the term ``children's product'' means a toy or any \n     other product designed or intended by the manufacturer for \n     use by a child;\n       (2) the term ``child care article'' means all products \n     designed or intended by the manufacturer to facilitate sleep, \n     relaxation, or the feeding of children, or to help children \n     with sucking or teething; and\n       (3) the term ``children's product or child care article \n     that contains a phthalate'' means--\n       (A) a children's product or a child care article any part \n     of which contains any combination of di-(2-ethylhexyl) \n     phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), or benzyl butyl \n     phthalate (BBP) in concentrations exceeding 0.1 percent; and\n       (B) a children's product or a child care article intended \n     for use by a child less than 3 years of age that--\n       (i) can be placed in a child's mouth; and\n       (ii)(I) contains any combination of diisononyl phthalate \n     (DINP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), or di-n-octyl phthalate \n     (DnOP), in concentrations exceeding 0.1 percent; or\n       (II) contains any combination of di-(2-ethylhexyl) \n     phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl \n     phthalate (BBP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP), diisodecyl \n     phthalate (DIDP), or di-n-octyl phthalate (DnOP), in \n     concentrations exceeding 0.1 percent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2276. A bill to enhance United States competitiveness in \naeronautics, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Aeronautics \nCompetitiveness Act of 2007 with my colleagues, Senators Voinovich and \nWarner.\n  Since the Wright brothers first flew at Kill Devil Hills, aeronautics \nhas been an iconic American industry. The ability to fly is no less \nremarkable because it has now become commonplace; and in fact, that a \nflight across the country is now routine is a wonder in itself. Very \nfew advances have had the national and global impact of the progress of \naeronautics, and at the core of those advances has been a robust \ntradition of American ingenuity and production.\n  The challenges in aeronautics continue to shift. The air traffic \ncontrol system is under strain, and my colleagues on the Commerce \nCommittee have worked diligently this year to chart the path for a \ncomplete overhaul of the system. There are environmental pressures the \nindustry has not faced before, including pressure to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions. At the same time, new sectors of the business, including \nlight jets, show the potential for astonishing growth. All of these \nchallenges require significant technology advances, and a significant \ninvestment in research.\n  We find ourselves at a crossroads. The European Union has written a \nreport entitled ``European Aeronautics: A Vision for 2020.'' I can \nsummarize the vision: it is to supplant the U.S. as the global leader \nin aeronautics in the next 13 years. Toward that goal, the E.U. is \ninvesting about $860 million per year at today's exchange rates in a \nresearch fund for aeronautics and ``sustainable surface transport.'' \nWith the investments of individual countries, the total research \nspending on civil aeronautics is closer to $4.5 billion. In contrast, \nthis year's budget for NASA aeronautics research will be on the order \nof $550 million. Aeronautics is the first ``A'' in NASA, but receives \nless than one-thirtieth of the funds.\n  The aeronautics industry is part of the fabric of American life, and \nhas the highest trade surplus of any industry, at $52 billion last \nyear. But U.S. preeminence is far from assured. This is why I am proud \nto introduce a bill that will help to ensure the future competitiveness \nof U.S. aeronautics. It increases the authorization level for NASA \naeronautics programs by 20 percent per year for the first 2 years, with \na smaller increase in the third year. It creates a more transparent and \ninclusive process for stakeholder input into research priorities, and \nencourages NASA to take selected technologies farther along from basic \nresearch towards development. And it invests in the workforce by \nproviding for scholarships for graduate students at NASA and the FAA, \nand creating a program modeled on the Independent Research and \nDevelopment program.\n  I believe the future is bright for this vital industry, and I \nstrongly feel that we should be unwilling to cede leadership to anyone \nin this area, no matter how determined they may be. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill to preserve the leading role of U.S. \naeronautics.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2278. A bill to improve the prevention, detection, and treatment \nof community and health care-associated infections (CHAI), with a focus \non antibiotic-resistant bacteria; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have seen an increasing amount of \nattention on the growing problem of community and hospital-associated \nmethicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, infections. The \nCDC estimates that in 2005 in the U.S., 94,000 people developed an \ninvasive drug-resistant staph infection. Out of 94,000 infections, \nresearchers found that more than half were acquired in the health care \nsystem--people who had recently had surgery or were on kidney dialysis, \nfor example. Nearly 19,000 Americans die, often needlessly, from these \ninfections every year. This is more than the number of people who died \nfrom HIV/AIDS, homicide, emphysema, or Parkinson's.\n  The infections impact not only our civilian families but also our \nmilitary families. CDC worked with the Army in 2003 to look at an \noutbreak of serious infections among soldiers. Between March and \nOctober 2003, they discovered that 145 American soldiers had been \ninfected with another drug-resistant bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii-\ncalcoaceticus complex, or ABC. This outbreak of drug-resistant wound \ninfections among soldiers in Iraq appears to have come from the U.S. \nmilitary hospitals where they were treated, not the battlefield.\n  Hospitals are taking active steps to identify and control infections, \nbut keep in mind that about half of the infections that end up being \ntreated in a hospital were actually picked up in the community. Schools \nin Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and Kentucky \nhave had to close to help contain the spread of an infection. School \nofficials in Mississippi, New Hampshire, and Virginia reported student \ndeaths within the past month from bacteria, while officials in at least \nfour other States reported cases of students being infected. Most \nrecently, a 12-year-old in Brooklyn died from a community-aquired staph \ninfection.\n\n[[Page S13630]]\n\n  In the State of Illinois, cases of the drug-resistant staph infection \nclosed schools in Aurora and Joliet. Other cases were confirmed in the \nIndian Prairie School District in the Aurora Naperville area. Two \nsuburban Catholic elementary schools outside of Chicago were closed for \nheavy-duty cleaning after school leaders discovered each of the student \nbodies had a case of a drug-resistant staph infection.\n  States are taking important steps to control staph infection. The \nState of Illinois has taken aggressive steps to identify the infection \nbefore it grows out of control. Illinois is the first State to require \ntesting of all high-risk hospital patients and isolation of those who \ncarry the bacteria called MRSA. Twenty-two States have passed laws that \nwill give their residents important information about hospital \ninfections. Nineteen States have laws that require public reporting of \ninfection rates.\n  States are actively pursuing the options that the CDC recommends for \ncommunities and hospitals to help fight the spread of drug-resistant \nbugs. It is time for the Federal Government to follow suit.\n  Today, I introduce the Community and Healthcare Associated Infections \nReduction Act of 2007. This legislation builds on what hospitals are \nalready doing and what infectious disease experts and Government \nagencies agree is critical to reducing the emergence of these \ninfections.\n  My colleagues, Senator Obama and Senator Schumer, and I introduced \nthis bill because we believe we have a national responsibility to \nimprove the prevention, detection, and treatment of community and \nhealth care-associated infections. To do so, we need to tackle the \nproblem from all sides.\n  We need better data to understand the problem at hand. The bill \nrequires hospitals to report infection rates to the Federal Government, \nwhich we will then use to target high risk areas, identify hospitals \nthat are doing a good job of controlling infections, and do a better \njob of communicating what we know to hospitals and health departments \naround the country. With better data, researchers will learn more about \nhow to treat and, ideally, how to prevent these dangerous infections.\n  But, reporting is not enough. We need comprehensive infection control \nprograms. The bill commissions an updated, comprehensive look at best \npractices for hospitals on infection control to provide hospitals the \ntools they need to best address these infections.\n  The bill also requires the Secretary to conduct a feasibility study \non the creation of a Federal payment system to acknowledge and reward \nhospitals that are preventing these infections. Would this system work \nand is it what hospitals need? Hospital workers, doctors, and nurses do \ntheir very best to protect patients from infection. What more can be \ndone to reward hospitals that are keeping infection rates low?\n  In addition, the bill addresses the growing impact of these \ninfections--inside and outside the hospital. A new public health \ncampaign will increase awareness in the public and educate people about \nreducing and preventing infections, especially in schools, locker \nrooms, playgrounds--the areas where we know bacteria can thrive. \nFinally, the bill calls for greater coordination of and greater \nemphasis on research at the Federal level. There are promising \napproaches to the control of infectious disease--for example, some \ninvestigators are looking at the use of bacteria-resistant surfaces in \nhospitals and other settings.\n  In a Nation as rich as ours, with the best health care professionals \nin the world, we don't expect people to come into a health care setting \nwith a broken bone and then go home with a dangerous infection. Our \nhealth care system is safe and high quality, and I think we can only \nimprove on that with a stronger emphasis on prevention, reporting and \nresearch. Our patients need it, our families deserve it, and everyone \nof us wants it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2278\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community and Healthcare-\n     Associated Infections Reduction Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Effective antibiotics have transformed the practice of \n     medicine and saved millions of lives, but the emergence and \n     spread of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens poses a \n     significant threat to patient and public health.\n       (2) Although many antibiotic-resistant infections occur \n     most frequently among individuals in hospitals and other \n     healthcare facilities, they also affect otherwise healthy \n     individuals in the community.\n       (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (referred to in this Act as the ``CDC''), \n     healthcare-associated infections (referred to in this Act as \n     ``HAI'') are one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the \n     United States.\n       (4) In American hospitals alone, HAI account for an \n     estimated 1,700,000 infections and 99,000 associated deaths \n     each year. In 70 percent of these deaths, the bacteria are \n     resistant to at least one commonly used antibiotic.\n       (5) Dr. John Jernigan, Chief of Interventions and \n     Evaluations at the CDC, estimates that HAI in hospitals \n     result in up to $27,500,000,000 in additional healthcare \n     costs annually. The growing problem of antibiotic resistance, \n     which affects the most common and least expensive antibiotics \n     first, also shifts utilization toward more expensive \n     antibiotics.\n       (6) Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (referred \n     to in this Act as ``MRSA''), one of the most dangerous forms \n     of antibiotic-resistant staph infections, highlights the \n     magnitude of the problem. A recent study by the CDC estimates \n     that nearly 95,000 people became infected with invasive MRSA \n     in 2005 in the United States, resulting in 19,000 deaths, \n     more than the number who died from HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's \n     disease, emphysema, or homicide. A vast majority (85 percent) \n     of these infections were associated with healthcare \n     treatment.\n       (7) MRSA also affects individuals outside the healthcare \n     setting and in the community. Recent weeks have seen an \n     increase by health and education officials in reported staph \n     infection outbreaks, including antibiotic-resistant strains. \n     These infections have occurred in New York, Kentucky, \n     Virginia, Maryland, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, \n     and the District of Columbia.\n       (8) The problem of antibiotic-resistant infections is not \n     limited to MRSA. High levels of resistance in enterococci, \n     Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and E. coli \n     have also been reported.\n       (9) Antibiotic-resistant infections have been discovered in \n     troops coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. A CDC study \n     showed that between March and October 2003, 145 United States \n     service members at military treatment facilities were \n     infected or colonized with a multidrug-resistant gram-\n     negative bacterium called Acinetobacter baumannii. The most \n     likely source of this outbreak was bacteria within deployed \n     field hospitals.\n       (10) Despite this significant public health threat, \n     information on community and healthcare-associated infections \n     (referred to in this Act as ``CHAI'') is incomplete and \n     unreliable. Policymakers, healthcare providers, and \n     individual consumers have little information about hospital \n     infection rates, making it difficult to diagnose the scope of \n     the problem and evaluate current infection prevention \n     efforts, and assess potential remedies.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to combat international violence against women and \ngirls; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, one in three women worldwide will \nexperience gender-based violence in her lifetime. In some countries, \nthat's true for 70 percent of women. No country is immune. From \ntrafficking of women in Eastern Europe to ``honor'' killings in Jordan \nto rape being used as a brutal weapon of war in Darfur and the Congo, \nviolence against women and girls crosses all borders and affects women \nin all social groups, religions and socio-economic classes.\n  Around the globe, women and girls face domestic violence, rape, \nforced or child marriage, so-called ``honor'' killings, dowry-related \nmurder, human trafficking, and female genital mutilation. The United \nNations estimates that at least 5,000 ``honor'' killings take place \neach year around the world and more than 130,000,000 girls and young \nwomen worldwide have been subjected to genital mutilation. A 2006 \nUnited Nations Report found that at least 102 member states had no \nspecific laws on domestic violence. The statistics are staggering.\n  Not surprisingly, violence against women and girls has a profound \nimpact on the health and development of countries worldwide. Violence \nbreeds poverty. It impedes economic development because it can prevent \ngirls from going to school, or stop women from holding jobs or \ninheriting property, or shut down access to critical health care for \nthemselves and their children. We can't eradicate poverty and disease \nunless we prevent and respond to the violence women face in their own \nhomes and communities. We cannot truly empower women to become active \nin civic life and promote peace, prosperity and democracy unless they \npersonally are free from fear of violence.\n  Violence against women is a global health crisis, not just because so \nmany women and girls are injured and die as a result, but also because \ninequality and violence interfere with current efforts to combat the \nHIV/AIDS pandemic. Forced sex increases vulnerability to HIV/AIDS \ntransmission, in part, because condoms are not likely to be used. In \nsub-Saharan Africa alone, women account for close to three-quarters of \nthose living with HIV/AIDS between the ages 18 and 24.\n  The picture is grim, and can be discouraging. But the good news is \nthat local and international organizations are working in communities \naround the world with courage, sensitivity and great success to help \nwomen overcome violence at home, in school and at work. But they need \nour help.\n  We've made tremendous progress in reducing violence against women \nhere in the United States since we passed the Violence Against Women \nAct, VAWA, in 1994. That important work continues. But we cannot ignore \nthe devastation wrought by violence in every corner of the globe. Now \nis the time to turn our attention to women in other parts of the \nworld--women whose lives are devastated by poverty, political and civic \nexclusion, disease, and violence. Gender-based violence contributes to \nthe poverty, inequality and instability that threaten peace. Addressing \nit isn't just moral; it is also smart.\n  So today, during this final week of Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth, I am introducing with my good friend from Indiana, Senator \nLugar, the International Violence Against Women Act. This \ngroundbreaking, bipartisan legislation would integrate efforts to end \ngender-based violence into all existing, appropriate U.S. foreign \nassistance programs.\n  The International Violence Against Women Act has three main \ncomponents. First, the bill reorganizes and rejuvenates the gender-\nrelated efforts of the State Department by creating one central \noffice--the ``Office for\n\n[[Page S13633]]\n\nWomen's Global Initiatives'', directed by a Senate-confirmed Ambassador \nwho reports directly to the Secretary. The Coordinator of the Office or \nWomen's Global Initiatives, the ``Coordinator'', will be charged with \nmonitoring, coordinating, and organizing all U.S. resources, programs \nand aid abroad that deals with women's issues, including gender-based \nviolence. Additionally, my bill creates a new Office of Women's Global \nDevelopment at the United States Agency for International Development, \nalso to be directed by a Senate-confirmed nominee. The Director will be \nresponsible for addressing gender-based violence and integrating gender \ninto U.S. government assistance programs. The Director will work \nclosely with the Coordinator and the Secretary of State to implement \nthe provisions of the IVAWA legislation.\n  Under the current organizational scheme, projects addressing violence \nagainst women, either primarily or tangentially, are spread throughout \nthe State Department and USAID without a central inventory, game plan \nor leader. My bill will raise the profile of women's issues generally \nat the State Department, and ensure that gender-based violence programs \nare building on past successes, leveraging core competencies and \nworking in conjunction with other initiatives.\n  Second, the International Violence Against Women Act mandates \ncreation of a 5-year, comprehensive strategy, with coordinated \nprogramming, to prevent and respond to violence against women in 10 to \n20 targeted countries. The act creates a dedicated funding stream of \n$175 million a year to support programs dealing with violence against \nwomen in five areas: the criminal and civil justice system--everything \nfrom drafting laws on domestic violence, to enhancing women's access to \nproperty and inheritance rights, to reforming police practices--health \ncare, girls' access to education and school safety, women's access to \nemployment and financial resources, and public awareness campaigns that \nchange social norms.\n  I know from my experience in Delaware that coordinating community \nresponses in towns and cities has made all the difference in fighting \ndomestic violence and rape. I applied those same principles of \ncoordination and joint programming to the International Violence \nAgainst Women Act. International experts agree on the necessity of a \nmulti-disciplinary approach that brings governments and nongovernmental \norganizations to the table to create sustainable infrastructure. To be \nclear, the International Violence Against Women Act is not asking \ncountries to reinvent the wheel. At every step our strategy will lead \nto coordination of efforts to have the greatest possible impact. This \ntype of effective, cost-efficient, gender-based violence programming \nalready exists and is taking place in pockets all around the globe. We \nhave the blueprints; my Act would provide the momentum and support for \na full-scale international priority.\n  Finally, as the recent reports from the Congo make tragically clear, \nin situations of humanitarian crises, conflict and post-conflict \noperations, women and girls are vulnerable to horrific acts of \nviolence. Reports of refugee women being raped while collecting \nfirewood, soldiers sexually abusing girls in exchange for token food \nitems, or women subjected to unimaginable brutality and torture as a \ntactic of war are shocking in number and inhumanity. The Act requires \ntraining, reporting mechanisms and other measures for those who are \nworking directly with or protecting refugees and other vulnerable \npopulations. The act also requires that the State Department identify \n``critical outbreaks'' in which violence against women and girls is \nbeing used as a weapon of intimidation and abuse in armed conflict or \nwar, or is escalating in an environment of impunity, and to take \nemergency measures to respond to the outbreaks.\n  The issue of violence against women and girls is complex and our \nlegislation is a bold and ambitious plan. There are limitations on the \nUnited States' power to ``fix'' a problem that is so widespread. We are \nmindful that no country has a perfect record or all the answers. Yet \nCongress has a long and proud history of tackling complex international \nproblems, most recently the devastating epidemic of HIV/AIDS and the \ninsidious crime of human trafficking.\n  I did not approach this legislation lightly. Over the past months, \nI've solicited information from every relevant office in the State \nDepartment, USAID and the Department of Justice that works on the \nissues of women's rights and gender-based violence abroad. I asked for \ninput and information from the United Nations secretariat, and many of \nits subsidiary agencies who are working to prevent and respond to \ngender-based violence internationally in various capacities. And most \nimportantly, the International Violence Against Women Act was drafted \nwith the insight and expertise of over 100 nongovernmental \norganizations and 40 women's groups around the globe, including \nAmerican Refugee Committee, Amnesty International, CARE, \nChristian Children's Fund, Family Violence Prevention Fund, Global AIDS \nAlliance, Human Rights Watch, Inter-Agency Gender Working Group, IGWAG, \nInternational Rescue Committee, International Justice Mission, Women's \nEdge Coalition, Vital Voices Global Partnership and many others. I \nthank all of them for their invaluable assistance and perseverance as \nthis bill came together.\n\n  Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said ``Violence \nagainst women is perhaps the most shameful human rights violation. And \nit is perhaps the most pervasive. It knows no boundaries of geography, \nculture or wealth. As long as it continues, we cannot claim to be \nmaking real progress towards equity, development and peace.'' I could \nnot agree more. My International Violence Against Women Act marshals \ntogether, for the first time, coordinated American resources, good will \nand leadership to address this global issue. I believe the time is now \nfor the U.S. to get actively engaged in the fight for women's lives and \ngirls' futures.\n  Over the past 30 years, the understanding of human rights and \nviolence against women has metamorphosed. A State's responsibility to \nprotect women from violence has evolved--what was once seen largely as \na private, family or cultural matter is now understood by the \ninternational community as a violation of basic human rights. Violence \nagainst women is a legal wrong. It cannot be excused or justified or \nignored. It is an engrained social norm but one that we can dismantle \nover time--one woman at a time--with patience, creativity and sustained \npolitical will. The International Violence Against Women Act is the \nfirst step.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2279\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Amendments to Foreign Service Act of 1980.\nSec. 202. Support for multilateral efforts to end violence against \n              women and girls.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Violence against women and girls is rooted in multiple \n     causes and takes many forms, including physical, sexual, and \n     psychological. It affects all countries, social groups, \n     ethnicities, religions, and socioeconomic classes and is a \n     global health, economic development, and human rights problem \n     of epidemic proportions.\n       (2) According to the World Health Organization--\n       (A) approximately 1 in 3 of the women in the world will \n     experience violence in her lifetime, with rates of up to 70 \n     percent in some countries; and\n\n[[Page S13634]]\n\n       (B) 1 in 5 of the women in the world will be the victim of \n     rape or attempted rape in her lifetime.\n       (3) According to the 2006 United Nations Secretary-\n     General's report entitled Ending Violence Against Women, 102 \n     member states have no specific laws on domestic violence.\n       (4) Women and girls face many different types of gender-\n     based violence, including forced or child marriage, so-called \n     ``honor killings'', dowry-related murder, human trafficking, \n     and female genital mutilation. The United Nations estimates \n     that at least 5,000 so-called ``honor killings'' take place \n     each year around the world and that more than 130,000,000 \n     girls and young women worldwide have been subjected to female \n     genital mutilation.\n       (5) The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief 2006 \n     Report on Gender-Based Violence and HIV/AIDS reports that \n     violence against women is a public health and development \n     problem that significantly increases susceptibility to HIV/\n     AIDS. A United Nations study on the global AIDS epidemic \n     found that in sub-Saharan Africa, women who are 15 to 24 \n     years old can be infected at rates that are up to 6 times \n     higher than men of the same age.\n       (6) Recent studies in Africa indicate that between 16 and \n     47 percent of girls in primary and secondary school report \n     sexual abuse or harassment by male teachers or classmates. \n     Girls who experience sexual violence at school are also more \n     likely to experience unintended pregnancies or become \n     infected with sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/\n     AIDS.\n       (7) Rape and sexual assault are weapons of war used to \n     torture, intimidate, and terrorize women and communities. \n     Amnesty International reports that women have suffered from \n     sexual violence during conflicts in Rwanda, the former \n     Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, and most recently in the Democratic \n     Republic of the Congo, where women have suffered from brutal \n     and systematic sexual assaults.\n       (8) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and girls in \n     humanitarian emergencies, conflict settings, and natural \n     disasters face extreme violence and threats because of power \n     inequities, including being forced to exchange sex for food \n     and humanitarian supplies, and being at increased risk of \n     rape, sexual exploitation, and abuse.\n       (9) According to the United States Agency for International \n     Development (USAID)--\n       (A) 70 percent of the 1,300,000,000 people living in \n     poverty in the world are women and children;\n       (B) \\2/3\\ of the 876,000,000 illiterate adults in the world \n     are women;\n       (C) \\2/3\\ of the 125,000,000 school-aged children who are \n     not in school are girls;\n       (D) more than \\3/4\\ of the 27,000,000 refugees in the world \n     are women and children; and\n       (E) 1,600 women die unnecessarily every day during \n     pregnancy and childbirth.\n       (10) In 2003, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on \n     Violence Against Women concluded that violence against women \n     violates the basic human rights of women, results in \n     ``devastating consequences for women who experience it, \n     traumatic impact on those who witness it, de-legitimization \n     of States that fail to prevent it and the impoverishment of \n     entire societies that tolerate it.''.\n       (11) Violence against women is an impediment to the health, \n     opportunity, and development of women and their societies. \n     According to an October 2006 study of the United Nations \n     Secretary General entitled Ending Violence Against Women, \n     ``Violence against women impoverishes women, their families, \n     communities and nations. It lowers economic production, \n     drains resources from public services and employers, and \n     reduces human capital formation.''.\n       (12) The World Bank recognizes that women's health, \n     education, and economic opportunities directly impact the \n     development and well being of their families and their \n     societies. A 2001 World Bank Report, entitled Engendering \n     Development, reports that greater gender equality leads to \n     improved nutrition, lower child mortality, less government \n     corruption, higher productivity, and reduced HIV infection \n     rates.\n       (13) Increased access to economic opportunities is crucial \n     to the prevention of and response to domestic and sexual \n     violence. Both microfinance-based interventions and increased \n     asset control have been shown to reduce levels of intimate \n     partner violence in addition to providing economic \n     independence for survivors.\n       (14) Campaigns to change social norms, including community \n     organizing, media campaigns, and efforts to engage and \n     educate men and boys, have been shown to change attitudes \n     that condone and tolerate violence against women and girls \n     and reduce violence and abuse.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to promote women's political, economic, educational, \n     social, cultural, civil, and human rights and opportunities \n     throughout the world;\n       (2) to condemn and combat violence against women and girls, \n     and to promote and assist other governments in preventing and \n     responding to such violence;\n       (3) to promote ending violence against women and girls \n     around the world, whether the abuse is committed directly by \n     a foreign government, is implicitly committed by such \n     government through hostile laws or de jure mandates to \n     disenfranchise women, or is committed by private actors and \n     the government fails to address the abuse;\n       (4) to encourage foreign governments to enact and implement \n     effective legal reform to combat violence against women and \n     girls, and to encourage access to justice, true \n     accountability for abusers, and meaningful redress and \n     support for victims;\n       (5) to systematically integrate and coordinate efforts to \n     prevent and respond to violence against women and girls into \n     United States foreign policy and foreign assistance programs, \n     and to expand implementation of effective practices and \n     programs;\n       (6) to fully implement the comprehensive international \n     strategy set forth in section 300G of the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961, as added by this Act, which provides assistance \n     to eligible countries to reduce and prevent gender-based \n     violence with coordinated efforts in the criminal justice, \n     health, education, and economic sectors;\n       (7) to support and build capacity of indigenous \n     nongovernmental organizations that are working to prevent and \n     respond to violence against women and girls, particularly \n     women's nongovernmental organizations, and to support and \n     encourage United States organizations working in partnership \n     with such nongovernmental organizations;\n       (8) to prevent and respond to violence against women and \n     girls through multisectoral methods, working at individual, \n     family, community, local, national, and international levels \n     and incorporating service, prevention, training, and advocacy \n     activities and economic, education, health, legal, and \n     protective intervention services;\n       (9) to coordinate activities with recipient country \n     governments, as appropriate, and with other bilateral, \n     multilateral, nongovernmental, and private sector actors \n     active in the relevant sector and country;\n       (10) to foster international and regional cooperation with \n     an aim towards defining regional strategies, as appropriate, \n     for preventing and responding to violence against women and \n     girls, and exchanging data and successful strategies;\n       (11) to work through international organizations of which \n     the United States is a member, including the United Nations \n     and its specialized agencies, funds and programs to \n     encourage, promote, and advocate for stronger efforts and \n     policies to prevent and end violence against women and girls;\n       (12) to enhance training and other programs to prevent and \n     respond to violence against women and girls in humanitarian \n     relief, conflict, and post-conflict operations;\n       (13) to enhance training by United States personnel of \n     professional foreign military and police forces and judicial \n     officials to include specific and thorough instruction on \n     preventing and responding to violence against women and \n     girls;\n       (14) to press for the implementation of policies and \n     practices in global peace and security efforts, including \n     United Nations peacekeeping and policing operations, that \n     prevent and respond to violence against women and girls and \n     hold personnel accountable for the full implementation of \n     these policies and practices.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 362\n\n       Whereas the American Society of Agronomy was founded on \n     December 31, 1907, with Mark A. Carleton as the first \n     President of the Society;\n       Whereas the American Society of Agronomy is one of the \n     premier scientific societies in the world, as demonstrated by \n     first-class journals, international and regional meetings, \n     and development of a broad range of educational \n     opportunities;\n       Whereas the science and scholarship of the American Society \n     of Agronomy are mission-directed, and seek to foster \n     exploration and application of agronomic science, with the \n     goal of increasing and disseminating knowledge concerning the \n     nature, use, improvement, and interrelationships of plants, \n     soil, water, and the environment;\n       Whereas the American Society of Agronomy strives to obtain \n     that goal by promoting effective research, disseminating \n     scientific information, facilitating technology transfer, \n     fostering high standards of education, striving to maintain \n     high standards of ethics, promoting advancements in the \n     agronomy profession, and cooperating with other organizations \n     with similar objectives;\n       Whereas the American Society of Agronomy significantly \n     contributes to the scientific and technical knowledge \n     necessary to protect and sustain natural resources in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the American Society of Agronomy has a critical \n     international role in developing sustainable agricultural \n     management standards for the protection of land resources;\n       Whereas the mission of the American Society of Agronomy \n     continues to expand, from the development of sustainable \n     production of food, fiber, and forage, to the production of \n     renewable energy and biobased industrial products;\n       Whereas the American Society of Agronomy certifies a body \n     of professional Certified Crop Advisors and Certified \n     Professional Agronomists who work closely with agricultural \n     producers to develop nutrient management plans that are \n     designed to minimize environmental risk in production \n     agriculture;\n       Whereas, in industry, extension, and basic research, the \n     American Society of Agronomy has fostered a dedicated \n     professional and scientific community that, in 2007, includes \n     more than 8,015 members and 13,015 certified crop advisor \n     professionals; and\n       Whereas the American Society of Agronomy was the parent \n     society that led to the formation of both the Crop Science \n     Society of America and the Soil Science Society of America \n     and later fostered the common overall management of these 3 \n     related societies: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes 2007 as the 100th anniversary year of the \n     American Society of Agronomy;\n       (2) commends the American Society of Agronomy for 100 years \n     of dedicated service to advance the science and practice of \n     agronomy; and\n       (3) acknowledges the promise of the American Society of \n     Agronomy to continue to enrich the lives of all citizens, by \n     improving stewardship of the environment, combating world \n     hunger, and enhancing the quality of life for the next 100 \n     years and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/10/31/senate-section/article/S13641-3", "month": "10", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3491.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as ``Health Care Choice Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. _02. SPECIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY FOR \n                   ENACTMENT OF LAW.\n\n       This title is enacted pursuant to the power granted \n     Congress under article I, section 8, clause 3, of the United \n     States Constitution.\n\n     SEC. _03. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The application of numerous and significant variations \n     in State law impacts the ability of insurers to offer, and \n     individuals to obtain, affordable individual health insurance \n     coverage, thereby impeding commerce in individual health \n     insurance coverage.\n       (2) Individual health insurance coverage is increasingly \n     offered through the Internet, other electronic means, and by \n     mail, all of which are inherently part of interstate \n     commerce.\n       (3) In response to these issues, it is appropriate to \n     encourage increased efficiency in the offering of individual \n     health insurance coverage through a collaborative approach by \n     the States in regulating this coverage.\n       (4) The establishment of risk-retention groups has provided \n     a successful model for the sale of insurance across State \n     lines, as the acts establishing those groups allow insurance \n     to be sold in multiple States but regulated by a single \n     State.\n\n     SEC. _04. COOPERATIVE GOVERNING OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH \n                   INSURANCE COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title XXVII of the Public Health Service \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new part:\n\n[[Page S13642]]\n\n``PART D--COOPERATIVE GOVERNING OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE\n\n     ``SEC. 2795. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       ``In this part:\n       ``(1) Primary state.--The term `primary State' means, with \n     respect to individual health insurance coverage offered by a \n     health insurance issuer, the State designated by the issuer \n     as the State whose covered laws shall govern the health \n     insurance issuer in the sale of such coverage under this \n     part. An issuer, with respect to a particular policy, may \n     only designate one such State as its primary State with \n     respect to all such coverage it offers. Such an issuer may \n     not change the designated primary State with respect to \n     individual health insurance coverage once the policy is \n     issued, except that such a change may be made upon renewal of \n     the policy.
