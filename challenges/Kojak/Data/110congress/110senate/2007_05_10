We \nwere just earlier talking about his experience as a tour guide and just \nhow wonderfully warm he and his family have been received as tour \nguides when they have been in Palestine. It was very warm and \nencouraging just listening to him describe that.\n  He is here today with his wife Donna and two of his daughters, Katie \nand Stephanie, as well as with many of his extended family. They are \nall enjoying this moment with Pastor Paul, and we welcome all of you \nhere today, too.\n  So, Paul, thank you for your life of faith, your leadership of the \nGood Shepherd Lutheran Church, and for your service to the community of \nPolson, MT, and to many others who I know attend your church.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Mr. President, I am concerned about comments made by a \nRepublican Senator yesterday suggesting that I have made a commitment \nthat the Senate will confirm a specific number of judges in this \nCongress.\n  Senator McConnell and I have a lot of private conversations on a lot \nof different subjects. Senator McConnell has told me that the number of \njudges confirmed and the way judges are handled in this Congress is \nvery important to him. If that, in fact, is the case, that it is \nimportant to him, it is important to me, and I have told him that.\n  The only way this Senate is going to run well is if the Republican \nleader and the Democratic leader have an understanding as to how things \nshould proceed. There are certain things I feel strongly about. He \nknows what they are. I feel that he understands how I feel about those \nthings. And I think the converse is true: If I think something is \nimportant, he thinks it is important.\n  I reiterate, he believes the way judges are handled in this Congress \nis important to him. It is important to me. It is important to both of \nus for a number of reasons.\n  He and I are both lawyers, and we both revere the Federal judiciary. \nWe have worked with present members of the Supreme Court to work on \nincreasing their pay. We have worked with them on a number of issues \nthat are important to the administration of justice in this country. \nThe Federal judiciary, really, is the third branch of our Federal \nGovernment, and it is entitled to great respect.\n  Senator McConnell and I believe that the process for considering \njudicial nominees has become too partisan over the years. The way the \nRepublican-controlled Senate treated President Clinton's judicial \nnominees was wrong. And, of course, Republicans have their grievances \nabout the way Republican nominees have been handled. We could weigh \nthem and say: You treated us worse than we treated you, and vice versa, \nbut that does not solve the problem. In this regard, there is no need \nwe look back to yesterday. We should focus on today and tomorrow, and \nthat is what I intend to do.\n  I do agree, without any reservation, with Senator McConnell that we \nshould work to improve the confirmation process for a number of \nreasons, part of which is selfish; that is, I understand how the Senate \nworks. Everyone is contemplating the election a year from this \nNovember. We are going to have a new President. It may be a Democrat, \nit may be a Republican. Those elections may tilt the balance of this \nSenate so that Democrats have more than just the one-vote majority we \nhave now. But, Mr. President, I have been around here a long time. You \nnever know what is going to happen in an election. We may find \nourselves in the minority.\n  So I think one reason we should put all this stuff behind us is we \nwant to handle the judges the same way, no matter who is President or \nwho is in control of the Senate. The House has nothing to do with \njudges as far as confirmation.\n  I told Senator McConnell we would work hard to process judicial \nnominees in due course and in good faith, and I will continue to do \nthat. To Senator McConnell, due course would mean 15 to 17 circuit \ncourt confirmations in this Congress because that is the historical \naverage for Presidents during the last 2 years a President is in \noffice. I cannot commit to a specific number. We should measure \nquality, not quantity. There is no reason we cannot confirm 15 nominees \nif, in fact, they are seen to be, on both sides, mainstream, capable, \nexperienced nominees who are the product of bipartisan cooperation. But \nwe should not confirm nominees who are out of the mainstream, who are \nunacceptable, for example, to home State senators.\n  Now, I say, Mr. President, I think we started off this year in a good \nlight. The President decided not to resubmit names he knew were \nproblematic, and I say publicly, as I have said to Senator McConnell \nprivately, that showed good faith. I appreciate that.\n  We have confirmed three circuit court nominees in this Congress, \nincluding Debra Livingston of New York yesterday. There is a hearing \nfor Judge Southwick that starts in 20 minutes. He is from Mississippi. \nThat has been a seat which has been very difficult to fill. We have \nbeen through at least two nominees that I know of. I would hope this \nhearing goes well.\n  I will continue to work in good faith. We presently have pending two \njudges on the appellate level. We have a number of district court \njudges, but we will focus today on circuit court judges--Mississippi, \nSouthwick, whom I just talked about, and one who was sent up late last \nmonth from Texas. We are going to make sure we work to move these as \nquickly as possible. But I do not have a specific numerical goal, other \nthan the outline the Republican leader has given. The Senate should \nfulfill its constitutional duty with care and confirm nominees who \ndeserve a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.\n\n  Finally, let me say something about the two who are responsible for \nthis Judiciary Committee, Senators Leahy and Specter. It is no secret--\nit has already been written about--that Senator Leahy and Senator \nHatch, when they were running this committee, had a difficult \nrelationship. It did not work out well. It has also been written \nabout--and very clear--that the relationship between Senator Specter \nand Senator Leahy is one of respect. They have done a lot of work \ntogether, good work together, and they get along extremely well, \nincluding with their work on judges.\n  I do not want the situation on the floor today to show any disrespect \nto the two men running that committee, Leahy and Specter. They are \ndoing the best they can. But I would hope that--in the Senate, Pat \nLeahy has been here a lot longer than I have. He has a distinguished \ncareer--the only Democratic Senator ever elected from the State of \nVermont. He had a distinguished career as a prosecutor before he came \nhere. He has a wonderful family. I care a great deal about him, and I \nhave worked very closely with him over these many years, trying to help \nwhen I could with the work he has in the Judiciary Committee. And I \nwill continue to do that. So I can only say positive things about \nSenator Leahy and Senator Specter as a result of what they are doing in \nthat committee.\n  I do want the record to reflect that--maybe it was a misunderstanding \nof one of the Senators on the other side of the aisle to say I was not \nliving up to my word in not moving forward on judges. At least that is \nwhat I was told he said. If that is the case, I am sure he did not \nunderstand all the facts. The record should be very clear that I am \ngoing to do everything I can as the majority leader, working with \nSenator Leahy, to move these judges as quickly as we can. If, in fact, \nthere are problems that arise during the confirmation process, I cannot \nmake myself the Committee of the Judiciary. I am only\n\n[[Page S5883]]\n\none Senator. I am not a member of that committee. That will be up to \nSenators Leahy and Specter to run as they see fit and to bring the \nnominations forward. I will do what I can, working with Senator Leahy, \nto expedite the judicial process, but I do not want to interfere with \ntheir work other than to say what I have said. I hope people understand \nthe relationship Senator McConnell and I have as to how the Senate runs \nis extremely important. There are times, I can tell my colleagues \nwithout any reservation, when I wish I were the Speaker of the House. \nThe Speaker of the House doesn't have to worry about the minority; they \nrun over everybody. That is the way it is set up. But here, the \nFounding Fathers those many years ago when they came up with this \nunique experiment called the Congress, a bicameral legislature, these \nwise men set up this situation so that one House, if you are in \ncontrol--if one party is in control, they can do anything they want, \nand in the other House--the Senate--if one party is in control, they \ncan do some things they want but not everything, because the minority \nhas tremendous power in the Senate. I know. I have been in the minority \nquite a bit.\n\n  So I want the Record to reflect I will continue to work with Senator \nMcConnell to move these judges as quickly as we can, and I hope this \nstatement reflects my position on judges. I will do my very best, and \nif any problems arise regarding judges and people don't understand my \nposition, if I haven't explained it clearly enough today, I will try to \ndo so again if any questions arise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/10/senate-section/article/S5883-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, seeing the occupant of the Chair and \nrealizing he is new to the Senate and learning the process here, I \nthink the majority leader had it right. One thing that is important for \neveryone to remember is that in the Senate, if you are here for a \nwhile, sooner or later the shoe is on the other foot. The position you \nare in today is the position your adversary may be in very soon in the \nfuture. So the precedents we set in the Senate are extremely important.\n  The majority leader and I, as he indicated this morning, talked about \nthis issue at the beginning of the session and we agreed that the \nprocess of confirming circuit court judges had become entirely too \ncontentious, and it was largely a waste of time to try to cast blame as \nto who was most at fault in that situation developing. To the maximum \nextent possible, we agreed we wanted to have a clean, fresh start that \nwould honor the traditions of the Senate.\n  A good way to look at it is to look at the last three Presidents. \nEach of them in the last 2 years of their tenure in office had a Senate \ncontrolled by the opposition party. So the question is, how did the \nopposition party in the Senate treat the President on circuit court \nnominees? Looking at the statistics, President Bush, 41; President \nClinton and President Bush, 43; and we will see how he comes out, \nPresident Bush, President Clinton, and President Reagan, there were an \naverage of 17 circuit court judges confirmed in similar situations.\n  The majority leader, in one of our discussions on the floor back in \nFebruary, said:\n\n       This is not our last circuit court judge, but the first of \n     a significant number who can at least meet the standards of \n     Congresses similarly situated as ours.\n\n  That was an accurate public reflection by the majority leader back in \nFebruary of the numerous conversations he and I have had, both publicly \nand privately, about the standard we ought to achieve here in this \nCongress. I think that is a standard that can still be met. Three \ncircuit judges have been confirmed this year--a little slower process \nthan frankly I had thought, particularly since we are in the early part \nof the Congress where presumably it would be more easily done than \nlater. The majority leader was entirely correct, and I commend him, for \nreferring to the gesture the President made at the beginning of this \nCongress about not resubmitting four or five highly contentious \nnominees that it is clear the new Democratic majority, as well as the \nDemocratic minority in the past, did not want to see confirmed. The \nPresident took those off the table, sent up new nominees, and most of \nthem are completely without controversy. One of them will have a \nhearing beginning at 10 o'clock this morning, and how that turns out \nand how that individual is treated will tell us a lot about where we \nare going to be able to go from here to achieve the standard the \nmajority leader referred to that he and I wish to meet for this \nCongress.\n  I thank my friend from Nevada for his observations. I agree with \nthem. I think they accurately reflect our mutual desire here to have \nthis Congress do no worse than the last three Congresses--this Senate--\nin the last 2 years with Presidents of the opposite party. It is a \nstandard that can be met. It is a standard that should be met.\n  One day, in spite of the best efforts of people like myself, there \nwill be a Democratic President. One of the things we know around here \nis that precedents established and lessons learned are hard to undo. So \nI say to our good friends on the other side, heed the advice of the \nmajority leader. It is in your best interests for us to have a less \ncontentious and more successful treatment of circuit judges during this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/10/senate-section/article/S5883-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator will be informed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, around here we have a lot of tough issues. \nWe have a lot of disagreements. We try to work together. I have to say \non this bill, this Water Resources Development Act, we have a bill that \nis the product of major bipartisan cooperation. Senator Inhofe and I \nare very proud of the work that has been done on both sides of the \naisle. We have had tremendous help from our committee. The chair and \nranking member of the subcommittee that oversees this, Chairman Baucus \nand Ranking Member Isakson, have been extraordinarily helpful, and all \ncolleagues have as well.\n  It is rare to have a bill that is supported by the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers and the Laborers Union, the American Farm \nBureau and the Carpenters Union, the National Waterways Conference, the \nAssociated General Contractors, and the Operating\n\n[[Page S5884]]\n\nEngineers. So we are here today to tell the Senate that this bill is a \nwin-win for everyone in this country. We urge our colleagues who have \namendments to consider them carefully, because we have worked so hard \nto balance this bill. It is a delicate balance. I know I have \ncolleagues on my side who have ideas that I support, but I have an \nagreement, as does Senator Baucus, as do Senator Isakson and Senator \nInhofe, that we will oppose all amendments that are not unanimously \nagreed to by the four of us in order to keep the balance in this bill. \nIf we have amendments all four of us can agree to, they will be placed \nin a managers' package.\n  We want colleagues to please come to this floor as soon as possible \nwith their amendments so we can see how we can dispose of them. Even \nthough we will probably not be voting tomorrow or Monday, we will be \nworking here on this bill.\n  This bill makes a huge commitment to the people of Louisiana. It puts \nLouisiana's coast on a category 5 protection path. It is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent to do something very important, \nwhich is to have printed in the Record the CBO cost estimate associated \nwith the substitute text that will be considered by the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2007.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairman: As you requested, CBO has reviewed a \n     proposed amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 1248, \n     the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, as ordered \n     reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works on March 29, 2007. The amendment was provided to CBO by \n     your office on May 7, 2007. Based on a preliminary review of \n     the amendment, CBO estimates that implementing S. 1248 with \n     the proposed amendment would increase discretionary outlays \n     by $7.1 billion over the 2008-2012 period and by an \n     additional $6.8 billion over the 10 years after 2012, \n     assuming appropriation of the necessary sums. In addition, \n     CBO estimates that enacting the bill with the proposed \n     amendment would increase direct spending by $6 million in \n     2008, by $4 million over the 2008-2012 period, and by $5 \n     million over the 2008-2017 period. Enacting the bill would \n     not affect federal revenues.\n       The bill with the proposed amendment contains no \n     intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). Federal participation in the \n     levee safety program and in water resource projects and \n     programs authorized by this bill would benefit state, local, \n     and tribal governments. Any costs incurred by those \n     governments to comply with the conditions of this federal \n     assistance would be incurred voluntarily.\n       Based on a preliminary review of the bill, CBO found no new \n     private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       The estimated budgetary impact of the legislation with the \n     proposed amendment is shown in the following table.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                                               -------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  2008      2009      2010      2011      2012\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nEstimated authorization level.................................     1,649     1,725     1,648     1,571     1,454\nEstimated outlays.............................................       909     1,448     1,651     1,599     1,501\n \n                                         CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING. \\1\\\n \nEstimated budget authority....................................         6        -2         *         *         *\nEstimated outlays.............................................         6        -2         *         *        *\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTE: * = less than $500,000.\n\\1\\ Annual changes in direct spending after 2012 would sum to less than $500,000 a year.\n\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Tyler \n     Kruzich.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Peter R. Orszag,\n                                                         Director.\n\n                Water Resources Development Act of 2007\n\n       Summary: The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 would \n     authorize the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to conduct \n     water resource studies and undertake specified projects and \n     programs for flood control, inland navigation, shoreline \n     protection, and environmental restoration. The bill would \n     authorize the agency to conduct studies on water resource \n     needs, to complete feasibility studies for specified \n     projects, and to convey ownership of certain federal \n     properties. Finally, the bill would extend, terminate, or \n     modify existing authorizations for various water projects and \n     would authorize new programs to develop water resources and \n     protect the environment.\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, including \n     adjustments for increases in anticipated inflation, CBO \n     estimates that implementing the legislation would cost about \n     $5.5 billion over the 2008-2012 period and an additional $26 \n     billion over the 10 years after 2012. In particular, section \n     1003(0) would effectively authorize the Corps to construct \n     projects in southern Louisiana to protect the region from a \n     hurricane storm surge that results from a category 5 \n     hurricane. Cost estimates to provide that level of protection \n     in the New Orleans region are not available. However, based \n     on the anticipated cost of flood protection projects \n     envisioned for this region, CBO expects that additional flood \n     protection efforts would cost at least $15 billion during the \n     decade following 2012 and perhaps much more. (Some \n     construction costs and operations and maintenance would \n     continue or commence after those first 15 years.)\n       The bill would convey parcels of land to various nonfederal \n     entities and would forgive the obligation of some local \n     government agencies to pay certain project costs. The bill \n     also would allow the Corps to collect and spend fees charged \n     for training courses offered by the Corps and for processing \n     certain permits issued by the Corps. CBO estimates that \n     enacting those provisions would increase net direct spending \n     by $6 million in 2008, by $4 million over the 2008-2012 \n     period, and by $5 million over the 2008-2017 period. Enacting \n     the bill would not affect revenues.\n       The legislation contains no intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act (UMRA). Federal participation in the levee safety program \n     and in water resource projects and programs authorized by \n     this bill would benefit state, local, and tribal governments. \n     Any costs incurred by those governments to comply with the \n     conditions of this federal assistance would be incurred \n     voluntarily.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of the legislation is shown in the following \n     table. The costs of this legislation fall within budget \n     function 300 (natural resources and environment).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                                                               -------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  2008      2009      2010      2011      2012\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nEstimated authorization level.................................     1,224     1,350     1,265     1,209     1,197\nEstimated outlays.............................................       674     1,112     1,272     1,233     1,197\n \n                                         CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING: \\1\\\nEstimated budget authority....................................         6        -2         *         *         *\nEstimated outlays.............................................         6        -2         *         *         *\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: * = less than $500,000.\n\\1\\ Annual changes in direct spending after 2012 would sum to less than $500,000 a year.\n\n       Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that the \n     bill will be enacted before the start of fiscal year 2008 and \n     that the necessary amounts will be appropriated for each \n     fiscal year.\n\n\n                   Spending Subject to Appropriation\n\n       The bill would authorize new projects related to \n     environmental restoration, shoreline protection, and \n     navigation. It also would modify many existing Corps projects \n     and programs by increasing the amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated to construct or maintain them or by increasing \n     the federal share of project costs. Assuming appropriation of \n     the necessary funds, CBO estimates that implementing the bill \n     would cost $5.5 billion over the 2008-2012 period and an \n     additional $26 billion over the 10 years after 2012, \n     including at least $15 billion that would be authorized by \n     section 1003(0).\n       For newly authorized water projects specified in the bill, \n     the Corps provided CBO with estimates of the annual budget \n     authority needed to meet project design and construction \n     schedules. CBO adjusted those estimates to reflect the impact \n     of anticipated inflation during the time between project \n     authorization and the appropriation of construction costs. \n     Estimated outlays are based on historical spending rates for \n     Corps projects.\n       Significant New Authorizations. The legislation would \n     authorize the Corps to conduct water resource studies and \n     undertake specified projects and programs for flood control, \n     inland navigation, shoreline protection, and environmental \n     restoration. For example, the bill would authorize the \n     construction of enhanced navigation improvements for the \n     Upper Mississippi River at an estimated federal cost of $1.8 \n     billion and an ecosystem restoration project, also on the \n     Upper Mississippi River, at an estimated federal cost of $1.6 \n     billion. Another large project that would be authorized by \n     this bill is the Indian River Lagoon project in the Florida \n     Everglades at an estimated federal cost of $683 million. \n     Construction of those projects would likely take more than 15 \n     years.\n       Hurricane Damage. Several provisions in title I would \n     authorize coastal restoration projects and water control \n     infrastructure in Louisiana that are needed to correct \n     hurricane damage. For example, the Morganza to the Gulf of \n     Mexico Hurricane Protection Project would seek to reduce \n     hurricane and flood damages across 1,700 square miles of \n     coastal Louisiana at an estimated federal cost of $576 \n     million. Other projects would improve flood protection \n     infrastructure within New Orleans and its vicinity. The cost \n     of those provisions would approach $2 billion. CBO expects \n     that most of those projects would be built over the next five \n     to 10 years. Improvements resulting from the completion of \n     those projects could reduce the costs of damages from future \n     storms and the amount of federal funds needed for recovery \n     from such events.\n       Section 1003(o) of the bill would authorize the Secretary \n     to construct projects in southern Louisiana that would \n     provide protection\n\n[[Page S5885]]\n\n     for a storm surge equivalent to a category 5 hurricane (or a \n     500-year storm, which is a storm that has a l-in-500 chance \n     of hitting the city in any given year) if the Senate \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works and the House \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure each pass a \n     resolution approving those projects.\n       Very preliminary cost estimates from Corps officials \n     indicate that the cost of protecting New Orleans from a \n     hurricane storm surge that has a l-in-100 chance of flooding \n     the city in any given year could reach a total of $15 \n     billion. No preliminary cost estimates are available for the \n     resources that would be needed to protect southern Louisiana \n     from the storm surge that would result from a category 5 \n     hurricane. CBO estimates that at least $15 billion would be \n     needed to provide storm-surge protection under section \n     1003(o) from much more severe storms.\n       Federal Share of Project Costs. Most projects undertaken by \n     the Corps are required to have a specific portion of costs \n     covered by local interests, and the remaining costs are \n     considered the federal share of the total project cost. \n     Section 2001 would allow local interests that have provided \n     in-kind contributions for the construction of water resources \n     projects to have the value of such contributions credited \n     toward the local share of the total construction cost of such \n     projects. Under the bill, the Corps would be authorized to \n     credit in-kind contributions of local participants on \n     projects. Based on information from the Corps, CBO expects \n     that any credit toward in-kind contributions would not \n     significantly affect the federal share of total project \n     costs.\n       Deauthorizations. The bill would withdraw the authority for \n     the Corps to build more than 50 projects authorized in \n     previous legislation. Based on information from the Corps, \n     however, CBO does not expect that the agency would begin any \n     significant work under current law for most of those projects \n     during the next five years (or longer). Some of those \n     projects do not have a local sponsor to pay nonfederal costs, \n     others do not pass certain tests for economic viability, and \n     still others do not pass certain tests for environmental \n     protection. Consequently, CBO estimates that cancelling the \n     authority to build those projects would provide no \n     significant savings over the next several years.\n\n\n                            Direct Spending\n\n       CBO estimates that enacting the legislation would increase \n     net direct spending by $6 million in 2008, by $4 million over \n     the 2008-2012 period, and by $5 million total over the 2008-\n     2017 period. Components of this estimate are described below.\n       Various Land Conveyances. The bill would authorize the \n     conveyance at fair market value of 650 acres of federal land \n     at the Richard B. Russell Lake in South Carolina to the \n     state. The bill also would authorize the conveyance at fair \n     market value of 900 acres of federal land located in \n     Grayson County, Texas, to the town of Denison, Texas. \n     Based on information from the Corps, CBO estimates that \n     the federal government would receive about $3 million in \n     each of 2008 and 2009 from those sales.\n       The bill also would convey certain federal land in \n     Arkansas, Missouri, Georgia, Kansas, and Oregon. CBO \n     estimates that those conveyances would have no significant \n     impact on the federal budget.\n       Arcadia Lake, Oklahoma. Section 3078 would eliminate the \n     obligation of the city of Edmond, Oklahoma, to pay \n     outstanding interest due on its water storage contract with \n     the Corps. CBO estimates that this provision would result in \n     a loss of receipts of about $9 million in 2008. The city has \n     no further obligations to pay the federal government under \n     this storage contract after 2008.\n       Waurika Lake Project. Section 3082 would eliminate the \n     obligation of the Waurika Project Master Conservancy District \n     in Oklahoma to pay its outstanding debt related to the \n     construction of a water conveyance project. Because of an \n     accounting error, the Corps inadvertently undercharged the \n     district for costs associated with a land purchase related to \n     the water project in the early 1980s. Under terms of the \n     construction contract, the district is required to pay all \n     costs associated with building the project, including the \n     full cost of the land purchases. The section would eliminate \n     the requirement for the district to pay the difference \n     between the full cost of the property and the initial \n     (undercharged) amounts. CBO estimates that enacting this \n     section would cost less than $200,000 a year over the 2008-\n     2017 period.\n       Fees for Training and Processing Permits. Title II would \n     allow the Corps to accept and spend fees collected in \n     conjunction with its training courses. Title II also would \n     make permanent the Corps' current authority to accept and \n     spend funds contributed by private firms to expedite the \n     evaluation of permit applications submitted to the Corps. CBO \n     estimates that the Corps would collect and spend less than \n     $500,000 during each year under those provisions and that the \n     net budgetary impact would be negligible.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: The \n     legislation contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in UMRA. Grant funds authorized in the \n     bill would benefit state governments that participate in a \n     national program to improve levee safety. State, local, and \n     tribal governments also would benefit from water resource \n     projects and other programs authorized in the bill. \n     Governments that choose to participate in those programs and \n     projects would incur costs to comply with the conditions of \n     the federal assistance, including cost-sharing requirements, \n     but such costs would be incurred voluntarily. In addition, \n     some state and local governments participating in ongoing \n     water resources projects would benefit from provisions in the \n     bill that would alter existing cost-sharing obligations. Many \n     of those provisions would make it easier for non federal \n     participants to meet their obligations by giving them credit \n     for expenses they have already incurred or by expanding the \n     types of expenditures counted towards the nonfederal share.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On March 29, 2007, CBO transmitted a \n     cost estimate for H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development \n     Act of 2007, as ordered reported by the House Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure on March 15, 2007. Assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO estimated that \n     implementing H.R. 1495 would cost about $6.7 billion over the \n     2008-2012 period and an additional $6.5 billion over the 10 \n     years after 2012. In addition, CBO estimated that enacting \n     H.R. 1495 would decrease net direct spending by $6 million in \n     2008, $9 million over the 2008-2012 period, and $8 million \n     over the 2008-2017 period. The differences in the cost \n     estimates stem from different levels of authorized funding \n     and from differences in direct spending provisions. In \n     particular, the House bill does not contain the provision \n     regarding Arcadia Lake, Oklahoma.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Tyler Kruzich; Impact \n     on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Lisa Ramirez-Branum; \n     Impact on the Private Sector: Amy Petz.\n       Estimate approved by: Peter H. Fontaine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what we are very proud of, both Senator \nInhofe and I, is that the CBO comes in with a cost estimate that is \n$13.9 billion, which is about $2 billion less than the House-passed \nbill.\n  So for all of those reasons, we urge a ``yes'' vote on this motion to \nproceed on this bill.\n  I yield the remaining time to my friend and colleague Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the leader and the chairman of the \ncommittee. Let me make one comment which I think is very important. We \nhad such a short period of time to talk before this, and I hope anyone \nwho has any concern over this bill at least will go ahead on the motion \nto proceed.\n  Let me make one comment that surprises a lot of people. It is true I \nused to chair this committee before the Democrats took the majority, \nand now Senator Boxer is the chairman. Senator Boxer is a very proud \nliberal Democrat and I am a very proud conservative Republican. I think \nit is important for people to understand that, because there are areas \nwhere we agree. We understand we have a crisis in this country on \ninfrastructure.\n  I have often said--and I am ranked No. 1 as the most conservative \nMember of the Senate--I feel we need to spend in areas of national \ndefense and infrastructure, and this bill is the second most important \ninfrastructure bill that is out there. We are far beyond the time we \nshould have had this. It has been some 7 years since we have had an \ninfrastructure bill.\n  Let me say to my conservative friends, it was misreported that this \nis going to be a $30.5 billion bill. It is less than half of that. It \nis less than the House has sent over. I can tell my colleagues this: If \nwe don't pass this--this is not a spending bill; this is a \nreauthorization bill. This is not an appropriations bill. So if we \ndon't do this, then it will be done without any guidelines. We followed \nguidelines. Perhaps they are not quite as good as they were a year ago, \nbut still, they are guidelines in terms of what we will consider and \nwhat we won't. But if we don't pass this, then we will be doing it \nwithout any type of discipline at all. So I think it is very important \nthat we agree to move on to the bill.\n  I yield my last minute to the Senator from Georgia, who is the \nranking member of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member and I commend \nthe chairman on great work on this bill. I want to make one point. This \nis not a spending bill; this is an investment bill. It is an investment \nin safe drinking water. It is an investment in storm water management. \nIt is an investment in flood control and water resources of the United \nStates of America. It is fiscally responsible and it is accountable. We \nhave worked together in an absolutely bipartisan way to accomplish \nthat.\n\n[[Page S5886]]\n\n  I encourage each of our Members to come and vote for the motion to \nproceed. If they have an amendment, bring it early, and let's go \nforward with the most important bill we may do in this session of the \nCongress of the United States.\n  I want to add to that it is bipartisan, it is fiscally responsible, \nand it is the first time we have reauthorized it in 7 years. It is long \noverdue and important for us to do it now.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nspeak in morning business under the time that is allotted to me \npostcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Iraq Funding\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last week, the Congress sent the President \nan emergency supplemental spending bill for Iraq. That bill provided \nevery dollar our troops need and every dollar the President requested \nand then some.\n  It also provided what a majority of Americans expect and that is they \nexpect a plan to start to bring home American troops, to bring this war \nto a responsible end, and to not escalate it indefinitely as this \nPresident is doing.\n  In vetoing the bill, the President not only denied our troops the \nfunding they needed, but he denied the American people what they have \nclearly stated they want: a responsible path out of Iraq. That is what \nthe 2006 election was about. That is what every poll is about. That is \nwhat the Senator from West Virginia, whom I see on the floor, and I and \nothers have been saying for some time now. I might add, that is also \nwhat I think an awful lot of our Republican colleagues want.\n  I raised a few eyebrows when I said a month ago that I don't think \nthere are more than a dozen members of the opposition who truly believe \nthis policy of unrelenting escalation with no end in sight in Iraq is \none they support. The question is: What do we do in the face of the \nPresident's recalcitrance?\n  We all know, and again I refer to my friend from West Virginia, the \nmost learned person in the Senate--I don't go back as far as he does, \nbut I go back to trying to end the war in Vietnam. I remember how \npainfully long that process was. Once the whole Nation and the Senate \nhad turned against the war, it was still painfully difficult to end.\n  So if it were up to me, I would send the same emergency spending bill \nback to the President and have the votes, with the money for our troops \nand the plan that is in that legislation to end the war, which the \npeople expect. I would send it back to him again and again and again \nand again and let him veto it again and again and again and again. Any \nreasonable person listening to my speaking might ask: Why would you do \nthat, not a fool's errand? I believe the more we keep this front and \ncenter, the more we relentlessly push on this President to abandon his \nflawed policy, the more pressure will be brought upon our colleagues \nwho, in their hearts, know this is not the right policy but are voting \nwith the President instead of with the troops.\n  I must admit straight up, this is about building pressure. We are \ngoing to need 67 votes to end this war--67 votes in the Senate. So that \nmeans, although I had a great conversation with Tim Johnson last \nnight--I might say, he sounded wonderful--although that means until \nSenator Johnson comes back, we need 17 Republican Senators to change \ntheir minds. That is why we have to keep pushing. We have to let the \nPresident demonstrate time and again that he is totally out of touch \nwith what our troops need, what the American people want, and where \nAmerica's interests lie. In a sense, this reminds me a little bit of \nRichard Nixon. He seems divorced from reality. He seems divorced from \nwhat is going on around him. I don't quite understand it. I have been \nhere 34 years. It reminds me of Nixon during Watergate.\n  Here we had the Attorney General testify before our Judiciary \nCommittee with a terrible appearance, and the President says he did \nwonderfully. The President says the war is going well. The President \nsaid the response to Katrina initially was great. There seems to be a \ndisconnect here. So the only thing I know to do is to continually force \nhim to demonstrate again and again, until he changes his mind, how out \nof touch he is, to build pressure in the Congress.\n  The truth is, votes matter. We need the votes to stop this war \nbecause I am convinced this President has made a decision with his Vice \nPresident to keep this from completely blowing up and hand it off to \nthe next President. The problem is, in the meantime, a lot of people \nare going to lose their lives--a lot of Americans and a whole lot more \nIraqis. But I recognize, as I said, the reality that it takes 60 votes \nto send the same supplemental back to the President, as it would take \n60 votes to formally deauthorize the war, as my friend from West \nVirginia is attempting to do, as I and Carl Levin talked about, and we \nintroduced legislation similar to that, to deauthorize the war and \nreauthorize a more limited mission. We need, though, 60 votes. It is \njust as people talk about cutting off funding, we still need 60 votes. \nIt would take, obviously, 67 votes then to overcome a Presidential \nveto.\n  The reason I say this is we all are frustrated on this floor. Right \nnow, we don't have those votes. We don't have the votes right now to \nsend back the same supplemental.\n  What should we do next? In my view, first, anything we send back to \nthe President must and will provide every dollar the troops need. As \nlong as we are on the frontlines, I will vote for the money to protect \nthem. That money must include funding for additional Mine Resistant \nAmbush Protected Vehicles, so-called MRAPs.\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\n  The amendment I offered was overwhelmingly adopted. The vast majority \nof deaths and injuries are from roadside bombs. They are responsible \nfor 70 percent of our casualties in Iraq. These new V-shaped hull \nvehicles that will take the place of heavily armored humvees have a \nfour to five times greater prospect of protecting troops inside those \nvehicles. They can literally cut our casualty rates by two-thirds.\n  As a matter of fact, depending on what we do send back to the \nPresident, it is my intention, if somehow we make no progress, to take \nthis money out for those vehicles and move it separately because it \nliterally, literally, literally can change the lives of our soldiers in \nthe field. Our military wants them; our soldiers need them.\n  Defense Secretary Gates said MRAPs are ``the highest priority \nacquisition program. Any and all options to accelerate the production \nand fielding of this capability should be identified, assessed, and \napplied.'' I am happy to hear him say that because originally they \ndidn't ask for this money to fast-forward the funding of these \nvehicles. The Secretary is right. I think it would be unconscionable \nnot to get as many of these new vehicles as possible in the field as \nfast as possible.\n\n  Second, if we don't have the votes now for a hard timetable, which is \nwhat is in the bill that was vetoed, a hard timetable that came out of \nthe language Senator Levin and I worked on putting in the bill, if, in \nfact, we don't have the votes now for that hard timetable to start \ngetting our troops out of Iraq, any bill we send back to the President \nmust limit dramatically the mission of the troops in Iraq.\n  We must get our troops out of the middle of this sectarian civil war \nthat we cannot end militarily. Having 15,000, 20,000, 30,000 troops in \na city of 6,200,000 people knocking on doors in the middle of a civil \nwar is just foolhardy. Instead, we should focus our military on a much \nmore limited mission that is in the national interest, that we can \nachieve with fewer troops, and that is doable; that is, training the \nIraqi Army, preventing al-Qaida from occupying territory in parts of \nAnbar Province, and--and--force protection.\n  If we limit the mission in that way, the President will not be able \nto justify keeping 160,000 troops in Iraq, especially at a time when \nour military is dangerously overstretched, threatening the readiness of \nour troops and the ability to retain those now serving, to recruit \nthose who may wish to serve in the future, and--and--to provide a \nNational Guard at home that is needed for natural disasters at home, as \nwe have recently seen in Kansas.\n  Just this week, we have seen how overstretching is hurting us at \nhome. When a tornado wiped 80 square blocks of Greensburg, KS, off the \nmap, the State's National Guard was slow in responding. Why? Because \nmuch of its manpower and equipment is in Iraq.\n  Across the country, our Governors have been warning for months that \ntheir National Guards are not prepared for the next local disaster \nbecause they are tied down overseas; or, even if they are home, because \nthey took their equipment overseas when they were deployed and were \nunable to bring it back, they are ill prepared in terms of manpower \nand/or equipment. So if we limit the mission of our troops in Iraq to a \nmore rational mission, the President will have to start bringing troops \nhome now, with or without a hard timetable.\n  He will have to start listening to our Governors. He will have to \nstart listening to our troops and their families who have told so many \nof us about the strain of going back to Iraq on third and fourth tours, \nabout being ordered to stay longer each time they go, about not having \nthe year at home between deployments that they were promised. He will \nhave to start listening because he won't have an excuse not to.\n  Third, if we can't get a hard timeline into this emergency spending \nbill, we should add it to the next bill we vote on, and to the one \nafter that, and to the one after that. We have to be relentless. Sooner \nor later, our colleagues will stop voting with the President and start \nbacking what the American people want: a responsible end to this war.\n  Until we have the votes to force the President to change course, we \nhave to keep the pressure on for change every single day. That is what \nI have been doing, and that is what I will continue to do until this \npolicy levee that the President has erected breaks.\n  The fact is, the fundamental strategy under which the President has \noperated is flawed. The idea that through force we are going to be able \nto establish a strong central democratic government in Baghdad is \nsimply not possible. It is simply not possible. It is not going to \nhappen in the lifetime of any Member of this Senate.\n  Starting to get our troops out of Iraq, and getting most of them out \nby early next year, is the first step toward bringing this war to a \nresponsible end. Just as important, we have to have a plan for what we \nleave behind so we do not trade a dictator for chaos in Iraq and the \nregion that undermines our interests for decades.\n  I don't want my son going to Iraq, but I also don't want my grandson \ngoing to that part of the world in the next 15 years. How we leave and \nwhat we leave behind will impact on that second question. We have to \nhave a plan to bring stability to Iraq as we leave, and that requires a \npolitical solution. Everyone--everyone--from the President on, says \nthere is no military solution to Iraq; there is a political solution \nonly. But he hasn't offered a political solution.\n  I know my colleagues have heard me talk about my plan for a political \nsettlement in Iraq for more than a year now. It calls for separating \nthe warring factions, giving them breathing room in their own regions, \nas their constitution provides, with control over the fabric of their \ndaily lives--such as police protection, education, marriage, jobs, \nreligion--and a limited central government that would be responsible \nfor distributing oil revenues, which should be the glue that holds this \ncountry together, responsible for the army and responsible for the \nborders.\n\n  Every passing day makes my plan, the Biden-Gelb plan, more urgent and \nmore relevant. Look at what is happening in Ramadi, where al-Qaida has \na stronghold. The administration rightly points to some successes in \ngetting Sunni tribal leaders to turn on al-Qaida in Iraq and getting \nthousands of young Sunni men to sign up for the Ramadi police force and \nprotection forces. Listen carefully to how this happened, as described \nby the Los Angeles Times:\n\n       Fed up with the insurgents' killings and their acts of \n     intimidation in Ramadi, the Sunni sheiks came to the \n     coalition in September to tell the U.S.-led force that they \n     were ready to cooperate and would urge their tribes to supply \n     recruits for the Iraqi army and police. Even the most \n     optimistic U.S. colonel was not prepared for the flood of \n     recruits once the sheiks got the word out that joining the \n     Army, police, and provincial forces had their approval. \n     Recently, 1,500 Iraqi youths showed up to enlist in the \n     police, more than the recruiters could take.\n\n  Continuing to quote.\n\n       Another change that helped recruiting was a policy \n     introduced in February promising recruits from Al Anbar that \n     they would be based close to home if they enlisted. Within 2 \n     days of that switch, 400 youths had signed up.\n\n  So you have Sunnis joining the police and army in their own regions, \nstaying in their regions to deal with Sunni extremists in the midst of \ntheir own region, and becoming part of the anti-al-Qaida solution.\n  What is that all about? It is what I have been saying for a long \ntime: give them local control and they will have the prospect of \nbringing this country to a peaceful settlement. That is a whole lot \nbetter than having them take the fight to the Shiites and becoming part \nof the sectarian nightmare.\n  It makes sense for our troops to be in Anbar, helping local Sunnis \ndefeat al-Qaida. That is what we should limit their mission to. It does \nnot make sense for them to be going door to door in Baghdad, a city of \n6.2 million people, and getting caught in the crossfire of a self-\nsustaining civil war. It makes sense for us to focus on a political \nsettlement by bringing problems and responsibilities down to the local \nlevel, giving each group an opportunity to advance its interests \npeacefully, not with bombs and death squads but with a political \ncompromise.\n  It does not make sense to send more and more troops into Iraq in \npursuit of a strategy that has virtually no prospect for success. The \nadministration hopes the surge will buy time for Prime Minister \nMaliki's government to\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\nget its act together. But there is no trust within that government, no \ntrust of the government by the people it purports to serve, and no \ncapacity on the part of the government to deliver the services or \nsecurity that is needed. There is little prospect that the government \nwill build that trust and capacity any time soon.\n  In short, the most basic premise of the President's approach, and \nthat of some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, is that the \nIraqi people will rally behind a strong central government that looks \nout for their interests equally and is fundamentally fair. That whole \nnotion, I have been saying for over 4 years, is fundamentally flawed. \nIt is not achievable. So instead of escalating this war with no end in \nsight, we have to start bringing our troops home with the goal of \ngetting most of them out by early next year.\n  As the President rails against those of us who have been proposing \nthat, I remind him his former Secretary of State Baker, his father's \nformer Secretary of State Eagleburger, were part of a commission that \nsaid we should get our troops out by March of 2008. The British, in \nBasra, did essentially what I am suggesting. They redeployed their \ntroops out of the cities, did not engage in the civil war, and began to \ndraw them down. Are they abandoning?\n  Instead of escalating this war, we have to start to bring our troops \nhome, and we have to help Iraq make the transition to the decentralized \nfederal system that is called for in their constitution. Making \nfederalism work for all Iraqis is a strategy that can still succeed and \nallow our troops to leave without leaving chaos behind.\n  This war must end, but it is still within our power to end it \nresponsibly. That is a mission that can unite Americans and protect our \ninterests, and that is a mission that is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am going to again invite Members to come \nto the floor. The order is H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development \nAct. We have had a chance now to act on a motion to proceed. We are on \nthat right now. I know there are several Members who have said they \nwant to come to the floor with statements and amendments. I join \nSenator Boxer, the chairman of our committee, in encouraging people to \nbring their amendments down and give us a chance to look at them.\n  I have to say, I was a little disappointed that we did not have a \nunanimous vote on the motion to proceed. Let me again say this, and I \nsay this to my conservative friends, the Water Resources Development \nAct that is under consideration now is very similar to the one we acted \non a year ago. In fact, it started out to be the same thing. I wanted \nto use the same criteria on the current bill that we used last year. \nHowever, on environmental infrastructure projects, there are a lot of \npeople who wanted some of those to be considered. Frankly, I would have \npreferred not to. But nonetheless, that is now part of the criteria. \nThere is a limited number of those projects.\n  We have criteria that go along the line of making sure there is local \nsupport. We do not have any waivers for local support of these efforts, \nso the participation has to be there from the local governments to \ndemonstrate clearly these are important projects to be considered.\n  Speaking as a conservative, let me emphasize there are certain things \nconservatives believe Government should be doing. The top two in my \ncategory are armed services--we have to defend America; that is our \nfunction; that is what we are supposed to be doing--and second is \ninfrastructure. Way back in the Eisenhower administration, we started a \nsystem of national highways. It has been very successful. But we have a \nproblem in the way we have been funding them with user fees, with a \nFederal gasoline excise tax. It has worked fairly well. However, we are \nto the point now where the last bill we passed 2 years ago, the \nTransportation reauthorization bill, was one where, even though it was \na very large bill in terms of spending that amount of money, it did \nnothing more than maintain what we currently have. That is not \nadequate.\n  You might say that has nothing to do with the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. It does. Right now, looking into the future, I see \nnothing but serious problems. We know 10 years from now the traffic on \nour highway system throughout America is going to double and probably \ntriple in 20 years. If something is not done to increase the road \ncapacity, it is going to be chaotic. The two things that have the most \nfavorable effect on surface transportation are our rail and waterway \nsystem. That is what this is all about, our waterway system.\n  We are going to be talking in a lot more detail about this, but I \nwant to say, particularly to those out there who believe there may be \nprojects they don't like: These projects meet a criteria. If we were \nnot to pass the Water Resources Development Act, if we were to say we \nare not going to pass it--maybe people are fabricating some reason, \nthey don't like one or two projects that are in there--No. 1, as it is \nnow, those projects have met the criteria, and, No. 2, if we do not \npass this bill, we will have no spending discipline on these projects. \nThey will simply go and get appropriations, and they can be things that \nhave nothing to do with meeting important criteria.\n  Look at this as a criterion bill to reduce spending, runaway \nspending; to reduce money being spent on things that do not meet the \ncriteria in terms of the Corps of Engineers' reports to make sure they \nmeet environmental and other requirements.\n  It may surprise a lot of people to know that in my State of Oklahoma, \nwe actually have a navigational waterway. A lot of people are not aware \nof that. In fact, it was the best kept secret for many years. But we \ncarry grain and oil products and petroleum products back and forth all \nthe way from my city of Tulsa, OK, it is called the Port of Catoosa, \ndown through the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers and distributed \nthroughout the water system. It is something absolutely necessary. If \nwe did not have that, if we were not able to pass legislation to expand \nthat capacity, then that traffic is going to fall on our highways.\n  I can assure you right now the same committee considering the water \nbill now is going to be considering the highway reauthorization, \nprobably in a couple of years. It is going to make it that much more \ntraumatic if we do not get this done.\n  I will give an example. In the State of Oklahoma, 98 percent of the \nway we have a 12-foot channel. However, if it is only 2 percent that is \na 9-foot channel, that restricts the entire channel. I think we all \nunderstand that.\n  While that is not in this bill--I don't have anything self-serving \nabout this comment because that has already been authorized, that has \nbeen authorized for years--it is that type of thing that, if we are to \nshut down for any reason or dramatically restrict our waterways, all \nthat is going to fall on our highways. It is a serious problem.\n  I reemphasize to those who are my conservative friends--we have \nrankings around here. One of the unique things about the Senate and \nHouse of Representatives is that if people want to know how their \nMembers are voting, if you are concerned about overtaxation, you have a \nnumber of organizations--the National Taxpayers Union, the National Tax \nLimitation Committee, and others--that rank us as to how we vote on tax \nincreases. If you are concerned about overregulation of small \nbusiness--I spent 35 years in small business so I know a little bit \nabout overregulation--if you are concerned about that, the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses ranks all Members, Democrats and \nRepublicans, House and Senate, as to how they vote on regulatory issues \nthat might inhibit the expansion of small businesses.\n  The same thing is true with how people vote on defending America. The \nCenter for Security Policy ranks all Democrats and Republicans, House \nand Senate, on how they vote on defense issues, which is a real \ncritical thing that we are dealing with right now.\n  The same is true in terms of people who are conservatives. The \nAmerican Conservative Union ranks all Members of the House and Senate. \nI have to say to my conservative friends, I am, as of\n\n[[Page S5899]]\n\n2 weeks ago, again, considered and ranked as the No. 1 most \nconservative Member of the Senate. I am proud of that. So I don't want \nanyone to run around saying we are passing a bill that is somehow going \nout and doing projects that should not be done.\n\n  Sure, there are some projects in here that I don't like as well as \nothers. I might not have had the same criteria as someone on the other \nside of the aisle might. But I have to say this, with the chairman of \nour committee, Senator Boxer, she and I have worked for a long time on \nthis. She, as I said before, is a proud liberal Democrat. I am a proud \nconservative Republican. We agree on these things. We know Government \nhas the function of making sure we do certain things. Certainly, the \ngreatest Nation in the world has to have an infrastructure system that \nwill accommodate transportation.\n  This is a very important part of that. When we deploy units for \ntraining out of Oklahoma, we send the heavy equipment via channels.\n  I have not told this story in a long time, but since I see Senator \nBoxer, I will tell it. Many years ago when I was in the State Senate, \nit occurred to me that our navigation way that makes us navigable in \nthe State of Oklahoma was something nobody knew about. They said: We \nknow about the Intercoastal Waterway, we know about the Arkansas River, \nwe know about the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes, but they \ndidn't know anything about the State of Oklahoma and the fact you can \nget all the way up there with barge traffic into my hometown of Tulsa, \nOK.\n  A guy came to me with an idea. This is years ago. He was from \nKellyville, OK. His name was Kelly. That must tell you something. He \nwas the head of the World War II submarine veterans.\n  He came to me and said: If you want to get the message across that we \nare navigable in Oklahoma, I can raise money to get a World War II \nsurplus submarine from Orange, TX. With volunteers we can, together, if \nyou will do the legislation in the State of Oklahoma and come help us \non this, we can bring that submarine all the way from Orange, TX, up \ntheir waterway, up the Mississippi, over the Arkansas, to the Port of \nCatoosa--actually, the Port of Muskogee is where it ended up--and we \ncan let the whole world know we have this navigation way. We did.\n  All my political adversaries were against it. They said, in the State \nSenate, we are going to sink Inhofe with the submarine. It didn't work. \nThe submarine is there now. It is proudly displayed in Muskogee, OK, \nletting all the world know we are able to barge material in and out of \nthe State of Oklahoma.\n  I have to say it is the Nation's most inland port. I invite you to \ncome out and take a trip, I say to my friend Senator Boxer.\n  The bottom line is this. We have to get the heavy stuff moved around. \nIf it is not going to be on rail, if it is not going to be on the \nchannel system, the waterway system we are talking about today, then it \nwill have to be on the other surface transportation or highway system \nthat is going to be so congested.\n  That is what this is all about. I renew our request for Members who \nhave amendments they want to bring to the floor, bring them now. We \nhave lots of time. We have all day to be looking at these. We want to \nconsider them. We want to give them our best consideration.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say thank you to Senator Inhofe. People \nsee us tangling on a host of issues. I think it gives them a good \nfeeling to know there are times when we see eye to eye. I would say, \nwhen those times occur, it should mean we can get our legislation \nthrough pretty quickly because we have worked hard to accommodate the \nviews of both sides of the aisle.\n  I am pleased the Senate voted overwhelmingly to start the process of \nconsidering the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. I hope, in \nshort order, we will find out we can actually move to the bill. We are \ntechnically on a motion to proceed to the bill, which is slowing us up \na bit, but we think there are other issues causing that. We hope they \nwill be resolved.\n  This important legislation authorizes projects and policies of the \nCivic Works Program of the Army Corps of Engineers and, as I said, it \nhas tremendous support both from my ranking member, Senator Inhofe, the \nentire Environment and Public Works Committee--which runs the gamut of \nphilosophies and geographies and all the rest.\n  Colleagues asked to see the substitute bill we worked so hard on, \nthat has a very good score from the Congressional Budget Office--less \nthan the House-passed bill; fiscally responsible. A good chunk of it is \naimed at Hurricane Katrina--which both Senator Inhofe and I feel very \ngood about. We believe certainly Louisiana is in desperate need of \nhelp, and we have answered their call in a very strong way. I would say \nabout 25 percent of the bill is actually dedicated to making sure \nLouisiana is made whole and is protected in the future.\n  We hope our colleagues from Louisiana will feel good about this. If \nthere are other things they want to offer, we ask them to come down and \nshow us what they are. Senator Inhofe, Senator Isakson, Senator Baucus, \nand I have an agreement that unless the four of us agree on these \namendments, we are going to oppose them. That is hard for us to do. We \ndon't like to give up our freedom. But on this we are going to do it. \nWhy? This bill is 7 years overdue--7 long years. There is enough blame \nto go around as to why it happened. We don't need to get into it. It is \nnot important. Right now we have an opportunity to make up for lost \ntime and get to where we are back on a track that makes sense. This is \na great economy in this country. We need an infrastructure that matches \nour ambitions and our future dreams for a thriving business community, \na place where workers can get good jobs. So we need this bill.\n  What we are saying to colleagues is, first of all, some of you want \nto see the bill. Of course. The bill is available to you.\n  The bill is available in both cloakrooms. The bill will be printed in \nthe Record tonight. You have all been part of it. I think you all will \nbe pleased with it. There is a CBO score that has been placed in the \nRecord for you to see. There is huge support out here in America for \nthis bill. We have letters coming in from disparate groups in this \ncountry which include farmers, which include workers' unions, \ncontractors, all kinds of businesses. This is a very powerful message \nto the Senate to move forward. The House has passed the bill. Let's get \nto conference. Let's get a bill to the President's desk.\n  Again, I say thank you to Senator Inhofe. I will say this a lot. But \nit has been a pleasure to work with him and his staff. My staff feels \nthe same way. We have made great progress. This bill is a project of \ncommitment, of bipartisan and partnership.\n  I mentioned Senators Baucus and Isakson. They have been very \nimportant in terms of working with us on this package. Many members of \nthe committee went to Louisiana to see the problem there. Senators \nLandrieu and Vitter were determined to show us their needs, and they \ndid. Again, a lot of the work in this bill is directed toward \nLouisiana.\n  I do want to thank members of the staff. Sometimes chairmen wait \nuntil the bill is finished to do that. But I want to do it now: My \nstaff director, Bettina Poirier, and my deputy staff director, Ken \nKopocis; Jeff Rosato and Tyler Rushforth for all their work. On Senator \nInhofe's staff, I wanted to thank Andrew Wheeler, Ruth Van Mark, Angie \nGiancarlo, and Letmon Lee. Additionally, I thank Jo-Ellen Darcy and \nPaul Wilkins with Senator Baucus and Mike Quiello with Senator Isakson.\n  We have had many late-hour, emergency, stressful phone calls getting \nto this stage. We hope those phone calls will not have been in vain and \nthat we have come up with a product everyone will be proud of.\n  In so many ways this is the start of a new day because I believe we \nare now on track to restore the regular process of meeting the Nation's \nwater resources needs as they arise. But we will not get done with this \nbill if colleagues do not come to the floor and let us see their \namendments.\n  I echo what Senator Inhofe said. Let's not play hide and seek with\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\namendments. Let's get those amendments out. I have already been very \nopen. I have told everybody there is an agreement with the big four on \nthe committee; that we need to agree to them, to support them. It may \nwell be there is an amendment on Senator Inhofe's side that he wouldn't \nvote for because one of us said it is not acceptable. The same thing \ncould well happen on our side. That does not diminish anyone's right to \noffer these amendments. They have the right to do it. We support their \nright to do it because if they come soon, maybe we can work on these \namendments together and get them included in the managers' package. So \nthat would be the best of all worlds.\n  I thank Senator Feingold because he and I had a chat. He is going to \noffer an amendment I do not agree with on prioritization of Corps \nprojects. But he is going to come over here at noon. He is going to \ntake his time then, and then he is not going to talk about this anymore \nuntil we have a vote. And he will do it in 2 minutes on Tuesday so that \nwe can get the debate on these amendments over with now.\n  So I ask other Senators with amendments, within the sound of our \nvoices: Please come over with your amendments. We have all day, all day \nhere with an open microphone for you. You can take as much time as you \nwant. You can put your amendment out there. You can talk about it, and \nthen Senator Inhofe and I can look it over, share it with Senators \nIsakson and Baucus.\n  We want to accommodate everybody. We really do. If you meet the \ncriteria we have set out--I think the criteria is well thought out. We \nwant to make sure every project in this bill can be defended. That is \nimportant because we have precious few dollars to waste. So we want you \nto come over with your amendments. We are going to try to help \neveryone. We have already done so much to help you. We want to do more. \nWe both agree, Senator Inhofe and I, that WRDA is an important bill, \nand it is overdue 7 years--too long to wait for a bill that authorizes \nessential flood control, navigation, ecosystem restoration; 7 years of \nprojects being ready to go and unable to begin because, for whatever \nreason.\n  Again, we did not--we could not get the political will, or we could \nnot just push it over the finish line, as I like to say. So we had 7 \nyears of communities in your State and mine and Oklahoma and other \nplaces, people waiting to shore up their infrastructure needs, many of \nthem vital to protecting homes and families from catastrophic flooding.\n  Believe me, I can tell you, in my State flood control is one of the \nmajor priorities of Senator Feinstein and I, as well as Governor \nSchwarzenegger. It is quite bipartisan in the State legislature as \nwell.\n  So, yes, there are a lot of projects in the bill. It is the cost of \nwaiting so long to act. So I think it is remarkable that given all the \ntime that has gone on, we were able to put together a bill that is \nfiscally responsible. The bill before the Senate is less expensive than \nthe bill passed by the House. The original bill had some ambiguous \nlanguage that drove up the score. But I believe Senator Inhofe and I \nand others, we have corrected this problem. It was not easy. It took \ndiscipline, but we worked cooperatively in a bipartisan way.\n\n  We have a bill that meets our communities' and our Nation's acute and \nunmet water infrastructure needs. It does it in a fiscally responsible \nway. Let me tell you what the bill does. Title I would authorize 47 \nprojects consistent with completed chief of engineers reports. Now, \nthat is very important because these reports lay out what we have to \ndo, what the cost will be.\n  Those chief of engineers reports deal with flood control, navigation, \nand ecosystem restoration projects. These chief reports are the result \nof years of engineering science, economic analysis, environmental \nassessment, hours of Corps of Engineers work and expertise going into \npreparing these documents, concluding with the final review of the \nchief.\n  Title I would also authorize new locks on the upper Mississippi \nRiver, Illinois waterway system, and the concurrent ecosystem \nrestoration plan for those waters. This project is important to \nwaterway goods movement, particularly grains from the heartland of \nAmerica. That is why the farmers support this bill. We have an amazing \ncoalition of people supporting this bill.\n  If you cannot move goods, grain, from the heartland, we are in a lot \nof trouble. We will be in a lot of trouble if this bill does not get \ndone. Senator Inhofe and I are committed to getting this done. We have \nour differences in this Chamber, and by the way, that is the way it \nshould be. There are differences in this Chamber, but when it comes to \nthis bill, it seems to me we have to set them aside. Those differences \nshould be set aside.\n  Title I also includes authorization for the Louisiana Coastal Area \nEcosystem Restoration Program, to revert wetland loss and provide \nhurricane and storm damage reduction benefits.\n  I will discuss this issue in depth at a later time. But we know the \nloss of wetlands is a major cause of flooding. Not even to get into the \nfact that our species need these wetlands, put that aside; the wetlands \nare flood control, natural flood control. We have lost so many wetlands \nthat the Corps came to us and told us they believe it is a major cause \nof trouble now. We did not realize what we had until they were gone. So \nnow we are restoring wetlands.\n  Finally, title I includes small projects for flood damage reduction, \nnavigation, aquatic ecosystem restoration, under the continuing \nauthority programs of the Corps.\n  Title II will make changes in Corps of Engineers authorities in how \nit carries out its programs. Title II contains the administrative \nprovisions that are commonly referred to as Corps reform. These \nimportant provisions include updating the Corps' planning process, the \nwater resources planning coordinating committee, independent peer \nreview, and improvements to the Corps' mitigation program.\n  Now, a lot of this language was new to the last bill. I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Inhofe. When he was in charge of the committee, he \ntook the lead on this section, and we kept that section intact. We made \nprogress with Corps reform. These provisions will help ensure the Corps \ndoes its job more effectively and soundly, require in many cases an \nextra pair of eyes on its projects.\n  Senator Inhofe worked with Senator Feingold and me and others. The \nlanguage stands. We should be proud. Yes, there is Corps reform in this \nbill.\n  Now, I wanted to make it clear that Senator Feingold wants to do \nmore. One of his ideas is prioritization. Frankly, I think it is off \nthe mark, and we are going to have a debate about it to see where the \nchips fall on that particular amendment. But I thank him for his \ncooperation. He is going to come down in a little while. He is going to \ntake his time. He is going to debate this bill. Senator Inhofe and I, I \nam sure, will have a response, and then we will be able to have a very \nshort continuation of the debate just a couple of minutes per side, \nhopefully, on Monday or Tuesday, and we will finish this bill.\n  Title II also contains the authorization for the National Levee \nSafety Program, a new program that helps identify failing levees and \nprovides Corps resources and expertise to help improve and repair those \nlevees.\n  Title III includes provisions that would affect existing, ongoing, or \ncompleted projects. These sections include making modifications to \nproject cost ceilings, modifying project purposes, changing project \nboundaries, extending authorizations for annual programs, and \ncorrecting original deficiencies. Why is this important? Because so \nmuch time has passed that these projects need another look. Sometimes \nthere is new technologies that can come in and meet the needs. \nSometimes there is new cost estimates that need to be reflected. So \nTitle III affects existing, ongoing, or completed projects.\n  I have just about 3 more minutes or 4 more minutes, then I will have \nto yield to whoever would like to speak at that time.\n  Title IV includes authorizations for new project studies. It also \nmakes modifications to ongoing studies. Title V includes modifications \nto the Estuary Restoration Act, an existing restoration program of the \nCorps. It includes programmatic authorities for regional approaches to \nwater resources problems.\n  Title VI would deauthorize all or portions of 52 previously \nauthorized Corps\n\n[[Page S5901]]\n\nprojects. The deauthorization represents projects or portions of \nprojects that are no longer supported by local interests. This does \nhappen. Sometimes you have a plan, and after years and years people \nsay: There is a better way to do it, or we don't need it. That is \nreflected here.\n  So that is a brief overview of the bill. But it only begins to \nexpress the bill's importance to our communities, our families, our \nNation, our farmers, our workers, our businesses. The bill is about \nauthorizing projects our communities need to help protect thousands of \nhomes and millions of lives from catastrophic floods. The bill is about \nauthorizing projects our communities need to help restore the great \nwetlands, estuaries, and rivers of our Nation. These are places in \nwhich wildlife thrives and our families can enjoy for generations to \ncome.\n  Indeed, as hunting, fishing, boating, camping, and our outdoor \nindustries boom, this bill is an important part of keeping America's \nrecreation economy thriving.\n  The bill makes other very important contributions to our Nation's \neconomy. It authorizes projects our communities need to help increase \nour port and waterway capacity and makes shipping easier, safer, more \nefficient.\n  It literally keeps America's economy moving. We are in a global \neconomy. Ships come into port, and they go out of port. They move goods \nin, they move goods out. Workers are at the ports, businesses are at \nthe ports.\n  I will tell you, when we get to our next highway bill, we have to do \na lot more for our ports in terms of cleaner air and goods movement. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Inhofe perhaps as early as next \nyear, and the other colleagues who chair and rank on that subcommittee, \nto begin looking at that next bill that is so important to our goods \nmovement.\n  But this is part of it. We need to pass this bill to keep America's \neconomy moving because so much of our economy is dependent on our water \nresources. In just the next 2 minutes, I am going to give you a couple \nof examples of what I am talking about.\n  America's ports and harbors are our gateway to the world. Our \nmanufacturers' goods, automobiles, computer chips, agriculture goods \nsuch as grains, wines, and fruit pass through our ports and harbors \naround the world. Goods worth $5.5 billion pass through our ports every \nday and more than 2.5 billion tons of trade move through our ports and \nwaterways. That volume is expected to double over the next 15 years. In \nthe next 15 years, goods movement is going to double in our country. So \nwe have to get down passing this bill, because thousands of jobs are on \nthe line. Many businesses are expecting us to take action, and our \nfarmers want action. Five million jobs are at America's ports. WRDA is \nessential.\n  Outdoor recreation, I talked about that. The Corps of Engineers \noperates more than 2,500 recreation areas at 463 projects, and leases \nan additional 1,800 sites to States or locals. The Corps hosts 360 \nmillion visits a year at its lakes, beaches, and other areas. It is \nestimated that 1 in 10 Americans visits Corps projects once a year, 25 \nmillion people. We need to pass this bill. That generates 600,000 jobs \nto support visitors.\n  Public health and safety, economic growth, environmental protection \nare the goals of this bill.\n  This is the first bill--I think Senator Inhofe and I are very proud \nof this--that takes into effect ethics reform, even though the bill has \nnot been signed into law. We have asked colleagues to submit letters \nanswering the question: Do you have a conflict of interest in any of \nyour projects? Those letters are open for the public to see. They are \nat the committee offices. We have printed in large print the results of \nthose letters and each of the projects Members have asked for.\n  We are proud of that.\n  One of the lessons of Hurricane Katrina is we ignore water \ninfrastructure at our own peril. We are going to be moving new WRDA \nbills right after this one. We are going to be looking at our levees. \nWe are not resting after this bill passes.\n  I look forward to moving along on this bill. I know at this point we \nhave a bit of a slowdown on the bill by my Republican colleagues. I \nunderstand their issues have nothing to do with the legislation. I \nrespect that. It is a tool being used. But I urge both sides, let's put \naside our differences on whatever they are. Whether it is judges, \nwhether it is Iraq, God knows we have differences; they are tough. I \nrespect those differences. Senator Inhofe does as well. But we need to \nmove this legislation. This bill can't wait much longer.\n  Again, we are going to work in a cooperative way. We urge Members \nfrom both sides to get their amendments to the floor. Even though we \ncan't at this point put those amendments in the Record, we can debate \nthem today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks made by the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Boxer. I do agree. It is very \nunusual that we agree so much on one bill, and we do on this one. It is \nimportant that everyone understands, this bill is actually less than \nthe House bill is. This bill is less than the bill when I was chairman \nof the committee a year ago. But the most important part is, it offers \ndiscipline. When you say you need a chief's report, you are saying a \nproject has to be economically justified, environmentally sound, and \ntechnically feasible. Without this bill, there is no discipline. That \nis what I keep saying to my conservative friends.\n  One of the Members who has been very helpful was the chairman of the \nsubcommittee--and I was ranking member--out of which this bill emerged, \nthe Senator from Georgia, Mr. Isakson. So we can lock in the next two \nspeakers, if there is no objection, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Isakson be recognized for up to 8 minutes, followed by Senator \nGrassley from Iowa for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I also ask unanimous consent for Senator Feingold to be \nrecognized at noon today for up to 1 hour. Then at 1 o'clock, we will \nhave an opportunity to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I reiterate my commitment to the chairman \nand ranking member, and to Senator Baucus, that we will remain united \nto support this bill to the end. We will be united on amendments \nwhether we are for them or against them. This is in the best interest \nof the United States.\n  I thank Ruth Van Mark, Angie Ciancarlo, Letmon Lee, Jeff Rosato, Ken \nKopocis, Tyler Rushforth and Jo-Ellen Darcy for their work on this \nbill. I particularly thank my staff member Mike Quiello.\n  The bill before us is an investment in infrastructure. It is not a \nspending bill. It ensures safe drinking water, clean drinking water, \nstorm water management, and navigable waterways will be a reality. They \nwill be workable and they will be improved. To use my State as an \nexample, I cite three things included in this bill that are important \nto the infrastructure of the Southeast.\n  First, I wish to take a minute to talk about the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1986. This committee has considered that legislation \nto authorize four projects on a biennial basis. Unfortunately, we have \ngone 7 years without a reauthorization. Now is without question the \ntime to make that reauthorization. I am proud of the work the committee \nhas done.\n  Specifically, for the State of Georgia, there are a number of \nimportant provisions included in this legislation: a fund for the \nconstruction of conveyance systems to connect both existing and planned \nwastewater infrastructure and facilities for the Metro North Georgia \nWater Planning District. What is so important about this is, it \nrepresents what Congress and the Corps have said is the future of \nquality, good management water. That is a regional approach. Water does \nnot recognize political jurisdictions. It does not recognize \npoliticians. It flows downstream and downhill and intersects regions as \nit goes. It is important to fund projects such as this to deal with \nwater on a regional and comprehensive basis.\n  Also included in this legislation is the Big Creek watershed in North \nFulton County. The Mayor of Roswell, the city of Roswell, the County of \nFulton, have worked critically on this watershed management and have \nincreased\n\n[[Page S5902]]\n\nthe flow of water into the Chattahoochee and improved its quality and \nused new high technology for flood and water control management. It is \nessential we invest in that type of infrastructure in the future for \ngood quality water, good quality runoff, and good quality storm \nmanagement.\n  I also wish to take a moment to talk about an historic event that \ntook place in my State at 2 p.m. on 12 March 2007. Governor Sonny \nPurdue of Georgia and Governor Mark Sandord of South Carolina met on \nthe banks of Jasper County in South Carolina and announced a bistate \nproposal to build a joint port operation in Jasper County. It is \nhistoric because for the better part of two decades, Georgia and South \nCarolina have fought over the use of that land. It has been used as an \nenvironmental dump, if you will. The two States operate the Port of \nCharleston, the Port of Savannah, and the Port of Brunswick. All are \nreaching capacity. The two States wanted to go together, build a port, \nand operate that port jointly to ensure the future of commerce to the \nSoutheast and, in fact, the rest of the Nation, so much so that the two \nStates are putting up the money to pay for the feasibility study. The \nWRDA bill only authorizes the study to be made. It does not cost the \ntaxpayers of America a dime. The taxpayers of Georgia and South \nCarolina are paying for it.\n  During the debate, there is going to be an amendment offered to \nclarify language in section 4028 of the bill which will more accurately \nreflect that agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of this \nhistoric transcript as well as a copy of the transcript of Assistant \nSecretary of the Army for Civil Works John Paul Woodley talking about \nthis agreement and acknowledging it in the EPW Committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Term Sheet\n\n       Whereas, Governor Sanford and Governor Perdue, as the chief \n     executive officers of their respective states, recognize that \n     the capacity at the existing ports in Charleston and Savannah \n     is finite and that their states' businesses and industries \n     have a need for increased access to marine terminal \n     facilities to import and export goods associated with their \n     activities for the benefit of each of the states, the United \n     States and for international commerce generally; and\n       Whereas, Governor Sanford and Governor Perdue believe that \n     the most practical means of increasing each state's capacity \n     for marine-related transportation facilities is to: (a) build \n     a new maritime terminal on the Savannah River in Jasper \n     County, South Carolina, and (b) improve access to both the \n     new terminal in Jasper County and the existing and potential \n     new or expanded terminals in Garden City and Savannah, \n     Georgia; and\n       Whereas, in order to expedite and facilitate the building \n     of the new terminal in Jasper County and to improve access to \n     this new terminal and the existing and potential new or \n     expanded terminals in Garden City and Savannah, Governor \n     Sanford and Governor Perdue are desirous of setting forth \n     herein their mutual intent to cooperate and coordinate in all \n     appropriate respects and to promote and advocate in good \n     faith the taking and occurrence of any and all actions \n     necessary to those ends, including, without limitation, those \n     set forth herein;\n       Whereas, Governor Sanford and Governor Perdue recognize the \n     importance of the environmental resources in the Savannah \n     River and the surrounding areas, and the need for wise use \n     and long-term sustainability of these resources through \n     planning and cooperation on resource management in a regional \n     and cooperative manner, and are proposing the actions herein \n     in a manner that balances the need for economic development \n     and protection of sustainable natural resources to the \n     maximum extent feasible;\n       Now, therefore, to promote and advocate the taking of \n     actions necessary to build a new maritime terminal on the \n     Savannah River in Jasper County and to improve access to both \n     this new terminal and the existing and potential new or \n     expanded terminals in Garden City and Savannah, and to \n     establish a framework from which their respective state \n     legislatures can draft and adopt a formal compact to \n     accomplish those objectives, Governor Sanford and Governor \n     Perdue set forth this Term Sheet.\n\n\n                  THE JASPER COUNTY MARITIME TERMINAL\n\n       1. Governor Sanford and Governor Perdue will use their best \n     efforts as the Governors of their respective states to \n     promote the development of a maritime terminal, by the two \n     states on an equal basis through an appropriate entity (the \n     Bi-State Port Authority) and pursuant to a compact (the Bi-\n     State Compact) approved by the two states' legislatures and \n     ratified by the United States Congress (the Congress), on an \n     appropriate portion of the land (the Jasper Terminal Site) \n     situate in Jasper County, owned by the Georgia Department of \n     Transportation (the Georgia DOT) and currently subject to \n     litigation between the states.\n       2. Independent of the pursuit of the Bi-State Compact to \n     develop a maritime terminal on the Jasper Terminal Site (see \n     paragraph 3 below), Governor Sanford and Governor Perdue \n     recognize that, as a threshold matter, in order for a \n     maritime terminal to be developed on the Jasper Terminal Site \n     by any entity, the easements (the Easements) used by the \n     United States Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) for \n     placement of dredged fill materials for the Savannah Harbor \n     Federal Navigation Project (the Savannah Harbor Project) on \n     the Jasper Terminal Site must be removed, released, or \n     modified. In this regard, Governor Sanford and Governor \n     Perdue further recognize that the Georgia DOT as the current \n     owner of the Jasper Terminal Site is the appropriate party to \n     initiate and pursue the release, removal or modification of \n     the Easements, and they will use their best efforts as the \n     Governors of their respective states to cooperatively pursue \n     the timely release, removal or modification of the Easements \n     by requesting:\n       (a) that the Georgia DOT, as soon as possible after \n     execution of this Term Sheet, make a formal application to \n     the Corps for the release, removal or modification of the \n     Easements and that the State of South Carolina submit a \n     letter of support to the Corps;\n       (b) that the Congress authorize the necessary studies to \n     permit such release, removal or modification (the Federal \n     Feasibility Study) and that each state take whatever action \n     may be required, including if necessary an appropriation by \n     its legislature during the 2007 legislative session, to \n     ensure that each state has the requisite funds dedicated as \n     soon as possible after execution of this Term Sheet for the \n     payment of one-half of the estimated cost of the Federal \n     Feasibility Study; and\n       (c) that each state's legislature appropriate during the \n     2008 legislative session, if necessary, funds dedicated for \n     the payment of one-half of the state or local share of costs \n     associated acquiring replacement spoil disposal sites.\n       Governor Sanford and Governor Perdue further acknowledge \n     that these efforts to release, remove or modify the Easements \n     must immediately proceed on a track independent of the Bi-\n     State Compact process and declare that these efforts shall \n     represent the necessary tangible commitment by the two states \n     to act in good faith toward ensuring that a new maritime \n     terminal on the Savannah River in Jasper County becomes a \n     reality. Additionally, Governor Sanford and Governor Perdue \n     acknowledge that, in the event the Bi-State Compact process \n     fails and title to the Jasper Terminal Site remains reposed \n     with the Georgia DOT (and thus continues to remain the \n     subject of the condemnation litigation pending between the \n     SCSPA and the Georgia DOT), then it would be equitable for \n     the State of Georgia to recompense the State of South \n     Carolina for funds expended by it in connection with the \n     Federal Feasibility Study and acquiring replacement disposal \n     sites to compensate for the areas no longer encumbered by the \n     Easements, and therefore Governor Perdue will use his best \n     efforts as Governor of Georgia to have the Georgia \n     legislature make the appropriate equitable reimbursement \n     arrangements.\n       3. Independent of their immediate effort to pursue the \n     release, removal or modification of the Easements from the \n     Jasper Terminal Site (see paragraph 2 above), Governor \n     Sanford and Governor Perdue will also use their best efforts \n     as the Governors of their respective states to promote the \n     passage of the Bi-State Compact in their respective state's \n     legislatures, on or before March 31, 2008, to:\n       (a) create the Bi-State Port Authority to be owned on a 50-\n     50 basis by the two states and governed by a board comprised \n     of directors appointed in equal numbers by the two states, \n     provided, however, that there are adequate provisions for the \n     resolution of deadlocks and specific assurances that the Bi-\n     State Port Authority would be completely committed to the \n     timely development of a new maritime terminal on the Jasper \n     Terminal Site, with specific milestones to be achieved, so \n     that the Bi-State Port Authority would not be in any way \n     biased toward the protection of existing or future maritime \n     terminal facilities owned and/or operated by the South \n     Carolina State Ports Authority (the SCSPA) at the Port of \n     Charleston or the Georgia Ports Authority (the GPA) at the \n     Port of Savannah;\n       (b) authorize the Georgia DOT's sale of the Jasper Terminal \n     Site to the Bi-State Port Authority for its fair market \n     value, with matters of record that prohibit the development \n     of a maritime terminal being removed prior to the sale, with \n     costs of such removal to be shared by the two states 50-50, \n     such sale to close immediately after the United States \n     Congress ratifies the Bi-State Compact;\n       (c) appropriate funds (with each state bearing one-half of \n     the funding) for the Bi-State Port Authority land acquisition \n     and costs related to its accomplishment of its \n     responsibilities;\n       (d) direct the SCSPA to dismiss its condemnation action \n     against the Georgia DOT and release the Georgia DOT from such \n     claims simultaneous with the Bi-State Port Authority's \n     acquisition of the Jasper Terminal Site; and\n       (e) direct the Bi-State Authority to issue Requests for \n     Proposal for private companies to submit proposals to \n     participate in the development the first phase of the Jasper \n     Terminal Site using private capital.\n\n[[Page S5903]]\n\n                      THE SAVANNAH HARBOR PROJECT\n\n       4. After the release, modification or removal of the \n     Easements from the Terminal Site, the Georgia DOT's sale of \n     its right, title and interest in and to the Jasper Terminal \n     Site to the Bi-State Port Authority, and the required \n     approval and ratification of the Bi-State Compact by the \n     state legislatures and the Congress, then Governor Perdue and \n     Governor Sanford agree to cooperate and to use their best \n     efforts to cause the respective Georgia and South Carolina \n     agencies and public interest parties to cooperate each with \n     the other and with other interested parties, including but \n     not three limited to the Corps, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \n     Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency, in the deepening of the \n     Savannah River navigation channel as conditionally authorized \n     in the federal 1999 Water Resources Development Act and set \n     forth as the Savannah Harbor Project further described at \n     www.sav-harbor.com. and in the permitting of the development \n     of the Jasper Terminal Site, with the understanding that any \n     local sponsor or other nonfederal costs associated with the \n     Federal Feasibility Study and the deepening of the Savannah \n     River navigation channel to at least 48 feet from the \n     Atlantic Ocean to and including the Jasper Terminal Site will \n     be divided equally between the states of Georgia and South \n     Carolina, or their respective agencies or departments, and \n     provided that neither the State of South Carolina nor any of \n     its agencies and departments shall bear any local sponsor or \n     other nonfederal costs of deepening the Savannah River \n     navigation channel beyond the westernmost terminus of the \n     Jasper Terminal Site.\n\n\n                     THE SAVANNAH RIVER COMMITTEES\n\n       5. By executive orders issued in June 2005, Governor \n     Sanford and Governor Perdue created committees to identify \n     and discuss issues of mutual interest related to the water \n     resources of the Savannah River Basin, and pursuant to those \n     orders the Governor's Water Law Review Committee, appointed \n     by Governor Sanford, and the Governor's Savannah River \n     Committee, appointed by Governor Perdue (collectively, the \n     Savannah River Committees), have corresponded and met to \n     discuss those issues, including, without limitation, the \n     following:\n       (a) The potential that fresh groundwater supplies in the \n     Upper Floridan Aquifer are being contaminated by salt water \n     intrusion from the Port Royal Sound and other areas;\n       (b) the impact of the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) \n     regulation for the Lower Savannah River recently issued by \n     the EPA;\n       (c) the use of the Savannah River below the Thurmond Dam as \n     a receptacle for treated wastewater from municipalities and \n     industries; and\n       (d) the need for a long-term strategy between the two \n     states to manage the use of the Savannah River.\n       Governor Sanford and Governor Perdue declare that nothing \n     in this Term Sheet shall undermine the importance of the \n     issues being considered by the Savannah River Committees and \n     reaffirm that these committees have been and continue to be \n     charged with the responsibility of investigating those \n     issues, with due consideration as to how such may impact the \n     other objectives discussed in this Term Sheet, and with the \n     task of reporting their findings and recommendations to the \n     two governors in a timely manner.\n\n\n                             MISCELLANEOUS\n\n       6. Governor Sanford and Governor Perdue shall appoint a \n     six-member task force (the Task Force) chaired jointly by a \n     member from each state with each Governor having an equal \n     number of appointments and direct it to present to them, \n     within 180 days (the 180-Day Task Force Due Diligence Period) \n     of the date hereof, a proposed Bi-State Compact that \n     incorporates the material provisions of paragraph 3 above and \n     that, once it has been passed by the two state legislatures \n     and then ratified by the Congress, would create binding legal \n     obligations in furtherance of the objectives referenced \n     herein. Governor Perdue and Governor Sanford further agree to \n     direct the Task Force to establish a deliberative compact \n     development process in which the draft compact is made \n     available to state officers, stakeholders and the public for \n     comment and revision prior to introduction in the respective \n     legislatures during the 2008 sessions.\n       7. Nothing in this Term Sheet shall delay or in any way \n     influence the legal options available to either state \n     relative to the prosecution or defense of litigation related \n     to any condemnation of the Jasper Terminal Site nor shall \n     this Term Sheet be admissible in such litigation; provided, \n     however, that Governor Sanford and Governor Perdue will ask \n     the SCSPA and the Georgia DOT to: a) take such actions as may \n     be reasonably necessary to have a final adjudication in the \n     pending condemnation action deferred by the South Carolina \n     state circuit court judge until after the expiration of 180-\n     Day Task Force Due Diligence Period, with the understanding, \n     however, that the two litigants during such time would still \n     be able to engage in activities preparatory to such final \n     adjudication; and b) enter into a six-month tolling agreement \n     confirming that the right of either party to petition the \n     United States Supreme Court to accept jurisdiction of the \n     condemnation action shall not be negatively affected by this \n     request for a delay of final adjudication. In this latter \n     regard, it is recognized that, notwithstanding this Term \n     Sheet, the SCSPA expressly reserves any and all arguments and \n     positions that it would be improper for the litigation it has \n     with the Georgia DOT to be removed to the original \n     jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court and the \n     Georgia DOT expressly reserves any and all arguments and \n     positions that such removal would be proper.\n       8. Market studies conducted both by the SCSPA and the GPA \n     indicate that a window of opportunity now exists for maritime \n     terminals in the Southeast to increase their volume of \n     imports and exports, and Governor Sanford and Governor Perdue \n     will use their best efforts as the Governors of their \n     respective states to promote regional cooperation between the \n     State of South Carolina and the State of Georgia to take \n     advantage of this opportunity--not only in regard to the new \n     maritime terminal planned for the Jasper Terminal Site, but \n     also between the existing operations at the Port of \n     Charleston and the Port of Savannah--so that the two states \n     are able to take advantage of this opportunity, said \n     cooperation to include, without limitation, the development \n     of a coordinated and improved network of rail access to and \n     rail delivery and distribution from terminal operations in \n     Jasper County, the Port of Savannah and the Port of \n     Charleston.\n       9. This Term Sheet is a statement of the mutual \n     understanding of the parties. Neither this Term Sheet nor any \n     provision hereof constitutes, or shall constitute, a legal \n     and binding obligation, contract or agreement between either \n     of the parties. Even though this Term Sheet is not binding in \n     any way, the parties agree that: a) if, within 180 days of \n     the creation of the Task Force referred to in paragraph 6 \n     above, a proposed Bi-State Compact is not presented to \n     Governor Sanford and Governor Perdue by such Task Force, then \n     this Term Sheet shall terminate automatically; and b) if by \n     March 31, 2008, the legislatures of the two states have not \n     formally approved the Bi-State Compact, then this Term Sheet \n     and the Bi-State Compact, if any, shall terminate \n     automatically.\n                                  ____\n\n\nStatement of the Honorable Johnny Isakson, a United States Senator From \n                          the State of Georgia\n\n       Senator Isakson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have enjoyed \n     working with you on many projects in the past, and look \n     forward to working with you on this Committee. I pledge to \n     Chairman Boxer that I absolutely will do everything I can to \n     help expedite and facilitate the WRDA bill and I associate \n     myself with her remarks.\n       I would like to welcome Senator Mack Mattingly from \n     Georgia, who is in the audience today, and Doug Marchand, who \n     will testify later, who since 1994 has overseen the expansion \n     of the Port of Savannah and the Port of Brunswick. I express \n     my appreciation to the Corps of Engineers for the investment \n     and the work they have done at both those facilities.\n       I particularly welcome General Strock, and tell you how \n     much I appreciate all you have done and how much you will be \n     missed. You have done an outstanding job.\n       Mr. Chairman, on Monday of this week at 2:00 p.m., the \n     Governors of South Carolina and Georgia met on the banks of \n     the Savannah River and held an historic press conference \n     which announced a bi-State compact to propose the building of \n     a new port in Jasper County, South Carolina to be jointly \n     operated by the State of Georgia and the State of South \n     Carolina.\n       Historically, the two States have been at odds over Jasper \n     County on many issues, and they joined hands today and even \n     offered to pay the financial cost of the feasibility studies \n     necessary to move forward on that event. I would like to \n     submit that entire agreement between Georgia and South \n     Carolina for the record.\n       Senator Baucus. Without objection.\n       Senator Isakson. Speaking of cooperation, Mr. Chairman, I \n     am pleased to tell you that the Governors of Alabama and \n     Georgia, you would think we were having a new civil war with \n     all my testimony here, but the Governors of Alabama and \n     Georgia have also worked together in the last eight months to \n     bring about a tri-State water compact in the Chattahoochee \n     Basin. We have been in court for the better part of 17 years \n     without a tri-State water agreement. It has hurt the States \n     of Florida, Georgia and Alabama. The Corps was to begin early \n     this year, has not yet, but I am going to encourage them to \n     hurry up and facilitate the completion of the water control \n     plan, which is the essential framework to formalize the tri-\n     State water compact and make that in fact happen.\n       I also am looking forward to the testimony of the members \n     of the Corps with regard to the fiscal year 2008 budget \n     request, as to its sufficiency. In my personal judgment, it \n     is probably insufficient to meet the challenges that we need. \n     I hope they will make suggestions as to what we can do in the \n     Senate and the Congress to improve that.\n       I again want to end where I began, with my sincere \n     appreciation to the Corps of Engineers for the investment of \n     capital and time in the State of Georgia and our resources. \n     Our ports of Brunswick and Savannah are two of the great \n     facilities on the East Coast of the United States. The \n     proposal to build a third port jointly by Georgia and South \n     Carolina is because those two ports have finite capabilities: \n     Brunswick, Savannah and the Port of Charleston. The States \n     have realized the importance of meeting the needs of the \n     people of the United States of America and our commerce in \n     the 21st century, and\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\n     believe that facility to be an essential part of it.\n       I thank the Ports Authority representatives for attending \n     today. I thank the Corps for their investment in Georgia. I \n     look forward to hearing from the Corps with regard to the \n     water control plan on the Chattahoochee River.\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. In conclusion, this water resources bill represents a \nlong overdue step forward in the investment to protect our water \nresources, enhance our environmental restoration, and spur economic \ndevelopment. It is an investment in the future of our drinking water, \nan investment in the future of our navigable waterways, and an \ninvestment in the future of our commerce. For Congress to fail today or \nthe Senate to fail today to act on this bill responsibly and move \nforward will be doing a disservice to commerce, to our citizens, and we \nwill, in fact, be abandoning our responsibility to meet the needs of \nthe people of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is a pleasure to see this bill out here again as it \nwas last year, passing the Senate, I think unanimously. I had thoughts \nthat maybe we would never see this bill again in this new Congress, \nsuch a needed bill as it is. We have not passed a water resource \ndevelopment bill since 2000. Usually Congress, before that period of \ntime, had been reauthorizing every 2 years or authorizing for the first \ntime on a regular basis.\n  This bill is important to the entire country, but we each represent \nour respective States. So I see the necessity of this bill from how it \nenhances the economy of the upper Midwest, Iowa being in the upper \nMidwest, benefiting very much from it, not only because of where we are \ngeographically located, but we are such a breadbasket for the world as \nwell. For Iowa, the Enhanced Navigation Capacity Improvement and \nEcosystem Restoration plan for the upper Mississippi and the Illinois \nwater systems being included in this Water Resources Development Act is \nvital to the economy and to the ecology of the upper Midwest and \nparticularly to the Mississippi River, with its triple purpose of \nenvironment, recreation, and commerce.\n  Of course, Iowa has the Mississippi River as our eastern boundary. \nIowa and the Nation rely on the river to move many of our goods, both \ndomestically and internationally, moving goods into our State that are \nneeded for production as well as moving finished product and raw \nproduct out of Iowa, not only agricultural products, which maybe you \nthink about most often, but other products beyond agriculture.\n  For the United States as a whole, our inland waterway system plays a \nmajor role in our Nation's economy. More than a billion tons of \ncommerce is moved domestically through our inland waterways with a \nvalue of $300 billion. Of the $300 billion, the upper Mississippi and \nthe Illinois River system contribute significantly. The value of that \npart of our inland waterway system is $12 billion per year. \nApproximately 60 percent of that $12 billion a year is involved with \nbulk agricultural exports moving from the farms to the river, down the \nriver, both upper Mississippi and Illinois River, out into \ninternational commerce. Navigation on these rivers supports over \n400,000 jobs, including 90,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs.\n  The United States enjoys a comparative advantage in corn production \nworldwide. My State of Iowa is the leading corn-producing State of the \nNation. But the United States as a whole has a comparative advantage to \nthe rest of the world. The per-ton cost for transporting corn in the \nUnited States is lower than in lots of other countries. That gives us a \ntremendous advantage beyond our productive capability. Our Nation must \nnot allow its transportation infrastructure to continue to deteriorate. \nI believe one of the most important reasons for this legislation, at \nleast as it relates to the Mississippi and Illinois, is there has been \ndeterioration of the system on the one hand and, on the other hand, it \nhas not been expanded in the most efficient way handle the enhanced \ncommerce, the enhanced tonnage that goes up and down the river today \ncompared to decades ago when this system was first set up. Because of \nthat, we have to be concerned not only with this deterioration and \nmaintenance but with the expansion of it because our international \ncompetitors are making major investments in their transportation \nsystems.\n\n  I had the good fortune, a year ago about now, to travel to Brazil \nwith a codel I headed, to look at the transportation of agricultural \nproducts from the inland of Brazil to the ocean into world commerce. As \nfar as some of their infrastructure is concerned, it is very inferior \nto ours because when traveling in rural Brazil, last year, we ran over \nmore potholes--and I suppose in that area, like in rural Iowa, you \nwould call them mud holes--than you can count.\n  But Brazil has made significant investments in river infrastructure \nas compared to their surface transportation. They are realizing they \nhave to get the stuff to the river if they are going to get it into \nworld commerce, so they are spending a lot in resources now on surface \ntransportation to move it from the farm to the ocean. When that \nhappens, I am telling you, we are really going to be at an economic \ndisadvantage with Brazil because of what they are doing on the Amazon, \nbecause Brazil already has made significant investments in its river \ninfrastructure.\n  In the Chamber, I have a map of Brazil, and it happens that where the \ntwo arrows are depicted on the map is where we stopped--at those \nlocations on the Amazon River. At the eastern location, you can see \nthere is a city called Santarem. It is 400 miles in from the Atlantic \nOcean, which is about the same distance from New Orleans to Memphis. \nThey have a brandnew facility there for loading oceangoing ships--not \nusing barges, the way we do, and then taking them out to the ocean and \nloading from the barges onto oceangoing ships. They have oceangoing \nships going all the way up the Amazon River to that point--400 miles. \nThey get the efficiency of loading right onto the oceangoing ships, to \ngive them an advantage. It is a very modern loading facility.\n  Now, there are also new facilities for barges farther up the river--\nanother 200 miles up the river--where they can load onto barges and \nmove their production into the world commerce. Barges traveling that \nfar into the mainland are going to help Brazil become very competitive \nwith our own farmers.\n  Then again, let me repeat, once they figure out how to get their \nrailroad--they do not have much of a railroad system for commerce to \nmove bulk--when they get railroads in place, when they get their \nhighways in place, they are going to be a real challenge to us.\n  Let me say, I ought to give them more credit than I have. From the \nstandpoint of what they can produce, at least with soybeans, they are \noutproducing the United States, as of a couple years ago, when, for the \nfirst time, we were no longer the world's leading producer of soybeans. \nSo they have that capacity to produce. Where we are more competitive at \nthis point is getting our stuff to market. But you can see they are \nconcentrating on that. That is why we need to concentrate on this \nlegislation to get our dam-and-lock situation on the upper Mississippi \nand the Illinois River in a position so we can do that.\n  Now, South America has more virgin land that has not been under \nproduction, and they are converting 17 million acres of virgin land \ninto agricultural production. The long-term results of these efforts on \nproducers in the United States, if we do not keep our transportation \nsystem on the Mississippi River and Illinois River up to date and \nexpanded, would be to reduce farm income by $562 million a year, \nincrease the foreign trade imbalance by $245 million, and to have a \nloss of sensitive global environmental habitat.\n  Therefore, we must invest in major improvements to all of our \ntransportation infrastructure. Currently, every mode of transportation \nis near or at maximum capacity. If we do not make these investments in \nour roads, in our rail, in our water, U.S. agriculture, U.S. industry, \nand the working men and women are going to pay the price.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, in 2005, U.S. \nexports of goods and services totaled $1.2 trillion, compared to $1.1 \ntrillion in 2004 and\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\njust a little over $1 trillion in 2003. Also, our Nation relies on many \nimported goods that come to the United States. Many of these goods \ntravel by our inland waterways. It is also forecast that both our \nexports and imports will continue to grow in the coming years. We must \nbe able, then, to efficiently and economically move these goods.\n  Nearly two-thirds of all grain and soybean exports are moved through \nthe Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. According to one study, unless the \nArmy Corps of Engineers modernizes the lock-and-dam system on the upper \nMississippi and Illinois Rivers, the cost of transporting corn would \nrise 17 cents per bushel. As a result, corn and soybean exports would \ndecline by 68 million and 10 million bushels per year respectively. The \ndecline in corn and soybean exports would reduce farm income by $246 \nmillion. Loss from lower prices and decreased interstate corn demand \nwould equal $316 million. So these figures highlight how important \nbarge transportation is to farmers and to the overall U.S. economy.\n  In addition, there are many environmental benefits to river \ntransportation. According to the EPA, towboats emit 35 to 60 percent \nfewer pollutants than locomotives or trucks. Barges operate at 10 \npercent of the cost of trucks and 40 percent the cost of trains, while \nreleasing 20 times less nitrous oxide, 9 times less carbon monoxide, 7 \ntimes less hydrocarbons, and burning 10 times less fuel. And you can \nsee this comparison right here, shown on this chart--with barges on the \nleft, hopper cars or trains in the middle, and then trucks and semis on \nthe right--you can see the massive number of semis it takes to do what \none 15-barge tow would do. This chart shows 15 railcars or 58 \nsemitrucks being needed to replace each barge loaded, diverted off the \nupper Mississippi river system. A 15-barge tow equates to 870 \nsemitrucks. EPA also estimates that the Nation currently saves $100 \nmillion to $300 million in air pollution abatements by moving bulk \ncommodities by barge on the upper Mississippi river system.\n  In these times of high fuel prices, and with the need to conserve \nenergy, 1 gallon of fuel in a towboat can carry 1 ton of freight 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes farther than rail and 9 times farther than trucks.\n  The Minnesota Department of Transportation estimates shifting from \nbarge to rail results in fuel usage, emissions, and probable accident \nincreases of 331 percent, 470 percent, and 290 percent respectively--\nfor fuel usage, emissions, and probable accidents. Shifting traffic \nfrom barges to trucks increases fuel use by 826 percent, emissions by \n709 percent, and probable accidents by almost 6,000 percent. \nFurthermore, shifting the 245 million tons from our rivers would add an \nadditional 9.4 million trucks each year. That would add more than 169 \nmillion tires in our landfills.\n\n  For these reasons, I have been working with several of my Senate \ncolleagues for so many years now on getting the initial authorization \nfor lock-and-dam modernization and enhanced environmental restoration \non these rivers signed into law. So I am very pleased this committee \nincluded these important initiatives in the Water Resources Development \nAct and that a bipartisan group of Senators is advocating for this very \nimportant modernization.\n  The lock system on the upper Mississippi River was built in the late \n1930s. Many of the lock chambers are only 600 feet long and cannot \naccommodate 1,100-foot barge tows. These structures require modern tow \nconfiguration to ``double lock'' in order to make the pass-through. \nThis adds up to mounting delay times, increased costs to shippers, \nincreased harm to our environment by higher emissions and higher \nsediment suspension in the river channels, loss of jobs, and lower \nwages.\n  By the year 2020, if we do not make the much needed improvements in \nthese locks, $562 million will be lost in farm income per year. This \namount does not even take into account the huge cost of increased \ndelays and congestion on our rail system and our road system. Also, \nkeep in mind that $1 invested in this navigation project yields $6 in \nnational benefit. That is a pretty good return on the investment of \ntaxpayers' money.\n  We realize the authorization for the lock-and-dam improvements is \njust a first step in a lengthy process of improving the lock-and-dam \nsystem on the upper Mississippi, but it is an important and necessary \nproject for our Nation. So I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this \nbalanced legislation for the good of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Grassley so much for his \nendorsement of this important bill.\n  It was interesting, I say to the Senator, that just as you came to \nthe floor, I was handed the letter from the Corn Growers saying how \nmuch they support our legislation. And we add to that the letters from \nthe American Public Works Association, the Associated General \nContractors of America, the National Waterways Conference, the American \nFarm Bureau Federation. We have the Carpenters Union. We have many \nunions.\n  This is one of those bills that have broad support. But I am just \nvery glad the Senator came down to express his support.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a second?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, let me verify, not only from the \nNational Corn Growers Association, as you read from their letter, but I \ncan tell you, from the town meetings I had during the Easter break and \nalso during the February break, from the grassroots of my State, \nfarmers, including members of the Corn Growers Association, came to my \nmeetings and on an individual basis backed up what their national \norganization stands for. So I think it is very much a national \nconsensus of an organization, but it is also an understanding with the \nfamily farmers as to the importance of this legislation.\n  I thank the Senator for inserting those letters in the Record.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     National Corn\n\n\n                                          Growers Association,\n\n                                                      May 8, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: The National Corn Growers \n     Association (NCGA) appreciates your time, effort and \n     steadfast commitment to bring the Water Resources Development \n     Act (WRDA) to the Senate floor for consideration. \n     Additionally, we applaud the Senate Environment and Public \n     Works Committee and associated staff for their determination \n     to see this long over-due legislation completed.\n       Corn growers have been long-time advocates for improvements \n     to our inland waterway system. We have sought partners with \n     industry, labor organizations, and environmental advocates \n     building a broad coalition of support for WRDA. Our country's \n     inland navigation system plays a critical role in our \n     nation's economy, moving more than a billion tons of domestic \n     commerce valued at more than $300 billion. More than 1 \n     billion bushels of grain (about 60 percent of all grain \n     exports) move to export markets via the inland waterways each \n     year, accounting for $8.5 billion in exports.\n       Furthermore, inland waterways relieve congestion on our \n     already over-crowded highways and railways that run through \n     cities. One jumbo barge has the same capacity as 58 trucks or \n     15 rail cars. For a typical 15-barge tow on our nation's \n     rivers, that is equal to 870 trucks in just one barge \n     movement. One gallon of fuel in a towboat can carry one ton \n     of freight 2.5 times farther than rail and nine times farther \n     than truck.\n       The Mississippi River and its tributaries serve as one of \n     our nation's major transportation corridors. Yet, the \n     infrastructure on the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers was \n     built in the 1930's when the total corn crop for the country \n     was two billion bushels. In 2006, corn production eclipsed 10 \n     billion bushels for the fourth consecutive year.\n       For continued success, U.S. farmers need efficient \n     transportation networks. Investment in the Upper Mississippi \n     and Illinois Rivers has not kept pace with demands. The \n     antiquated system is slowly being starved resulting in \n     operational failures that hinder barge movement and \n     dramatically impact corn prices. Problems along the \n     Mississippi and Illinois Rivers will continue to persist year \n     after year if long-term investments are not made to improve \n     our transportation infrastructure.\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\n       Specifically, WRDA would authorize a fifteen year project \n     that includes the construction of seven new locks on the \n     Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers as well as immediate \n     implementation of small-scale measures. This legislation \n     would authorize a fifteen year project that includes the \n     construction of seven new locks on the Upper Mississippi and \n     Illinois Rivers as well as immediate implementation of small-\n     scale measures and the creation of a major ecosystem \n     restoration program. As with our highways and interchanges, \n     the purpose of modernization on the Upper Mississippi and \n     Illinois Rivers is to make the entire system more efficient.\n       The continued development of our water resources in an \n     environmentally sound manner will contribute mightily to our \n     nation's well-being. The Congress needs to act now to address \n     issues such as environmental restoration, navigation, flood \n     control, hurricane protection, water supply, irrigation, \n     beach nourishment and recreation.\n       Corn growers appreciate your support and stand ready to \n     work with you in passing this important piece of legislation \n     to the nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Ken McCauley,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   American Public\n\n\n                                            Works Association,\n\n                                                     May 10, 2007.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairwoman, Environment and Public Works Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairwoman: The American Public Works \n     Association applauds your leadership in moving the Senate \n     Water Resources Development Act of 2007 through committee and \n     readying it for floor action! This bill will authorize vital \n     inland and coastal public works projects needed for \n     transportation, flood control, shore protection and \n     environmental restoration. Passage of WRDA is long overdue \n     and the time for action is now.\n       Our water resource systems are integral to our nation's \n     well-being. With adequate dredging, our ports and waterways \n     are the backbone of our transportation system--ensuring \n     domestic and international trade opportunities and low-cost, \n     environmentally sensitive goods movements. Our flood damage \n     reduction program saves lives and prevents almost $8 in \n     damages for each dollar spent. Corps hydropower facilities \n     provide electricity to 24% of citizens. Shore protection \n     projects provide safety from hurricanes and other storm \n     events for transportation, petroleum and agriculture \n     infrastructure around our coastal waterways and deltas. They \n     also provide recreational benefits, returning $4 in benefits \n     for each dollar invested. Projects for water supply, \n     irrigation, recreation and wildlife habitat provide \n     innumerable benefits.\n       APWA's members are uniquely positioned to collaborate with \n     municipal and county agencies, engineers and local community \n     leaders on these issues. APWA's 29,000 members design, build, \n     operate and maintain transportation, water supply, sewage and \n     refuse disposal systems, public buildings and other \n     structures and facilities essential to our nation's economy \n     and way of life. Public works professionals serve a diverse \n     range of local communities, municipalities, counties, \n     townships, villages and districts, whether large or small, \n     urban or rural. As stewards of public infrastructure, APWA \n     members are dedicated to managing and operating public works \n     departments that provide safe and reliable service to their \n     communities.\n       We thank you for your efforts to ensure that our water \n     resources infrastructure, from our coastlines to our inland \n     rivers and Great Lakes, will continue to be viable. We look \n     forward to celebrating with you the enactment of a sound \n     Water Resources Development Act of 2007 that furthers the \n     goals of providing the nation with an economically and \n     environmentally sustainable future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Peter B.

For every \n     $1 billion expended on water resources development \n     activities, approximately 40,000 direct and indirect jobs are \n     created. In addition, an estimated $706 billion in damages \n     have been prevented through flood damage reduction projects--\n     most within the past 25 years--representing a six-to-one \n     return on investment.\n       Over the past five years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \n     has voluntarily implemented new policies designed to improve \n     analysis, accountability, regulatory compliance and \n     environmental protection for the nation's Civil Works \n     program.\n       The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 will finally \n     set the Nation back on the track of reaping substantial \n     returns on investment. Congress must commit to infrastructure \n     investment now to leave behind a legacy of economic security \n     and opportunity for future generations. WRDA is a key vote \n     for AGC members and we urge you to vote YES for final passage \n     of S. 1248.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Jeffrey D.

Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairwoman, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairwoman: It is vitally important that \n     America's water resources infrastructure be reliable and \n     productive. Therefore we applaud your efforts to end the \n     stalemate over water resources project authorization by \n     bringing H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act of \n     2007 (WRDA) to the Senate floor. We firmly believe that it is \n     time to end the impasse over passage of WRDA.\n       A Water Resources Development Act is vitally needed to \n     accommodate the many important projects awaiting \n     authorization, including the modernization of the locks on \n     the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. Projects with a \n     Chief of Engineers' report have undergone years of study and \n     analysis to determine if they are in the best interest of the \n     Federal government. In addition, stakeholders have already \n     indicated their willingness to cost-share the price-tags. \n     Water resources projects are the very foundation upon which \n     citizens can be productive in their daily lives. As outlined \n     in the letter sent by the National Waterways Alliance on May \n     3, it is equally important that policy provisions enhance the \n     process by which the Corps of Engineers formulates project \n     solutions. Finally addressing the ``Corps reform'' issue in a \n     balanced way can lead to stability for the Corps of Engineers \n     and reassure the nation that the Corps is a world-class \n     engineering organization for the future.\n       Our water resources system contributes mightily to \n     America's well-being. With adequate dredging, our ports and \n     waterways are the backbone of our transportation system--\n     ensuring domestic and international trade opportunities and a \n     safe, cheap and eco-friendly transportation alternative for \n     products such as steel, coal, fertilizer, energy products and \n     byproducts, salt, sand and gravel, cement, petroleum, \n     chemicals, etc. In addition, the U.S. maritime transportation \n     system moves more than 60 percent of the Nation's grain \n     exports. Our flood damage reduction program saves lives and \n     prevents, on average, almost $8 in damages for each dollar \n     spent. Corps hydropower facilities supply 24% of the \n     hydropower generated in the United States. Projects for water \n     supply, irrigation, recreation, beach nourishment and \n     wildlife habitat provide innumerable benefits. These water-\n     related assets have the potential to help grow our economy, \n     help ease our Nation's growing congestion problem and provide \n     a finer quality of life.\n       As you know, the National Waterways Conference is the \n     Nation's ``umbrella'' water resources policy organization. \n     Its members include those who ship goods domestically and \n     around the world, the carriers of those goods, waterway \n     service firms such as engineering companies, fleeting \n     services and dredging concerns, public entities such as \n     coastal and inland ports, levee districts, water supply \n     districts and state governmental units, and associations, \n     both regional and national in scope--representing a wide \n     variety of interests. The members of the National Waterways \n     Conference, Inc., look forward to working with you to ensure \n     that our water resources infrastructure remains a monument to \n     the greatness of the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Worth Hager,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Farm Bureau\n\n\n                                                   Federation,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2007.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The American Farm Bureau Federation \n     urges you to support S. 1248, the Water Resources Development \n     Act of 2007 (WRDA), when it is considered on the floor. The \n     bill authorizes important, long overdue flood control, dam \n     safety, storm damage reduction and environmental restoration \n     projects across the country. It includes critical provisions \n     to update and modernize the locks and dams on the Upper \n     Mississippi and Illinois rivers.\n       Modernizing the locks and dams on the Upper Mississippi and \n     Illinois Rivers is essential for U.S. commerce and the \n     agricultural sector. One medium-size tow on the river can \n     carry the same weight as 870 trucks. However, the structures \n     now in use were built many decades ago and were not designed \n     to accommodate today's longer barge tows that are absolutely \n     necessary in order to compete in a global market. While these \n     outdated locks and dams make our transportation system less \n     efficient, our competitors in countries such as Argentina and \n     Brazil are aggressively modernizing their own infrastructure.\n       Farm Bureau urges you to support S. 1248 and oppose any \n     amendment that would hinder progress on infrastructure \n     improvements.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to allocate time, \nand that would be for Senator Martinez to immediately follow my remarks \nand to have the floor for up to 10 minutes; then Senator Salazar for 10 \nminutes; Senator Alexander for 10 minutes; and at the end of their \ntime, the time be reserved for Senator Feingold for 1 hour, followed by \nmyself at the end of that hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I express my thanks to Chairman Boxer \nand Ranking Member Inhofe for bringing this important bill to the \nfloor, which sets a high priority for my State, and for giving it such \nstrong support. I also note how important it is that we have a strong \nbipartisan effort. At a time when our country could rightly wonder if \nthe Congress can get anything done or if, in fact, it is possible for \nbipartisan cooperation to exist, here is a good example of where \nRepublicans and Democrats are working together for something that is \nvery important for our country and significantly important for the \nState of Florida. This bill is something Senator Nelson and I have \nworked on side by side trying to bring to fruition. It is long overdue. \nIt is time.\n  My State of Florida is home to beautiful beaches, coastal estuaries, \nand 14 deepwater ports. No piece of legislation moving through Congress \nwill have as much lasting improvement on Florida's fragile ecosystem as \nthis bill. After a long delay, it is my hope my colleagues will support \nthis bill and begin the Federal partnership for restoring the \nEverglades.\n  For too long in our Nation's past, the Federal Government's water \nresources policies seemed to be in conflict with nature. In the not so \ndistant past, the Army Corps of Engineers and even the elected \ncongressional and State leadership of Florida were determined to drain \nthe Everglades.\n  One of our most colorful former governors, Napoleon Bonaparte \nBroward, famously proclaimed: ``Water will run downhill!'' At that \ntime, draining and improving what was then thought to be ``useless \nswampland'' was the epitome of true conservation because opening the \nwetlands and marshes of Florida to farming and development was \nconsidered a better use of land because it could feed people, it could \nemploy people, it was good for development, it was good for Florida.\n  There is also a popular story of a man who moved to south Florida to \nmake his fortune farming the rich soils around Lake Okeechobee. He was \nquoted as saying:\n\n       I have bought land by the acre, I have bought land by the \n     foot, but I have never before bought land by the bucket.\n\n  There was still a large amount of what we called ``Old Florida'' back \nthen with numerous hardwood hummocks and cypress domes that were prone \nto flooding.\n  The idea that places should be protected for their environmental \nvalue, their intrinsic beauty, as a water resource, and for public \nenjoyment was an alien concept. Fortunately for our Nation and more \nimportantly for Florida, the idea of conservation and restoration has \nan entirely different and more sophisticated meaning today than in the \npast.\n  In the year 2000, Congress authorized the landmark Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan, otherwise known as CERP, to repair and \nrestore the natural sheet flow of water across the park and into \nFlorida Bay. CERP projects will capture and store a great deal of the \nnearly 1.7 billion gallons of fresh water a day which is currently \nreleased into the Atlantic Ocean and into the Gulf of Mexico. This \nwater will be stored in aboveground and underground reservoirs. When \nneeded, it will be directed to wetlands, lakes, rivers, and estuaries \nin south Florida, providing abundant, clean, fresh water while also \nensuring future urban and agricultural water supplies.\n  Even though we get more rain than nearly anywhere else in the \ncountry, Florida is currently experiencing a severe drought. Evidence \nof that drought is the wildfires we are experiencing today as we speak, \nout-of-control wildfires because of drought, but also because what \nnormally would be wetlands and marshes have been drained over years of \ndevelopment--careless development. So it is vital that we capture this \nfresh water so it can be used to meet our growing conservation and \nwater use needs.\n  Restoring the Everglades, this incredible undertaking, is the largest \nenvironmental restoration project in the world. I am proud to say the \nState of Florida has made historic and prolific financial commitments \nof over $3 billion to honor their commitment to the Everglades. The \nState of Florida has done its part. When I meet with our former \nGovernor, when he was Governor, or our current Governor, or members of \nour legislature, I am reminded by them: Where is the Federal \npartnership? We have done our part. The Federal Government, on the \nother hand, has contributed around $3 million of their commitment. WRDA \nwill help to address this inequity by authorizing major CERP projects \nsuch as the Indian River Lagoon and the Picayune Strand, which is such \nan important restoration effort, so they can begin to take shape.\n  The Indian River Lagoon South Restoration Project in WRDA is critical \nto the success of the CERP and returning the St. Lucie estuary to a \nhealthy status. Approximately 2,200 species have been identified in the \nlagoon system, with 35 of these species listed as threatened or \nendangered. According to the South Florida Water Management District, \nit has the greatest species diversity of any estuary in North America.\n\n  Implementation of the South Restoration Project will feature more \nthan 12,000 acres of aboveground water reservoirs, 9,000 acres of \nmanmade wetlands, and 90,000 acres of natural storage and water quality \nacres, including 53,000 acres of restored wetlands. All of these areas \nprovide additional water storage and management capabilities for \napproximately 44 billion gallons of runoff water storage. Also included \nis the removal of more than 7 million cubic yards of muck sediments \nfrom the St. Lucie River, with a corresponding restoration of 2,650 \nacres of habitat, 922 acres of sea grass, and 889 acres of oyster \nhabitat. All of these project features will cooperatively achieve a \ntargeted reduction of 41 percent of the phosphorus and 26 percent of \nthe overall nitrogen loadings in the estuary from these basins in the \nlong term, restoring the system to a more balanced and natural state.\n  Another very important Everglades restoration project included in \nWRDA is the authorization of the Picayune Strand project. This area was \noriginally planned as the largest subdivision in the United States. It \nwas called Golden Gate Estates. In the early 1960s, the Gulf American \nCorporation dredged 48 miles of canals, built 290 miles of roads, and \nsold thousands of lots before going bankrupt. At that time there were \nno Federal or State laws setting drainage standards or regulating the \ndevelopment of wetlands. WRDA will help the State of Florida in \nrestoring this degraded area back to the cypress wetland it was before \nby removing the harmful drainage canals that have made this area prone \nto wildfires and invasive species such as Old World climbing fern, \nmaleluca, and Brazilian pepper. In addition, the project will restore \nand enhance habitat for fish and wildlife resources, including \nthreatened or endangered species such as the Florida panther, the \nFlorida black bear, red-cockaded woodpecker, and wood stork, as well as \nrare habitat such as tropical hummocks and plant species, including \norchids and bromeliads.\n  The habitat and water recharge benefits will provide a boon for the \nBig Cypress National Preserve. Also, it will provide a boon to the \n10,000 Islands National Wildlife Refuge and the Florida Panther \nWildlife Refuge.\n  This bill also contains an important study approved by the EPW \nCommittee to direct the Army Corps of Engineers to examine the \nstructural integrity of the Hoover Dike. This is a critically important \nstep in trying to ensure the structural integrity of this dike. The \ndike around Lake Okeechobee was constructed in response to the 1928 \nhurricane which struck and caused Lake Okeechobee to overflow, killing \nover 2,500 people in the Belle Glade area. A study was performed in \n2006 by the\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\nFlorida Water Management District, and this study found the dike's \nprotective capability had been severely eroded in several areas. This \nstudy will direct the Corps to examine the findings and make \nrecommendations for the State of Florida.\n  The WRDA bill also means greater jobs and improved transportation for \ncoastal communities and ports in Florida. It authorizes additional \npassing lanes, increased safety at Florida's largest port, the Port of \nTampa, which is where half of the State's seaborne tonnage moves \nthrough. In addition, WRDA provides navigation improvements for the \nMiami Harbor, which is widely regarded as one of the world's major \ncruise and shipping destinations. It will also help with beach \nrenourishment, which will also help restore some of the critically \neroded beach areas from the devastating storms of 2004 and 2005.\n  In conclusion, I thank Chairman Boxer, Senator Inhofe, Senator Bond, \nand Senator Isakson for including these vital restoration and economic \ndevelopment projects in WRDA. This legislation is long overdue. I urge \nmy colleagues to support it. I hope for the swift conclusion of this \nlegislation so the people of Florida can begin to see the benefits that \nare going to come to our State as a result of this farsighted \nlegislation that will have impacts on our State long after most of us \nhave parted from these halls of Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n      Iraq Study Group Recommendations Implementation Act of 2007\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I come to the floor today with my distinguished \ncolleague and friend, the Senator from Tennessee, to talk about a new \nway forward in Iraq. I ask unanimous consent that legislation which we \nhave put together working with the Iraq Study Group entitled, The Iraq \nStudy Group Recommendations Implementation Act of 2007, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. __\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Iraq Study Group \n     Recommendations Implementation Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On March 15, 2006, the Iraq Study Group was created at \n     the request of a bipartisan group of members of Congress.\n       (2) The United States Institute of Peace was designated as \n     the facilitating organization for the Iraq Study Group with \n     the support of the Center for the Study of the Presidency, \n     the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the \n     James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice \n     University.\n       (3) The Iraq Study Group was composed of a bipartisan group \n     of senior individuals who have had distinguished careers in \n     public service. The Group was co-chaired by former Secretary \n     of State James A. Baker, III and former chairman of the House \n     Foreign Affairs Committee Lee H. Hamilton, and the other \n     members were former Secretary of State Lawrence S. \n     Eagleburger; Vernon E. Jordan, Jr, the Senior Managing \n     Director of Lazard, Freres and Company; former Attorney \n     General Edwin Meese III; former Supreme Court Associate \n     Justice Sandra Day O'Connor; former White House Chief of \n     Staff Leon E. Panetta; former Secretary of Defense William J. \n     Perry; United States Senator Charles S. Robb; and United \n     States Senator Alan K. Simpson.\n       (4) On June 15, 2006, President George W. Bush signed into \n     law the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for \n     Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, \n     2006 (Public Law 109-234), which provided $1,000,000 to the \n     United States Institute of Peace for activities in support of \n     the Iraq Study Group.\n       (5) The Iraq Study Group consulted nearly 200 leading \n     officials and experts, including the senior members of the \n     Government of Iraq, the United States Government, and key \n     coalition partners and received advice from more than 50 \n     distinguished scholars and experts from a variety of fields \n     who conducted working groups in the areas of economy and \n     reconstruction, military and security, political development, \n     and the strategic environment in Iraq and the Middle East.\n       (6) While the Iraq Study Group recommended shifting the \n     primary mission of United States military forces in Iraq from \n     combat to training, and while the Iraq Study Group described \n     actions and conditions that could allow for a redeployment of \n     troops not necessary for force protection out of Iraq by the \n     first quarter of 2008, the Iraq Study Group did not set a \n     fixed timetable for withdrawal and said it could support a \n     short-term redeployment of United States combat forces, \n     complemented by comprehensive political, economic, and \n     diplomatic efforts, to stabilize Baghdad or to speed up the \n     mission of training and equipping Iraqis if the United States \n     commander in Iraq determines that such steps would be \n     effective.\n       (7) The report of the Iraq Study Group includes a letter \n     from the co-chairs of the Iraq Study Group, James A. Baker, \n     III and Lee H. Hamilton, which states, ``Our political \n     leaders must build a bipartisan approach to bring a \n     responsible conclusion to what is now a lengthy and costly \n     war. Our country deserves a debate that prizes substance over \n     rhetoric, and a policy that is adequately funded and \n     sustainable. The President and Congress must work together. \n     Our leaders must be candid and forthright with the American \n     people in order to win their support.''\n       (8) The Republicans and Democrats who comprised the Iraq \n     Study Group reached compromise and consensus and unanimously \n     concluded that their recommendations offer a new way forward \n     for the United States in Iraq and the region, and are \n     comprehensive and need to be implemented in a coordinated \n     fashion.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF IRAQ STUDY \n                   GROUP RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President and Congress \n     should agree that the way forward in Iraq is to implement the \n     comprehensive set of recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, \n     particularly those specifically described in this Act, and \n     the President should formulate a comprehensive plan to do so.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS IN IRAQ.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that, consistent with the \n     recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, the United States \n     Government should--\n       (1) establish a ``New Diplomatic Offensive'' to deal with \n     the problems of Iraq and of the region;\n       (2) support the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq;\n       (3) encourage other countries in the region to stop the \n     destabilizing interventions and actions of Iraq's neighbors;\n       (4) secure the borders of Iraq, including through the use \n     of joint patrols with neighboring countries;\n       (5) prevent the expansion of the instability and conflict \n     beyond the borders of Iraq;\n       (6) promote economic assistance, commerce, trade, political \n     support, and, if possible, military assistance for the \n     Government of Iraq from non-neighboring Muslim nations;\n       (7) energize the governments of other countries to support \n     national political reconciliation in Iraq;\n       (8) encourage the governments of other countries to \n     validate the legitimate sovereignty of Iraq by resuming \n     diplomatic relations, where appropriate, and reestablishing \n     embassies in Baghdad;\n       (9) assist the Government of Iraq in establishing active \n     working embassies in key capitals in the region;\n       (10) help the Government of Iraq reach a mutually \n     acceptable agreement on the future of Kirkuk;\n       (11) assist the Government of Iraq in achieving certain \n     security, political, and economic milestones, including \n     better performance on issues such as national reconciliation, \n     equitable distribution of oil revenues, and the dismantling \n     of militias;\n       (12) encourage the holding of a meeting or conference in \n     Baghdad, supported by the United States and the Government of \n     Iraq, of the Organization of the Islamic Conference or the \n     Arab League, both to assist the Government of Iraq in \n     promoting national reconciliation in Iraq and to reestablish \n     their diplomatic presence in Iraq;\n       (13) seek the creation of the Iraq International Support \n     Group to assist Iraq in ways the Government of Iraq would \n     desire, attempting to strengthen Iraq's sovereignty;\n       (14) engage directly with the Governments of Iran and Syria \n     in order to obtain their commitment to constructive policies \n     toward Iraq and other regional issues;\n       (15) provide additional political, economic, and military \n     support for Afghanistan including resources that might become \n     available as United States combat forces are redeployed from \n     Iraq;\n       (16) remain in contact with the Iraqi leadership, conveying \n     the clear message that there must be action by the Government \n     of Iraq to make substantial progress toward the achievement \n     of the milestones described in section 11, and conveying in \n     as much detail as possible the substance of these exchanges \n     in order to keep the American people, the Iraqi people, and \n     the people of countries in the region well informed of \n     progress in these areas;\n       (17) make clear the willingness of the United States \n     Government to continue training, assistance, and support for \n     Iraq's security forces, and to continue political, military, \n     and economic support for the Government of Iraq until Iraq \n     becomes more capable of governing, defending, and sustaining \n     itself;\n       (18) make clear that, should the Government of Iraq not \n     make substantial progress toward the achievement of the \n     milestones described in section 11, the United States shall \n     reduce its political, military, or economic support for the \n     Government of Iraq;\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\n       (19) make clear that the United States Government does not \n     seek to establish permanent military bases in Iraq;\n       (20) restate that the United States Government does not \n     seek to control the oil resources of Iraq;\n       (21) make active efforts to engage all parties in Iraq, \n     with the exception of al Qaeda;\n       (22) encourage dialogue between sectarian communities and \n     press religious leaders inside and outside of Iraq to speak \n     out on behalf of peace and reconciliation;\n       (23) support the presence of neutral international experts \n     as advisors to the Government of Iraq on the processes of \n     disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of militias \n     and other armed groups not under the control of the \n     Government of Iraq; and\n       (24) ensure that reconstruction efforts in Iraq consist of \n     great involvement by and with international partners that \n     actively participate in the design and construction of \n     projects.\n\n     SEC. 5.

REPORT ON POLICY IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n       Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, and every 90 days thereafter, the President shall \n     submit to Congress a report on the actions that have been \n     taken to implement the policies specified in sections 4 \n     through 11.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, back in December when the Iraq Study \nGroup first came out with its recommendations, the recommendations were \nheralded by many people around the country as a new way forward--a new \nway forward for us to deal with this very difficult and impractical \nproblem in which we find ourselves in Iraq. Those recommendations--some \nof which have been implemented and some of which have not--I believe \nstill create the centerpiece for how we can find a bipartisan way \nforward for how we deal with the Iraq issue.\n  I have walked around with the report of the Iraq Study Group for the \nlast 4 months. I am very much appreciative of the fact that the people \nwho put together the report were some of the best statesmen and women \nwe have in the United States of America: James A. Baker, Lee Hamilton, \nLawrence Eagleburger, Vernon Jordan, Ed Meese, Sandra Day O'Connor, \nLeon Panetta, William Perry, Charles Robb, and Alan Simpson. Those are \nsome of the best and brightest people we have in America and who are \nworking on one of the most difficult issues that confronts our country \ntoday. So it is in the vein of their work that I come to the floor \ntoday with my colleague from Tennessee to suggest that their \nrecommendations create the opportunity for us to provide the basis for \nsome agreement among Democrats and Republicans on how we might move \nforward in dealing with the very difficult national security issue we \nface in Iraq.\n  As we debate this issue here in Washington, with veto pens and \ndueling press conferences, I come back to the reality of our brave \nAmerican men and women and the dangers they face every day in the \nstreets of Baghdad and al Anbar Province and in countless other places \nin that Nation which today we find in turmoil. It is for them, for our \nmen and women in uniform, we must find common ground. It is for them we \nmust bridge our differences here on the Senate floor to create a path \nto success in Iraq. It is for them we must develop a policy that is \nworthy of their sacrifices and the sacrifices of their families.\n  I come to the floor today with my colleague from Tennessee to offer \nmy view on how we can reach our common goal and how we can work to heal \nthe deep divisions this war has caused here at home.\n  Not since the Vietnam war has the American public been so divided. I \nam concerned that the bitterness and the harshness of this debate is a \ndebate that clouds good judgment on one of the most fundamental issues \nwe deal with in the Congress: the issue of war and peace. It is \nimportant for us to remember that no matter how contentious this debate \nmay become, every Senator shares the same goal, and that goal is peace \nand stability in the Middle East and a safe return home of our troops. \nWhile we may disagree on the best path to that end, we must continue to \nwork together for a constructive change in our policy.\n  It is important to remember what binds us together as a nation is \nsomething we must honor so we will not be torn so far apart that we \ncannot bring our Nation back together. The Iraq Study Group report, I \nbelieve, embodies the best wisdom we have seen as to how we ought to \nmove forward with the issue of Iraq. I believe the work of the Iraq \nStudy Group is a model for how we can come together in good faith. The \ngroup, as I have said before, is comprised of some of the finest and \nbest public servants we have in America. They worked together for \nmonths and they did it in a nonpartisan, nonpolitical way. They are \nfrom both parties. That group and their work consulted over 250 \nofficials and experts, including senior leaders of the Government of \nIraq, the United States Government, and key coalition partners. They \nreceived advice from more than 50 distinguished scholars and experts in \na variety of fields.\n  I am honored, therefore, to join Senator Lamar Alexander in appealing \nto our colleagues in the Senate to take a fresh look at the group's \nreport and to consider how we can use it as our guide to create a \nsuccessful policy for the war in Iraq.\n  The group proposed a new diplomatic offensive--a new diplomatic \noffensive--to deal with the problems of Iraq and the region.\n  I am pleased that recently the administration has moved forward in \nembracing some of the recommendations set forth in that ``new \ndiplomatic offensive.''\n  The report provided a roadmap for transitioning our troops from a \ncombat role to the training, equipping, advising and support of the \nIraqi military.\n  The Iraq Study Group recommended how we can strengthen and restore \nour own military, which has been put under such strain by the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  In addition, the report details new policies for the Iraqi police and \ncriminal justice system, the Iraqi oil sector, and for improving \neconomic and security assistance programs in Iraq.\n  Finally, the Iraq Study Group recommended specific milestones for the \nGovernment of Iraq to meet. They include establishing a fair process \nfor amending the constitution, revising de-Baathification laws, \nensuring the equitable sharing of Iraqi oil revenues, holding free and \nfair provincial elections at the earliest possible date, and enacting \nlegislation to ensure the rights of women and the rights of all \nminority communities in Iraq.\n  The Iraq Study Group concluded that with the implementation of these \npolicies, all United States combat forces could be out of Iraq by the \nfirst quarter of 2008, except those necessary for protecting personnel \nand infrastructure, for training, equipping, and advising of Iraqi \nforces, for conducting targeted counterterrorism activities, and for \nengaging in rapid reaction and special operations.\n  Senator Alexander and I intend to propose legislation that will \neffectively embody this comprehensive set of recommendations.\n  Our bill would state the sense of the Congress that the Iraq Study \nGroup's recommendations should be implemented and that the President \nshould formulate a comprehensive plan to do so. It would require the \nestablishment of policies and plans that implement\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\nthe core recommendations of the group. And it states that the United \nStates should condition political, military, and economic support on \nthe Iraqi Government making substantial progress in meeting those \nmilestones detailed in the report.\n  The Iraq Study Group did not set a deadline for the redeployment of \nour troops, and neither would our bill. But the group did, and our bill \nwould, state the policies and actions that can and should lead to the \nsuccessful and rapid conclusion to this war.\n  I believe we all share that goal. I believe the distinguished members \nof the Iraq Study Group have given us the means to achieve it.\n  I don't believe the report of the Iraq Study Group should simply \nbecome another study on the shelf that gathers dust.\n  I will conclude with two remarks. First, here in Washington, DC, it \nseems there is a lot of poison in the air, and most issues are decided \non a partisan basis. It is my view, as a Senator from Colorado, that \nthe issues of war and peace, when we have our men and women in uniform \nin harm's way, should not be decided on the basis of Republicans versus \nDemocrats. No matter what has happened in Iraq up to this time, and no \nmatter what kind of finger-pointing will take place in terms of the \nwisdom or lack of wisdom on how the war has been prosecuted, the fact \nis, we are there now. Also, we have 140,000 men and women in harm's \nway.\n  For us in the Senate, I believe it is our responsibility to come \ntogether, as Democrats and Republicans, to fashion a new way forward to \nsuccess. I believe this new way forward to success has been laid out by \nthe Iraq Study Group, which didn't just look at this for an hour or a \nday or two but spent a year, under the authorization of the Congress, \nand they came up with what they thought was the best way for the United \nStates to move forward in Iraq.\n  I am hopeful both Democrats and Republicans will join Senator Lamar \nAlexander and myself as we move forward with the introduction of this \nlegislation, which we hope to do after the Memorial Day recess.\n  Finally, I think the working relationship Senator Alexander and I \nhave on so many issues, including land and water conservation and other \nareas, is the kind of bipartisan spirit we can bring to so many issues \nthat face us today. But of all the issues, the one that cries out the \nmost for unity today is the 800-pound gorilla issue of the war in Iraq.\n  I am very pleased and honored that Senator Alexander has joined us in \nthis effort today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I salute the Senator from Colorado for \nhis leadership, initiative, and patriotism, and the way he is \napproaching the foremost issue facing our country: Where do we go from \nhere in Iraq?\n  There is too much partisan game playing on the issue of Iraq. We owe \nit to our country and our troops to find a bipartisan consensus to \nsupport where we go from here. We need a political solution in \nWashington, DC, as much as we need one in Baghdad. We need to get out \nof the combat business in Iraq and into the support, training, and \nequipment business as soon as we honorably can.\n  That is why Senator Salazar and I have drafted legislation to \nimplement the recommendations of the bipartisan Baker-Hamilton Iraq \nStudy Group.\n  As the Senator said, we will introduce our legislation after Congress \nand the President have worked out the Iraq supplemental appropriations \nbill. We invite our colleagues--both Democrats and Republicans--to join \nus. We believe the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group offer the \nbest opportunity for a bipartisan consensus on a new course in Iraq.\n  In fact, these recommendations seem to already be guiding the \nPresident's efforts and the efforts of those on the other side who were \ncalling for change.\n  For example, the administration has begun to act on these \nrecommendations by increasing the number of troops embedded with Iraqi \nforces, using milestones to help chart progress, and by meeting with \nIraq's neighbors, including Iran and Syria. The President's national \nsecurity adviser has pointed to the Baker-Hamilton report as authority \nfor the surge of troops in Baghdad.\n  Just last week, the President himself told the Associated General \nContractors of America at their convention that he liked what Baker and \nHamilton had to say. ``It is something we should seriously consider. \nTheir idea was that, at some point in time, it makes sense to have a \nU.S. presence configured this way,'' the President said. ``It is an \ninteresting idea.''\n  At the same time, Democratic proposals in Congress have also been \nguided by the ISG report, for example, working on milestones for \nimprovement in Iraq, limiting the role of the United States to one of \ntraining, equipping, and counterterrorism operations, and stating as a \ngoal a drawdown of combat forces by March of next year.\n  In short, the seeds of bipartisan consensus about how the United \nStates should go forward in Iraq are best found in the Iraq Study Group \nreport.\n  Former Secretary of State Jim Baker and former Congressman Lee \nHamilton prefaced their report by saying this:\n\n       Success depends on the unity of the American people in a \n     time of political polarization. Americans can and must enjoy \n     the right of robust debate within a democracy. Yet, U.S. \n     foreign policy is doomed to failure--as is any course of \n     action in Iraq--if not supported by a broad, sustained \n     consensus. The aim of our report is to move our country \n     toward such a consensus.\n\n  Yesterday and today, I talked with Secretary Baker and Congressman \nHamilton. Each said the Salazar-Alexander legislation accurately \nreflects the recommendations of their report.\n  I have learned that sometimes a Senator has to say something two or \nthree or more times on the Senate floor before anybody pays much \nattention.\n  For example, on March 14, I said that it was time for the President \nto take the Iraq Study Group report down off the shelf and use it for \nsomething other than a bookend.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have my statement of that date printed in \nthe Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Today, I am making that same suggestion again, and I \nam going one step further. The Senator from Colorado and I are offering \nto our colleagues on both sides of the aisle--and to our country--a way \nto go forward on a bipartisan basis.\n  I was surprised and disappointed that the President didn't take \nadvantage of this opportunity during his State of the Union Address in \nJanuary. He knew then that a majority of Americans didn't support his \nstrategy. Fewer do today. He knew then his strategy cannot be long \nsustained without that support. That is still true today.\n\n  The President could have invited the distinguished members of the \nIraq Study Group to sit in the gallery during his speech and, as \nPresidents often do, introduced them, 10 of America's most \ndistinguished citizens from the Reagan, Carter, and George H.W. Bush \nadministrations, and the U.S. Supreme Court. One of these is now the \nSecretary of Defense. They are ideologically and politically diverse. \nThey spent nine months, met nine times, went to Baghdad, interviewed \n171 individuals, and made 79 recommendations. They are all in this \nbook. They didn't shy away from the unpleasant facts.\n  They told us 79 percent of Iraqis have a mostly negative view of U.S. \ninvolvement in their country. Then they said 2,900 American lives were \nlost, and another 21,000 wounded; $400 billion was spent, with \nestimates as high as $2 trillion for the final cost. They said this is \nnot a perfect option, but it is the best option.\n  The President could have said in January: This isn't my \nrecommendation, it is theirs, and I accept it for the good of our \ncountry, and I ask the American people to accept it.\n  That is not Presidential weakness, that is Presidential leadership. \nThe President's job is not only to see urgent issues and lay out a \nstrategy. It is the rest of his job--at least for a sustained military \nstrategy--to persuade half of the people he is right. It is not too \nlate.\n  The President has the option before him today, and we are trying to \nmake it easier for him. What we are respectfully saying in our \nlegislation is, if the President should choose to develop a\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\nway forward based upon the Iraq Study Group's recommendations, we will \nsupport that plan and we will encourage our colleagues and our country \nto do so on a bipartisan basis, so that Iraq, the Middle East, our \ntroops, and the world will know that in the United States we are \nunified in our purpose.\n  Such a plan will not satisfy everybody. It will not pull out our \ntroops tomorrow. It will not get us out of the combat business \nimmediately. It won't add 100,000 or 200,000, or 300,000 troops for \n``victory'' in Iraq. It will get us out of the combat business in Iraq \nand into the support, training, and equipping business, in a prompt and \nhonorable way. It will reduce the number of forces in Iraq. Because \nthere will still be a significant but limited military presence in \nIraq, it will signal to the rest of the Middle East to stay out of \nIraq. It will give support to General Petraeus and his troops, who are \nin the midst of a surge. It will expand diplomatic efforts to build \nsupport for Iraq national reconciliation and sovereignty. It will \nrecognize, as Prime Minister Blair said, it is time for the next \nchapter of Iraq's history to be written largely by the Iraqis \nthemselves.\n  As a Republican Senator, my message with respect to the President is \nthat I hope he and the White House seriously consider this.\n  We are not introducing this bill today. It will be introduced in 2 or \n3 weeks. Then, we hope other Senators will support it. I hope the \nPresident will embrace it. There is plenty within this report that \ngives him the opportunity to continue our mission in Iraq. The \ndifference is that this is not the President's report, and that is its \nadvantage. It has a better chance of success, in terms of developing \nbipartisan support here and in our country.\n  Finally, there are some issues that are simply too big for one party \nto solve. Iraq is, as the Senator from Colorado has said, the foremost \namong these.\n  Here we are, the oldest democracy, lecturing Baghdad, an infant \ndemocracy, for not coming up with a political solution, when we \nourselves cannot come up with one.\n  Until we do come up with one, we should spend less time lecturing \nBaghdad and more time working together to fashion a way forward on the \nforemost issue facing our country. Coming together in support of the \nplan based upon the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group offers that \nbest opportunity. We invite our colleagues to join us.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  President Bush Should Take the Iraq Study Group Report Down Off the \n                                 Shelf\n\n       My purpose today is to say that it is time for President \n     Bush to take the Iraq Study Group report down off the shelf \n     and use it for something other than a bookend.\n       There is a reason why we don't have 535 commanders-in-chief \n     or 100 commanding generals each saying charge down this \n     street or over that hill.\n       The founders of our country made the President Commander-\n     in-Chief and gave to Congress the power to declare war and to \n     pay for it.\n       That is why I will vote against any of the resolutions that \n     seek to micromanage this war. Once a war is authorized, as \n     this one was by a bi-partisan vote of 77-23 in 2002, it is \n     the president's job to manage the war.\n       As an example of why we don't need 535 Members of Congress \n     micromanaging this war, consider this: since last January, \n     the new Democratic majority has offered 17 different bills \n     and resolutions outlining what to do in Iraq. Undoubtedly \n     there will be more in the coming weeks.\n       And I am not about to cut off funds for General Petraeus' \n     troops in the middle of the current military exercise, which \n     congress clearly does have the power to do but should not do.\n       I do have the responsibility as a United States Senator, to \n     say what I believe is the right way forward for our country \n     in Iraq, and my belief is this: the President would be wise \n     to take down off the shelf the recommendations of the \n     bipartisan Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group, to develop a \n     strategy based upon those recommendations, and to ask \n     Americans to accept that strategy as the way forward in Iraq.\n       The President would have been wise to do this in January \n     during his State of the Union address. The country was then \n     looking for a new way forward in Iraq. The Iraq Study Group, \n     after nine months of careful, bipartisan work, offered such a \n     plan.\n       Instead, the day after the report was announced in \n     December, some who wanted another 100,000 or 200,000 troops \n     to ``win the war'' said the report was a ``recipe for \n     defeat.''\n       On the other side, those who wanted the U.S. out of Iraq \n     immediately dismissed the report as more of the same.\n       So the report was put on the shelf. Not much was heard \n     about it.\n       That is, until lately.\n       Lately, the President's national security adviser has cited \n     the Baker-Hamilton report as authority for the surge of \n     troops in Baghdad which, in fact, on page 73, the report did \n     say might be necessary.\n       Over the weekend, the United States participated in \n     meetings with Syria and Iran, perhaps the most controversial \n     recommendation in the report.\n       Now, the timetable and strategy for reducing U.S. combat \n     strength in Iraq contained in the newest Democratic senate \n     resolution sounds very much like the Iraq Study Group report, \n     calling for combat troops to be largely withdrawn from Iraq \n     by March of next year. But the Iraq Study Group specifically \n     opposed setting timetables or deadlines for withdrawal, \n     noting that its recommendation should be ``subject to \n     unexpected developments on the ground.''\n       At the same time, like one of the Republican-sponsored \n     resolutions, the Iraq Study Group recommended that the U.S. \n     work closely with Iraq's leaders to support the achievement \n     of specific ``milestones'' on national reconciliation, \n     security, and governance.\n       In short, if there is any bipartisan consensus emerging \n     about how the United States should go forward in Iraq, the \n     best blueprint of that consensus can be found in the Iraq \n     Study Group report.\n       The membership and process of the Iraq Study Group is as \n     important as the substance of what it said. It included 10 of \n     America's most distinguished citizens from the Reagan and \n     Carter and George H.W. Bush administrations, from the \n     Congress and from the Supreme Court. One of its former \n     members is now the Secretary of Defense. On its face, it was \n     ideologically as well as politically diverse. The group spent \n     nine months, met nine times, including a trip to Baghdad, and \n     interviewed 171 individuals in the U.S. and in Iraq. Its \n     report is comprehensive, with 79 specific recommendations.\n       Its assessment of the ``dire'' current conditions in Iraq \n     is honest and sobering. It did not shy away from reporting \n     unpleasant facts--that 79 percent of Iraqis have a mostly \n     negative view of the influence that the United States has in \n     their country, that 2,900 (at that time) Americans had lost \n     their lives and another 21,000 wounded, that we have spent \n     roughly $400 billion on the Iraq war and that estimates run \n     as high as $2 trillion for the final cost. The group \n     acknowledged that its recommendations were not perfect \n     options but seemed to be the best options.\n       As much as America needs a new strategy in Iraq, we also \n     need a consensus in support of that strategy. To put it \n     bluntly, a majority of the American people do not now have \n     confidence in the President's course in Iraq. The Iraq Study \n     Group offered the President an opportunity to say, ``Okay, \n     here is a different approach suggested by a bipartisan group \n     of distinguished Americans. It is not my strategy. It is \n     theirs. I accept it and, for the good of our country and the \n     armed forces fighting for us, I ask you to accept it.''\n       Such a statement would not exhibit presidential weakness. \n     This would be presidential leadership--recognizing that the \n     president's job is not only to choose the right strategy but \n     to successfully persuade at least half the people he is \n     right.\n       The president still has this option before him.\n       He would be wise to exercise it today--this week. Come back \n     to Congress. Report on the last few weeks' progress in Iraq. \n     Invite the Iraq Study Group members to sit in the gallery. \n     Compliment their work. Accept their recommendations. Ask the \n     Congress and the country also to accept their \n     recommendations.\n       This course will not satisfy those who want 100,000 more \n     troops for victory in Iraq.\n       Neither will it satisfy those who want all troops out on a \n     specific timetable.\n       But it will get U.S. troops quickly out of the combat \n     business in Iraq, and into the support business.\n       It will reduce the number of American forces in Iraq over \n     the next year.\n       It will leave American special forces in Iraq to go after \n     al Qaeda and troops to help guard the borders.\n       Because there will still be a limited U.S. military \n     presence, it will send a signal to the rest of the Middle \n     East to stay out of Iraq.\n       It will give support to General Petraeus and his troops who \n     are in the midst of a surge to make Baghdad safer.\n       It will expand diplomatic efforts to build support for \n     Iraqi national reconciliation and sovereignty, including with \n     Iraq's neighbors.\n       And it will begin to recognize that America has done most \n     of what it can do to help Iraq. As Prime Minister Blair has \n     said, it is time for the next chapters in Iraq's history to \n     be written by the Iraqis themselves.\n       Finally, this course will recognize that while the United \n     States can and should be a shining example of democracy and \n     does have the mightiest military force in the world, that a \n     conservative view of human nature and our own national \n     interest places limits on what we can do to make it possible \n     for others to adopt our democracy and our way of life.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we all know, time has been reserved for \nSenator Feingold for up to an hour. He\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\nsays he is going to take less time, but he has that time, at which time \nI will respond to him. What I wish to do is lock in some time for \nSenator Pryor immediately following my remarks so he may speak on the \nissue of Iraq.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for less \nthan 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have no objection to that request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis eloquence in his statement and his plea for Americans to come \ntogether as we move forward on the biggest issue that faces our country \ntoday, Iraq.\n  I appreciate the hard work he has put in, together with my staff and \nworking with the Iraq Study Group, to come up with language that is \nincluded in the legislation.\n  I also thank the chairperson of the Environment and Public Committee, \nSenator Boxer, for arranging for us to spend some time this morning \ndiscussing our bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Water Resources Development Act \nbeing considered today includes important language to reform the Corps \nof Engineers which I have long championed. I especially thank my \ncolleague Senator Boxer in particular, but also Senator Inhofe, Senator \nBaucus, and Senator Isakson for reporting a Water Resources Development \nAct that includes many important Corps of Engineers reforms that were \nso hard fought in last year's Congress, both in negotiations and on the \nfloor.\n  While we still have far to go in improving Corps planning, such as, \nfor example, passing the Feingold-McCain prioritization amendment, \nreform provisions in the underlying bill are absolutely essential for \nimproving the Nation's water resources planning, and they should be the \nbaseline for reforms that come out of Congress.\n  These reform provisions include independent peer review of costly or \ncontroversial Corps projects, dramatic improvement to the Corps' \nmitigation process, modernizing the Corps' woefully out-of-date \nplanning guidelines, establishing a new national policy that directs \nthe Corps to avoid impacts to floodplains, requiring an interagency \nassessment of the Nation's vulnerability to flood and related storm \ndamage, and recommendations to improve the Nation's various flood \nprevention programs.\n  These reforms are essential for improving the Corps' ability to \nproperly plan and construct projects. Over the past decade, dozens of \nstudies have highlighted stunning flaws in Corps project planning. \nProblems with the Corps project planning are so great that the GAO \nrecently told Congress that Corps projects ``did not provide a \nreasonable basis for decisionmaking because they were fraught with \nerrors, mistakes, and miscalculations, and used invalid assumptions and \noutdated data.''\n  We can no longer afford to build projects based on flawed \nengineering, flawed science, or flawed economics. These reforms are \nessential for preventing costly and potentially deadly mistakes, such \nas the levee failures that occurred in the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  The Corps, the American Society of Civil Engineers, and the National \nAcademy of Sciences have all said faulty design and construction by the \nCorps resulted in the levee failures. So these reforms are essential \nfor protecting the Nation's natural resources.\n  The Nation's rivers, streams, floodplains, and wetlands provide vital \nservices for all Americans. They help attenuate floods, they improve \nwater quality, they provide vital fish and wildlife habitat, and they \nprovide exceptional recreational opportunities. They are vital to the \nhealth, safety, welfare, and economic well-being of all of us.\n  I am very pleased Senators Boxer and Reid agreed to join me in a \ncolloquy with respect to the provisions in sections 2006, 2007 and \n2008(c) and (e) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007. We have \nreached an understanding that these are fundamental elements of \nmeaningful reform. Chairman Boxer has stated it is the committee's \nintent to retain these elements, and that she will strenuously support \nthem in conference.\n  I understand the Senate is now debating the motion to proceed to H.R. \n1495, the Water Resources Development Act. So at this point, while I \ncannot formally offer my prioritization amendment to that bill, I wish \nto take the time to speak in favor of it.\n  I will be offering this amendment to the Water Resources Development \nAct on behalf of myself and Senators McCain, Coburn, Carper, Gregg, and \nSununu. Senator McCain and I have worked together for years to \nmodernize the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and I am pleased to be \nworking with him again on this issue.\n  I also appreciate the strong support of Senators Coburn, Carper, \nGregg, and Sununu. This important amendment recognizes we must address \nour current flawed planning process and also respond to the tragedy of \nHurricane Katrina by working to make sure that limited taxpayers' \ndollars go to the most worthy water resource projects.\n  That doesn't seem like a lot to ask. As we all know, our Nation is \nstaring down deficits that only a few years ago were unimaginable. We \nalso have a backlog of $58 billion in Corps projects that are \nauthorized but not built, and that number will be closer to $70 billion \nwhen this bill passes.\n  Clearly, we have to get some kind of a way of identifying projects \nthat are most needed. Right now, Congress does not have any information \nabout the relative priority of the current massive backlog of \nauthorized projects, and we don't have any way of evaluating the \nrelative priority of new projects. What we do have is individual \nMembers arguing for projects in their States or district, but no \ninformation about which projects are most important to the country's \neconomic development or transportation systems or to our ability to \nprotect our citizens and property from natural disasters. Clearly, the \nstatus quo is not serving the public well.\n\n  This amendment would simply help Congress develop the tools to more \nwisely invest limited resources while also increasing public \ntransparency in decisionmaking. This amendment would do that by \ncreating a temporary bipartisan water resources commission to do two \nthings: one, make recommendations on a process for prioritizing Corps \nprojects and, two, analyze projects authorized in the last 10 years or \nthat are under construction and put similar types of projects into \ntiers that reflect their importance. This would be done with a clear \ndirection to seek balance, meeting the needs of all States.\n  My amendment would place Corps projects into three categories that \ncorrespond to the three main mission areas of the Corps: flood damage \nreduction, navigation, and ecosystem restoration. The commission will \nestablish broad national priorities to apply to those projects. The \namendment sets out minimum requirements that projects in each category \nhave to meet so that, for example, flood reduction projects must be \nevaluated in part on whether they reduce the risk of loss of life. But \nthe commission is free to consider other factors as long as it is clear \nwhich factors it is, in fact, considering. Projects in each of the \nthree project types will be placed in tiers based on how great a \npriority they represent.\n  This information will then simply be provided to Congress and the \npublic in a nonbinding report--a nonbinding report. That is it. The \nCongress and the public will get information to help them make \ndecisions involving millions and even billions of dollars. Surely, that \nisn't too much to ask. Don't we want the benefit of objective, \nimpartial advice when we decide how to allocate scarce taxpayers' \ndollars?\n  As my colleagues may recall, Senator McCain and I offered a \nprioritization amendment last Congress. This year's amendment has been \nrevised to address some of the concerns raised on the floor last year, \nin particular those raised by my friend and now-Chairman Boxer.\n  In response to criticism that the amendment gave too much authority \nto the administration, this year's new\n\n[[Page S5914]]\n\namendment creates a temporary commission comprised of eight non-Federal \nindividuals appointed by Senate and House leaders of both parties and \nthe President.\n  Also, instead of requiring regular updating of a prioritization \nreport, the bipartisan commission created by this year's new amendment \nwould only issue one nonbinding report that would include \nrecommendations for reevaluating priorities in the future and when new \nprojects are authorized.\n  I am pleased to have the support of a number of outside groups, \nincluding Taxpayers for Common Sense Action, the National Taxpayers \nUnion, the Citizens Against Government Waste, American Rivers, National \nWildlife Federation, Earth Justice, Clean Water Action, Defenders of \nWildlife, Environmental Defense, Friends of the Earth, the League of \nConservation Voters, Republicans for Environmental Protection, the \nSierra Club, and the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n  A number of editorial writers weighed in last year on behalf of \nprioritization. Here is what the New York Times had to say:\n\n       The Army Corps of Engineers must learn, or be compelled, to \n     place a higher priority on safety projects than on \n     Congressional pork . . . it would shine more light on an \n     often opaque process, a reform we support.\n\n  The New Orleans Times-Picayune said:\n\n       The best chance for changing the way the corps operates is \n     through reforms sought by Sens. John McCain and Russ \n     Feingold. They're offering two amendments to the water \n     resources bill. One would establish independent review of \n     corps projects from planning and design to construction. The \n     other would require corps projects to be ranked in importance \n     based on three national priorities: flood and storm damage \n     reduction, navigation and environmental restoration.\n\n  The Philadelphia Inquirer opined that ``with 50 States demanding \nservices, the Corps needs better direction than the whims of competing \npoliticians.''\n  And the Washington Post said:\n\n       Hurricane Katrina was a crisis that has created a real \n     opportunity: to bring some rationality to the way we spend \n     tens of billion of dollars on water projects in this country \n     so we can protect millions of Americans--\n\n  Millions of Americans--\n\n       whose lives are at risk.\n\n  Clearly, based on that mere series of endorsements and statements, \nthis amendment has broad interest and impact. The public clearly \nbelieves the Congress should do a better job spending billions of \ndollars on water projects. The Feingold-McCain-Coburn-Carper-Gregg-\nSununu prioritization amendment would help Congress in evaluating \noptions for how to prioritize Corps projects.\n  I also wish to remind my colleagues that modernizing all aspects of \nwater resources policy will help restore credibility to a Federal \nagency that is plagued by public skepticism in the wake of Hurricane \nKatrina. The Corps has admitted serious design flaws in the levees it \nbuilt in New Orleans, and it is clear the Corps' mistakes contributed \nsignificantly to the devastation in that city.\n  I can tell my colleagues when I was down in New Orleans last summer, \nI heard even more complaints about the Corps than I did about FEMA. As \nwe worked as a body to improve FEMA, we must also work to improve the \nCorps. Our constituents and the people of this country deserve no less.\n  Of course, the Corps does important work. The real problem this \namendment seeks to address is us in Congress. Congress has too long \nused the Army Corps of Engineers to facilitate favored porkbarrel \nprojects while periodically expressing a desire to change its ways. If \nwe want to change our ways, we can start by passing the Feingold-\nMcCain-Coburn-Carper-Gregg-Sununu prioritization amendment to help us \nmake sure the Corps continues to contribute to our safety, environment, \nand economy without wasting taxpayers' dollars.\n  I will conclude my initial remarks and again thank Senator Boxer and \nalso Senator Inhofe, Senator Baucus, and Senator Isakson for retaining \nthe reform provisions we worked so hard to get included in last year's \nSenate bill. However, this bill authorizes an additional $15 billion \nworth of projects which, coupled with an additional backlog of $58 \nbillion, would take 40 years to complete. I hope by adopting this \namendment we can also move this bill in a direction that will truly \nbenefit the American taxpayers. I urge my colleagues to support our \namendment.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feingold for his kind \nremarks. He and I are close colleagues. We have worked very closely \ntogether on so many issues. On Corps reform, we worked closely \ntogether, and working together we did get very important peer review \ninto the bill. I am very proud of his work on this bill and praise him \nfor it.\n  It is very rare we find ourselves on differing sides, but I am in \nstrong opposition to his amendment, and I want to lay out the reasons.\n  I describe the Senator's amendment as ``we have met the enemy and it \nis us.'' I reject the fact that Members of the Senate have to give us \ntheir judgment and their views on what is important in our own States \nto some politically appointed panel, probably politicians, because they \nwill be appointed by politicians. I have other objections to this \namendment because I think it creates a bias toward large projects. It \nreduces the ability of the Corps to pursue small ecosystem restoration \nprograms. It reduces their ability to pursue small but vital flood \ncontrol projects. It could preclude navigation projects that serve \nsmall communities, recreational interests, and subsistence \nfishermen. Because, as it is drafted, it sets up a tier system of \npriority recommendations, but each tier is limited to 5 billion \ndollars' worth of projects, or 100 total projects. That means a worthy \nflood control project in my State, or any State, could end up stuck in \na lower tier simply because it is more expensive, if equally more \nimportant projects in other States were ranked in a higher tier. I \nthink it is an arbitrary system that can label a project second tier \ndespite critical local public safety needs.\n\n  How does a project become second tier if it is the only way to \nprotect a community? Such an arbitrary label will inappropriately \nundermine an important project's chances of receiving appropriations, \nand I believe people's lives could be in jeopardy because of it. I \ndon't think that is the kind of prioritization we need when we have to \nfight tooth and nail every year to get critical funding for very \nimportant and needy flood control projects.\n  The Senator named a lot of groups I support and that support me, and \nI respect that fact. But to be candid, a lot of these groups don't like \nwater projects in general, and I think sometimes they will just say: \nFine. Anything to slow down these projects.\n  I believe Congress, not political appointees or a commissioner, \nshould retain this responsibility. I understand the legislation has \nbeen changed to an advisory situation, but it only slows us down. It \nslows us down with political appointees, and I have a basic problem \nwith that. It is adding layers of delay. We have already delayed this \nbill 7 long years. We need it, Mr. President. We need it.\n  We need it because the farmers say we need it and the corn growers \nsay we need it and the labor unions say we need it and the chambers of \ncommerce say we need it and we have colleagues supporting it--from \nSenator Inhofe to Senator Boxer. If my colleagues don't think that is \nsomething to point to, it is. It means things are working around here.\n  My colleague and friend, Senator Feingold, is a strong supporter of \nfiscal responsibility. We took this bill down from $33 billion to a \nscore of $13.9 billion. How did we do it? We were careful. We did \nscrutinize these projects. And, by the way, we have standards built \ninto this bill. I want my colleague to understand--and it is very \nimportant because this is kind of a trash-the-Senate amendment, taking \naway, casting doubt on our judgment--that we worked hard by setting up \nthese objective criteria by which I have had to, frankly, turn against \nmy own Members and say: You know I can't take care of that for you \nbecause it doesn't fit the criteria.\n  So I think there is a sense of fiscal responsibility that is \npermeating this place. We took a bill from $33 billion down to $13 \nbillion--$13.9 billion to be exact--and we did it without some \nappointed people telling us what to do.\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\nWe did it because we care about fiscal responsibility and we care about \nkeeping this economy moving, and I just don't think we need this \ncommission. We went through an exhaustive process to determine which \nprojects and studies would be authorized. They have to have chief of \nengineers or other completed Corps reports for construction. They have \nto meet a benefit-cost test, or have environmental benefits. So I think \nwe have a lot of built-in safety features as we go through this \nprocess.\n  We have a very broad committee that has different ideologies. We \nrepresent broad areas of the country. Frankly, I think we all want to \nprotect Americans. We have seen what happens when we look at Katrina, \nso we want to do our best.\n  I laud my colleague for his absolute commitment and dedication to \nfinding ways to make this process work better, but I say this bill \nproves, in my opinion, that we are listening.\n  We did incorporate the fine Corps language that my friend worked on \nso hard, and he knows how strongly I feel about this particular \namendment. But he insists on it because, in his heart, he thinks it is \nimportant. I know he has some things he will say now about my comments, \nso I will yield to him with the understanding that I will be able to \nrespond in due course.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the chair of the committee. Of \ncourse, I have enjoyed working with her on so many issues, and I again \ncompliment her for retaining key reforms in the underlying bill. She \nhas provided a great deal of leadership on Corps reform, and for that I \nam truly appreciative.\n  In the past, the chairman has offered to work together on the issue \nof prioritization in the future, and I hope that is still something in \nwhich she is interested. I don't think we should wait to enact \ncommonsense reform. This is not a new idea I just thought of; rather, \nit is a critical reform that many of my colleagues and I have been \ncalling for since 2002. In fact, it was the former Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Smith, who first called for prioritizing Corps projects. \nI cosponsored Senator Smith's Corps bill in the 107th Congress, along \nwith Senators McCain, Ensign, and Daschle.\n  I certainly commend Senators Boxer, Inhofe, Baucus, and Isakson for \nlimiting the number of additional projects added to this bill. I \nrecognize some of the efforts they have made with regard to fiscal \nresponsibility in the committee process, and I commend them for that. I \nalso commend them for their effort to move this bill quickly. However, \nthe desire to move a bill quickly should not override the need to \nensure that Congress enacts the full suite of reforms necessary to \nrespond to over a decade of evidence calling for reforms.\n  I strongly believe prioritization is one of these key pieces, which \nis why I am offering an amendment during consideration of WRDA on \nbehalf of this group of Senators. We need to get these ideas on the \ntable, and I think my colleagues agree a report, with recommendations \nto Congress, is a good, commonsense approach.\n\n  I was interested in the Senator's remark that we have met the enemy \nand it is us. I think that is not the case unless we are foolish enough \nnot to back up our decisions and our judgment with the benefit of \npeople who know what they are taking about. The Senator from California \nsays these are political appointees, but, in fact, these folks have to \nbe water resource experts. That is who we will put together on this \ngroup to take a look at these 70 billion dollars' worth of projects.\n  Of course, despite the way in which the Senator described the impact \nof this report, all this does is set priorities. This is not mandatory \nin any way. It is nonbinding. It is simply a report that gives us \ninformation. Yes, it ranks things in different tiers, but we still have \nthe power--and, of course, we fully retain the power--to change those \npriorities if, in our judgment, we believe it is the right thing to do.\n  We do that all the time. There are all kinds of government reports \nthat tell us to do X or Y and, in our judgment and our responsibility \nas Members of Congress, we exercise our own independent judgment. Not \nto have the benefit of these experts saying these projects are more \nimportant than others--I can't understand the downside of that. In \nfact, when the Senator says this somehow casts doubt on the Senate, or \ntrashes the Senate, I think it is just the opposite. It will make us \nlook good if, for once, it looks as if we are basing our priorities on \nsomething other than pure political pull.\n  When we were out here together, the Senator from California and I \nwere arm in arm, literally, on ethics reform and lobbying reform, and \nsome said that was trashing the Senate. Some said that was somehow \nsaying we weren't capable of regulating ourselves; that somehow we \ndidn't need these laws and we should be trusted. Well, this is an area \njust like the ethnics and lobbying reform, where people have concerns. \nAnything we can do to enhance our credibility, anything we can do to \nsay, hey, look, we didn't agree with every part of this report, but in \nlarge part we agree with these priorities, I think strengthens our \nhand. I think it enhances the reputation of the Senate, particularly in \nthe eyes of the taxpayer who now see that, after this bill, we are \ntalking about $70 billion in projects.\n  I think this is a win-win proposition. Of course, I respect the \nchair's disagreement on this particular point. I know she agrees with \nreform in almost every single context. She just doesn't see this \nparticular reform. But I urge her, once again, to consider the fact \nthis is nonbinding, informational. I don't think it is binding in any \nway that would cause a problem for the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want the Senator to know he can have as \nmuch time as he wants. As he knows, I am not rushing the bill in terms \nof hearing from people. As a matter of fact, I thank him for coming \ntoday because we don't see anybody else talking about their amendments, \nand we do want to get this bill done.\n  I will use this as another opportunity to call on my colleagues, who \nmay well support the Senator's amendment or oppose it or have other \namendments, to please join us on the Senate floor. It is very pleasant \nhere. It gets you away from other debates that are a little harder in \nmany ways. So I urge my colleagues to come down, show us your \namendments, please. We want to get this moving. We are going to be here \ntoday, we could be here tomorrow, we could be here Monday debating \namendments and, hopefully, disposing of this bill on Tuesday.\n  Did my colleague want to respond?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I just wanted to ask that the time be \nreserved on my side so that, should other Senators want to talk on \nthis, they could. But I am prepared, if the Senator is, to move on at \nthis point.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. I would like to say to anybody wishing to \nspeak on the Feingold amendment, please, I will make sure you get \nadequate time.\n  I also want to say to my friend, as he leaves, because he has asked \nme to think about it, that I am going to ask him to think about it \nalso. I want him to think about this: there are so many checks and \nbalances on this WRDA bill. I want to go through a couple for him, just \nso that maybe he doesn't believe we are without checks and balances.\n  First of all, we have the local people who decide what it is they \nneed and want to protect their communities. We have the State people, \nwho come in and have to issue a water quality certificate. So they are \ninvolved in it. We have the Corps that has to do the study based on a \ncost-benefit analysis and other issues. There are matching funds in \nevery case--almost every case. So we have a big check there, if a local \ncommunity is willing to put up the money. So that is matching funds.\n  There is the executive branch that comes in. The executive branch \ncomes in and they decide what they want to fund. We have the \nAppropriations Committee, after the authorizers get done with it, \ndeciding what they want to fund. And we have every one of us Senators \nstanding for reelection at some point who have to face up and say, we \nfought for this particular project.\n  Also, I thank my colleague for something right now on ethics reform, \nand I want him to know something which he may not know. As a result of \nall his work on ethics reform, and so many other colleagues here and \nour leader and the rest, even though the ethics reform isn't law yet--\nwe hope it will soon be--the committee decided to act as if\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\nit were law. We asked every Senator to put in writing the fact that \nthey did or did not have any real or perceived conflict of interest \nthat went along with their requests for these particular projects. \nThose letters are available for everyone to see in the office. We have \nalso printed in the Record, in large type--because at first it came out \nin small type--what each of us has asked for. So I want to thank my \ncolleague for that. I want my colleague to understand that this bill is \nnot only half the size that it was last year, not only is it a couple \nof billion less than the House, not only did we follow the ethics \nproposal, which isn't law yet because we want people to feel good about \nthis, but we have done all these things. And, of course, I have \nincluded my friend's ethics Corps reform from last year.\n\n  So even though we do have strong disagreement, and I don't want to \nsugarcoat it because it is pretty strong--we disagree on this--there is \nso much progress that has been made, and my friend is responsible for a \nlot of that, and I feel really good about that. I hope he doesn't take \nmy opposition to this particular amendment, my strong opposition to it, \nin any way as diminishing the amazing work he has done so that this \nbill comes to us in a form that, really, I think we can all be proud \nof.\n  I thank my colleague very much for coming. And, of course, the record \nis open and the floor is open to all colleagues who want to speak, pro \nor con, on this particular amendment or any other amendment that people \nwould like to offer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the Senate substitute \nfor H.R. 1495, which I hope we will be getting to, the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act. This legislation has been delayed for many years. I \nthank Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe for bringing together a bill \nthat is critically important to our future in regard to water \ninfrastructure improvement and the ecosystem's restoration. I think \nthis legislation is carefully balanced, it is responsible as far as its \nbudget, but it is very important for us to move forward and consider \nthis legislation and move it to, I hope, enactment and signature by the \nPresident.\n  The bill contains a number of provisions that are vital to Maryland, \nwhich relies heavily upon the Army Corps of Engineers for water \nresource programs. The bill contains an important project that protects \nCumberland, MD, and Ridgeley, WV, against flooding. Like so many other \nprojects contained in this bill, the Cumberland effort will have \nmultiple benefits. In addition to the increased public safety that \ncomes from flood control, this project will serve as an essential \ncomponent of the restoration efforts underway in Cumberland, including \nthe rewatering of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the reconstruction \nof the turning basin there.\n  For the first time, the Army Corps will supplement the Environmental \nProtection Agency's efforts to repair and improve the wastewater \ntreatment facility plants that benefit the Chesapeake Bay. The Corps \nwill be able to support sewage treatment upgrades, such as the one at \nBlue Plains. That plant is the largest advanced treatment facility in \nAmerica, serving customers in the District of Columbia, northern \nVirginia, and the Maryland jurisdictions of Prince George's County and \nMontgomery County.\n  The new EPA permit for Blue Plains requires that the nitrogen load \nfrom the plant be reduced by more than 4 million pounds annually. This \nbill will be the largest single nutrient-reduction project in the bay \nwatershed in a decade. Slashing the nitrogen load to the bay is a key \nstep in the Chesapeake restoration efforts, and this bill will help get \nit done. It takes the participation of the Federal Government in the \nChesapeake Bay restoration to a new level. By allowing the Corps of \nEngineers to help us with the tremendous backlog of sewage treatment \nplant repairs and improvements, this bill takes us to a much stronger \npartnership in the Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts.\n  We have a geography and topography which make the Chesapeake Bay \nparticularly susceptible to erosion. The bay shoreline and many of its \nhistoric islands are literally being washed away. The erosion \ncontributes millions of cubic yards of sediment annually to the bay, \nadversely affecting water quality and clogging navigational channels.\n  The bill extends the authorization of the 50-foot dredging of the \nBaltimore harbor and its channels. This project has been vital to the \neconomic strength of the Port of Baltimore.\n  The bill contains authorization for two important island \nenvironmental restoration efforts. Tiny Smith Island in Somerset County \nhas lost over 3,300 acres of wetlands over the past 150 years, \nthreatening the population that lives there and degrading the \nChesapeake Bay in the process. The project authorized in this bill \nconsists of constructing 2 miles of offshore sediment breakwaters to \nprovide protection to over 2,100 acres of wetlands and underwater grass \nbeds.\n  I am particularly pleased the bill we are considering now contains \nfunding for the Poplar Island project. This is a model project. We have \nbeen able to restore an island that had been almost washed away. There \nused to be a hunting lodge there. People would use the island. It had \neroded almost to being nonexistent. What we have been able to do at \nPoplar Island is have a site where we could take the dredge materials \nfrom the dredging of the harbor, put it on the island, restore the \nisland from an environmental point of view, and it has been a win-win \nprocess.\n  The Port of Baltimore is one of the largest ports on the east coast \nand a vital engine of economic activity, contributing $2 billion to the \nState economy and employing 18,000 Marylanders directly and tens of \nthousands more indirectly. There are approximately 15 miles of channel \nleading to the Port of Baltimore. Each year, approximately 4 to 5 \nmillion cubic yards of material must be removed from the channels to \nkeep them at the existing depth and width. Poplar Island allows us to \ncomply with that dredging need.\n  We have been able to take the dredged materials and put them onto \nPoplar Island. It was once a home to residents and hunting lodges. \nSince the project's authorization in 1996, the Corps has restored over \n1,100 acres of remote island habitat. Popular Island has risen again, \nPhoenix-like, from the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. Eight miles of \ndikes protect the island from severe wave action. There are over 570 \nacres of upland habitat at an elevation that sometimes exceeds 20 feet. \nAn additional 570 acres of wetland habitat has been created.\n  Today, even as the project continues, the island is once again home \nto migratory shorebirds, mammals, reptiles, and even serves as a \nnesting area for Maryland's famous terrapins. The expansion of the \nproject authorized in this bill will build upon this success. It will \nadd an additional 575 acres, half uplands and half wetlands, to the \nrestored island.\n  The Nation has become increasingly aware of the important role \nwetlands and barrier islands play. We all witnessed the increased \ndevastation that struck the coast of Louisiana, due in part to loss of \nwhat I like to refer to as nature's speed bumps, the wetlands and \ncoastal islands that help absorb the shock from these horrific storms.\n  The Poplar Island expansion project authorized in this bill is \nimportant to the Port of Baltimore and to the ecology of the Chesapeake \nBay. It is also a model for the Nation, showing us how the Army Corps \nprojects can be engines of economic success, while at the same time \nserving beneficial ecological functions.\n  This vital project points the way to the future of the Army Corps of \nEngineers. It is one of the main reasons I support this legislation. \nThis is a well-balanced bill. It is a bill that, yes, will help \nMaryland, but also help Maryland with projects which I think are \nimportant to show the Nation what you can do in moving forward on the \neconomic needs of our communities, such as the dredging of our ports, \nbut also moving forward on the environmental issues such as restoring \nvital wetlands and islands that would have disappeared.\n\n[[Page S5917]]\n\n  It is important as far as dealing with storm damage. It is important \nto the restoration of our wildlife. It is important in so many \ndifferent areas. I urge us to move forward with this legislation. Let's \nmove it forward to consider the amendments, let's get it done, let's \ntake it to the other body, and let's get it to the President as soon as \npossible. It has been delayed for years, we all know that. Thanks to \nthe hard work of our leadership on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, we have been able now to come forward with a bill that I \nthink has the best chance for enactment. I urge my colleagues to \ncarefully consider this legislation, support this legislation, but, \nmore importantly, let's get it moving.\n  It is well past time that we enact the WRDA bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill.) The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I want to speak on the bill, \nand I wanted to congratulate Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe for their \ncombined leadership, their working together to bring this legislation \nto the floor. It has been a long time coming. We passed it here last \nyear thanks to the leadership of both of them. Senator Inhofe was \nchairman. Now Senator Boxer is the Chair.\n  It is now time for us to pass it again. It has only been 7 years \nsince we have had a Water Resources and Development Act. We desperately \nneed it for all of these water projects across the country that need to \nbe authorized.\n  Of course, one of the ones I want to speak to not only affects our \nState of Florida, the Everglades restoration, but it clearly affects a \nlot of the ecosystems of planet Earth. We violated Mother Nature over \nthe course of the last half century. As a result of massive hurricanes \nin the early part of the last century, particularly the hurricane of \n1928 that killed over 2,000 people in the Lake Okeechobee region--many \nof them drowned--the emphasis back then was, when the floods came: Get \nthe water off.\n  So over the course of the years, through then, up through the mid-\n1900s, you had all of this diking and draining that went on, to the \npoint at which the mindset was: Get the water away when the floods \ncome.\n  But, of course, what everybody was ignoring was Mother Nature and \nwhat she had created in this incredible system that starts south of \nOrlando in the center part of the State, and starts meandering water \nsouth into the Kissimmee River, meandering through its oxbows where all \nof the marsh grasses were cleansing the water, and then it reaches the \nbig lake, Lake Okeechobee, which then Mother Nature had the water \nabsolutely proceed south through very rich muck lands, in a slow sheet \nflow that flowed into what we now know as the Everglades.\n  Ultimately that water then flowed on out, in through the southwest \npart of Florida, and in the south part of Florida, into what is known \nas Florida Bay, which is that area south of the tip of the peninsula of \nFlorida and inside the bow created by the Florida Keys.\n  What mankind did was disrupt that natural flow of the water. As a \nresult, when the floods came: Get the water off. So we were now sending \nfresh water into tidewater in these very delicate brackish water \nsituations that were so important to wildlife and marine life, and \nmaking it much too much fresh water, not brackish water, as a result, \nalso dumping water that contained excessive nutrients, so that as this \nwater flowed out, the tidewater in places like the Loxahatchee River \nand to the east the St. Lucie River, you suddenly have these rivers \nthat had way too much fresh water and way too many nutrients.\n  What you got was the growing of algae, the sucking out of the oxygen, \nand creating nearly dead rivers. Everybody got concerned about this \nalong about the 1980s and into the 1990s. The legislature and the \nFederal Government started realizing we have to go back and redo \nthings. The problem was, it was a lot different then in Florida than \nwhat Mother Nature first had created, because now there was a huge \nagricultural industry just to the south of Lake Okeechobee on all of \nthat rich muck land, and now there were 6 million people living in \nSouth Florida who had to have a source of water.\n  So that is what was developed, the Comprehensive Everglades \nRestoration Project. It is a project that will span over 20 years, and \nit is a project that needs funding, half from the Federal Government \nand half from the State Government and its entities, including the \nwater management district, the local governments, and so forth. That \nhalf and half is how we are ultimately going to be able to restore the \nEverglades and still provide water for the agriculture industry as well \nas the 6 million people who live there.\n  Now, I must say, it is pretty tough right now because we have a \ndrought. It simply has not rained. Back in 2005, with Florida smarting \nfrom the four hurricanes in 2004, hurricanes that filled up the lake to \nthe point of being concerned about breaching the dike and killing a lot \nof people from flooding, in anticipation of a 2005 very active \nhurricane season, they lowered the lake. Well, 2005 ended up not being, \nfor Florida, an active hurricane year. Therefore, the rains were not \nthere, and that started reducing the lake more to the point at which \nLake Okeechobee is 5 feet down from what is its normal average.\n  When you combine that with the drought that is occurring now, then \nyou have a real problem. That is why all of the local governments in \nsouth Florida have gone to a restriction on water use, which includes \nnow once-a-week watering of lawns. You see the problem.\n  There is a problem in some of the well fields in south Florida. If \nthey do not replenish them with fresh water, you are going to have \nsaltwater intrusion from the Atlantic Ocean. Of course, the Corps of \nArmy Engineers is working on that right now.\n  That is all the background, which is why this WRDA bill is all the \nmore important for us, because there are several projects that will \naddress this issue of Everglades restoration we have been trying to get \nauthorized since the last authorization bill 7 years ago.\n  One of them is what is called the Indian River Lagoon, and it is that \npart on the east coast of Florida, the St. Lucie River estuary, where \ninstead of dumping all of that fresh water, all of that nutrient-laden \nwater, you are going to be able to cleanse that water through various \nCorps projects back closer over to Lake Okeechobee in the center of the \nState.\n  Another project in here is called the Picayune Strand. It is a \nproject over on the southwest coast, which is going to help restore the \nflow of water going into the Ten Thousand Islands. It is going to \nrestore 72,000 acres of habitat and ecological connections that will \ndirectly affect the Florida Panthers National Wildlife Refuge, the \nBelle Meade State Conservation and Recreation Lands Project Area, and \nthe Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve.\n  With all of this, it is so important that we pass this bill and we \nget a conference agreement with the House of Representatives so we can \nget this bill to the President for signature.\n  Now, I have spoken of a couple affecting Florida. There are several \nmore projects in here, but I have picked the two biggest ones that are \ncritical for the environmental sensitivities, and a major ecological \nasset for planet Earth. And it is that. It does not just affect \nFlorida, it affects the entire planet. It is like the Amazon River. \nThat certainly just does not affect Brazil; that has global climate \neffects.\n  I want to thank again the leadership for having brought out this \nbill. It cannot be soon enough for us to get it passed and to get a \nconference agreement with the House and to get it signed into law. Then \nwe can start fleshing this out with the appropriations bills to fund \nthese specific water projects.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe remainder of the hour allocated to me in debate postcloture and \nwhich I have not used be allocated to Senator Boxer, the manager of the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5918]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in the days ahead, this Congress and \nthe President of the United States face a choice on the critical \nquestion of funding our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is a \nchoice between brinksmanship and statesmanship, a choice between \ncontinuing to stalemate, largely along partisan lines, or uniting \nacross partisan lines in support of our troops.\n  We all know what our most important responsibility is. Our forces in \nIraq and Afghanistan are looking to us. They need the funding that only \nwe in Congress can provide them. The money is running out.\n  I understand that many in this Chamber saw the supplemental \nappropriations bill as an opportunity to force a withdrawal of our \ntroops from Iraq and that many of us argued vigorously against the \namendments that attempted to do that. Each side has now had an \nopportunity to make its case. The result is clear: There are not enough \nvotes in Congress to enact a mandatory date for withdrawal of American \nforces from Iraq. The time for having debates, therefore, and sending \nmessages on this troop funding bill should be over. It is now time to \nget our troops the equipment, the training, the supplies they need--and \nwithout delay. We in this Chamber have a responsibility to make certain \nthat no matter what disagreements and differences we have here in \nWashington, our men and women in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan are \nnot caught in the political crossfire.\n  Only a couple months ago, this Senate confirmed the new commander to \nimplement a new strategy in Iraq, GEN David Petraeus. That new strategy \nis now being implemented, and it is achieving some encouraging, if \nearly, signs of success. Indeed, progress has been won, even though the \nfull complement of troops has not yet arrived in Iraq. Yet now many in \nCongress would pull the plug on this new strategy and thwart the work \nof our troops before they are given a fair chance to succeed.\n  I am aware public opinion has turned against the war in Iraq. The \nAmerican people are deeply frustrated by the multiplicity of mistakes \nand errors that have been made. Progress has been too slow. The \nsavagery of our enemy, which the American people witness on television \nevery night, has been demoralizing. Many simply want to leave and wash \nour hands of what they perceive as a mess--a deadly mess. But \nleadership requires sometimes that we defy public opinion if that is \nwhat is necessary to do what is right for our country. In fact, at a \ntime such as this, we are required to do what each of us believes is \nright, and that might not be what is popular.\n  What is right, I firmly believe, is that we cannot allow our Nation \nto be defeated in Iraq by the same terrorist enemy with which we are \nnow engaged in worldwide conflict. The global war on terrorism which we \nare waging is a worldwide struggle against a barbaric totalitarian foe \nthat is al-Qaida. And today, it is al-Qaida that we are fighting in \nIraq. Al-Qaida itself has declared Iraq to be the central front of \ntheir larger war against our way of life.\n  So all of us who are privileged to serve this great country in \npositions of leadership have a very serious choice to make. Our \njudgment can be guided by the public opinion polls, and we can withdraw \nin defeat. We can rationalize our action with reassuring but, I \nbelieve, falsely hopeful words such as ``redeployment.'' No matter what \nwe say, our enemy will know that America's will has been broken by the \nbarbarity of their blood lust, the very barbarity we declare we are \nfighting but from which we would actually be running.\n\n  My main point is this: Now is not the time for delay, for prolonged \nlegislative posturing and bargaining over this supplemental \nappropriations bill. It is the time to do our duty, to fund our troops, \nstand by our allies, and do everything we can to help them win the war \nagainst al-Qaida in Iraq, rather than inventing new ways to vent our \nfrustration with the war in Iraq or with the President of the United \nStates, by handcuffing General Petraeus and undermining his strategy. \nLet us give him and his troops our support as they and their Iraqi \nallies fight to win for us.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nWater Resources Development Act of 2007. I first congratulate the new \nchairman of the committee, Senator Boxer, for taking her first bill to \nthe floor. She is doing a great job. It is out of committee virtually \nunanimously. She brought out a bill that was worked out in advance and \nshe is doing a terrific job. I highly commend her.\n  Benjamin Franklin once wrote:\n\n       When the well is dry, we know the worth of water.\n\n  Westerners, including the current occupant of the chair, have learned \nthis painful lesson many times. Recently, several years of drought have \nplagued farmers and ranchers across my State of Montana and many other \nparts of the country. Weatherworn switch grass and crops bring a \nterrible cost to producers in the West.\n  The West's battle with drought highlights the pressing need to ensure \nour water resources are used efficiently. I remind my colleagues, it \ndoesn't rain a lot in the West. The annual rainfall west of the 100th \nmeridian, down from Minnesota and across the country, is much less than \nin the eastern part of the country. In Montana, the average \nprecipitation--rain, snow, all of it--in our towns is roughly about 13 \ninches a year. In Washington, DC, it is about 44 inches a year. That is \na big difference, and that is in ordinary years. We have had a lot of \ndrought in the West in the last several years.\n  Therefore, this Water Resources Development Act is long overdue. \nAlthough the Senate passed this legislation last year, the conference \nwith the House fell short of resolution, so we are here today to get \nthis bill over the goal line. I think we will finally get there. The \nbill provides authority for the Corps of Engineers to move forward on \nmany long overdue water resources projects.\n  In 1986, Congress enacted the Water Resources Development Act, or \nWRDA. Every 2 years since then, Congress received proposals from the \nadministration seeking authorization for water resources projects--\nevery 2 years, since 1986. Why? It is clearly because there are new \nneeds every 2 years. This pattern of requests provided the Corps and \nlocal sponsors with a regular planning schedule, helped them know what \nwas on the drawing boards, which projects would be developed first and \nsecond, with some regularity, the planning for the development of \nneeded resource projects in our country.\n  This administration, however, has yet to request one update of this \nlegislation. Why is that? Well, I ask the question: Have all the water \nresources needs of the country been met? Clearly, the answer is no. \nScores of water resources projects are awaiting authorization.\n  Second, does this administration think this legislation costs too \nmuch? Perhaps, but remember, investing in our water resources \ninfrastructure is a cost we cannot put off. This is not an annual \nrecurring operating expense; it is an investment that pays huge \ndividends.\n  Levees are crumbling. People are living in harm's way, waiting for \nthis legislation to help provide them with protection. This bill \nauthorizes projects that will provide needed flood and storm damage \nprotection, navigation improvements and environmental restoration. All \nthree are very important.\n\n[[Page S5919]]\n\nThere is authority for rebuilding and restoring the coast of Louisiana \ngenerally, but this legislation provides specific authority for that \nrebuilding and restoration, devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n  Authority for modernizing the lock and dam system on the Mississippi \nRiver is contained in here, and authority for ecosystem restoration \nprojects, all the way from New Jersey, to Florida, to Colorado. There \nis a lot in this legislation.\n  The Corps of Engineers is charged with the management of America's \nwater resources. The Corps of Engineers built levees and floats barges. \nIn my State of Montana, we see the Corps as restorers of the ecosystem. \nWe see the Corps as guardians of America's recreational assets, such as \nthe Missouri River, Yellowstone River, and the Fort Peck Reservoir.\n  We in Montana have 11,000 miles of blue ribbon trout streams. Montana \nis home to the mighty Missouri River and the beautiful Yellowstone \nRiver. The Yellowstone is the longest remaining free-flowing river in \nour country. Montana's Fort Peck Reservoir provides outstanding \nrecreation for the eastern part of my State. There is a huge fishing \ntournament in the Fort Peck Reservoir. The Corps helps make that \nhappen.\n  We value the Corps' expertise and their partnership in many of our \nwater resources projects. I might name several projects that are \nimportant and will continue that tradition in Montana: the Yellowstone \nRiver and Tributaries Recovery project; the lower Yellowstone project \nat Intake, MT; the Missouri River and Tributaries Recovery project; the \nupper basin of the Missouri River project. These projects will all \nprovide improvements and provide valuable protection for the valuable \nresources in our State and, with all the tourism coming to our States, \nfor a lot of Americans as well.\n  There is also an important authorization for the rehabilitation and \nimprovement of a very important large aging water project on the \nBlackfeet Reservation in Glacier County called St. Mary Diversion. This \nsystem is rusting, cracking, and crumbling before our eyes. It is \ndeteriorating, and 17,000 Montanans on the highline--the northern part \nof the State--depend on this system. It is a Federal system, but it is \nfalling apart.\n  Without St. Mary, the lower Milk River would go dry 6 out of every 10 \nyears, imperiling the water source for thousands of Montana families. \nThis is irrigation and also drinking water. I cannot believe that in \nthe United States we don't have good drinking water in large parts of \nmy State. That is an outrage.\n  These important water projects, and their importance to the \ncommunities the projects serve, underline the need to move this \nlegislation forward. Our first priority, therefore, is to authorize the \nlong overdue projects in the WRDA bill this year. I hope we can get the \nadministration's support to do that this year. We passed a bill last \nyear. Let's get it enacted this year. Let's do our part to ensure that \nour water resources needs are met and let's get back to the biennial \npractice of enacting a water development resources bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise following my good \nfriend from Montana, with whom I served last year as the subcommittee \nleaders of the Environment and Public Works Committee. We worked in a \nbipartisan way, and I appreciate that working relationship this year \nagain. The EPW has worked on a bipartisan basis on this very important \nbill, and we have shown it by the number of people who signed letters \nasking that they move the bill. We have seen it in the vote on cloture. \nI thank the leadership in this body, particularly Chairman Boxer and \nRanking Member Inhofe.\n  This bill before us today and next week, the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act, or WRDA, is long overdue and badly needed. As has \nalready been said, it authorizes projects under the jurisdiction----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I confirm a point made by our good friend \nfrom Missouri that there has been close cooperation in putting the bill \ntogether. I commend the Senator from Missouri. He has done a super job \nand so has Chairman Boxer, who is our leader. She sets the tone and \ngets us working together, and Senator Inhofe is right there with her. I \nthank the Senator for being helpful.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind comments of my friend \nfrom Montana. I wish there were more issues on which we could work so \nclosely, but this one I view as a vital investment in our Nation's \nfuture. This is something we ought to be able to come together on as \nRepublicans and Democrats, conservatives and liberals, and say we need \nto build for the future.\n  As my colleague from Montana has said, the programs administered by \nthe Corps are of tremendous value to the entire Nation. They provide \ndrinking water, electric power production, river transportation, \nrecreation, flood protection, environmental protection and restoration, \nand emergency response.\n  Few agencies in the Federal Government touch as many citizens as the \nCorps does. The Corps provides one-quarter of our Nation's total \nhydropower output. If you are looking for pollution-free power, it is \nhydropower. The Corps operates 463 lake recreation areas; moves 630 \nmillion tons of cargo, valued at over $73 billion annually through our \ninland system; manages over 12 million acres of land and water; \nprovides 3 trillion gallons of water for use by local communities and \nbusinesses; and has prevented an estimated $706 billion in flood damage \nwithin the past 25 years with an investment one-seventh of that value. \nDuring the 1993 flood alone, an estimated $19.1 billion in flood damage \nwas prevented by flood control facilities in place at that time.\n  Regrettably, I must tell my colleagues that as we debate this bill on \nthe floor, a flood is currently striking Missouri. I talked with a top \nCorps official from Missouri yesterday, who said the flood and its \nimpact now may be as great as the disaster of the 1993 floods. I will \nbe going there tomorrow to survey the damage. Floods are a fact of \nnature, and a good levee system can reduce the damage.\n  The WRDA bill is a bipartisan bill traditionally produced by Congress \nevery 2 years. As a matter of fact, you could say this is the 2002 WRDA \nbill about 5 years late. Better late than never.\n  The bill makes possible all of America's major flood control \nprojects, coastal protection, environmental protection and restoration, \ntransportation and recreation on our major waterways.\n  Despite its importance, however, we have not passed a WRDA bill since \n2000. The longer we wait, the more unmet needs pile up and the more \ncomplicated the demands upon the bill become. I think the public voice \nis loud, clear, and spoken often regarding how they feel about our long \noverdue and much-needed WRDA legislation.\n  We believe the bill before the Senate is a good one, balancing the \nneeds of our States for environmental restoration of key waterways and \nfor navigation projects that create economic growth and keep our \neconomy going.\n  The bill before us will create jobs, spur economic development and \ntrade competitiveness, and improve the environment. It is financially \nresponsible. To say it is widely supported is an understatement. It \npassed the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee last year by a \nvoice vote and, in the 109th Congress, 80 colleagues signed a letter \nurging floor action.\n  A few weeks ago, the House cleared a companion bill with a vote of \n394 to 25, and in the 109th Congress, they passed it with 406 votes. \nLast year, we merely ran out of time in conference. That is why I am \nglad the bill was passed out of committee and brought to the floor in a \ntimely manner. We cannot afford to let the time run out on the bill in \nthis Congress.\n  In the last 20 years, environmental protection has become a primary \nCorps mission. Our water resources perform a variety of functions \nsimultaneously. They can provide transportation and protection from \nfloods and protect habitat for many species.\n  Similarly, when it comes to Corps projects, navigational and flood \ncontrol projects can and should be environmentally sound. Environmental \nrestoration can help prevent or minimize flooding during the next major \nstorm.\n\n[[Page S5920]]\n\n  The Corps is leading some of the world's largest ecosystem \nrestoration projects. The commanding feature of this bill is its \nlandmark environmental and ecosystem restoration authorities. More than \nhalf the bill consists of authorization for environmental restoration \nprojects.\n  Think of all the major waterways that are important to America, to \nour environmental heritage, to recreation, and to commerce. This bill \naffects all of them.\n  Among the projects, this bill restores wetlands in the upper \nConnecticut River basin in Vermont and New Hampshire, restores oyster \nhabitats in the Chesapeake Bay, restores fisheries in the Great Lakes, \nimplements an environmental management program for the Rio Grande \nRiver, continues restoration of the Florida Everglades, restores areas \nof coastal Louisiana damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, restores \nhabitat on the upper Mississippi and Illinois water systems, and \nrestores oyster habitats on the Long Island Sound.\n  Flood control obviously is important. If we learned anything about \nMother Nature in the last 15 years, it is that we very often need \nprotection from her storms. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita obviously are \ndevastating examples.\n  The good news is that Corps projects have prevented an estimated $706 \nbillion in flood damage within the last 25 years with an investment of \none-seventh that amount.\n  During the 1993 flood alone, an estimated $19.1 billion in flood \ndamage was prevented by flood control facilities in place at the time.\n  This legislation authorizes flood control projects in California, \nLouisiana, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, \nMinnesota, Kentucky, South Carolina, Idaho, Washington, Missouri, Iowa, \nNew Mexico, and Arkansas, to name a few.\n  Transportation efficiency is another benefit. While the majority of \nthis legislation is for environmental protection and restoration, a key \nbipartisan economic commission we include provides transportation \nefficiency and environmental sustainability on the Mississippi and \nIllinois Rivers.\n  As the world becomes more competitive, America must also. From 1970 \nto 2003, the value of U.S. trade increased twenty-fourfold and 70 \npercent since 1994, an average annual growth rate of over 10 percent. \nWe can expect demand for U.S. exports to dramatically increase over 34 \nyears. We must ask ourself, or that part of our exports that are \ncommodities: Will there be growth in transportation in the next 20 to \n50 years to accommodate the growth in demand for commercial \ntransportation?\n  If we listen to the Department of Transportation, they are already \npredicting the congestion on our roads will double in the next quarter \nof a century.\n  From where I sit, capacity on the rails is at a maximum. It is a lot \ntougher to build a new railroad than it is to maintain the locks on an \nexisting waterway system. If we think our roads are congested now, \nthink of what will happen if we cannot relieve the pressure on our \nhighways. Water transportation is an inadequately tapped capacity, and \nit is good news because water transportation is efficient, it is safe, \nit conserves fuel, and it protects the air and the environment. One \nmedium-size barge tow can carry the same amount of freight as 870 \ntrucks. That fact alone speaks volumes to the benefits of water \ntransport. With oil prices at a record $72 per barrel, consider the \nadvantage of a twin engine barge that can carry the equivalent of 870 \ntrucks.\n  Over the past 35 years, waterborne commerce on the upper Mississippi \nRiver has more than tripled. It currently carries 60 percent of our \nNation's corn exports and 45 percent of our Nation's soybean exports. \nIt does so at two-thirds the cost of rail when and if rail is \navailable.\n  In Missouri alone, we ship 34.7 million tons of commodities, with a \ncombined value of more than $4 billion, and it isn't just agricultural \nproducts. It includes coal, petroleum, aggregates, grain, chemicals, \niron, steel, minerals, fertilizers, and other commodities.\n  The sad fact is our navigable waterways are in environmental and \neconomic decline. Jobs, markets, and the availability of habitat for \nfish and wildlife are at stake. The American Society of Civil Engineers \ngrades navigable waterways infrastructure with a D-minus, with over 50 \npercent of the locks functionally obsolete despite increased demand. \nThese locks were built 75 years ago with a life expectancy of 50 years. \nIf you look at the locks when they are locking through a tow, they \ndon't just leak, they shed tons of water. They are past the stage where \ncontinued application of chewing gum and duct tape are going to protect \nthe water transportation infrastructure we need.\n  This bill is a plan that gets the Corps back in the business of \nbuilding for the future rather than haggling about predicting it. The \nlegislation contains authorization for funding to improve navigation on \na number of our waterways in several States--Louisiana, Texas, Alaska, \nVirginia, Delaware, Maine, Oklahoma, and South Carolina. My interest is \na key piece of the bill that modernizes locks and dams on the upper \nMississippi and Illinois Rivers.\n\n  We authorize capacity on locks 20 to 25 on the Missouri River in \nPeoria and LaGrange on the Illinois. New 1,200-foot locks on the \nMississippi will provide equal capacity in the bottleneck region \ndownstream of the 1,200-foot lock 19 at Keokuk and upstream locks 26 \nand 27 near St. Louis.\n  What happens with the 600-foot lock as now exists today? All the \nmodern tows are 1,200 feet long, so we have to double lock through \nthem, push half the barges in, lock them down, bring the water down, \npush the other half of the barge in, lock it down. That is a tremendous \nbottleneck, and even though 600-foot locks are in very degraded \ncondition, half the cost of the new locks will be paid by private users \nwho pay into the inland waterways trust fund. Additional funds would be \nprovided for mitigation and small-scale and nonstructural measures to \nimprove efficiency.\n  There is lots of talk around here about wanting to increase trade. \nAll the productive farmers, commercial family farms in Missouri know \nthat trade is essential, not only for their well-being, but for the \nstrength of the economy to bring revenue to rural communities and the \nrest of the world. But we can't have those without the basic \ntransportation infrastructure necessary to move goods from buyers to \nsellers. New efficiency helps give our producers an edge that can make \nor break opportunities in the international marketplace.\n  As we look 50 years into the future, we have to ask ourselves a \nfundamental question: Should we have a system that promotes growth or \nshould we be confined to a transportation straitjacket designed not for \n2050 but for 1950 or earlier with paddle wheel boats?\n  Further, we can ask ourselves if dramatic investments should be made \nto address environmental problems and opportunities that exist on these \ngreat waterways. In both cases, the answer to me, and I hope a majority \nof this body, must be, of course, we must modernize and improve.\n  Seventy years ago, some argued that a transportation system on the \nMississippi River was not justified. But Congress bravely stepped \nforward and decided it would not try to predict the future but to shape \nthe future and decide to invest in a system despite the naysayers. Over \n84 million tons per year later, clearly the decision was wise.\n  A couple years ago, a veteran chief economist at the USDA, talking \nabout transportation efficiency and the ability of farmers to win \nmarkets and higher prices, said that transportation is fundamentally \nrelated. He predicted that corn exports should rise over the next 10 \nyears by 45 percent, and 70 percent of that will travel down the \nMississippi River.\n  This decision to improve the waterways has not been taken lightly. \nAll decisions have been documented and coordinated with an interagency \nFederal principles group, independent technical reviews and \nstakeholders and have been made available for public review and \ncomment.\n  The Corps of Engineers spent $70 million completing an anticipated 6-\nyear study that actually took 14 years to complete. That was only three \ntimes over budget. During that period, there have been no less than 35 \nmeetings of Governors' committees, 28 meetings of economic coordinating \ncommittees among the States, and a minimum of 44 meetings of the \nNavigation and Environmental Coordination Committee;\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\nadditionally, 130 briefings for special interest groups, 25 \nnewsletters, at least 6 sets of public meetings in 46 locations with \nover 4,000 people in attendance. There are some who say we ought to \nstudy it some more. Give me a break. To say the least, this has been a \nvery long transparent and representative process, and while we have \nbeen studying, our competitors have been building.\n  One of the saddest sights I have seen recently is a picture of \nexports from New Orleans. Rather than exporting American commodities, \ndo you know what they are exporting? Barges. They are exporting barges \nand tow boats that couldn't operate efficiently on the existing lock \nsystem to Brazil and other areas so they can have modern transportation \nmeans that will eat our lunch both literally and figuratively.\n  Given the extraordinary delay so far and given the reality that \nlarge-scale construction takes not weeks, not months but decades, \nfurther delay is no longer an option. That is why I am very pleased to \njoin a bipartisan group of Senators who agree we must improve the \nefficiency and the environmental sustainability of our great resources.\n  The transportation efficiency provisions are supported by a broad-\nbased group of States, farm groups, shippers, labor, and those who pay \ntaxes into the trust fund.\n  Of particular note, I appreciate the strong support from the \ncarpenters, corn growers, farm bureau, soybean growers, energy and \nconstruction materials industry.\n  Additionally, I thank Senators McCaskill, Durbin, Obama, Grassley, \nand Harkin for their strong bipartisan support as well.\n  As for the budget, for some, this bill is too small; for others, it \nis too big. It is important to understand the budget implications of \nthis legislation in the real world. We are contending with difficult \nbudget realities. It is critical that we be mindful of those realities \nas we make investments in the infrastructure that supports those who \nmanufacture, grow, buy, and sell products so we can expand our economy, \ncreate jobs, secure our future, and pay the taxes our Government needs \nto continue providing support for the infrastructure.\n  This is an authorization bill. It does not spend $1--not $1. It makes \nprojects eligible within budget constraints. With the allocation \nprovided the Appropriations Committee, the Congress and the President \nwill fund projects deemed to be of the highest priority. The remaining \nwill not be funded because of budget issues. This WRDA process simply \nallows for projects to be considered during the process of \nappropriations. Some will measure up, some will not, although the ones \nin this bill have gone through rigorous examination to get this far.\n  I believe we strike a balance that disciplines the new projects to \ncriteria fairly applied while addressing a great number of water \nresource priorities.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Waterways Alliance, the \nAmerican Shore and Beach Preservation Association, the California \nCoastal Coalition, AASHTO, and 250 other organizations.\n  My thanks to the Environment and Public Works Committee, its \nleadership, its staff, the staff of the Subcommittee on Transportation \nand Infrastructure for their hard work and the commitment to bring WRDA \nto the floor in a timely manner.\n  Again, I particularly thank Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member Inhofe \nfor their forbearance. I look forward to debate and final passage.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have made some good progress on the \nbill today. A number of our colleagues have come forward. I \nparticularly wanted to thank Senator Feingold for coming and debating \nhis amendment on prioritization with me. We are going to have a vote on \nthat, if all goes well, on Tuesday. That has not been finalized, but it \nlooks as if that is what is going to happen.\n  I would say to colleagues that we did have a good, fair debate so far \ntoday, and we are going to continue this tomorrow and on Monday. I hope \nthat those who have not come forward with their amendments would be so \nkind as to do that. We don't have very many because we did take care of \nmany issues between both sides of the committee, but if there are \namendments, we urge our colleagues to please come forward and talk \nabout those amendments. This way, they can have as much time as they \nwant and we can hopefully get this bill done.\n  We keep adding to the letters of support. I was just handed a letter \nfrom the National Association of Manufacturers in favor of this bill, \nso it is one of these rare moments in history where we have the \nmanufacturers association, the labor unions, we have the farmers, we \nhave the corn growers, and we have the water people. We just have a \nhuge amount of support for this bill. It is one of those times that \neverybody is coming together, setting aside other matters, other issues \nthat are so terribly contentious, such as Iraq, which tears at our \nheartstrings whenever we are on it, and other tough matters we deal \nwith every day. This is one which does bring us together, I am happy to \nsay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter I just \nreferred to printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Manufacturers,\n\n                                                     May 10, 2007.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairwoman, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairwoman: On behalf of more than 14 million \n     manufacturing employees in the U.S., we would like to thank \n     you for your leadership in moving forward with the Water \n     Resources Development Act of 2007, WRDA. It is vitally \n     important that America's water resources infrastructure be \n     reliable and productive. Therefore we applaud your efforts to \n     end the stalemate over water resources project authorization \n     by bringing H.R. 1495, WRDA, to the Senate floor. We firmly \n     believe that it is time to end the impasse over passage of \n     WRDA.\n       A Water Resources Development Act is vitally needed to \n     accommodate the many important projects awaiting \n     authorization, including the modernization of the locks, \n     harbors, canals and other key infrastructure that are vital \n     to the competitiveness of the U.S. economy. A sound national \n     transportation system for the 21st century needs modem water \n     projects, and WRDA will authorize many of those needs.\n       We look forward to working with you and your staff and \n     issues of importance to the nation's economy and environment. \n     Again, thank you for your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       The National Association of\n                                                    Manufacturers.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, without the physical infrastructure in \nthis country in good shape, we can't move goods, we can't move people, \nand we can't move services. So we need all this. And this bill is 7 \nyears old. So we are very pleased.\n  We are also very pleased that this bill complies with the spirit of \nthe ethics reform we passed here in the very early days of the session. \nAlthough that ethics bill hasn't yet become law--we expect it will--\nthis committee, on both sides, decided we wanted to comply with it. So \nwe got letters from colleagues stating whether they had any type of \nperceived conflict of interest or a conflict of interest in relation to \nthe projects that are in the bill.\n  At this point, I do not see any colleagues coming here to speak, but \nwe will keep the floor open for a period of time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/10/senate-section/article/S5921-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5921-S5922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Madam President, I try to come to the floor each week to \naddress the issue of the ongoing genocide in Darfur. I am troubled that \nso much time has passed and so little has been done. When a great \nnation such as the United States declares a genocide in some part of \nthe world, I think we have a moral responsibility to do something.\n  Imagine, transport yourself back in time to the genocides that have \noccurred in the past. Imagine a declaration by the United States of a \ngenocide involving Jewish people and others during the Holocaust of \nWorld War II. Imagine that we had recognized that was going on and \nannounced that our Government knew it was going on and ask yourself, if \nwe had done nothing at that point, having made the announcement, what \nit says about the United States.\n  President Bush and his administration have done the right thing in \ndeclaring a genocide in Darfur. The President, a few weeks ago, gave a \nspeech in which he said we have to go beyond this declaration to do \nsomething. Yet it has not happened.\n  I want to give the President and the Secretary General of the United \nNations adequate time to respond in a way that will save lives, but as \nwe wait and negotiate and think about it, people suffer. Millions \nremain displaced, unable to return home. Humanitarian assistance coming \ninto Darfur continues to hang by a thread. It could be snapped at any \nmoment by escalating violence or chaos in the region.\n  There were several developments this past week that reflect the \nturmoil and complexity of the Darfur situation.\n  The shareholders at Berkshire Hathaway, in Omaha, NE, at their annual \nmeeting, rejected a proposal that would have required this giant \ninvestment firm to sell its investment in PetroChina, the large oil \ncompany in the Sudan owned by the Chinese. PetroChina is a subsidiary \nof a Chinese Government firm known as the China National Petroleum \nCorporation. It is the largest company operating in the Sudan, drilling \nand exporting much of China's oil. Berkshire Hathaway is the largest \nindependent shareholder in PetroChina in America.\n  The second development was the release of a new report by Amnesty \nInternational detailing the transfer of arms to the Sudanese \nGovernment. Many of these arms have been supplied by Russia and China.\n  Another thing happened this week: China announced that it was sending \na unit of military engineers to assist the African Union peacekeeping \nmission in Darfur.\n  I would like to speak for a moment about these three developments.\n  First, the vote at Berkshire Hathaway was a disappointment. Warren \nBuffett is my friend. I respect him very much. I think he is one of the \nnicest people I have ever met and is certainly one of America's great \nbusiness leaders. I used to look forward, when I owned one share of his \nclass B stock, to his annual report. I thought it was probably the most \nhonest analysis of business and business decisions that one could read \nin the course of a year in America. I had hoped, when the shareholders \ncame together in Omaha, they would decide to make an issue of this \nownership of PetroChina.\n  The Los Angeles Times, last Friday, detailed how Berkshire's \ninvestments in PetroChina are particularly challenging for the Gates \nFoundation. Berkshire chairman, Warren Buffett, has pledged $31 \nbillion--that is $31 billion--worth of Berkshire stock as a donation to \nthe Gates Foundation. That is an amazingly generous donation to an \norganization that is doing life-changing work for the world's poor and \nsuffering.\n  According to the L.A. Times, in its own investments, the Gates \nFoundation also currently holds about $22 million in firms operating in \nSudan that benefit the Sudanese Government.\n  A Gates Foundation spokesperson stated that:\n\n       Bill and Melinda [Gates] have initiated a process to assess \n     the asset trust investments in Sudan.\n\n  These numbers really illustrate the complexities of this situation, \nwhen even mammoth foundations that do enormous good work across the \nworld have to take an honest look at their own investments. I believe \neach of us should do the same. It is not an easy process. Subsidiaries \nmay be hidden from open view, and it is difficult to know what exactly \nlies beneath the mutual fund statements we might receive.\n  My mutual fund statements certainly have far fewer pages than Mr. \nBuffett's or Mr. Gates'. I have still wrestled with how to ensure that \nmy investments do not include funds related in some way to companies \noperating in Sudan. I am trying to make this process honest but easier \nfor all Americans.\n  The second development I mentioned that took place this week was the \nrelease of a new report by Amnesty International. The report states:\n\n       [In 2005, the most recent year for which data is available] \n     Sudan imported $24 million worth of arms and ammunition from \n     the People's Republic of China, as well as nearly $57 million \n     worth of parts and aircraft equipment and $2 million worth of \n     parts of helicopters and airplanes from China. . . . During a \n     meeting in Beijing, the Defense Minister of China reportedly \n     told Sudan's joint chief of staff that military relations had \n     been ``developing smoothly'' and said: ``[We] are willing to \n     further develop military co-operation between our two \n     countries in all areas.'' . . . [A Chinese company] recently \n     delivered six K-8 military training/attack aircraft to the \n     Sudanese Air Force and a further six will follow soon, \n     according to a military magazine. . . . Amnesty International \n     is concerned that the Sudan Air Force . . . is highly likely \n     to use these newly acquired jets, as it has other aircraft . \n     . . for indiscriminate attacks in Darfur in violation of the \n     UN arms embargo and international humanitarian law.\n\n  This report from Amnesty International details the ways in which the \nSudanese Government violates the United Nations' arms embargo and \ndisguises some of its military operations in Darfur. It offers a number \nof recommendations to close loopholes in the arms embargo and to better \nmonitor the flow of goods into Sudan. The report also calls on all \nstates to immediately suspend the transfer of all weapons, ammunition, \nand military equipment and ``dual use'' equipment likely to be used in \nthe commission of human rights violations in Darfur. The report \nconcludes that a global arms trade treaty is needed to prevent the flow \nof arms from fueling such catastrophic conflicts in the future.\n\n  We must see what we can do to prevent future disasters like the one \nplaying out in Darfur.\n  Finally, I would like to mention the third development of the week. \nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry announced to the press and in a letter to \nMembers of Congress that it was sending a unit of military engineers to \nparticipate in the peacekeeping operation in Darfur and assist the \nAfrican Union. This unit is expected to number perhaps 300 engineers. \nIt is a welcome gesture.\n  China has taken other positive steps as well, such as helping to \nconvince Khartoum to agree to the deployment of 3,000 U.S. \npeacekeepers.\n  Those steps must be juxtaposed, however, against some realities: \nChina helping Sudanese President Bashir build a new Presidential \npalace; against China investing billions of dollars in the Sudanese oil \nindustry; against China reportedly transferring arms to Sudan and \nseeking expanded military cooperation; and against China's opposition \nto sanctions against Sudan.\n  The international community has to do more to stop the killing in \nDarfur. China has to do more, and so do we as American individuals and \nas a nation.\n  On April 18, President Bush stated in his speech at the Holocaust \nMuseum that Sudan had a short time to end its obstructions and accept a \nfull-scale peacekeeping mission or face serious consequences. I \napplauded that statement.\n  I have spoken to the President personally about this statement, and I \ntold him I believe those words were important for the world to hear. I \nunderstand President Bush did not impose a new sanction on that day \nbecause he wanted to give the Secretary General\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\nof the United Nations several weeks to seek a diplomatic solution.\n  A short period of time is coming to a close. I am ready to work with \nthe President and my colleagues in Congress to find new tools to bring \nto bear in order to stop the violence in Darfur.\n  Along with several colleagues, I am preparing to introduce \nlegislation to provide some of those additional tools in this effort.\n  The most effective policy instruments will be multilateral, meaning \nmany nations involved in achieving this goal. But in the meantime, the \nUnited States must act. We cannot let more months pass while people \ncontinue to suffer.\n  I hope by next week the President of the United States will have \nreached a conclusion that the Secretary General has had his \nopportunity, that the United Nations may not be able to broker some \ndiplomatic resolution. I hope at that time the President of the United \nStates--and I will urge him to--will make a decision that we should \nstep out in terms of sanctions against the Sudanese Government.\n  What is at stake? Two hundred thousand to four hundred thousand \ninnocent people who were killed--men, women, and children whose \nvillages were destroyed, whose homes were destroyed, children were \nkilled, terrible atrocities against humanity. Over 2 million people \nwere displaced, forced to trudge across the desert to try to stay alive \nto make it to a refugee camp. Why? Because the Government of their \ncountry in Sudan has, frankly, ignored the obvious, that the jingaweit \nmilitia and other forces are killing their own people. That is clearly \ngenocide, and it is a situation we can no longer tolerate.\n  I hope we can find bipartisan support for decisive action. I hope we \ncan say to the Chinese: Yes, we applaud your sending 300 engineers into \nthis region that is as large as the State of Texas. Yes, we applaud the \npublic statements you have made encouraging the Sudanese to accept the \nU.N. peacekeeping force. But the Chinese can and must do more.\n  China is the biggest customer in the world for Sudanese oil. If the \nChinese make it clear they are not going to continue their relationship \nwith Sudan unless something is done to end this genocide, it can make a \nbig difference. I think it is important they do these things. \nCertainly, to condemn violence on one hand and then sell the arms and \nammunition to the Sudanese that is being used against their own people \nis duplicitous. It is not consistent. The Chinese should think long and \nhard about whether they can serve both roles and try to convince the \nworld they are doing something meaningful.\n  In the meantime, I think we need a divestment strategy. I think it is \ntime for the United States, first, to change the law so State and local \ngovernments can make decisions to divest in mutual funds, in investment \nfunds that relate to companies doing business in Sudan. Right now the \ncourts have stopped that kind of divestment. We can change that law, \nand I have pending legislation to do that. We need to have our own \npolicy in this country to put pressure on the Sudanese to accept the \nU.N. peacekeepers--not American soldiers but U.N. peacekeepers--who \nwill come to the rescue of these poor people who are suffering in \nDarfur. This is a situation which calls on the United States to keep \nits word. When the President announced the genocide in Darfur, he \nreminded us of what happened in Rwanda. Under the previous \nadministration in Rwanda, the genocide occurred which claimed as many \nas 800,000 innocent lives. The administration at that time, under \nPresident Clinton, was warned and took no action, would not declare a \ngenocide. As a consequence, the massacre occurred. We know it could \nhave been averted with very few soldiers, maybe even as few as 5,000 \nsoldiers. Supplementing the U.N. peacekeeping force could have saved \n800,000 lives. It is unimaginable that we did not respond, or at least \nhelp others to respond.\n\n  President Clinton, reflecting on this, has said it is one of the real \ndisappointments and failures in foreign policy during the terms he \nserved as President. Let's not repeat that mistake.\n  I have urged President Bush, with a year and a half left of his term, \nand so many other things that he has to consider, to remember a promise \nhe made when he announced the genocide in Darfur. He said: Not on my \nwatch.\n  Well, Mr. President, your watch is drawing to a close, and you have a \nchance, you have the power, unlike any other person in the world, to \nmake a difference in Darfur. If the Secretary General of the United \nNations will not respond in a timely way, we must respond. Some may \nargue it might fail. Maybe we won't succeed, but at least we will have \ntried.\n  I always think, when we come to these discussions about this kind of \nchallenge, about one of my favorite movies: ``Schindler's List.'' At \nthe end of ``Schindler's List,'' Oskar Schindler, if you will remember, \nwas a businessman who started off with the goal of making money and \nthen decided that he had a bigger goal in life, and that was to save as \nmany Jewish people as he could by declaring that they were workers and \nemployees in his plant. He managed to save so many lives.\n  At the end of the movie there was this graphic scene where the \nworkers--the war was over and the workers were finally free, and they \nwanted to show their gratitude to Mr. Schindler. So they asked the \nworkers to give up the gold fillings in their teeth, and they knocked \nout the gold fillings in their teeth and melted it into a ring that \nthey gave him as a gift for saving their lives.\n  There was this touching scene at the end of the movie where Liam \nNeeson, who was playing the role of Oskar Schindler, was standing by \nthis car about to leave the factory, and they presented him with this \nring. He broke down, and his words are unforgettable. He said: I should \nhave done more. I should have done more.\n  I think about that in the context of Darfur. When it is all over, and \nhistory is written, I don't want to have to stand here and ask any \nSenator to say: I should have done more. We need to do something, and \nwe need to do it now. If it is not successful in ending the genocide in \nDarfur, at least we can say we have given it our best effort. But today \nwe can't say that. We haven't done nearly as much as we should or could \ndo to help these suffering people.\n  When history is written, it will perhaps applaud our declaration of \ngenocide, but there won't be much applause for the little action that \nhas followed. It is not too late.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/10/senate-section/article/S5923-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5923-S5925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ASSISTING THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this week I introduced two bills to \nassist members of the armed services and veterans. S. 1314, the \nVeterans Outreach Improvement Act, will help to ensure that all of our \nveterans know about Federal benefits to which they may be entitled by \nimproving outreach programs conducted by the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. S. 1313, the Servicemembers' Cellular Phone Contract Fairness \nAct, will ensure that deployed servicemembers are not subjected to \nunfair penalties for cancelling their cell phone contracts.\n  I would also like to thank my good friend, the junior Senator from \nHawaii, for holding a hearing yesterday that considered both of these \nbills along with many other important pieces of legislation to improve \nthe treatment of veterans, servicemembers and their families. Senator \nAkaka is a strong leader on these vitally important issues as chairman \nof the Veterans Affairs Committee and I commend him on his efforts and \nlook forward to working with him to enact veterans' benefits \nlegislation that includes my two proposals.\n  I am pleased to be joined in the effort to improve outreach by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs by the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nBurr. I introduced identical legislation in the 108th and 109th \nCongresses. I am also pleased to note that there is a companion bill in \nthe House, H.R. 67, sponsored by Representative McIntyre. On Tuesday, \nthe House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Disability Assistance\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\nand Memorial Affairs approved the bill by a voice vote.\n  I was extremely troubled by revelations of gaps in care as \nservicemembers transition to the VA that emerged as a result of \ninvestigations of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. I appreciate the \nDepartment of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs' attempts to \nremedy these gaps, but more work remains to be done. It can be \nextremely difficult for veterans to navigate the VA's health care and \nbenefits systems. This bill will increase congressional oversight of \nthe VA's outreach activities and authorize the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to work with States to perform outreach.\n  Several years ago, the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, \nWDVA, launched a statewide program called ``I Owe You.'' Under the \ndirection of Secretary Ray Boland, the program encourages veterans to \napply, or to re-apply, for benefits that they earned from their service \nin the U.S. military.\n  As part of this program, WDVA has sponsored several events around \nWisconsin called ``Supermarkets of Veterans Benefits'' at which \nveterans can begin the process of learning whether they qualify for \nFederal benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. These \nevents, which are based on a similar program in Georgia, supplement the \nwork of Wisconsin's County Veterans Service Officers and veterans \nservice organizations by helping our veterans to reconnect with the VA \nand to learn more about services and benefits for which they may be \neligible. More than 11,000 veterans and their families have attended \nthe supermarkets, which include information booths with representatives \nfrom WDVA, VA, and veterans service organizations, as well as a variety \nof Federal, State, and local agencies. I was proud to have members of \nmy staff speak with veterans and their families at a number of these \nevents. These events have helped veterans and their families to learn \nabout numerous topics, including health care, how to file a disability \nclaim, and preregistration for internment in veterans cemeteries.\n  The Institute for Government Innovation at Harvard University's \nKennedy School of Government recognized the ``I Owe You'' program by \nnaming it a semi-finalist for the 2002 Innovations in American \nGovernment Award. The program was also featured in the March/April 2003 \nissue of Disabled American Veterans Magazine.\n  The State of Wisconsin is performing a service that is clearly the \nobligation of the VA. These are Federal benefits that we owe to our \nveterans and it is the Federal Government's responsibility to make sure \nthat they receive them. The VA has a statutory obligation to perform \noutreach, and current budget pressures should not be used as an excuse \nto halt or reduce these efforts.\n  The legislation that I introduced was spurred by the overwhelming \nresponse to the WDVA's ``I Owe You'' program and the supermarkets of \nveterans benefits. If more than 11,000 Wisconsin veterans are unaware \nof benefits that may be owed to them, it is troubling to think how many \nveterans around our country are also unaware of them. We can and should \ndo better for our veterans, who selflessly served our country and \nprotected the freedoms that we all cherish. And it is important to \naddress gaps in the VA's outreach program as we welcome home and \nprepare to enroll into the VA system the tens of thousands of dedicated \nmilitary personnel who are serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other \nplaces around the globe.\n  In order to help to facilitate consistent implementation of VA's \noutreach responsibilities around the country, my bill would create a \nstatutory definition of the term ``outreach.''\n  My bill also would help to improve outreach activities performed by \nthe VA in three ways. First, it would create separate funding line \nitems for outreach activities within the budgets of the VA and its \nagencies, the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration, and the National Cemetery Administration. Currently \nfunding for outreach is taken from the general operating expenses for \nthese agencies. These important programs should have a dedicated \nfunding source instead of being forced to compete for scarce funding \nwith other crucial VA programs.\n\n  I have long supported efforts to adequately fund VA programs. We can \nand should do more to provide the funding necessary to ensure that our \nbrave veterans are getting the health care and other benefits that they \nhave earned in a timely manner and without having to travel long \ndistances or wait more than a year to see a doctor or to have a claim \nprocessed.\n  Secondly, the bill would create an intra-agency structure to require \nthe Office of the Secretary, the Office of Public Affairs, the VBA, the \nVHA, and the NCA to coordinate outreach activities. By working more \nclosely together, the VA components would be able to consolidate their \nefforts, share proven outreach mechanisms, and avoid duplication of \neffort that could waste scarce funding.\n  Finally, the bill would ensure that the VA can enter into cooperative \nagreements with State Departments of Veterans Affairs regarding \noutreach activities and would give the VA grantmaking authority to \naward funds to State Departments of Veterans Affairs for outreach \nactivities such as the WDVA's ``I Owe You Program.'' Grants that are \nawarded to State departments under this program could be used to \nenhance outreach activities and to improve activities relating to \nveterans claims processing, which is a key component of the VA benefits \nprocess. State departments that receive grants under this program may \nchoose to award portions of their grants to local governments, other \npublic entities, or private or nonprofit organizations that engage in \nveterans outreach activities.\n  I am pleased that this bill has the support of a number of \norganizations that are committed to improving the lives of our Nation's \nveterans, including the American Legion; Veterans of Foreign Wars; \nParalyzed Veterans of America; Vietnam Veterans of America; Wounded \nWarrior Project; and National Association of State Directors of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  The second bill that I introduced seeks to make life a little easier \nfor our servicemembers and their families when they are called up to \nduty or transferred. We all recognize the heroic service the men and \nwomen in our armed services provide the Nation each day. So when I \nheard stories about servicemembers and their families in Wisconsin \nhaving trouble canceling their cell phone contracts after being called \nup, I looked for a way to help. With the prospect of a combat \nassignment, the last thing our men and women in uniform should have to \nworry about are early termination fees or being forced to pay for a \nservice they cannot use. I tried to have this provision adopted as an \namendment to the Defense authorization bill last June and, while I was \nunsuccessful, I will continue to push for the adoption of this \ncommonsense measure.\n  These problems with canceling cellular phone service have not been \njust isolated incidents. In fact, the issue has been raised by the \nWisconsin National Guard. I will ask that the full testimony of 1LT \nMelissa Inlow of the Wisconsin Army National Guard at a hearing on a \nWisconsin State Assembly bill in April be made part of the Record.\n  I just want to highlight one part of that testimony that makes the \npoint that this is a real issue facing our servicemembers. She \ntestified: ``It's becoming increasingly difficult to get cell phone \nservice providers to suspend the contract. Even with suspension the \nsoldiers are still paying up to $25 a month for a service they cannot \nreap the benefits of. These fees can accumulate to more than the \ntermination fee which on average is $200.'' First Lieutenant Inlow went \non to specifically recommend that the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act \nbe amended to include a section on cellular phones.\n  First Lieutenant Inlow and the Wisconsin National Guard are not alone \nin this opinion either. The National Guard Association of the United \nStates, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United \nStates, and the Military Officers Association of America have supported \nmy proposal since the original amendment was offered last June. I was \nglad to add the support of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the \nDisabled Veterans of America, the American Legion, and the Veterans of \nForeign Wars to this list when they expressed support at a recent \nVeterans Affairs hearing. This\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\npractically universal support among the current armed services and the \nveterans communities clearly show that this commonsense provision \nshould be enacted.\n  It is common now for cellular phone contracts to require a contract \nterm of up to 2 years. Along with these long contracts, there are often \nearly termination fees of several hundred dollars. When National Guard \nmembers are called up to active duty or soldiers are transferred \noverseas or to a base that isn't covered by their current provider, \nthey often face the prospect of either paying these significant fees or \npaying monthly fees for the remainder of the contract for a service \nthey cannot use. While many servicemembers and their families have been \nable to work with telecommunications companies to eventually get the \nearly termination fee canceled, the account suspended, or the fees \nreduced, they have enough to deal with after being called up that they \nshould not have this added burden as well.\n  My legislation proposes that we bring these cellular phone contracts \nin line with what we have already done for residential and automotive \nleases in the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act--let the servicemembers \ncancel the contract. Under my proposal, if servicemembers are called up \nfor more than 90 days, transferred overseas, or transferred to a U.S. \nduty station where they could not continue their service at the same \nrate, they could cancel their contract without a termination fee.\n  While my legislation helps to prevent servicemembers from being \nfinancially punished for volunteering to protect this country, I have \nalso tried to make sure that the telecommunications providers are \ntreated fairly as well. That is why I have included a provision that \nwould allow the providers to request the return of cell phones provided \nas part of the contract. If the company requests the return under this \nprovision, it would also have to give the servicemember the option of \npaying a prorated amount for the cell phone should he or she wish to \nkeep it. Moreover, if the provider and servicemember mutually agree to \nsuspend instead of terminate the contract, the bill makes sure that the \nreactivation fee is waived.\n  Several States, including Wisconsin, have already given \nservicemembers this protection. While these State laws are positive \nsteps, a national law will make sure all servicemembers are afforded \nthis protection and give the industry a baseline standard.\n  While this is a modest addition to the rights of servicemembers, it \nis important that we remove as many unfair burdens facing this \ncountry's men and women in uniform as we can. I hope my colleagues will \nshare this view and quickly adopt this nonpartisan proposal.\n  Both of these two bills I introduced earlier in the week and that \nwere considered in yesterday's Veteran's Affairs Committee hearing have \nwidespread support. I hope this support will translate into the \nVeterans Affairs Committee including them as part of its package of \nveterans' benefits legislation later this year. I again, want to thank \nChairman Akaka and the Veterans Affairs Committee for considering my \nbills to improve outreach activities and allow servicemembers to cancel \ncellular phone contracts in yesterday's hearing.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned \ntestimony of 1LT Melissa Inlow be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nTestimony for the Record of First Lieutenant Melissa Inlow at a Hearing \n           on Wisconsin Assembly Bill 1174 on April 17, 2006\n\n       Thank you, chairman and members of the committee, for the \n     opportunity to speak. The Department of Military Affairs and \n     the Wisconsin National Guard is in support of Senate bill \n     1174. I am First Lieutenant Melissa Inlow, a Judge Advocate \n     General Officer with the Wisconsin Army National Guard. By \n     granting servicemembers the right to terminate their cell \n     phone contracts upon mobilization, you are ensuring further \n     protections and peace of mind for our servicemembers. In \n     August of 2005, I was brought on to provide legal assistance \n     to our deployed servicemembers and their families. Since that \n     time, about 3-5 percent of my time has been dedicated to \n     assisting servicemembers in resolving issues with their cell \n     phone service contracts. It's becoming increasingly difficult \n     to get cell phone service providers to suspend the contract. \n     Even with suspension the soldiers are still paying up to $25 \n     a month for a service they cannot reap the benefits of. These \n     fees can accumulate to more than the termination fee which on \n     average is $200. I've found it very difficult and sometimes \n     impossible to reach a live person and very difficult to reach \n     a person with decision making authority. Each time I have had \n     to call a cellular phone service provider, I have talked to a \n     different customer service representative, and each has given \n     me a different resolution to the cell phone issue. The \n     companies are lacking significantly in internal consistency \n     when it comes to resolving cell phone contract issues. It has \n     been my experience that the customer service representatives \n     of cell phone companies experience high turnover rate and are \n     not aware of the wireless provider's policy on military \n     suspension. It is extremely frustrating for me; I can only \n     imagine the undue stress and strain it causes our deploying \n     servicemembers and their families that are left behind to \n     deal with these issues. This change will likely help ease the \n     stress deployment places on our servicemembers allowing them \n     to focus on their mission. I hope that the Federal Government \n     will follow suit and amend the Servicemember's Civil Relief \n     Act to incorporate a section on cell phone contracts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/10/senate-section/article/S5925-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   OXFORD COUNTY VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, it is truly a solemn honor to join in \nrecognizing these exceptional soldiers extraordinary enough to have \nworn our Nation's uniform as you gather for the unveiling of the Oxford \nCounty Vietnam War Memorial\n  It is fitting and just that on this Armed Services Day, as we express \nour gratefulness to soldiers in service to our Nation, we commemorate \nthose who saw service in Vietnam--especially the 37 Mainers who \nperished or are considered missing in action, whose revered names are \nremembered for all time on this Vietnam War Memorial. This tribute to \ntheir valor and their enduring dedication to duty reminds us that all \nthe blessings of liberty we cherish today, the protection of our \nfamilies, and the strength of our democracy represent our inheritance \nfrom generations past that we are obligated to safeguard and carry \nforth into the future.\n  This shining example of their contribution will serve not only to \ninspire--but also to heal. It will ensure that we always regard with \nthe highest respect the inexpressible debt of gratitude we owe all \nsoldiers and their families which we can never repay, but must never \nforget. And to faithfully and appropriately honor those who have \nfallen, we must nurture and protect the founding democratic principles \nwe treasure, for which they so bravely made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Every name etched on this wall corresponds to a unique story, but all \nare bound together, each to each, comrade to comrade, and soldier to \nsoldier, by a universal, selfless devotion a commitment eloquently \nmemorialized by President John Adams when he wrote, ``if we do not lay \nout ourselves in the service of mankind whom should we serve?\n  Two servicemen, SGT James B. Bartlett, U.S. Army, 1st Infantry \nDivision, Bethel and SSG John H. R. Brooks, U.S. Army, 129th Assault \nHelicopter, Peru, are both missing in action, and so this monument must \nalso stand as a testament that we will honorably keep the faith with \nthose who so valiantly kept their faith with us.\n  Each person we celebrate on this wall dignifies this memorial and \nmakes it the sacred destination that it is intended to be, and that \ndignity is passed on to each of us when we pay rightful homage to the \nnobility of their deeds and the legacy of their love for this country.\n  May God bless you all, and may God bless the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/10/senate-section/article/S5925-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5925-S5926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CAR AND CHILD SAFETY\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, it is with deep regret that I share \nthe following story of a constituent of mine. On April 24, Kristen \nMcCrea, a woman from Amherst, NY, lost her daughter in a nontraffic, \nnoncrash incident. Collett McCrea was only 22 months old. The incident \noccurred when Kristen left her daughter in their home briefly while \nbacking her car out of the garage. Little did Kristen know that Collett \nhad gotten out of the house and was behind\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\nthe vehicle. Kristen did not realize she had backed over Collett until \nher child came into view in front of the car.\n  Sadly, Collett's tragedy is not an isolated incident. In April 2007, \nthe child safety advocacy group, Kids and Cars, has documented 17 fatal \nbackover incidents across the country--from Rochester, NY, and South \nBend, IN, to San Francisco and Dallas. Six more incidents of fatal \nfrontovers were reported in April, as well as a brake-shift interlock \nfatality.\n  While all these tragedies occurred in the last month, the danger of \nnontraffic, noncrash incidents is not a new trend. On average, a child \ndies in the United States nearly every other day from a completely \npreventable accident--backed over by a driver who couldn't see behind \nhis or her vehicle, strangled in a power window, or killed when an \nautomobile inadvertently shifts into gear.\n  Since 2000, over 1,150 children have died in nontraffic, noncrash \nincidents, and this number has been steadily rising. The average age of \nvictims is between 12 and 23 months. This year alone, according to the \nresearch by the child safety group, Kids and Cars, 261 children have \nbeen involved in 235 of these incidents, resulting in 17 fatalities. At \nleast 21 children in New York State have been victims of these \nincidents since 1990.\n  It is time we stopped these tragedies from happening to more \nfamilies. And that is why I introduced, the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and \nCars Safety Act, a bill to improve the child safety features in new \nvehicles.\n  This bill is named in honor of a 2-year-old Long Island boy who was \nkilled when his father accidentally backed over him in his driveway.\n  The Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act would make new \npassenger motor vehicles safer in three important ways. First, it \nrequires a detection system to alert drivers to the presence of a child \nbehind the vehicle. Second, it calls on the Secretary of Transportation \nto examine power windows technology that reverses panel direction when \nit detects an obstruction--preventing children from being trapped, \ninjured, or killed. And, finally, the bill will require the vehicle \nservice break to be engaged in order to prevent vehicles from \nunintentionally rolling away.\n  The bill also establishes a child safety information program \nadministered by the Secretary of Transportation to collect nontraffic, \nnoncrash incident data and disseminate information to parents about \nthese hazards and ways to mitigate them.\n  This bill proves that with modest, cost-effective steps, we can \nprevent many tragic car-related accidents from occurring. Power window \nsensors, for example, cost around $10 a window. Brakeshift interlocks \nare already standard in most passenger vehicles but will cost only $5 \nwhere needed. Backover warning systems cost approximately $300 a car, \nfar cheaper than DVD and stereo systems. This inexpensive technology \ncould save thousands of children's lives.\n  I fought long and hard into the last hours of the 109th Congress to \nget this bill through, and I am proud to be working with families, \nadvocates, and many of my colleagues in the fight to get this bill \npassed.\n  I am proud to champion the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety \nAct of 2007 and urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nbill. Together, we can ensure that we have safer cars and safer kids \nacross our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/10/senate-section/article/S5926-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              MURPHY OIL AND THE EL DORADO PROMISE PROGRAM\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to \none of the top companies in the Nation and one that calls Arkansas \nhome, Murphy Oil. In the May 2007 issue of Reader's Digest, Murphy Oil \nwas named one of ``America's 100 Best'' in recognition of the El Dorado \nPromise scholarship program. Reader's Digest called the program the \n``Best Class Act'' and nothing could be more true.\n  El Dorado Promise was created through a $50 million gift from Murphy \nOil Company. The advent of the program guarantees that all local high \nschool graduates in the El Dorado community will be able to go to \ncollege. To be eligible for the program, students must, at minimum, \ngraduate from El Dorado High School, live in the school district, and \nattend El Dorado High between the 9th and 12th grades. Depending on how \nlong a student has lived in the school district, eligible students will \nreceive tuition and mandatory fees assistance for up to 5 years and \nequal to the highest yearly rate charged by an Arkansas public \nuniversity. Students must enroll in a community college or a 4-year \nuniversity--public or private, in Arkansas or out of State--and \nmaintain a 2.0 grade point average to remain eligible.\n  What a gift this is for this South Arkansas community and the \nfamilies that live there. According to the Washington Post, it is one \nof the most generous scholarship programs in the Nation. When the \nprogram was announced in January at a school assembly, many in \nattendance were brought to tears.\n  I want to commend Claiborne Deming, the president and CEO of Murphy \nOil, and the Murphy Oil board of directors for their vision and \ninvestment in the children of El Dorado. The commitment they are making \nto their community will provide wonderful opportunities for many \nArkansas families. Murphy Oil's unselfish gift also will elevate the \nlives of so many young people and allow them to fully participate in \nour global economy.\n  Many colleges are offering to participate in the program, and El \nDorado Promise is already sparking interest as other communities \nattempt to find ways to offer similar programs. I am also hopeful that \nthis scholarship program will set an example for other corporate \ncitizens to make investments in their communities. It can go beyond \ndollars and cents, too. The donation of technology or even time in the \nform of mentoring programs can have a meaningful impact on students and \ncommunities in ways that cannot be measured.\n  Education is a national investment in our most precious resource, our \nchildren. The knowledge and training they receive will provide them \nwith the tools they will carry with them for the rest of their lives. \nThe Nation's ability to lead responsibility in the world, to \neffectively confront emerging threats, and to complete in the global \neconomy will depend on providing all our future leaders with a quality \neducation. The El Dorado Promise is a quality investment in those \nchildren who will, no doubt, reap Murphy Oil its greatest return for \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/10/senate-section/article/S5926-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5926-S5927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO TROY BUCK\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, tonight the students who belong to \nthe Future Farmers of America chapter at Centerpoint High School \nlocated between Amity and Glenwood, AR, are having their annual \nbanquet. Some of these students will graduate next week and begin new \nchapters in their lives. While every teacher there has contributed to \nthe education of each student I rise to today to honor one teacher \nthere, Troy W. Buck.\n  Troy Buck is a native of Alpine, which is located in Clark County in \nthe southwest part of my State. He earned his bachelor's and master's \ndegrees in agriculture at the University of Arkansas-Fayetteville and \nhas spent 47 years in vocational agriculture impacting the lives of \ncountless students along the way.\n  Troy Buck taught for 21 years at Hope High School and built the Hope \nFFA chapter into the largest in the State. He then moved to Amity, \nwhich merged with Glenwood in 1995 to create the Centerpoint School \nDistrict. Today under Troy Buck's leadership, Centerpoint's FFA chapter \nhas almost 300 students, making it one of the State's largest. It \noperates the only school-supported meats lab in the State and recently \n98 acres was purchased for a school farm. In addition to his \neducational activities, Troy also farms 400 acres, most of which is in \npasture or hay. He runs 100 head of cattle, operates 2 breeder hen \nhouses, and produces Bermuda hay sold primarily to the racehorse market \nin nearby Hot Springs.\n  Troy Buck is also a volunteer in his community. The Rockefeller \nFoundation has recognized him as a leader in small communities. He \nhelped establish and build a building to house an ambulance service in \nAmity. Troy has\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\nalso helped establish volunteer fire departments and a community water \nsystem. He serves as president of Alpine Water Association and the \nAlpine Fire Department. He is a member of the Farm Credit Board, and \nserves on the State board of Arkansas Farm Bureau. Additionally, he is \na certified first responder.\n  My home State of Arkansas is fortunate to have men and women of Troy \nBuck's caliber who devote their lives to providing excellent education \nfor our children and improving the quality of life in our communities. \nI ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Troy Buck for his commitment \nand service to the State of Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/10/senate-section/article/S5927-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DEACON JOSEPH T.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 127 East Locust Street in Fairbury, Illinois, as the \n``Dr. Francis Townsend Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to designate the U.S. Post Office at 127 East Locust Street \nin Fairbury, IL, as the ``Dr. Francis Townsend Post Office Building.'' \nI am grateful to Senator Barack Obama, Mayor Robert Walter, Jr. and the \nFairbury City Council for their support of this legislation.\n  This legislation honors Dr. Francis Townsend, the creator of the \nTownsend old-age revolving pension plan, and his hometown of Fairbury, \nIL, a town which will celebrate its sesquicentennial anniversary this \nJune.\n  Dr. Francis E. Townsend, the son of a farmer, was born in January \n1867. He became a physician and served in the Army Medical Corps during \nWorld War I. Following his retirement from medicine, Dr. Townsend \ndeveloped an old-age pension plan for seniors during the Depression. \nThe Townsend Plan created a Federal pension of $200 a month paid to \nevery citizen age 60 and older, on the condition that the pensioner \nspend the entire sum within 30 days of receipt, in order to stimulate \nthe economy.\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\n  Dr. Townsend advocated tirelessly around the country on behalf of his \nplan and encouraged 25 million Americans to sign petitions to the White \nHouse and to Congress demanding that the Federal Government institute a \nrevolving old-age pension fund. It is likely that Townsend's efforts \nexpedited passage of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Social Security \nAct, a major New Deal initiative. The Social Security Act included \nmatching payments from the Federal Government, known as Old Age \nAssistance, and a national old-age annuity program. Though the \ninitiative fell short of Dr. Townsend's vision, he continued to press \nfor increased benefits to the elderly. Dr. Townsend's persistence \nhelped to sustain the movement for increased elder benefits.\n  Dr. Francis Townsend, an innovator and social activist, was a pivotal \nfigure in the antipoverty movement and became the leader of a social \nmovement. I am pleased to introduce this legislation to permanently and \npublicly recognize Dr. Townsend by naming this post office in Fairbury \nin his honor. Given Dr. Townsend's dedication to his community and his \ncommitment towards the improvement of society, the renaming of this \npost office would be a most appropriate way for us to express our \nappreciation to Dr. Townsend and to celebrate his contributions to our \nNation's pension programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1352\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DR. FRANCIS TOWNSEND POST OFFICE BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 127 East Locust Street in Fairbury, \n     Illinois, shall be known and designated as the ``Dr. Francis \n     Townsend Post Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Dr. Francis Townsend Post Office \n     Building''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 1353. A bill to nullify the determinations of the Copyright \nRoyalty Judges with respect to webcasting, to modify the basis for \nmaking such a determination, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, I come back to the floor to \nintroduce legislation to keep the Internet free of discrimination. For \nover a decade, people have tried to get their grubby hands all over the \nInternet and I have sprung into action to stop them. I have fought hard \nto prevent discrimination in the taxation of Internet commerce. I have \nfought hard to prevent discrimination on the content and applications \nlayer of the Internet. Now, I am back here one more time, to prevent \ndiscriminatory treatment against Internet radio companies and consumers \nof their product in how copyright royalties are collected.\n  Make no bones about it, the recent decision on copyright royalty fees \nby the Copyright Royalty Board is discrimination. The fees that \nwebcasters will have to pay will discriminate in favor of traditional \nradio broadcasting and satellite radio broadcasting, which pay a much \nlower percentage of their revenues in royalties.\n  The decision of the Copyright Royalty Board would increase royalties \non webcasters to levels between 300 and 1200 percent of their current \nroyalty fees. For most webcasters, the royalties will exceed their \ngross revenues. There are not many people who are going to stay in \nbusiness long when their costs exceed their revenues. This is certainly \nthe case for webcasters. That is why I am introducing the Internet \nRadio Equality Act today.\n  The Bipartisan Internet Radio Equality Act, that I am introducing \ntoday with my friend from Kansas, Senator Brownback, will prevent this \ndiscrimination. It does so by invalidating the decision of the \nCopyright Royalty Board and instead puts Internet radio on par with \nSatellite Radio, jukeboxes, and cable radio. Additionally, it has \nspecial protections in place for noncommercial webcasters, like \nNational Public Radio and college radio, to ensure that they can take \nadvantage of webcasting as well.\n  Unfortunately, time is of the essence in saving Internet radio. On \nJuly 15, if Congress does not intervene, collection of these new \nroyalty fees will begin. It is no coincidence that on the same day, if \nCongress does not intervene, that hundreds of thousands of Internet \nradio stations will be turned off for good. It is imperative that we \nact within the next 2 months to prevent this from happening.\n  I want to thank my friend from Kansas, Senator Brownback, for joining \nme in introducing this important legislation. I look forward to working \nwith him and Congressman Inslee, my friend from Washington, who has \nintroduced companion legislation in the House, to get the job done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1353\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat \nspaceports like airports under the exempt facility bond rules; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleagues, \nSenators Bingaman, Nelson of Florida, Hutchison, Domenici, Feinstein, \nand Dole, to introduce the Spaceport Equality Act of 2007, a bill to \nhelp bring additional investment to the space transportation industry.\n  Last summer, Kazakhstan launched its first satellite, catapulting \nthem into the space transportation industry. Also joining the race for \nspace launch capacity are Singapore, Australia, Canada, and the United \nArab Emirates, with seven new commercial spaceports proposed between \nthe four countries. With new entrants being added to the space \ntransportation marketplace, is the U.S. falling behind in the race for \naccess to space?\n  The U.S. once dominated the commercial satellilte-manufacturing field \nwith an average market share of 83 percent; however, that market share \nhas since declined to below 50 percent. The U.S. satellite industry \nfaces increasing pressure to consider the use of foreign launch \nvehicles and launch sites, due to the lack of sufficient domestic \nlaunch capability. An even smaller share of U.S. manufactured \nsatellites is actually launched from U.S. spaceports.\n  This past year, only 2 of the 21 commercial launches worldwide were \nlaunched from locations in the United States, that is less than 10 \npercent of the market share. This comes at a loss of billions of \ndollars to the U.S. economy.\n  These are just some of the many reasons why my colleagues and I are \nintroducing the Spaceport Equality Act.\n  The space economy is made up of manufacturers, service providers, and \ntechnologists in both the government and private sector that deploy and \noperate launch vehicles, satellites, and space platforms. Many everyday \ngoods and services rely on space infrastructure, including: broadcast, \ncable, and satellite television; global Internet services; satellite \nradio; and cellular and international phone calls.\n  Satellites are also used global positioning systems, known as GPS, \nwhich enables us to have hands-on directions in our cars and other \nvehicles. GPS is also influential in the trucking, aviation, and \nmaritime industries for day-to-day operations, and for our Nation's \nmilitary operations. Thousands of gas stations use inexpensive small \nsatellite dishes to connect to credit card networks so customers can \npay instantly at the pump. Satellites also generate 90 percent of the \nweather forecasting data in the U.S., and are used to track hurricanes, \ntsunamis, and other weather phenomenon.\n  These satellites are launched vertically atop of rockets, propelling \nthem into orbit in space. Because most U.S. space-launch facilities are \noperated by NASA and the Air Force, priority for launches at these \nfacilities is given to government projects. This means our commercial \nsatellite needs take a backseat to Government operations. This often \nleaves U.S. commercial satellite ventures without reliable launch \navailability.\n  This in turn has forced many companies seeking manufacturing and \nlaunch services toward our international competitors.\n  Commercial spaceports are subdivisions of State governments that \nprovide additional launch infrastructure than that which is available \nat Federal facilities. They attract and promote the U.S. commercial \nspace transportation industry. Spaceport authorities function much like \nairport and port authorities by providing economic and transportation \nincentives to the industry, which in turn benefits the surrounding \ncommunities. Many States are forming space authorities to pursue ways \nof developing space transportation infrastructure.\n  The Florida Space Authority, now known as ``Space Florida,'' was the \nfirst such entity, and was created as a subdivision of the Florida \nState Government by Florida's Governor and State legislature in 1989. \nSpace Florida focuses on expanding and strengthening my state's space \nindustry through partnering with the commercial space industry to \nimprove space transportation and to provide innovative, forward-\nthinking solutions to the challenges facing this evolving industry.\n  The last few years have begun a new phase in space exploration. \nSpaceports presently operate in Florida, California, Virginia, and \nAlaska, and efforts are currently underway in New Mexico and Oklahoma \nto establish spaceports for the new emerging space tourism industry. \nStill additional commercial spaceports have been considered in the \nfollowing states: Alabama, California, Montana, Nevada, Oklahoma, South \nDakota, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n  The commercial space transportation industry includes not only \nspaceports themselves, but also companies that develop the needed \ninfrastructure for testing and servicing launch vehicles. When \nincluding these industry partners with spaceports, at least 23 States \nare directly affected by the commercial space transportation industry. \nBoth spaceports and industry partners face increasing pressure from \nGovernment sponsored or subsidized competitors in various countries \nacross Europe, and also in China, Japan, India, and Russia. And soon \nthey will face new competitors in Australia, Canada, Singapore, and the \nUnited Arab Emirates.\n  Commercial space transportation is a growing part of the U.S. \neconomy. In 2004, this industry alone generated a total of nearly $98.1 \nbillion in economic activity, more than $25 billion in earnings, and \nover 550,000 jobs. The Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, recently \nissued a report on 2006 launch activities, in that report, it was noted \nthat in 2006, U.S. launches generated approximately $140 million in \nrevenues.\n  A 2004 Gallup poll shows overwhelming public support for space \nexploration. Roughly 80 percent of Americans agree that ``America's \nspace program helps give America the scientific and technological edge \nit needs to compete in the international marketplace.'' and 76 percent \nagree that our space program ``benefits the nation's economy'' and \ninspires ``students to pursue careers in technical fields.''\n  The space industry has also led to a number of ``spin-off'' \ntechnologies,\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\nthose influenced by space technology research and development.\n  Home roof insulation and air filtration, anti-lock brakes, athletic \nshoes, vehicle protective airbags, cellular phones, and Lasik surgery \nall owe their development to space-based research and technology. The \nlist of space ``spin-off'' technologies is estimated to exceed 40,000. \nThese related technologies have helped employ tens of millions of \nAmericans. Encouraging commercial investment in the space industry and \nincreasing U.S. market share in this industry will certainly lead to \nadditional innovation and technology that will positively influence \nother fields.\n  As you can see, this once Government-dominated industry is now \nbecoming a diverse mix of Government and commercial entities, also \nleading the way into future avenues of commercial space transportation, \nsuch as space tourism.\n  The increase in recent commercial launches includes the debut of the \nfirst commercial crewed suborbital launches of SpaceShipOne, the \nbeginnings of public space travel. ``Space tourism,'' as public space \ntravel is now referred to, has the potential to become a major growth \nindustry. Recent market studies have shown that, within 20 years, space \ntourism has the potential to become a multibillion-dollar industry.\n  Even though the average American may not be able to participate in \npublic space travel, its potential impact on our economy and \ninternational competitiveness is something to be appreciated. Space \ntourism industry players expect there to be a market demand of at least \n15,000 Americans per year to travel into suborbit and orbital flights. \nThis would require an estimated 665 launches per year by 2010.\n  If the U.S. continues as is, we will only be able to capture a 10-\npercent market share, at best, of this emerging industry. If needed \ninfrastructure is added, however, the U.S. could potentially pick up 60 \nto 70 percent of space flight demand by 2010. Every launch that we do \nnot provide for in the U.S. means a loss to our economy, and a gain for \nour international competitors. The Federal Aviation Administration's \nCommercial Space Transportation division expects a $3 billion dollar \nloss to our economy if we do not meet the rising demand for space \ntourism.\n  Currently, U.S. launch facilities are few and most are owned and \noperated by the Federal Government, putting commercial users in direct \ncompetition with the U.S. military, NASA, and other Government entities \nthat, as I mentioned earlier, receive priority over commercial \nprojects.\n  Recently, the U.S. Air Force provided license to Space Exploration \nTechnologies, known as SpaceX, to utilize one of the decommissioned \nlaunch complexes at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for its commercial \nlaunch ventures.\n  The utilization of existing Federal resources by commercial ventures \nwill open up opportunity for further commercial launches, but this \nalone will not afford America the resources it needs to remain \ncompetitive internationally. If the U.S. is to remain competitive in \nthe commercial space industry, added and improved infrastructure will \nbe needed to support this growing industry.\n  On a more local note, my own State of Florida could stand to gain \nmuch by way of economic development from increased investment in \nSpaceport infrastructure.\n  According to recent studies, increased spaceport infrastructure and \nactivity in Florida could mean as much as $29.7 million in additional \neconomic activity by the year 2015, this does not include the economic \nactivity generated from increased tourism, secondary contracts, and \nspin-off technologies.\n  Other modes of transportation, highways, airports, and seaports, \ncurrently enjoy a tax incentive for meeting their infrastructure needs, \nso why not spaceports? Perhaps this policy made sense in the past, when \nspace did not have the enormous potential for commercial growth that it \nnow does. Our ability to utilize space is more apparent than ever \nbefore; we need to acknowledge this emerging reality.\n  This Spaceport Equality Act of 2007 would provide spaceports with the \nsame tax incentives granted to airports, seaports, rail, and other \ntransit projects under the exempt facility bond rules. With \ninternational competition on the rise, our Nation's spaceports are a \nvital component of the infrastructure needed to expand and enhance the \nU.S. role in the international space arena. The Spaceport Equality Act \nis an important step to increasing our competitiveness in this field, \nbecause it will stimulate investment in expanding and modernizing our \nspace launch facilities and lower the costs of financing spaceport \nprojects.\n  Since 1968, tax-exempt bonds have played a crucial role in meeting \nairport investment needs, with 50 percent or more of major airport \nprojects being financed through municipal tax-exempt bonds. By \nextending this favorable tax treatment to spaceports, this bill will \nhelp meet spaceport needs and increase our Nation's ability to compete \nwith expanded international interests in space exploration and \ntechnology. Similar legislation has been considered since the 1980s, \nand we cannot afford to wait any longer to address the needs of this \nimportant sector.\n  This proposal does not provide direct Federal spending to our \ncommercial space transportation industry, but rather, it creates the \nconditions necessary to stimulate private capital investment in \nindustry infrastructure. By issuing tax-free bonds to finance spaceport \ninfrastructure, space authorities could provide site-specific and \nvehicle-specific tailoring to promote the competition and innovation \nnecessary to maintain the U.S. competitive edge in the space \ntransportation industry.\n  This is an efficient means for achieving our space transportation \nneeds, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us in this most \nimportant effort by cosponsoring this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to require all gasoline \nsold for use in motor vehicles to contain 10 percent renewable fuel in \nthe year 2010 and thereafter, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today along \nwith Senator Johnson that will take a bold step in reducing our \ndependence on fossil fuel and foreign oil. It is the 10 by 10 Act.\n  The 10 by 10 Act will require that 10 percent of each gallon of motor \nfuel sold beginning January 1, 2010, contain at least 10 percent \nrenewable fuel. The 10 by 10 Act is a signal that Congress remains \ninterested and adamant in seeking energy independence by promoting the \ndevelopment of renewable fuels in the United States.\n  Because the U.S. imports more than 60 percent of the crude oil we \nneed, we have become dangerously reliant on foreign sources of energy. \nIt is a threat to our national security for the United States to be \ndependent upon countries like Iran and Venezuela for our energy needs. \nIt's also a threat to our economic security to be dependent on foreign \ncountries for the energy that drives our economy.\n  It is up to our farmers and ranchers to help liberate our consumers \nand our economy from the stranglehold of OPEC and other foreign \ncountries on our energy needs. I am here to say to America's \nagriculture community that we are serious and we are going to do \nsomething about it.\n  This legislation will demonstrate to consumers, in a common sense \nway, that each and every gallon of gasoline will contain at least 10 \npercent of domestically produced renewable fuel. It'll show that we're \nserious about reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and it will show \nin a tangible way that we're working to reduce that dependence.\n  The 10 by 10 Act is a commitment to our constituents that we're \nworking to lower that dependence, and reduce our consumption of foreign \noil in every gallon of fuel they pump. With this legislation, Americans \nwould know with certainty that 10 percent of each gallon of motor fuel \nwas home-grown by farmers and ranchers right here in America.\n  Today, ethanol, a renewable fuel produced primarily from corn, is \nblended in nearly 50 percent of the gasoline sold in the United States. \nThere are currently 116 biorefineries producing nearly 6 billion \ngallons of ethanol annually. By the end of 2009, it is projected that \nwe will have the capacity to produce over twelve billion gallons \nannually.\n  It is important for consumers to recognize that for the vast majority \nof cars on the road today, no modifications are necessary to operate on \na 10-percent renewable fuel blend. No significant changes are required \nto the fuel distribution network to allow for a 10-percent blend. The \nonly thing standing in the way of reduced dependence on foreign oil is \na signal from Congress that we recognize the virtue of home-grown \nalternatives to foreign oil.\n  With this legislation, we would ensure the use of approximately 14 \nbillion gallons of renewable fuels in our Nation's automobiles. The \nethanol use would be distributed around the country in each gallon of \ngasoline. In this way, we will ensure the use of the fuel even if an \nextensive E-85 market is not yet in place. This effort could very well \nbe a stepping stone if it's determined that ethanol could be blended in \nhigher ratios, such as 15 or 20 percent. By blending in each gallon of \ngasoline, we ensure the benefits of homegrown, renewable fuels reach \nall consumers without the immediate need for additional fueling \ninfrastructure or alternative fuel vehicles.\n  We owe it to the American people to pursue aggressive policies to \nfree our country from our foreign oil dependence. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in this effort to replace 10 percent of each gallon of \ngasoline with homegrown, environmentally friendly, renewable fuel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1358\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve health care for severely injured members \nand former members of the Armed Forces, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Bridging the \nGap for Wounded Warriors Act to provide comprehensive solutions to \nproblems that have arisen from military bureaucracy's failure to meet \nthe medical needs of this generation's wounded warriors as they \ntransition from the Armed Services to civilian life.\n  This is a moment of profound challenge for our country, for our \nmilitary, and for our men and women in uniform. And while there are \noften strong disagreements here in Washington, I hope we can unite \naround our common values and patriotism when it comes to how we treat \nour servicemembers and veterans.\n  If you serve your country your country should serve you. That is the \npromise our country must keep to the men and women who enlist, who \nfight, and who return home often bearing the visible and invisible \nscars of sacrifice. Sadly, too often in the past several years, that \npromise has been broken: whether it's a lack of up-armored vehicles on \nthe ground in Iraq or a lack of appropriate care in outpatient \nfacilities at Walter Reed.\n  Last year, I authored and passed into law the Heroes at Home \ninitiative to assist returning servicemembers experiencing the complex, \ndiffuse, and life-altering symptoms of traumatic brain injury and other \nmental health difficulties.\n  This past March, I followed up with the introduction of the Heroes at \nHome Act of 2007, S. 1065, the Restoring Disability Benefits for \nInjured and Wounded Warriors Act of 2007, S. 1064, and the Protecting \nMilitary Family Financial Benefits Act of 2007, S. 1063, to serve our \nservicemembers and send a message: you will be treated as heroes before \ndeployment, during deployment, and upon returning home. You didn't \noffer excuses and do not deserve to be offered excuses by your country.\n  Finally, Senator Evan Bayh and I introduced the Traumatic Brain \nInjury Access to Options Act, S. 1113, in order to provide a temporary \nand immediate solution to the discrepancy in health care services and \nbenefits encountered by TBI patients.\n  However, a broader and permanent solution is needed to assist all \nmembers and former members of the Armed Services who have incurred any \ntype of combat-related injury. The mistreatment of servicemembers at \nWalter Reed and testimony from recent hearings in both the Senate Armed \nServices and Veterans Affairs Committees have revealed major gaps \naffecting servicemembers, including discrepancies in benefits for \nactive duty and medically retired servicemembers; difficulties in \nobtaining needed care for wounded servicemembers transitioning from the \nArmed Services to civilian life; and disparities between the DoD and VA \ndisability rating systems.\n  Although the military, more often than not, offers quality health \ncare services, wounded servicemembers often encounter barriers to \nreceiving the optimal health benefit. The two major barriers are: (1) a \nconfusing array of benefits; and (2) discrepancies between benefits for \nthose on active duty versus those who are medically retired.\n  Recent events at Walter Reed have highlighted the longstanding need \nto overhaul the DoD and VA disability rating systems, which are \nunnecessarily complex and result in delays in payment that hinder \nefforts of wounded servicemembers to support themselves and their \nfamilies. On March 6, 2007, the Chief of Staff of the Army General \nPeter Schoomaker and then-Army Surgeon General Lieutenant General Kevin \nC. Kiley testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that \nsoldiers appearing before the Physical Evaluation Board were ``short-\nchanged'' and had not received appropriate disability benefits. \nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, since the enactment of \nthe Traumatic Servicemembers Group Life Insurance program at least 45 \npercent of claims have been denied. In March 2006 the Comptroller \nGeneral issued GAO Report 06-362: Military Disability System: Improved \nOversight Needed to Ensure Consistent and Timely Outcomes for Reserve \nand Active Duty Service Members--the Department of Defense did not heed \nthe recommendations provided in this report and as a result injured and \nwounded warriors continue to languish in an inefficient and adversarial \ndisability system. We must stop short-changing our wounded warriors.\n  Finally, a blanket overlap of benefits and disability rating reform \nare necessary but not sufficient for addressing the needs of those who \nare wounded. In order to support an all-volunteer force and meet the \nneeds of this generation's wounded warriors, it is critical to achieve \nefficient DoD and VA collaboration and coordination of assistance to \nmembers of the Armed Forces in their transition from Active Duty to \ncivilian life. Thus, the duties of the existent VA Office of Seamless \nTransition must be terminated and transferred to a new organizational \nstructure that will achieve the long-sought goals of seamless \ntransition between the DoD and VA and improved coordination between \nthese agencies.\n  That's why I am introducing the Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors \nAct today, to ensure a continuum of care for severely injured \nservicemembers and fix the problems that stymie the transition process. \nI am grateful to have developed this proposal with the Wounded Warrior \nProject, the National Military Family Association, and the Military \nOfficers Association of America.\n  We should provide our wounded warriors with the best care options \navailable. This legislation would establish a 2 year blanket overlap of \nactive duty and veterans health services and benefits for severely \ninjured service\nmembers to facilitate their recovery and help resolve administrative \nproblems like those found at Walter Reed. All costs of health care, for \nboth active duty and medically retired servicemembers, will be paid for \nby the DoD. The provisions of this section shall take effect for those \ninjured on or after October 7, 2001, but eligibility shall not include \nretroactive compensation for payments already made.\n  We should also create a joint DoD-VA Office of Transition for the \ncoordination of assistance to members of the Armed Forces in their \ntransition from service in the Armed Forces to civilian life. The \nOffice of Transition would absorb the duties of the existent VA Office \nof Seamless Transition as well as the functions and responsibilities of \napplicable offices within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, OSD. \nLeadership of the Office of Transition would consist of a Director and \nDeputy Director, who would both have seats on the Joint Executive \nCommittee, JEC. The Secretaries of DoD and VA would have oversight of \nthe Office of Transition, although the office would also be required to \nsubmit mandatory annual reports and biannual briefings to Congress. The \nGAO would also submit a biennial report on the Office of Transition's \nactivities, in order to ensure that the Office's progress is not being \nstymied by the DoD or VA.\n  Further, we should reform the current disability rating system to \nensure that there is continuity of medical care and no disruption in \ncompensation payments made to wounded service\nmembers. My legislation would change the roles of the agencies, so that \nDoD would no longer assign the actual disability rating but would still \ndetermine fitness for duty and document such a decision in writing, \nwhile VA would assign final ratings for all service-connected injuries. \nFurther, the legislation would repeal the provision in the Omnibus \nReconciliation Act of 1982 that requires the delay in payment of VA \nbenefits until the first day of the second month after they are \nentitled. This provision would eliminate the gap in payments and allow \nservicemembers to continue to support themselves and their families.\n  Finally, we should do what we can to ensure that both DoD and VA \nmedical facilities have the appropriate trained professionals to deal \nwith the range of injuries that our wounded servicemembers now incur, \nincluding\n\n[[Page S5937]]\n\ntraumatic brain injury, burns, amputations, vision problems, spinal \ncord injuries, and broken and fractured bones. In order to move in that \ndirection, my legislation would require the GAO to submit a preliminary \nassessment and final report on the extent to which medical facilities \nof the DoD and VA offer interdisciplinary medical treatment for wounded \nmembers of the Armed Forces.\n  Let us all join together in accepting our responsibility as a nation \nto those who serve and resolve to achieve efficient DoD and VA \ncollaboration and coordination that is critical for supporting an all-\nvolunteer force and meeting the needs of this generation's wounded \nwarriors.\n  I ask unanimous consent letters of support for this legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Military Officers\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                      Alexandria, VA, May 9, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: On behalf of the 362,000 members of \n     the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), I am \n     writing to express MOAA's appreciation for your leadership in \n     sponsoring the Bridging the Gap for Wounded Warriors Act. \n     This piece of legislation will ensure a continuum of care for \n     all the severely injured servicemembers from OIF and OEF.\n       The bill's three elements address the most significant \n     problems that currently stymie transition for our \n     servicemembers between DoD and VA programs. The two-blanket \n     overlap of health services addresses their health care \n     concerns. The transition office would institutionalize a \n     joint team of permanent DoD and VA personnel working together \n     to develop and implement solutions to long-standing, \n     unresolved transition issues. Finally, your bill would reform \n     the disability rating system to ensure fair and consistent \n     long-term compensation and benefits for wounded \n     servicemembers.\n       We are proud of and grateful for the sacrifices our \n     military members and their families are willing to make for \n     our country. The extreme sacrifices of the wounded have \n     earned and deserve our special attention, which your bill \n     would deliver. We look forward to working closely with you in \n     seeking timely enactment of this legislation in the 110th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Norb Ryan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 National Military\n\n\n                                     Family Association, Inc.,\n\n                                      Alexandria, VA, May 9, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The National Military Family \n     Association (NMFA) is the only national organization whose \n     sole focus is the military family and whose goal is to \n     influence the development and implementation of policies that \n     will improve the lives of the families of the Army, Navy, Air \n     Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and the Commissioned Corps \n     of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration. For more than 35 years, its staff \n     and volunteers, comprised mostly of military members, have \n     built a reputation for being the leading experts on military \n     family issues. On behalf of NMFA and the families it serves, \n     we commend your sponsorship of the Bridging the Gap for \n     Wounded Warriors Act.\n       NMFA thanks you for recognizing the problems wounded \n     service members face as they recover from their injuries. In \n     addition to the family stress and the often-lengthy recovery \n     process in multiple medical facilities, wounded service \n     members must also navigate a complex maze through two \n     distinct disability benefit processes, that of the Department \n     of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Veterans' Affairs \n     (VA). NMFA believes this legislation acknowledges the need \n     for more coordination between the DoD and VA to create a \n     truly seamless transition for these service members and ease \n     the care burden on their families. NMFA endorses this \n     legislation as a first step in addressing the need for a \n     standardized approach to the DoD Medical Evaluation Board \n     (MEB), and Physical Evaluation Board (PEB) plus determination \n     for VA Disability Compensation. The legislation would also \n     respond to the need for wounded service members to receive \n     consistent quality care in both health care systems and for \n     the establishment of a ``joint office'' to address these \n     concerns.\n       Thank you for your support of military service members and \n     veterans diagnosed with TBI, and the families who care for \n     them. If you have any questions you may contact Barbara \n     Cohoon in our Government Relations department.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Tanna K. Schmidli,\n     Chairman, Board of Governors.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Wounded Warrior Project,\n\n                                        New York, NY, May 9, 2007.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The Wounded Warrior Project (WWP) \n     strongly supports your legislation entitled the Bridging the \n     Gap for our Wounded Warriors Act. As a result of WWP's \n     direct, daily contact with the severely injured and their \n     families, we have identified three consistent issues causing \n     confusion and frustration among those most in need of \n     assistance. A discrepancy in benefits between the Departments \n     of Defense and Veterans Affairs, confusion during the actual \n     transition process, and the inconsistent and redundant \n     disability ratings system are all problems cited by the \n     wounded as obstacles they face as they attempt to recover. \n     The comprehensive provisions included in your bill will \n     address many of these issues and provide access to the care \n     and compensation our nation's heroes need as they continue in \n     their recovery.\n       The first provision would establish a two-year overlap of \n     active duty and veterans benefits and services for severely \n     injured servicemembers. By removing the artificial barrier \n     between active duty service and veterans status, the bill \n     would allow those who are injured to enjoy the differing \n     benefits and health care services offered by each agency \n     regardless of their duty status.\n       The second provision would establish a joint DoD-VA Office \n     of Transition to improve assistance from the two agencies as \n     members of the Armed Forces move from the Department of \n     Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs. While there \n     are currently many entities within each agency charged with \n     assisting transitioning servicemembers, the creation of a \n     joint office with oversight over these programs and policies \n     will ensure a more coordinated effort on behalf of our \n     wounded servicemembers.\n       Finally, the legislation would reform the current \n     disability ratings system to ensure consistency and fairness \n     in the ratings while providing immediate compensation for \n     those leaving the service.\n       These provisions will go far towards insuring the long term \n     health and well-being of wounded service members. Again, WWP \n     thanks you for your leadership on these issues, and we stand \n     committed to assisting you in seeing this legislation through \n     to passage and enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Meredith Beck,\n                                         National Policy Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1364. A bill to amend titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security \nAct to extend the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIPS) \nand stremline enrollment under SCHIP and Medicaid, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, over 25 years ago, a member of the Select \nPanel for the Promotion of Child Health said in a statement to \nCongress, ``Children are one-third of our population and all of our \nfuture.'' We must protect the health and welfare of our nation's \nchildren if we are to secure the future of our country. This year we \nhave a tremendous opportunity to ensure that security. With the \nreauthorization of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nSCHIP, we can improve the health and health care of our Nation's \nfuture, for the over 70 million children in America and, in particular, \nthe 9 million children who have no health coverage.\n  Since the creation of SCHIP 10 years ago, more than 6.2 million \nchildren have been covered by this vital program, including over \n290,000 children in Illinois. As the first State to provide coverage \nfor all children, Illinois has been a leader in the movement to change \nthe course of health care in this country. Since 1993, SCHIP, its \nrelationship to Medicaid, and the flexibility that this administration \nhas permitted the programs to have, have made it possible for Illinois \nto provide health care to the more than 313,000 children who did not \nhave access to it before.\n  Nearly 1 million Illinois families have at least one uninsured family \nmember, and the face of the uninsured is changing. The uninsured are \nnot only the mother and daughter living in downtown Chicago. The \nuninsured includes the family who runs a small business in the suburbs, \nthe family farm in central Illinois, and the single father working at a \nfactory downstate.\n  The majority of kids without health care coverage come from working \nfamilies, families like Mr. and Mrs. Buss and their three young sons. \nLisa Buss and her husband own a small home inspection company. They \npaid over $9,000 last year alone on regular medical care, without any \ncatastrophic events or emergencies. That's a lot of money for a family \nliving in the suburbs of Chicago. There is also the Hickey family of \nGodfrey, Illinois. After an\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\nunfortunate accident, their son broke a couple of bones in his hand. \nWithout insurance, they were hesitant to see the specialist at the \nsuggestion of the emergency room physicians, but for the health of \ntheir son, they did so. For a 5 minute visit, they paid close to \n$1,000. Mr. Hickey works in the construction trade and work had been \nslow. Susan is a teacher for the Alton School District. They were given \nno financial assistance except to be offered a payment plan. Now, the \nHickeys have to find a way to pay for their house payment and their \nutilities, rising gas prices, and this medical treatment.\n  The unnecessary burden and anxiety caused by health care is an \nunfortunate reality for too many, and children often bear the brunt of \nthis hardship. Kids should not have to wait until their fever is 103 \ndegrees to see a doctor. Kids should be able to obtain glasses when \nthey are straining to see the chalkboard. Kids should be able to obtain \nantibiotics when that ``cold'' just won't go away. Our parents should \nnot have to worry about whether they can afford to take their son to a \nbone specialist.\n  As is often the case, States are leading the way with children's \nhealth coverage initiatives. In 2005, my State of Illinois was the \nfirst State to ensure health care coverage for all children. Since \nthen, many States have taken on the challenge of expanding health care \ncoverage. The State of the States 2007 report by AcademyHealth \nindicates that more than a dozen States have enacted innovative \npolicies to expand coverage. These range from comprehensive health care \nreform in States such as Massachusetts, Vermont, and Maine; to public-\nprivate partnerships in States such as Arkansas, Montana, New Mexico, \nOklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Utah; to initiatives to cover \nall children in Illinois and Pennsylvania.\n  Democratic and Republican governors alike are exploring ways to reach \nthe uninsured, proving that children's health and health care coverage \nare American issues, not partisan issues. One important way to insure \nmore children is through a strong reauthorization of SCHIP.\n  Today, with the introduction of the Healthy Kids Act, I propose SCHIP \nreauthorization legislation that builds on the progress made in these \nStates. First, the bill provides States with more funding to enroll \nchildren who are eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP. These kids account \nfor more than half of all uninsured children.\n  Second, the Healthy Kids Act will eliminate obvious barriers to \ncoverage and simplify enrollment procedures. For example, seven States \nhave reported declines in Medicaid enrollments because of new \ncitizenship requirements. Approximately 65 percent of internists report \nserving patients with Limited English Proficiency; for children living \nin these families, making language assistance services available is a \ncritical precursor to quality care. My bill proposes options for States \nto reach the neediest children through SCHIP by reducing some of these \nbarriers. For example, the bill provides for funds for language \nassistance services.\n  Third, the bill also supports the establishment of medical homes, a \nnetwork of providers for children that helps prevent them from falling \nthrough the cracks. The bill puts forth an effort to create pediatric \nquality and performance measures. The Healthy Kids Act also establishes \na disease prevention and treatment demonstration project for ethnic and \nracial minority children, using research that specifically examines \ndisparities in minority children enrolled in Medicaid/SCHIP. We can \nreduce health disparities and improve health outcomes for this \npopulation.\n  Finally, the bill creates a commission to study children's health \ncoverage. The Commission on Children's Health Coverage will develop \npolicy recommendations and track the program's overall performance. \nFeedback and analysis of SCHIP's performance is critical to improving \nthe program in the future.\n  SCHIP has been an unparalleled success and a model for health \ninsurance coverage that both Democrats and Republicans can be proud of. \nEnsuring health care coverage for children in need is a priority for \nboth sides of the aisle. The reauthorization of SCHIP is a rare \nopportunity for the Federal Government to expand its support for \npolicies in States like Illinois and others. Let's take a step forward \nand work to provide basic health insurance for all children. Healthy \nchildren grow into healthy adults, in turn, these individuals are \nhappier and spend less money on health care in the long run. The SCHIP \nprogram is critical for our Nation's health and economic future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1364\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Services Act to provide \nmethamphetamine prevention and treatment services; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am honored today to introduce the \nMethamphetamine Abuse Treatment and Prevention Act. Meth is one of the \nmost deadly, addictive, rapidly spreading drugs in history. It is \nravaging rural and urban communities alike. And it is leaving a path of \ndestruction, human, financial, and environmental, that is staggering.\n  We've seen violent crime increase significantly for the first time in \nmore than a decade. This increase was most evident in the meth-plagued \nMidwest. We must realize meth abuse is not only a State problem, but a \nnational problem that is threatening communities across the country.\n\n[[Page S5949]]\n\n  Law enforcement efforts to curb the distribution of dangerous meth \nmaking chemicals and locking up fertilizers have been successful. In \nIowa, we've reduced the number of meth labs by nearly 80 percent. But \nour effort to fight meth is not over. Unfortunately, many States have \nseen dramatic increases in the amount of crystal meth or ``ice'' \nsmuggled into the State. Ice is a much purer and more dangerous form of \nthe illegal stimulant. Addicts who no longer have access to meth \nmanufactured through home labs are using this more dangerous form. This \ndrug puts a heavy toll on our communities, our justice and health care \nsystem, and tears apart families.\n  We need to remember that the meth epidemic is a double scourge. It is \na public safety crisis. And it is also a public health crisis. Even if \nwe shut down every home-based lab, we would still have a meth problem \nin this country. It will not go away until we do a better job of \npreventing people from using meth in the first place and giving addicts \nthe treatment they need to kick the habit for good.\n  Bear in mind that meth is more addictive than crack cocaine or \nheroin. More than 50 percent of meth users started when they were under \nage 18. Law enforcement officers across Iowa tell me that prevention \nand treatment are the keys to stopping this epidemic.\n  Yet this is exactly where we are falling short. There are 22 million \nAmericans in need of treatment for substance addiction. Less than 3 \nmillion are able to get help. The bill I am introducing today would \naggressively step up efforts to prevent meth addiction and provide more \ntreatment options.\n  Given the highly addictive nature of methamphetamine, prevention is \ncrucial. Over 50 percent of meth users started when they were under age \n18. We must target our efforts to ensure that people do not ever start \nusing meth. My bill provides grants to schools and communities for meth \nprevention programs. It creates a telephone helpline and an online \nparent resource center. When parents or family members want information \non keeping their children safe from drugs, or they fear a young person \nis experimenting or in trouble with drugs, this telephone helpline and \nInternet resource will give live, real-time support and information, as \nwell as referrals to community resources.\n  At the same time, the bill takes a comprehensive approach to \ntreatment. We know that with proper treatment, meth addicts can recover \nand live productive lives. Every dollar spent on treatment saves \ntaxpayers seven dollars, largely by reducing crime, incarceration, and \nhealth care costs. The bill that I am introducing today is designed to \nrealize these savings by promoting a comprehensive approach to meth \ntreatment.\n  This legislation promotes range of treatment options. First, it \nincludes family-based treatment. Parental substance use is the culprit \nin at least 70 percent of all child welfare spending, yet only 10 \npercent of child welfare agencies are able to successfully find \nsubstance abuse programs for mothers and children. Comprehensive \ntreatment specifically for parents can assist them in recovering and \nproviding safe and nurturing environments for their children. This \nlegislation provides critical resources for adolescent and family-based \ntreatment services to ensure that young people and parents are able to \naccess the treatment they need.\n  Second, this legislation includes grants to offer treatment services \nfor nonviolent adults and juveniles as an alternative to jail and \ndetention. Nearly 80 percent of those in jail have been identified as \nhaving a substance abuse problem and one-third of inmates reported \nbeing under the influence at the time of their offense. We must provide \ntreatment in order to prevent recidivism and cycling through the \njustice system.\n  My bill also improves services to help recovering addicts make the \ntransition from treatment to the community, including housing \nassistance and help finding work, education, and mental health \nservices. These things are critical to long-term abstinence and \nrecovery.\n  I ask for your help now in joining me to fighting the meth epidemic \nthat is plaguing our country. This drug tears apart families and is a \nheavy burden on our communities, our justice and health care system. We \nmust dedicate the time and resources to getting this problem under \ncontrol and we must do it now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/10/senate-section/article/S5949-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5949-S5950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 192--RECOGNIZING NATIONAL NURSES WEEK ON MAY 6 \n                          THROUGH MAY 12, 2007\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 192\n\n       Whereas, since 2003, National Nurses Week is celebrated \n     annually from May 6, also known as National Nurses Day, \n     through May 12, the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the \n     founder of modern nursing;\n       Whereas National Nurses Week is the time each year when \n     nurses are recognized for the critical role they play in \n     providing safe, high quality, and preventative health care;\n       Whereas nurses are the cornerstone of the Nation's complex \n     health care system, representing the largest single component \n     of the health care profession, with an estimated 2,900,000 \n     registered nurses in the United States;\n       Whereas, according to a study published in the New England \n     Journal of Medicine in May 2002, a higher proportion of \n     nursing care provided by registered nurses and a greater \n     number of hours of care by registered nurses per day are \n     associated with better outcomes for hospitalized patients;\n       Whereas nurses are experienced researchers and their work \n     encompasses a wide scope of scientific inquiry including \n     clinical research, health systems and outcomes research, and \n     nursing education research;\n       Whereas nurses are currently serving the Nation admirably \n     in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan;\n       Whereas nurses help inform and educate the public to \n     improve the practice of all nurses and, more importantly, the \n     health and safety of the patients they care for;\n       Whereas our Nation continues to face a nursing shortage \n     unprecedented in its depth and duration, with a projected \n     1,200,000 new and replacement nurses needed by 2014;\n       Whereas the nationwide nursing shortage has caused \n     dedicated nurses to work longer hours and care for more \n     acutely ill patients;\n       Whereas nurses are strong allies to Congress as they help \n     inform, educate, and work closely with legislators to improve \n     the education, retention, recruitment, and practice of all \n     nurses and, more importantly, the health and safety of the \n     patients they care for; and\n       Whereas nurses are an integral part of the health care \n     delivery team and provide quality care, support, and \n     education to patients and their families, conduct essential \n     research, and serve as strong patient advocates: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the significant contributions of nurses to \n     the health care system of the United States;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of National Nurses Week, \n     as founded by the American Nurses Association; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     National Nurses Week with appropriate recognition, \n     ceremonies, activities, and programs to demonstrate the \n     importance of nurses to the everyday lives of patients.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sincere \nappreciation for the more than 2.9 million nurses in our country. In \nrecognition of National Nurses Week, May 6 through 12, I am pleased to \nintroduce a resolution with Senators Mikulski and Snowe to commemorate \nthis week and the valuable role of nurses nationwide.\n  Our resolution honors the contributions that nurses make day--after \nday--on the front lines of patient care. We do not thank nurses as \noften as we should. Nurses are an invaluable resource not only to our \nhealth care system but also to medical research--in health systems and \noutcomes, in nursing education, and in clinical settings. They serve \nour Nation admirably in our communities and in our military, including \nthe current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Nurses do so much for our country, yet one of the biggest challenges \nfacing our health care system today is a shortage of nurses. According \nto an April 2006 report by the American Hospital Association, we need \napproximately 118,000 registered nurses to fill vacant positions \nnationwide. By 2020, there will be a shortfall of more than 1 million \nnurses.\n  The problem is not a lack of interest by capable people willing to be \ntrained. The issue is a lack of faculty to educate future nurses. Last \nyear, nursing colleges across the Nation denied admission to more than \n40,000 qualified\n\n[[Page S5950]]\n\napplicants from entry-level and graduate nursing education programs, \nincluding almost 2,000 in my State of Illinois alone. Over 71 percent \nof the schools surveyed cited the lack of faculty as the primary reason \nthat qualified students were turned away. Nursing schools need the \nresources to teach and train a new generation of nurses and nurse \neducators.\n  This is why I introduced the Nurse Education, Expansion, and \nDevelopment, or NEED, Act. This act would provide schools of nursing \nwith grants to hire and retain new faculty, purchase educational \nequipment, enhance clinical laboratories, and repair and expand \ninfrastructure--some of the very problems that keep nursing schools \nfrom enrolling additional students today.\n  The Illinois Nurses Association's theme for National Nurses Week this \nyear is Working Together to Make a Difference, and when it comes to the \nnursing shortage, we all should adopt this theme. Strengthening nursing \nschools, increasing the number of graduates, and driving up the quality \nof care with an adequate supply of nurses depends on all of us working \ntogether.\n  Nurses care for us and our loved ones when we are at our most \nvulnerable. The difference they make in our lives, their dedication, \nand their enormous contributions are an important part of our country's \nstrength.\n  This week--and always--we honor their efforts and thank them for all \ntheir work in keeping our Nation healthy and strong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/10/senate-section/article/S5950-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 193--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MAY 6 THROUGH MAY 12, \n2007, AS ``NORTH AMERICAN OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH WEEK'' AND MAY \n    9, 2007, AS ``OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH PROFESSIONAL DAY''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Kennedy) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 193\n\n       Whereas every year more than 5,700 people die from job-\n     related injuries and 4,400,000 more suffer occupational \n     injuries and illnesses;\n       Whereas transportation crashes continue to be the number 1 \n     cause of on-the-job deaths, and overall in 2005 there were \n     6,159,000 transportation accidents resulting in 43,433 \n     deaths, 2,700,000 injuries, and an estimated $230,600,000,000 \n     in tangible costs;\n       Whereas every day millions of people go to and return home \n     from work safely due, in part, to the efforts of many unsung \n     heroes, such as occupational safety, health, and \n     environmental practitioners, who work day in and day out \n     identifying hazards and implementing safety and health \n     advances in all industries and at all workplaces, aimed at \n     eliminating workplace fatalities, injuries, and illnesses;\n       Whereas these occupational safety, health, and \n     environmental professionals and members of the American \n     Society of Safety Engineers work to prevent accidents, \n     injuries, and occupational diseases, create safer work and \n     leisure environments, and develop safer products, and are \n     committed to protecting people, property, and the \n     environment;\n       Whereas the work of these professionals in the areas of \n     occupational safety, health promotion, disease prevention, \n     and wellness programs has contributed greatly to the \n     improvement of overall employee health, increased \n     productivity, and reduction in health care costs, and yields \n     significant returns on investments in occupational safety and \n     health for the employer;\n       Whereas our society has long recognized that a safe and \n     healthy workplace positively impacts employee morale, health, \n     and productivity;\n       Whereas the more than 30,000 members of the American \n     Society of Safety Engineers, along with the more than 150,000 \n     combined members of the Academy of Certified Hazardous \n     Materials Managers (ACHMM), the American Association of \n     Occupational Health Nurses, Inc., (AAOHN), the American \n     Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), and the American \n     National Standards Institute (ANSI), are occupational safety, \n     health, and environmental practitioners dedicated to keeping \n     people safe at work and protecting property and the \n     environment;\n       Whereas the purpose of North American Occupational Safety \n     and Health Week (NAOSH) is to increase understanding of the \n     benefits of investing in occupational safety and health, to \n     demonstrate the positive impact that integrating effective \n     safety and health programs in the workplace and the community \n     has on the economy and business, to raise awareness of the \n     role and contribution of safety, health, and environmental \n     professionals in all areas, and to reduce workplace injuries \n     and illnesses by increasing awareness and implementation of \n     safety and health programs;\n       Whereas the theme of NAOSH Week 2007 is all modes of \n     transportation safety, particularly stressing that motor \n     vehicle drivers should drive wisely to save lives; and\n       Whereas on May 9 occupational safety and health \n     professionals will be recognized during the second annual \n     Occupational Safety and Health Professional Day for the work \n     they do to keep people safe at work: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of May 6 through May 12, 2007, to \n     be ``North American Occupational Safety and Health Week'' \n     (NAOSH) and May 9, 2007, to be ``Occupational Safety and \n     Health Professional Day'';\n       (2) commends occupational safety, health, and environmental \n     practitioners for their ongoing commitment to protecting \n     people, property, and the environment;\n       (3) commends those businesses that encourage a strong \n     safety culture and incorporate occupational safety and health \n     into their business strategies;\n       (4) encourages all industries, organizations, community \n     leaders, employers, and employees to join with the American \n     Society of Safety Engineers to support activities aimed at \n     increasing awareness of the importance of preventing illness, \n     injury, and death in the workplace, during the week of May 6 \n     through May 12, 2007, and throughout the year;\n       (5) recognizes the commitment of occupational safety and \n     health professionals in their ongoing work to protect people, \n     property, and the environment on May 9, 2007, Occupational \n     Safety and Health Professional Day;\n       (6) urges everyone to observe the theme of NAOSH Week and \n     drive responsibly;
