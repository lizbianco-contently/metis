Mr. President, Senator Biden and I are delighted to \nwelcome to the Senate today the Rev. Dr. Patricia Bryant Harris, who \npastors at a church not far from where Senator Biden and I live in \nnorthern Delaware.\n  In her prayer this morning, she called on God to grant us wisdom. It \nis not infrequently, when our Senators meet with our own Senate \nChaplain, Barry Black, that he, too, prays for us for wisdom and \nencourages us to ask God for wisdom as we deliberate the issues that \nare before us. As Senator Biden and the Presiding Officer know, the \nissues before us this week have been difficult and we needed all the \nwisdom we could garner.\n  I have been privileged to know Reverend Harris for close to two \ndecades. She has had a career that included remarkable accomplishments \nin the private sector and then, somewhere in the 1990s, she decided she \nfelt a calling from God to enter the ministry. She has done that as a \nMethodist pastor in our State and a series of assignments--actually an \nassignment that led her down to Salisbury, MD, and the Delmarva \nPeninsula, where she oversaw a great number of churches.\n  As we could tell from her prayer, she is a loving, giving, caring, \npatient person. She is one who has reminded me, and I think reminds her \ncongregants in her own home church in Marshalltown, that God wants us \nto do two things--if nothing else, to do two things: To love the Lord \nthy God with all thy heart, soul, and mind and to love thy neighbor as \nthyself.\n  Barry Black, our Chaplain, oftentimes reminds us in the Senate--as \nSenators we ask how do we use our faith to help inform what we do as \nSenators, and he always takes us back to that second great commandment, \nand so does Reverend Harris, that we have an obligation to love our \nneighbor as ourselves.\n  She also reminds me and reminds those who worship at her church that \nwe have an obligation to those who are hungry--when they are hungry we \nhave an obligation to feed them; when they are naked we have an \nobligation to clothe them; when they are thirsty we have an obligation \nto give them to drink; when they are sick and in prison we have an \nobligation, regardless of what our faith is, to visit them.\n  Those are wonderful lessons, not just for the people in her \ncongregations over the years; not just for those who worship in our \nState but wonderful lessons for us in the Senate.\n  It is with great pride that Senator Biden and I welcome Reverend \nHarris today to help get us started on the right foot and to do not \njust the Senate's business, not just the business of our country but \nthe Lord's business as well.\n  With that having been said, I know Senator Biden is here and he wants \nto comment. I am delighted to welcome Senator Harris--Senator Harris? \nThere was a Senator Harris, there may be another one someday too--I am \ndelighted\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\nto join him in welcoming Reverend Harris today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Rev. Dr. Harris is capable of being a Senator. She has \nthe capability and competence to do any number of jobs I can think of.\n  I compliment my colleague for inviting the Rev. Dr. Harris to open \nthe Senate this morning. As you could tell by Senator Carper's \nreference to Reverend Harris, Senator Carper is a man of deep faith, as \nI know the Chair is and as I am. We share different faiths, but we \nshare a common set of values, as almost all the confessional faiths do, \nnot just the Christian faith which we share. I am a Roman Catholic, my \nfriend is a Presbyterian, and Dr. Harris is a Methodist.\n  The thing about Dr. Harris--and I will not take a lot of the Senate's \ntime--the thing about Dr. Harris that has impressed me from the many \nyears--my Lord, I think it may be more than a couple decades. I have \nknown her a long time. She was an incredibly well-respected figure in \nmy State before she went to the ministry--before. Since then, she has \ncarried on that same path of excellence that she did prior to the \nministry. But if I can take a page from my colleague's book in \nreferencing Dr. Harris's opening prayer, she talked about wisdom, which \nshe knows we need in abundance. But she also talked about--she used the \nword that, if I had to describe her, would be the word I would use. She \ntalked about tolerance. The thing that most impresses me about the Rev. \nDr. Harris is her literal--not figurative, not rhetorical--commitment \nto the notion of tolerance.\n  She has such an expansive view of human nature. She has such a \nwelcoming--not only faith but personality.\n  I think if I had a wish, if the Lord came down and sat at my desk and \nsaid: Joe, you get one wish. What is the one attribute you would like \nto pervade this Chamber? Maybe even more than wisdom, it would be \ntolerance.\n  Tolerance is not engaging in relativity. Tolerance does not mean we \ndon't have strong beliefs and strong opinions and strong positions on \nfaith. Tolerance is what not only our Christian religion teaches us but \nJudaism and Islam and Hinduism. It is about tolerance. It seems to me \nthat is the single most lacking element in American society today.\n\n  I think if you get to know her--you are not going to get to know her, \nI realize that is a bit of an exaggeration--I hope you get a chance to \nengage Rev. Dr. Harris today. She exudes the notion of tolerance which \nequates with her notion of equality. It gets to what--I will conclude--\nmy friend Tom said, the two great commandments: love thy God and love \nthy neighbor. This is all about loving thy neighbor. We are the single \nmost heterogenous democracy in the history of mankind. It is unable to \nfunction--I look at the pages wondering: What is this old guy saying? \nThis country is unable to function without the lubricant of tolerance. \nAnd Dr. Harris embodies that.\n  I am honored to be here this morning with her. I, again, compliment \nmy colleague on not only his comments but inviting Dr. Harris to be \nhere and introducing her to all of you and to those who are watching C-\nSPAN this morning, watching her.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6512-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, following the remarks of Senator McConnell \nand myself, there will be an hour for debate prior to a cloture vote on \nthe motion to disagree in the House amendments with respect to H.R. \n3221, the housing reform legislation. Senators should expect a cloture \nvote to begin sometime around an hour from now.\n  Last night we reached an agreement to consider the nomination of \nGeneral Petreaus and Lieutenant General Odierno at a time to be \ndetermined by me and the Republican leader. We will set a time to do \nthose votes. There will be 20 minutes of debate, equally divided and \ncontrolled between the chairman and ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee, prior to votes on their confirmations.\n  Finally, last night we were unable to get consent to move to global \nAIDS legislation, and therefore it necessitated my filing cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to the bill. I am hopeful we can reach some kind \nof agreement on a way to proceed.\n  I had a conversation on the floor with Senator Kyl, a public \nconversation on the floor. He is hopeful and confident something can be \nworked out. I hope that, in fact, is the case. As I have indicated, \nthis is one of President Bush's pieces of legislation that he is \npushing. We, on this side, are ready to move forward on it. We would \nlike to be on something that is agreed upon between Senators Lugar and \nBiden and other people who have some interest in this matter. I hope \nthat can be done; otherwise, we are going to have a cloture vote on \nthat tomorrow.\n  I hope we can work something out. If not, I hope we would be allowed \nto proceed to this legislation. As I have indicated to the Republican \nleader, if cloture is not invoked on the motion to proceed, then that \nwill be the end of that legislation for this work period. If necessary, \nwe will have to come back to it in the next work period. But with time \nconstraints we have this work period, this is our opportunity to \ncomplete that legislation.\n  I have been told that S. 3236 is at the desk and is due for a second \nreading.\n  It obviously is not ready yet.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The matter will be read on the next \nlegislative day.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry about that, Mr. President.\n  We are going to vote in a short time on cloture, a final cloture vote \non this housing bill. It is so important we get this done as quickly as \npossible. I am disappointed in that Senator Shelby and Senator Dodd, \nwho worked very hard, had a little tight managers' package that would \nhave made it so much better to take to the House, but I have been told \nSenator DeMint is objecting to that. As we know, in the Senate, one \nperson can hold up things, and it is my understanding he is going to \nhold up things.\n  The reason it is important we do this and move forward on this \nlegislation, Mr. President, is that in the news today, the Associated \nPress reports that the number of homeowners stung by the rout in the \nU.S. housing market jumped as foreclosure filings grew by more than 50 \npercent compared to June a year ago.\n  Nationwide, 252,363 homes received foreclosure notices in June. That \nis 1 month. Foreclosure filings increased a year ago in all but 11 \nStates; in 39 States they went up.\n  The highest foreclosure rates: California, Arizona, Florida, \nMichigan, Nevada. This is a very desperate situation we find. It is \nmore than the people whose homes are being foreclosed upon; it affects \nneighborhoods where the homes are being foreclosed upon; it affects \ncommunities where the homes are being foreclosed upon. It affects, of \ncourse, the lenders who do not want to foreclose upon the homes. It is \na loss for them when they do that. It is a loss for the community where \nthe home is located because they lose revenues, tax revenues for that \nhome.\n  So foreclosure is a lose-lose situation. I hope everyone would \nunderstand the importance of it. I hope Senator DeMint would reconsider \nholding up this managers' package which has been worked on for more \nthan 2 months now by Senators Dodd and Shelby and other Senators.\n  But we are going to send it back to the House today, I hope today. I \nalso hope that Senators would not require the 30 hours to be used. But \nwe will see. They have that right, to use at least part of that 30 \nhours postcloture.\n  I am glad we are moving along. I hope we can complete our work today. \nIf not, we will complete it tomorrow for this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6512-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Senate came back into session 4 \ndays ago and we have yet to address the No. 1 issue in the country; \nthat is, high gas prices. There were 44 Senate Republicans who \nintroduced legislation over 2 weeks ago which would have an immediate \nimpact on the price at the pump.\n  The Gas Price Reduction Act can be summed up in four simple words: \nFind more, use less. The Gas Price Reduction Act focuses on simple \nsolutions which already have support from many of our friends on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  Many of our colleagues, Democratic colleagues, have now acknowledged \nthe merits of allowing States to open the Outer Continental Shelf for \ndeep sea oil and gas exploration. Our bill was limited to only those \nStates that want to do that. It gives a State option for the \nopportunity to go onto the Outer Continental Shelf for deep sea oil and \ngas exploration. We all agree we can do more in encouraging the \ndevelopment of alternative energy sources, which is why the Gas Price \nReduction Act contains incentives to develop plug-in electric cars and \ntrucks and new battery technology.\n  In addition, we included measures to strengthen the U.S. futures \nmarkets by increasing funding and staff for the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission and examining foreign markets. These ideas also have \nsupport from many on the other side of the aisle.\n  By focusing on the areas where we agree, instead of the ones where we \ndiffer, we can achieve results for the American people. I ask my good \nfriends on the other side of the aisle to join us in finding energy \npolicies we can agree on. Believe me, the American people are demanding \nit. We can pass meaningful legislation which would develop more \nAmerican energy while encouraging conservation, and we need to do that \nvery soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6513-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NOMINATIONS OF GENERAL PETRAEUS AND GENERAL ODIERNO\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we also have an opportunity today to \nconfirm the nominations of two of our Nation's leading generals. \nSecretary Gates and Admiral Mullen have both, rightly, talked about the \nchallenges facing the Nation as we transition from one Presidential \nadministration to the next during a time of war. The next President \nwill be fortunate to have General Petraeus and General Odierno \nresponsible respectively for central command area of operations in \nIraq.\n  It is the nature of world events that the next President will be \nconfronted with some international emergency that could not have been \nanticipated. What we know is that our strategic interests in the Middle \nEast and Persian Gulf are longstanding and are being challenged. We \nknow that the threat of an Iran regime bent on securing a nuclear \nweapon will not end when a new President is sworn in next year.\n  We know that despite the real progress made as a result of the surge \nof forces into Iraq, that the transition of forces, responsibilities, \nand missions must be managed with a steady hand.\n  Both of these fine officers are well prepared for their next \nresponsibilities. As a nation we are lucky to be able to call upon such \nmen at this critical point in American history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my distinguished colleague is right, gas \nprices are a tremendous issue. We in Nevada feel it very deeply. The \naverage price of gasoline is now $4.11 or $4.12 a gallon. In Nevada it \nis much higher than that.\n  We have to do something, there is no question, with domestic \nproduction. Right now, we have, counting ANWR--and the Republicans \nthankfully have stopped raising that as an issue; they do not want to \ndrill in ANWR; that is good. But even counting ANWR, and all of the \noffshore, we have less than 3 percent of the oil in the world. So we \ncannot produce our way out of the problems we have, because we in \nAmerica use more than 25 percent of every barrel of oil that is used \nevery day. We use more than 25 percent of it. But we can do better with \nour domestic production, and we need to do that.\n  The Republican bill that has been introduced does not have a single \nline in it that deals with renewables. But I accept the invitation of \nthe Republican leader and I hope he accepts our invitation. Let's work \ntogether to try to get something done as it relates to domestic \nproduction.\n  In the other areas, as we know, there are 68 million acres available \nfor drilling right now, 68 million acres. How much is 68 million acres? \nLook at a map of the United States. Look at the State of Nevada. If you \ndiscount Alaska, we are the sixth largest State in the Union. We make \nup about 68 million acres. From the southern tip of Nevada to the top \nis more than 700 miles; across the top of the State of Nevada is more \nthan 400 miles; a lot of space. That is how much area is left available \nto drill right now. We ask and invite the oil companies to start \ndrilling, find out where in the 68 million acres there is oil. We know \nthere is oil. I also invite the oil companies to look at the 8 million \nacres in the Gulf of Mexico that we legislatively, less than 2 years \nago, allowed them to explore and drill.\n\n  We know we need to do a better job producing domestically. We are \ngoing to do our very best to do that. But we hope there would also be \nan agreement that any oil that is drilled and produced in the waters \noff the coast of America be used in America. That is important. And we \nhave had test votes in that regard.\n  When there was a question about whether there would be drilling in \nANWR, we asked that oil--and I believe the amendment was offered by \nSenator Wyden, an amendment that said: Okay, we can drill oil out of \nANWR. You must use that oil in the United States. All but 16 Senators \nsaid: That is absolutely right.\n  One of the 16 Senators who said no was John McCain. I hope John \nMcCain would join us in saying that the oil we get offshore should be \nused in the United States. In the past, obviously, he has disagreed \nwith that. I do not think it is fair that we drill in the territorial \nwaters of our country and then ship that oil overseas.\n  We also have to deal with speculation. The Republican leader \nmentioned that their bill talks about adding staff to the CFTC, the \nentity that controls some of the trading that takes place with oil. We \nalso agree there should be something done. I am having a meeting today, \nand we are going to make a decision as to what that legislation should \nbe. So we share that with our Republican friends and hopefully they \nwill join us in that regard.\n  One thing that is not in the Republican legislation that we think is \nso vitally important to use at this time, as did this President's \nfather when he was President, is the Strategic Petroleum Reserve we \nhave in America, which is 97 or 98 percent filled. Why did we fill it? \nFor emergencies. I think for emergencies such as this, as was done with \nhis father. Once you start tapping that, the price of gasoline goes \ndown very quickly so we would hope there would be efforts made by this \nadministration to start taking oil out of the reserve. I think there is \nroom for us to work together; that is, Democrats and Republicans to try \nto meet the expectations of the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6513-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees, with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each, and with the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, \ncontrolling the final 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I will be using some of the first of the Republican \nminutes. I thank the leader for his comments on energy. I too think we \ncan get together and solve a huge problem for this country.\n  I do want to make a clarification on the Republican bill that was put \nup. I do not want anybody to think that was comprehensive. The leader \nmentioned some things that were left out. I have got a number of \nmatters that were left out of that bill that should be in there, except \nwhat we have a tendency to do in this body is to lump everything into \none big bill. If a few people do not like this part and a few people do \nnot like that part, then pretty quickly we cannot get a majority. So we \nneed to do things in a smaller way. This will make a huge difference in \nthe price of gasoline. The Republican bill would make a huge difference \nin the price of gasoline. But it is a package that we thought everyone \ncould come together on. And somehow we are going to have to do that in \nthis body if the United States is going to progress.\n  We can bring down the gas price Goliath if Democrats and Republicans \nwill work together to pass legislation that will help America find more \noil as we use less. Actually we have to do both. If we increase the \nsupply and we cut demand, we will beat this giant problem. If we use \nless and we find more, we will beat this giant problem.\n  I had the privilege of traveling around Wyoming last week during the \nJuly 4 home work period. There is no question that gas prices are the \nNo. 1 topic on everyone's mind. In Wyoming the rising price of gasoline \nand diesel fuel hits us hard, because our cities and towns are spread \nout and we are often forced to drive tens if not hundreds of miles to \nget groceries and to go to work. I am personally as concerned as are my \nconstituents with the rising price of gasoline. I get angry when I fill \nup my vehicle and I am charged more than $4 a gallon for gas. I am \nskeptical when I hear the oil industry is making record profits and \nCEOs are taking home huge pay packages.\n  Well, what can we do about that? Increasing taxes will not produce \nany more oil. It would raise the price of gas further, and probably \ndrive production off our shores, so we would be paying for oil from \nother places.\n  We do have a plan that would reduce gas prices. I have cosponsored S. \n3032, the aptly named Gas Price Reduction Act of 2008. It recognizes \nthat the biggest problem we face is the problem of supply and demand.\n  Right now America does not produce enough energy to meet our Nation's \nenergy needs, but with increased efforts and innovation we could. We \nneed to produce more domestic energy while we use less in the future. \nWe need more American oil from American soil.\n  By developing more American energy as we work to conserve our usage, \nwe will secure America's energy future. In order to do that, though, we \nhave to have agreement from the other side of the aisle that we do want \nto develop more energy sources. We do not have that agreement yet. I do \nnot know how much longer those on the other side of the issue can hold \nout against their constituents who are hurting from the higher gas \nprices, but I hope it is not long. We need to get something done now.\n  The bill I am cosponsoring is not perfect. It does not include \neverything I would like it to include. But it is a start. That is what \nwe need, a start. We need to start doing something now to improve our \nNation's energy situation. We need to stop playing ``gotcha'' politics \nand start coming together to start finding solutions. Congress should \nbe addressing high energy prices by looking for solutions that produce \nmore American energy while we reduce our usage. That is what those in \ncontrol of both Houses of Congress do not seem to understand at this \nstage.\n  The continued rise of gas prices is going to put an end to the dog-\nand-pony show eventually, and when the dog-and-pony shows ends, and we \nstop playing ``gotcha'' politics, we need to start to take a look at \nour Nation's energy policy.\n  We need to come together to increase our energy supply. We need to \nlook at the energy situation in steps. Instead of trying to pass \nmassive bills that have provisions a number of Members can't support, \nwe should work on passing smaller, consensus bills. We need to put \npartisan differences aside to figure out what we can do to improve our \nenergy situation. How do we lower gas prices? We find more, as we use \nless. We increase our oil supply, as we each seek to cut back the \namount of gas we use. Increasing supply by getting more American oil \nfrom American soil while at the same time conserving will lessen our \ndemand and bring prices down. We have choices to make. Do we meet this \nchallenge head-on by finding more oil, using less, putting our back and \nour brains into the task of developing better ways to use what we have, \nor do we do what many would have us do and say it is too late or that \nit is the oil companies' fault or they blame the Government and look to \nlawyers to solve our problems?\n  I have listened to my colleagues criticize the speculators who are, \nin theory, driving up oil prices. As the Wall Street Journal pointed \nout, Congress always needs a political villain and speculators always \nend up tied to the whipping post when people get upset about prices. We \nhave an energy problem, but instead of looking at what we can do to fix \nthe problem, we continue to play the blame game. My colleagues don't \nmention that the so-called speculators are often pension funds or \nairlines that want to stay in business and stabilize future fuel \nprices. My colleagues often fail to mention that for every person who \nis making money in the futures market, there is a person losing money.\n  Major oil consumers need some certainty in this volatile market so \nthey use the futures market to hedge their bets. They can't get \ncertainty from Congress that we will produce more energy, so they need \nto find it somewhere.\n  I am cosponsoring the Gas Price Reduction Act. I am cosponsoring \nclean coal measures. I am advocating American oil production and \nrefining. I am also pushing to renew important tax credits for wind and \nsolar power so that we can use more renewable energy. I am not ready to \nlet the greatest Nation on Earth sink into poverty because we were not \nwilling to help ourselves.\n  I am also counting on the innovation of the American people. \nAmericans are the most innovative people in the world. If they face a \nchallenge, they will come up with solutions. I was part of the rocket \ngeneration. Sputnik went up when I was in junior high. Our generation \nfigured out how to get a man on the Moon. We had the computer \ngeneration, and we have led the computer world. Then cell phones were \nthe next generation. Now we need the energy generation. We need the \nkids to invent clean ways, better uses, and more production. It can be \ndone in a good way.\n  We are in the situation we face today because we haven't acted for \nyears. We did not get in the situation overnight, and we won't get out \nof it overnight. What we can do is work to make the situation better. I \nam committed to working with colleagues to do just that. Let's stop \nplaying the blame game and start working together to get things done. \nMoving forward with the Gas Price Reduction Act or, if not that \nspecific bill, then parts of it, is what we have to do to bring prices \ndown. If we don't move now, we may not be able to afford the gas so we \ncan move into the future.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for talking about \nthe energy situation and the price of gasoline. I have traveled my \nState hard. I know Senator Enzi knows his State like the back of his \nhand. He goes to every place in it repeatedly and talks to average \npeople. They are hurting.\n  Look at the numbers. In 1 year, over the last year, the average \nfamily drives 24,000 miles a year. The average family\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\nis paying $105 a month more for gasoline for their automobiles than the \nprevious year. You go back over, since 2003, it is $217. That is a new \nexpense they never had before, and 60 percent of that money is sent \nabroad to purchase oil that we utilize because 60 percent of our fuel \ncomes from abroad. It totals $500 to $700 billion in a wealth transfer \neach year now. It is unbelievable. T. Boone Pickens said it is the \ngreatest wealth transfer in the history of the world and it is \nadversely affecting our economy, not just the fact that the family has \nless money now to take care of other needs. It has to go to gasoline so \npeople can commute to work, in large part, I would submit, by the \nfailure of this Congress to act.\n  I have been speaking on these issues ever since I came here. I have \nbeen pointing out the need for increased production consistently. We \nproduce off my coast in Alabama substantial amounts, but 85 percent of \nour offshore production is now blocked.\n  We need to do this. We are talking about $105 more a month out of the \nfamily budget, so they can't purchase items with this money. It is \nrippling through the economy. It is not a ripple; it really is a \ntsunami.\n  Let me point out some of the things in recent magazines and recent \nnewspaper articles. Here from the New York Times yesterday:\n\n       High fuel costs lead AirTran to cut 480 jobs. AirTran \n     announced it would eliminate 480 pilot and flight attendants' \n     jobs, joining a growing list of airlines that have cut their \n     workforces in the face of high fuel prices.\n\n  The cost of jet fuel has risen 92 percent this year, which is almost \ndouble in 1 year.\n  Here is the New York Times of July 8:\n\n       Markets decline even as oil pulls back a little bit.\n\n  The price dropped just a little.\n\n       Wall Street, which has been hurtling stocks lower for the \n     past few weeks, remains fearful that consumers are trimming \n     their spending to pay for gasoline. With consumer spending \n     accounting for more than two-thirds of [U.S.] economic \n     activity, a pullback would create big ripples.\n\n  Boy, I tell you, they are reducing spending; $105 less a month they \nhave now to spend on other items because they are having to spend on it \ngasoline.\n  Here is the Wall Street Journal the day before yesterday:\n\n       Stock Drop Spooks Currency Investors: Oil Prices Still Key.\n       . . . Janet Yellen [Federal Reserve Bank member], who made \n     surprisingly worrisome comments about inflation.\n       ``The continuing rise in oil and commodities has certainly \n     raised the inflation risk.''\n\n  It is just every day. Does anybody not understand this? I have to \ntell you, I have to say, and I have spoken about this several times, I \nam utterly disappointed in my Democratic colleagues for having no plan \nwhatsoever to deal with this problem. It is just not a plan. I am \nwilling to discuss how we can work together. I am not wedded to every \nsingle issue, I would say. I am willing to consider anything that will \nwork. But I will tell you that the Democratic leader made a speech down \nhere, and they offered a policy that proposes these things:\n  Tax the oil companies; that would make us feel better. It might even \nbe a good policy to raise revenue, perhaps. But it is not going to \nincrease oil production to tax the people who do it. When you tax \nsomething, you get less of it. People cannot pass a law to repeal the \nlaw of supply and demand. You tax it, you will get less of it.\n  No. 2, they want to prosecute, pass a law to empower the FTC to \nprosecute stations for price gouging. We already have a law that allows \nthe FTC to do that. They say the gas stations are not prosecuting. They \nwant to go prosecuting after speculators. Speculators are able to \noperate and be successful. I don't defend them. They are out to make a \nbuck any way they can. They are able to do that because we have a \ndemand for oil that is greater than supply. I think it is 86 million \nbarrels of oil demand a day at this point and 85 supply. So they are \nable to maneuver in that thing and play this game and make themselves \nsome extra money. But if we got the supply up and our demand down, they \nwouldn't be able to do this. They couldn't do it when we had $10-a-\nbarrel oil a decade or so ago.\n  They want to sue OPEC. OPEC, what do they do? OPEC meets to decide \nthe amount of oil they want to produce essentially, and that creates \nthe shortages that are driving up the price. Eighty percent-plus of the \noil in the world today is not held by oil companies. It is held by \nnation states, many of them hostile to the United States. OPEC meets to \nset the price by controlling the supply. They are reducing and not \nproducing the oil that they could if this was a real free market. They \nare manipulating the market. OPEC meets to decide how much they are \ngoing to tax the consumers of the world and, in particular, how much \nthey are going to tax us.\n  I have to tell you, it is a dramatic thing that is happening. I am \ntold that it costs less than $10 a barrel to produce oil from the sands \nof Saudi Arabia. Yet they are selling it for $140 a barrel. This is the \nkind of wealth transfer that is damaging our economy. It is hurting \nthis Nation. It is something we have to confront with real policies \nthat will work, and there are some.\n  I happened to catch Jack Welch, former CEO of GE, on one of the \nmorning talk shows not long ago. They were dealing with this question \nof Senator Obama and many of our colleagues here who say: Don't drill \nin Alaska; it might take 10 years. It wouldn't take quite that long, \nbut they say 10 years. You shouldn't drill off the coast; that will \ntake 10 years. Really, drilling off the coast, you begin to get \nproduction. They drill off my coast in Alabama right now, but there are \nother areas with lots of reserves. It would take 3 years, 5 years to \nget production.\n  This is what Mr. Welch said. He said: It is amazing to me that a \nperson who aspires to be the President of the United States would say \nhe is not going to take a policy today that won't have an impact for 5 \nyears. Think about it. He went on to say: A President should be \nthinking 5, 15, 30 years down the road. We need to be doing the things \nthat serve our long-term national interest. Just because it would take \nsome time to have this go forward, we should not delay taking action.\n  The matter is pretty serious. A Wall Street Journal article by Gerald \nSeib, executive editor, notes that there are three problems with the \nhigh prices of oil. One is that, of course, it impacts the family \nbudget. The second is that the high prices weaken our Nation's economic \nindependence because we owe so much money for it. Thirdly, the money is \nenriching countries, many of which are hostile to the United States.\n\n  So I think we are at a point in time when we need to get together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, and recognize that we face a problem that \nchallenges our family budgets, that we have, in effect, taxed the \nAmerican people, or allowed them to be taxed, by over $100 more a month \nin 1 year alone, that we can make a difference and bring those prices \ndown--certainly stop the continuing increase. But we have to do \nsomething. There are things we can do.\n  I will say, as a person who has been able, a few times, to go fishing \non the gulf coast, we go out and fish under oil rigs because that is a \ngood place to fish, and it is clean and there is no oil out on the \nwater. They are very careful about that.\n  We have approximately 51 billion barrels or more of recoverable \nreserves in the Gulf of Mexico. That is a lot. We use, as a nation, 5 \nbillion barrels a year, and 3 billion of that is imported. If you \nreplaced that 3 billion, that would be 17 years right there just from \noffshore production in the Gulf of Mexico. We have 85 percent of our \nreserves still blocked. We have had production that is still being \neffective off the coast of California before that was blocked. None has \nbeen expanded since, in decades, and none, really, off the Atlantic \ncoast. But there are reserves out there. States such as Virginia are \ntalking about maybe that would be a good way to produce additional oil \nand serve the national interest.\n  We have the opportunity to produce oil from shale. There are 1.8 \ntrillion barrels of oil in shale rock. Perhaps 800 billion of that is \nrecoverable, experts tell us. We are using 5 billion a year, so that is \n100 years or more from shale rock. I am told they can produce that at \nless than the current world price, keeping wealth at home, producing \nour energy at home, not sending that abroad.\n  I will tell you, one of the greatest potential breakthroughs that \ncould help us with global warming emissions and\n\n[[Page S6516]]\n\nother areas is hybrid automobiles, particularly a plug-in hybrid. I \nstrongly believe we should--my time is up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have 1 additional moment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to 1 additional \nminute?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will conclude by saying that nuclear \npower produces no emissions into the air. We need to expand it. We are \nat 20 percent now in our Nation. We have not built a plant in 30 years. \nFrance has 80 percent. We could plug in our cars at night, charge those \nbatteries with clean nuclear electricity, and run back and forth to \nwork. That is within our grasp right now.\n  Those are the kinds of things we need to be talking about: expanding \nwind, expanding biofuels, expanding the production of our existing \nresources, keeping American wealth at home, ending this incredible \ntransfer of wealth.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                          Unifinshed Business\n\n  Mr. President, I, too, want to talk about high gasoline prices, but I \nwant to talk about other unfinished business this Senate has not taken \ncare of. Fortunately, we do have one positive development; that is, \nyesterday we passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--after \n145 days had lapsed. So that is a good thing. But we have unfinished \nwork to do.\n  For example, the Colombian Free Trade Agreement--it has been 597 days \nthat our American farmers and manufacturers have been disadvantaged by \ntariffs on goods sold here in America. For my State of Texas, there is \n$2.3 billion a year that is charged in tariffs for our exports when \nthey are imported into Colombia, when Colombian goods bear no similar \ntariff when their goods are imported into the United States.\n  Then there is the matter of judicial nominees waiting for a vote--\nsome as long as 742 days.\n  Then, finally, on the matter of gasoline prices, it was about 808 \ndays ago when Speaker Pelosi said that if she and other Democrats were \nput in charge, they would come up with a commonsense plan for bringing \ndown the price of gasoline at the pump. Well, that was when gasoline \nwas about $2.33 a gallon. Now gasoline averages $4.10 a gallon, and we \nare still waiting for that commonsense plan to bring down the price of \ngasoline at the pump.\n  Increasingly, Americans are squeezed by the high cost of gasoline. Of \ncourse, it is driving up everything from food prices to competing with \npeople's ability to pay for their housing, their health care, \ntransportation, and, obviously, the tax bite, where State and local and \nFederal taxes take up a huge amount. About 111 days of income is used \njust to pay for that tax burden.\n  But what we need to do, I firmly believe, is to find more domestic \nenergy as we use less. What do I mean by that? By using less, we need \nto conserve, we need to be more efficient. America consumes about 20 \npercent of the world's oil supply, and unfortunately, about 60 percent \nof that we import from foreign sources. We are literally held hostage \nby groups such as OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries, countries such as Venezuela and Hugo Chavez and others that \nare charging us about $140 a barrel for oil. Of course, that oil is \nused to make gasoline at refineries.\n  But my constituents in Texas are very worried about the failure of \nCongress to act by removing the impediments or the moratoria on \ndeveloping what is about 85 percent of our natural resources here at \nhome. That is what I mean by finding more while we use less.\n  For example, Debra, from Lovelady, TX--a town of roughly 600 people, \njust a ``Texas mile'' north of Houston--recently wrote me this letter. \nShe said:\n\n       I am a school teacher in a small rural East Texas school, \n     so my income is very limited. I drive almost 30 miles one way \n     to work each day as do many of my family and neighbors. We \n     have chosen to stay in small towns for the ``everyone is \n     family'' feeling they still give, but it makes it harder to \n     live with the cost of everything rising.\n\n  She said:\n\n       The rising price of gasoline is limiting everything I do. I \n     will not make a trip to town unless it is for my monthly \n     shopping needs or to go to church. There will be no summer \n     trips for me this year as I do not see a way to afford \n     driving anywhere.\n\n  She concludes:\n\n       I know there are vast resources America could tap into. . . \n     . Please look into exploring the energy resources we already \n     have in America.\n\n  Well, I believe Debra speaks for a lot of people in this country now \nas they see their prices go up, as it is driving commodity prices up, \nsuch as food costs. They are finding it harder and harder to make it, \neven if they do have a job, even if they have an income.\n  I believe it is past time for Congress to respond by removing the \nimpediments to domestic production. That is why I cosponsored the Gas \nPrice Reduction Act of 2008. That act can be summed up, as this chart \nsays: Find more and use less. It opens up offshore and shale oil \ndeposits for exploration so America's energy producers can gain access \nto Federal lands. This also will create jobs right here in America, \nwhich is something I would think we would want to do. In a time when we \nare talking about economic stimulus, about concern for the economy, \ndon't we want to create more jobs here in America rather than having \nthose jobs created in places such as Saudi Arabia or Mexico or Canada \nor Venezuela?\n  At the same time, this bill increases research and development \ninitiatives and for battery-operated plug-in hybrid technology. I think \nit is hard for many of my constituents in Texas, with the long \ndistances they have to drive, to imagine a day when they will be \ndriving a battery-operated hybrid car, but I do predict the day is \ncoming, and companies such as General Motors and other car \nmanufacturers, in 2010, will begin selling these plug-in hybrid cars \nthat you can literally plug into a wall socket at night and recharge \nthe battery and then drive about 40 miles on that battery before you \nhave to get a generator to recharge the battery to provide you \nadditional range. This is in our future. Right now we have about 240 \nmillion cars on the road, and the average age of those cars is about 9 \nyears. So obviously it is going to take a long time--about a decade--\nbefore we can transition from the kinds of gas guzzlers and cars that \nwe drive now to something that provides an additional alternative.\n  I think we are beginning to see some cracks in the intransigence of \nmany in Congress to preventing additional domestic production. I know \nthere are a number of Senators, a fabled group called the Group of 10, \nthe Gang of 10--5 Republicans, 5 Democrats--who are meeting to try to \ncome up with a bipartisan alternative. I applaud that effort. It is \nreally important because, as we all know, nothing happens around here \nunless it is on a bipartisan basis. I think it is very important, as I \nsaw the Democratic whip say that he was not opposed to more exploration \nand production.\n  I would invite those who are worried about exploration and production \nhere in America to fly into DFW Airport where you can see gas wells \nbeing drilled into the Barnett shale right there from your airplane as \nyou land or as you take off. It is being done using modern drilling \ntechnology which is compatible with the safety and security of the \nneighbors as well as a good environment.\n  We need to act in a bipartisan fashion on real energy solutions--a \ncombination of conservation and energy production. It will be good for \nAmerica's economy and our energy policy, as well as our national \nsecurity. Find more, use less.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3237 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today, I rise to express my support for \nthe Housing and Economic Recovery Act.\n  The housing crisis in America has reached critical proportions. In \nAuburn, WA, Michelle was a single mom with an income that made it very \ndifficult to find an apartment she could afford. Like so many people, \nshe searched desperately to find a roof to put over her children's \nheads. The search is not easy. The search is not fair. But for the \nhundreds of thousands\n\n[[Page S6517]]\n\nof Americans that need affordable housing today, the search is a \nreality.\n  The number of renter households jumped by nearly 1 million last year, \naccording to a Harvard University Joint Center for Housing Studies \nReport. And monthly rents are reaching record highs. Last year, they \nclimbed to an all time sky high of $775.\n  We are faced with a fundamental supply and demand problem: a \nballooning renter population and a diminishing supply of affordable \nhousing.\n  This is a problem that requires a real solution. And today, I am \nproud to say that we have taken action to put people like Michelle in \nthe homes they so desperately need and deserve.\n  This action did not come without the hard work of many people. I \nespecially want to commend Finance Committee Chairman Baucus, Senator \nGrassley, and their staffs. Because of their hard work, we have \nincluded in this comprehensive housing and economic recovery package a \nset of provisions that encourage the development of affordable rental \nhousing by expanding and improving the low-income housing tax credit. I \nalso want to recognize the tremendous leadership of House Ways and \nMeans Committee Chairman Rangel, who has long been an advocate for \naffordable housing and a champion of the tax credit program.\n  Because of current conditions in the financial markets, the \ndevelopment of many affordable housing options has come to a screeching \nhalt. And for the hundreds of thousands of homeowners that must now \nturn to rental housing, the homes they could afford are diminishing at \nan alarming pace.\n  I knew this was a critical problem that needed a solution. Many of my \ncolleagues, including Senators Kerry and Smith, agreed. We worked \ntogether to ensure that the tax title of this bill contains the \nprovision that will extend the reach of two of our most successful and \nbroadly supported Federal housing programs: the Housing Bond and Low-\nIncome Housing Tax Credit Programs.\n  We now have the best cumulative version of what the Senate and House \nindependently approved.\n  The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program was created as part of the \nTax Reform Act of 1986 and made permanent in 1993. Designed as a \npublic-private funding partnership, largely administered by the States, \nthis program built its way into the history books as the most \nsuccessful production program in existence.\n  These tax credits have created 2 million homes for families in need--\nhomes with restricted rents for terms of at least 30 years that would \nhave otherwise been impossible.\n  In fact, in April 2007, Michelle from Auburn, WA, moved into one of \nthese homes created by tax credits. She is thriving and able to provide \nfor her children. Without tax credits like these, I am unsure where \nMichelle and her family would be.\n  We are building opportunity out of this past success and passing this \nopportunity on to the Americans who need it.\n  This will work now to increase the number of affordable choices \navailable to our neighbors in need. State agencies award housing tax \ncredits to housing developers, who turn the credits into construction \nfunds by selling them to investors. These funds allow developers to \nborrow less money and pass the savings on to renters in the forms of \nlower rental rates.\n  A classic ``win-win'' situation.\n  By extending the reach of this program in the tax title of this bill, \nwe give States the flexibility they need to develop housing credit \nproperties in hard-to-serve, often rural, areas; we give investors \nneeded AMT relief for housing bonds, housing credits, and \nrehabilitation credits; and we give our vulnerable neighbors, like \nMichelle, the homes they need.\n  It is critically important that Congress's response to the housing \ncrisis not leave out those in need of affordable rental housing. I am \nproud of this legislation and am anxious to see it enacted into law.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are at last moving \ncloser to enactment of much-needed housing legislation.\n  The foreclosure situation in my State of Michigan continues to be \ndire. In 2007, there were more than 103,000 foreclosures. According to \nthe data released recently by RealtyTrac, there were nearly 13,000 \nMichigan foreclosure filings in May alone, a 25 percent increase from \nthe previous month. That is one foreclosure filing for every 353 \nhouseholds, which puts our State's foreclosure rate at the fifth \nhighest in the Nation. Nationwide, filings are up nearly 50 percent \ncompared to this time last year, with one in every 483 U.S. households \nreceiving a foreclosure filing in May.\n  Sadly, we all know that homeowners facing foreclosure are not the \nonly ones being impacted by this crisis. Property values have plummeted \nin many areas, due in part to the glut of abandoned and foreclosed \nhomes. Lost property values moreover translate into decreased State and \nlocal revenue from property taxes, creating a shortfall in revenues and \nreducing the budget available for valuable State and local programs and \nservices.\n  Our Nation's broader economic woes can also be traced back, at least \nin part, to the foreclosure crisis. There is a long chain of investors, \nlenders, and financial markets relying on American homebuyers to pay \nwhat, in many instances, are shaky home loans. Because of the record \ndefaults on these loans, credit remains tight.\n  Throughout this crisis I have received wise counsel from many experts \non foreclosure prevention and housing matters. Earlier this year I \nhosted a series of roundtable meetings in Michigan communities with \nleaders from local and State government, as well as organizations who \nare in the trenches working with families facing foreclosure, to \ndiscuss practical ways to help homeowners and protect our economy from \nfurther damage. Many of the ideas discussed at those roundtables are \nincluded in this legislation.\n  I have also had the benefit of advice from Bernie Glieberman, \nchairman of the board of the Michigan State Housing Development \nAuthority, and member of the board of the Michigan Housing Trust Fund \nand Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies policy \nadvisory board. Long before the committees started crafting this \nhousing bill, Bernie brought to my attention the idea of increasing \ntax-exempt bonding authority to enable State housing agencies to help \nstruggling homeowners acquire more affordable mortgages. I am pleased \nthat this bill will bring this additional bonding authority to \nfruition. I am confident that the Michigan State Housing Development \nAuthority, MSHDA, and other State housing agencies across the Nation \nwill put it to good use. These tax-exempt bonds will help agencies like \nMSHDA raise the funds needed to refinance homeowners from adjustable \nrate mortgages into affordable fixed-rate mortgages, as well as provide \nloans for first-time homebuyers and finance the construction of multi-\nfamily residential housing.\n  This bill has a number of other provisions that will help alleviate \nthe suffering caused by the foreclosure crisis. Arguably the most \nimportant provision in this bill is the HOPE for Homeowners program, \nwhich will enable the Federal Housing Administration to provide \ngroundbreaking new refinancing options to distressed borrowers. Through \nthis temporary new program, the Federal Housing Administration, FHA, is \nauthorized to insure up to $300 billion in 30-year, fixed-rate \nmortgages. I applaud the work of Senator Dodd and others of our \ncolleagues in putting this FHA refinancing proposal together. It is \nbased on the successful Home Owner's Loan Corporation that was \nimplemented by President Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression \nto issue new loans to help homeowners in default.\n  It is important to note that this new program is not an investor or \nlender bailout. FHA will only insure loans at 90 percent of the current \nproperty value, which in most cases is significantly less than the \noriginal loan amount. Investors and lenders who choose to take \nadvantage of this program must, therefore, be willing to take a hit. \nThey will likely be willing to take this loss, however, because it will \nbe less than the losses associated with foreclosure. Also, this is \nhardly a windfall for distressed borrowers, as some are claiming. Those \nwho sign up for the FHA insured loans will share their new equity and \nfuture appreciation with FHA by paying a premium--3 percent initially, \n1.5 percent annually thereafter--for the FHA loan. They are also \nrequired to give a portion of the\n\n[[Page S6518]]\n\nequity from sale proceeds for this home back to FHA. I am pleased to \nnote that this program, which is estimated to help nearly 400,000 \nhomeowners nationwide, will not cost taxpayers money; in fact, it is \nexpected to net $250 million.\n  Not only does this bill take significant steps to help keep families \nin their homes, it provides immediate help toward rehabilitating \nblighted neighborhoods. The nearly $4 billion in CDBG-like funding \nprovided through this bill will go to areas of the country with the \nhighest foreclosure rates and number of filings. Michigan stands to \nreceive almost $170 million through this provision, and the funds could \nbe used to restore an estimated 6,000 properties. Inclusion of these \nneighborhood stabilization funds will help protect more homeowners from \ngoing ``underwater,'' and I urge Members in the House to support \nkeeping this provision in the final bill.\n  Our economic crisis is exacerbated further by the fact that we are a \nnation at war. Our brave and dedicated soldiers should not have to \nreturn to U.S. soil to find that, facing foreclosure action, they no \nlonger have a home. I am pleased that this bill will delay foreclosure \naction for returning soldiers and also provide them 1 year of relief \nfrom increases in mortgage rates. The bill also provides additional \nhomeownership opportunities for veterans through increases in the VA \nloan guarantee amount. There is also funding for home modifications for \nveterans with service-related disabilities.\n  In addition to the provisions in this bill that help alleviate the \nsuffering of the many families in dire straits, this legislation will \nhelp stimulate the slumping housing market and help to ease the broader \neconomic slowdown.\n  One key provision of this bill is a 1-year, $8,000 tax credit \navailable for first-time homebuyers. The homebuyer would repay the \nmoney over time, similar to an interest-free loan. I have heard from \nrealtors, prospective buyers, home builders and many others who believe \nthis would help reduce the existing stock of vacant housing.\n  The availability of quality, affordable housing is critical to the \neconomic health of America. This legislation would help create \nadditional affordable rental housing and increased homeownership \nopportunities for low-income families by creating a new Housing Trust \nFund and a Capital Magnet Fund. These funds, which would be provided as \ngrants to States, would greatly help those who need it most because the \nfunds are required to be used primarily for the benefit of low-income \nfamilies. The bill also provides incentives to spur development of \naffordable housing property by the private sector through increases to \ncurrent programs such as the Low Income Housing Tax Credit.\n  It is not enough to simply alleviate the Nation's present suffering \nand get us back on track for the time being. Congress has a \nresponsibility to do what it can to ensure that a housing crisis of \nthis sort does not happen again. To that end, this bill contains a \nnumber of provisions aimed at helping homeowners avoid foreclosure and \nreforming major Federal players in the housing market: the Federal \nHousing Administration and the housing government-sponsored \nenterprises, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  As I observed during the roundtable discussions I hosted in Michigan, \nmany counselors are doing good work on the ground to try and help \nfamilies avoid foreclosure. However, foreclosure prevention counselors \nare overwhelmed, and a lack of funds is tying the hands of local groups \ntrying to help keep families on track. This bill would provide $150 \nmillion for pre-foreclosure counseling and $30 million for legal \nservices to help keep people in their homes.\n  This bill also establishes a new, independent regulator for the \nhousing Government Sponsored Enterprises, GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac. Through capital standards, audits and other internal controls, \nthis regulator will oversee the safety and soundness of these financial \ngiants who play such a key role in our housing markets.\n  I am pleased that this bill also incorporates long-awaited \nlegislation to modernize and expand the Federal Housing Administration. \nThese reforms will help provide access to homeownership to families in \nhigher cost areas who have not been able to take advantage of the FHA \nprogram in the past, by raising the FHA loan limit. It will also \nprovide counseling for first-time homebuyers as well as homeowners who \nare having trouble making their mortgage payments through FHA, and \nimprove the FHA loss mitigation process to help struggling homeowners \nstay in their homes.\n  Finally, many blame predatory lending practices, at least in part, \nfor the excessive number of irresponsible loans made to subprime \nborrowers. In response, this bill amends the Truth in Lending Act, \nTILA, to, among other things, require that borrowers be informed of the \nmaximum monthly payments possible under their loan, and ensure full \ndisclosures are provided no later than 7 days before closing so \nborrowers can shop for another loan if they are dissatisfIed with the \nterms. In order to discourage unscrupulous behavior, statutory damages \nfor TILA violations have been increased 10-fold, from current rates of \n$200 and $400 to $2,000 and $4,000, respectively.\n  I support this comprehensive housing legislation, and am confident \nthat, once enacted, it will provide much-needed relief to many \nstruggling homeowners in Michigan and across the country. Addressing \nthe foreclosure crisis will require a team effort among Federal, State, \nand local governments, community and neighborhood organizations, and \nlenders, brokers, and borrowers. This bill recognizes that fact. It \nprovides an opportunity to help keep struggling families in their \nhomes. It provides an opportunity to help restore our housing markets \nby keeping declining property values stable. It will protect \nneighborhoods from a glut of vacant homes. I will continue to work with \nmy colleagues to get this bill passed, and, if need be, to overcome a \nPresidential veto. This legislation cannot come too soon.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to my friend, the Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we are nearing the end of a long debate in \nthe Senate dealing with what some people call the housing bill, but as \nwe know, it is more than housing. One of the big titles in it deals \nwith the reform of the government-sponsored enterprises--GSEs commonly \nknown as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as the Federal Home Loan \nBank Board.\n  We know that we are in a housing crisis in this country. We have a \nlot more houses than we probably need right now, and we have a lot of \npeople who are going to be facing foreclosure. So, working together \nwith Senator Dodd and our staffs, we have tried to come up with a plan \nto give thousands of people an opportunity for some relief. It is not a \nGovernment bailout. It is not taxpayers' money. It gives them an \nopportunity--assuming a lender is about to foreclose on someone--to get \ntogether with someone else who has borrowed money and say: Look, if you \ncan get this refinanced through the FHA modernization plan, if we can \ndo that and we can cut down on the value of the mortgage--take a \nhaircut, so to speak--this is better than a foreclosure.\n  Lenders know the worst thing in the world for them is foreclosure. \nBorrowers know that too, because it is a dangerous game people play. \nGoing back to the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac situation, we know they \nplay a huge role--a central role--in our housing, but we also know that \ntogether they owe a little over $5 trillion; $5 trillion in debt, and \nthey are thinly capitalized because they are government-sponsored \nenterprises. They have the implicit guarantee of the taxpayer--the U.S. \nGovernment, basically. I have no reason to believe we would let them go \nunder because there is a lot at stake. The way to keep them from \ngetting in worse financial shape is to create a strong regulator that \nwill monitor them closer than they have been in the past to make sure \nthey have adequate capital.\n  With Senator Dodd's 28 years and my 22 years on the Banking \nCommittee, we have 50 years. In our combined 50 years on the Banking \nCommittee, we have seen financial debacles. We have seen good times and \nbad times. What we are trying to do is prevent as many headaches and \nhardships as we can, not only to homeowners but ultimately to the \nAmerican people by reforming GSEs. I hope this is a big first step \ntoday.\n  I wish to take a minute to commend my colleague, Senator Dodd, \nchairman\n\n[[Page S6519]]\n\nof the Banking Committee. As I enjoyed my 4 years serving as chairman, \nI also enjoy working with Senator Dodd and his staff. I wish to commend \nhis staff as well as my staff, our Republican staff on the Banking \nCommittee, including Bill Duhnke, Mark Oesterle and others, for all the \nwork they have done here, night and day, and it is not over yet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleague from \nAlabama, Senator Shelby. He makes it sound like Methuselah this morning \nreferring to those years we have served together in the Senate, \ncombined years of service. I have been a member of the Banking \nCommittee since my first day as a Member of this body in January of \n1981. I have served under and with a lot of different people on that \ncommittee, going back to Bill Proxmire of Wisconsin, who was the \nranking Democrat in those days; Jake Garn, who was the chairman of the \nBanking Committee in 1981, the Senator from Utah. Over the years, \nSenator Riegle, Phil Gramm, and Paul Sarbanes, of course, chaired the \ncommittee, as well as, of course, Senator Shelby.\n  This is an important moment for this body. We have a severe housing \ncrisis in the country. I don't need to keep repeating that. All Members \nrecognize it. When we go home and talk to our constituents, as we did \nover the last week or so, we see that this problem is not going away. \nWe were hoping that somehow the market would be taking care of all of \nthis and by now we would be seeing that proverbial light at the end of \nthe tunnel, but the only light we see is the light of a train coming. \nUnless we act promptly, we are looking at a situation that will only \nget worse.\n  Our legislation is not the salvation of every problem. I wish to make \nclear to my colleagues that what Senator Shelby and I and the other 19 \nmembers of our committee have done is to fashion some proposals that we \nthink will make a significant contribution to the issue, maybe the most \nimportant one being a sense of optimism and confidence that this \nCongress of ours, despite the narrow margins that split us as two \nparties in this body, can actually work together to get something done.\n  There is a growing fear in the country--in fact, more than growing--\nthat we are incapable of doing much here; that we can't seem to get \nmuch done because of the partisan divide. This bill argues strenuously \nagainst that conclusion. By a vote of 19 to 2, this committee marked up \nthis piece of legislation.\n  We have now been on the Senate floor debating this because of the \nvery difficult parliamentary situation we are presented with as a \nresult of what the House of Representatives sent us, so we have spent \nthis much time on this legislation. However, I think we have a very \ngood product reflected by the votes that have occurred over the last \nseveral weeks. I think the lowest vote total on any single proposal \nthat has been either offered or suggested has been something like 77 \nvotes, showing that an overwhelming majority of people are supporting \nthis committee product, and we appreciate that as members of the \nBanking Committee.\n  So this action is coming none too soon. Today the RealtyTrac reported \nthat over 250,000 families went into foreclosure in the month of June. \nThat is a 53-percent increase over last year. We all throw these \nstatistics around rather easily in this Chamber, but numbers, while \nstaggering, are faceless and nameless. Behind every one of these \nnumbers, that 250,000, that 53-percent increase, is a mother, is a \nfather, is a family, and children whose lives have been unalterably \nchanged for the worse because they are going to lose their home. They \nare going to lose their home.\n  Just imagine, if you will, those who have not been in that situation, \nwhat it would be like to wake up this morning and know that you have a \nforeclosure notice on your home, that you can't meet your obligations \nand you have to face your children, you have to face your spouse, you \nhave to face your coworkers, and you have to find some other place to \nlive. Mr. President, 250,000 people went through that in the month of \nJune, 1,500,000 over the last year, and we are still here debating this \nbill and whether we can do anything to make a difference in people's \nlives.\n  What is happening today is a tragedy, a significant tragedy for these \npeople, for their neighbors, for their communities, and for our \ncountry. The cover story in this week's issue of Business Week is \nentitled ``The Home Price Abyss: Why the Threat of a Free Fall is \nGrowing.'' I think the article sums up very well the threat we are \ntrying to address with this legislation.\n  Let me quote from it:\n\n       The risk to the financial system and the economy is that \n     the price drop, which is already horrifying, will start \n     feeding on itself.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       When home values fall low enough, hard-pressed homeowners \n     become less able or less willing to keep paying their \n     mortgages. That forces lenders to repossess homes and then \n     dump them back on the market at fire sale prices, which \n     depresses further the prices in those neighborhoods and leads \n     to even more foreclosures.\n\n  When we consider the role home equity has played in supporting \nconsumer spending, we can see that this vicious cycle can create a \ndisaster. We have already had hundreds of thousands of job losses and \nthe like. I think we all recognize we have a responsibility to act.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to pass the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act of 2008, which will help us begin to address this crisis \nand the larger economic turmoil. I wish to add that we would have liked \nto have considered other amendments. Other colleagues had ideas to add \nto this bill. Because of a handful of Members who don't want any more \nconsideration, we are forced into this situation. A number of \namendments had been worked out between Democrats and Republicans, but \nwe cannot even offer those. That is the situation. I regret that \nbecause there were some good ideas, frankly, that could have been added \nto the bill as it leaves here. But that is the situation. Candidly, we \ncannot wait longer, having gone weeks going through the parliamentary \nrigmarole on the floor of the Senate.\n  I will sum up again the legislation we are about to pass and send on \nto the House. The bill establishes the Hopeful Homeowners Act to assist \nat least 400,000, maybe 500,000 families to keep their homes and \nstabilize their neighborhoods. It does so after asking both lenders and \nborrowers to make financial sacrifices. It does so at absolutely no \ncost to the taxpayer. It creates a new class of regulation for Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac.\n  You can look in the Wall Street Journal of this morning if you doubt \nwhether we should act or we can wait longer. The headline is: ``U.S. \nMulls Future of Fannie, Freddie.'' If you think we ought to wait longer \nto try to get something better out of the bill, consider what we may \nhave happen to these GSEs, which are critical to providing stability in \nthe housing market. The world-class regulator, which is something we \ntried to do over the last 7 years, is finally done in this bill on a \nbipartisan basis. Recent news makes it clear these entities need a \nstrong regulator to ensure they are viable and healthy institutions.\n  The bill raises the loan limit from $417,000 to as high as $625,000, \nso the GSEs can play a more active role in stabilizing the housing \nmarket. I wish to point out that this loan limit is considerably higher \nthan what was included in the committee-passed bill. Senator Shelby, to \nhis credit, and I agreed to do this in an effort to accommodate the \ninterest of the other body, the House. And also the people who live in \nhigher cost States, the higher numbers will be important for them to \nget relief as well from the bill.\n  Treasury Secretary Paulson said passing this legislation is the most \nimportant thing we can do to address the housing crisis. The bill \nmodernizes the FHA program, raising the loan limit from $362,000 to \n$625,000. The FHA proved its value in the current crisis. It continues \nto be a stable source of mortgage credit, while many other lenders have \nfailed. This bill will make sure FHA is available to even more American \nfamilies.\n  To give you some idea of how this affects people, by raising these \nlimits to the $625,000 level from $417,000, we will now cover 85 \npercent of the American population and 98 percent of the counties in \nAmerica. The other 2 percent are the very high-cost counties. My\n\n[[Page S6520]]\n\nState has one of them, and several other States across the country do \nas well. But 85 percent of the American people are potentially covered \nby this bill, and 98 percent of the counties will be covered by the \nnumbers we have raised from $417,000 to $625,000. When people tell you \nwe are not reaching enough, we have reached about as far as you can \nreach if you are interested in helping those who may face more serious \nproblems.\n  The bill includes a permanent affordable housing fund, financed by \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, that will provide tens of thousands of \naffordable housing units in the future. Let me say, about this part of \nthe bill, the GSE reform will be long lasting and important. The HOPE \nfor Homeowners Act is temporary; it doesn't exist after 3 or 4 years. \nMaybe the most important thing we will do is the affordable housing \nissue in this bill. No new tax money required. The money will come out \nof the GSEs. We know, as a matter of fact, that we have built very few \naffordable housing units in this country over the last number of years. \nAnd particularly those people losing their homes will have a hard time \nfinding rental units. This is a permanent bill on affordable housing, \nand there is a means to pay for it without adding to the taxpayers' \ncosts. It is one of the most important long-lasting features of the \nbill. In the long term, that bill will make a huge difference for \nmillions of people.\n  Seventeen million people today spend half their disposable income on \ntheir houses. If you are on SSI, in fact, housing costs exceed the \nmonthly benefits you get today under SSI. For millions of people in \nthis country, that affordable housing provision can be very important \nin the long term.\n  The bill includes a new protection for elderly homeowners taking out \nFHA-insured reverse mortgages so they are not deceived into using the \nproceeds from the loans to buy expensive and needless insurance \nproducts. These are provisions that were incorporated by Senator \nMcCaskill, and we thank her for it. There is a new mortgage broker and \nlender licensing requirement that was added by Senator Martinez and \nsupported by Senator Feinstein from California. That will begin to \naddress many of the abuses of the mortgage process that have been \nperpetrated by brokers.\n  In addition, the bill includes improved disclosure requirements that \nwere added by Senator Reed of Rhode Island and Senator Bond of Missouri \nas well. Because of the effort of Senators Kerry, Coleman, Akaka, \nCornyn, and Sanders, the bill expands the availability of VA housing \nprograms. It includes a number of provisions to help returning veterans \nsave their homes from foreclosure and provides new housing benefits to \ndisabled vets as well.\n  In an amendment adopted on the floor prior to the recess, we added \nlanguage by Senator Kohl of Wisconsin to create protections against \nforeclosure scams, and we reduced paperwork burdens on certain small \npublic housing authorities, thanks to the amendment by Senator Sununu.\n  This legislation includes $3.9 billion in emergency community \ndevelopment block grant funds. This is a controversial provision. I \nknow some Members have raised concerns about it. I think all of us \nrecognize that when we talk about a national crisis, with problems of \nforeclosures having a devastating effect in our States, obviously, \nresources locally, with property taxes declining for police and fire, \nand the like, our mayors and county officers are finding themselves \nfurther hard-strapped to meet their obligations. We thought an infusion \nof community development block grant money, targeted specifically to \nthose communities that face high foreclosure rates, would be of benefit \nto them to help them rehabilitate their communities and the foreclosed \nhomes and get them back on the market. This is still in the bill.\n  I have been warned by Members of the other body that this provision \nwill have to come out. I know some Members want to strike it. It is \ngoing to stay in the bill that is going to the other body. They object \nto it because they don't have a pay-for in it, and we do here. We call \nit emergency funding, as we do when we have hurricanes or other natural \ndisasters occurring. This is similar to a natural disaster. If you are \none of those 250,000 families who, in the month of June, lost their \nhomes--whether by flood or by hurricane, believe me, it is a disaster. \nThey lost it because they got lured into deals they could not afford or \nbecause there was a scam or deceptive practices going on. Don't try to \ntell that family they have not faced a disaster. It is not a natural \none, but nonetheless it is a disaster. The idea that we cannot provide \nadditional funding to mayors and county executives to help out \ncommunities is something I am troubled by. It may come out of the bill \nwhen it comes back. I urge them to look hard at this and try to find a \nfunding source.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 or 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am going to object, and I will explain \nwhy. We have a committee hearing we are working through this vote, and \nso I do object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DODD. I will yield that time to my colleague from New Jersey.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for \nhis leadership. I rise to express my disappointment that it appears \nthat the managers' package is being blocked by one or two of my friends \non the other side of the aisle. This package includes, among other \nimportant provisions, my amendment, offered by family and children \norganizations across the country, to help children who are the silent \nvictims of the housing crisis.\n  My amendment authorizes $30 million in additional funding into the \nexisting McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Program to support children \ndirectly impacted by foreclosures. There are about 2 million children \nin this country, including 50,000 in New Jersey and over half a million \nLatino children nationwide, who will be directly impacted by the \nforeclosure crisis, placing them at risk of poor school performance, \nbehavior problems, and other challenges as well.\n  While we provide lower interest rates supporting the homebuilding \nindustry and reform mortgage lending practices, several children's \norganizations and educational organizations have asked for this \namendment as a modest way that our Nation can support the nearly 2 \nmillion children who are suffering the consequences of decisions made \ncompletely outside their control.\n  The foreclosure crisis is damaging our economy. Let us not forget \nthat the children who have no say, no ability to make a difference in \ntheir lives, are the real victims of this crisis and, even worse, they \nare the silent victims. It is not fair these children get lost in the \npaperwork or in the politics of one Member, and they deserve our full \nsupport.\n  This amendment was being cosponsored by several colleagues. We worked \nwith Senator Enzi, who had original jurisdiction, along with Senator \nKennedy, to get the language right. We appreciate Senator Shelby having \nit in the managers' package. If that cannot move forward, these \nchildren will be left unprotected. That is a disgrace.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  The clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     disagree to the amendments of the House, adding a new title \n     and inserting a new section, to the amendment of the Senate \n     to H.R. 3221, the Foreclosure Prevention Act.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. By unanimous consent, the mandatory \nquorum call is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to disagree to the amendments of the House, adding a new title \nand inserting a new section to the amendment of the Senate to H.R. \n3221, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are mandatory \nunder the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I have \nbeen advised by Senators Dodd and Shelby that they likely will be able \nto finish their work on the housing bill today.\n  We have also pending a cloture vote tomorrow morning on the PEPFAR \nbill. I have had a conversation with the Republican assistant leader \nand we kind of know where we are on this issue. We could, with consent, \nmove that vote up today or do it in the morning. Whatever, we on this \nside would be satisfied to do it today.\n  I have had a conversation with Senator Biden, who has helped a great \ndeal on this piece of legislation, and he said he was going to confer \nwith Senator Lugar to see if the last kinks can be worked out. Frankly, \nthat is doubtful. So we can either have that cloture vote in the \nmorning or this afternoon, and we await the word of the minority as to \nwhat they wish to do on that issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6521-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6521-S6524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATIONS OF GENERAL DAVID H. PETRAEUS AND LIEUTENANT GENERAL RAYMOND \n                        T. ODIERNO TO BE GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session and consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nominations of Gen. David H. \nPetraeus and Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, Department of the Army, to be \ngeneral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have these two nominations before us. I \nunderstand the vote on the two nominations will take place at 2 p.m. or \nthereabouts.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee unanimously approved the \nnomination of General Petraeus for reappointment to the grade of \ngeneral and to be commander of the U.S. Central Command, and also the \nnomination of LTG Raymond Odierno for appointment to the grade of \ngeneral to be commander of the Multinational Force Iraq. The \nconfirmation of these nominations will provide a continuity of senior \nmilitary leadership for the region and for Operation Iraqi Freedom. \nThis continuity in U.S. military leadership will be helpful in working \nwith regional and Iraqi political and military leaders.\n  General Petraeus brings a large amount of experience and leadership \nto the position of CENTCOM commander. He has served over 30 years in \nthe military, including 3 tours of duty in Iraq, first as commander of \nthe 101st Airborne Division, then as commander of the Multinational \nSecurity Transition Command Iraq, and since February of 2007, as \ncommander of the Multinational Force Iraq. As the Multinational Force \nIraq commander, General Petraeus has led a shift in tactics in Iraq, \nhelping to calm, hopefully permanently, very violent sectarian \nconflict.\n  If confirmed as CENTCOM commander, General Petraeus would continue to \noversee the U.S. troops in Iraq, drawing on his knowledge of the \nsituation on the ground and his working relationships with Iraqi \npolitical and military leaders. He would also be responsible for \naddressing an increasingly violent insurgency in Afghanistan and other \nimportant national security interests throughout the CENTCOM region.\n  General Odierno is well qualified for his new duties, with 32 years \nof uniformed service, including 2 tours in Iraq, first as commander of \nthe 4th Infantry Division, and until recently as commander, \nMultinational Corps Iraq, in which he worked directly under the command \nof General Petraeus. He has assisted the change in operational approach \nin Iraq toward counterinsurgency. He understands that Iraqis must \nachieve political reconciliation to unite their country and to provide \nmore effective governance for Iraq. He understands the importance of \nand is committed to increasing the Iraqi security forces technical \ncapability, professionalism, evenhandedness, and full integration so \nthey can eventually assume total and effective responsibility for their \nown nation's stability. He understands the recent gains in reducing \nviolence, controlling militias, and rejection of al-Qaida must be \nsupported and expanded by an Iraqi Government which grows more capable \nand is more attuned to meeting the needs of the Iraqi people. And most \nimportantly, General Odierno understands the necessity for Iraqi \npolitical leaders to take responsibility for their own country--to take \nresponsibility politically, economically, and militarily.\n  So our country, I believe, is indebted to the service of General \nPetraeus and General Odierno for their willingness to continue that \nservice, and we are also indebted to their families for the sacrifices \nthose families endure when their two loved ones spend so much time in \nsuch difficult areas.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these two nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to inform the chairman that I shall \nspeak myself, and Senators Sessions, Chambliss, and Graham also hope to \nbe recognized. I have inquired at the desk, and there is some \nflexibility in our time here this morning, and we will go from one side \nto the other if Senator Levin has colleagues who are going to speak.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on that point, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, there is 20 minutes equally \ndivided.\n\n[[Page S6522]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. And how much time did I use?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority side has 6 minutes 34 seconds, \nand the Republican side has 9 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I have \nno objection to Senator Warner's yielding to the Senators he has \nidentified, or other Senators speaking beyond that 9 minutes, or \nwhatever time he has. But I will have to reserve the remainder of my \ntime, because I think there may be speakers on my side who may oppose \nthe nominations, and I want to protect them if they do. So I ask that \nsame courtesy then be agreed to by the good Senator from Virginia, if \nthere is additional time needed on our side for speakers.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, subject to my leadership, I will certainly \nrecommend that be done.\n  Mr. President, very simply, two of America's finest sons are before \nthis body with the very important responsibility entrusted by the \nFounding Fathers as they wrote the Constitution of the United States; \nnamely, that the Senate shall give advice and consent. I have had the \nprivilege through my lifetime to be associated with many senior \nofficers of all branches of our military. I say unreservedly, these are \ntwo of the most extraordinary that I have been privileged to know and \nwork with in my long career.\n  On many trips to Afghanistan and to Iraq with the distinguished \nchairman of the committee--we so often travel together--on a number of \nthose occasions we worked directly with General Petraeus and General \nOdierno. Therefore, they both have my strongest endorsement, and I \ncongratulate them individually and I also congratulate their families. \nThese are two fine officers, and their families have participated in \ntheir careers and backed them. If you look at the length of service \nthat each has had in four deployed regions, most specifically Iraq, it \nhas been a very extensive period of time, and the consequences on the \nfamily are often difficult to bear. But the families have stood by \nthese fine officers through these long deployments.\n  Both nominees have had extraordinary experience, and therefore I \nanticipate we will have a very positive confirmation by the Senate. \nThey are highly experienced, indeed specifically trained. I sort of \nedited that word into my remarks because they have served a number of \ntimes in Iraq and moved up to higher responsibilities--in the case of \nGeneral Odierno, and in General Petraeus, he takes on responsibility \nfor the entire region. But he is magnificently trained to do so.\n  Further, as we approach, again, our constitutional system by which we \nchange Presidents, there is a continuity that these two officers offer \nby virtue of serving in these positions, if it is the will of the next \nPresident. That is invaluable in this region. That is because, as the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair and many others know, the cultural \nsituation in this part of the world is a very challenging one to fully \nunderstand and appreciate; to see that our Armed Forces act with them, \nwork with them in such a way as to achieve the goals but at the same \ntime protect our Armed Forces.\n  I say ``with'' because the nations of Iraq and Afghanistan are now \nsovereign nations. As such, we are there by consent of that sovereignty \nto work with their forces.\n  I also add that I don't know that I have ever experienced a dimension \nin contemporary times where the professional officers have had to work \nso very closely with other members of the executive branch, notably the \nNational Security Council and the Department of State, working hand in \nhand.\n  The current Ambassador in Iraq, Ambassador Crocker, is well known in \nthe Senate, and I believe extremely admired and respected for the \nservices he has rendered. He has been a partner with General Petraeus \nin working through their individual responsibilities, coming before the \nCongress jointly to make their reports. They know the region, they know \nthe background, and they are fully qualified to undertake these \nresponsibilities.\n  At this point, I would like to yield the floor to my other \ncolleagues. I may have a few closing remarks.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Georgia, a member of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, Senator Warner, Chairman Levin, thanks \nfor getting these nominations up in short order.\n  I rise to speak in favor of the nominations of GEN David Petraeus to \nbe Commander, United States Central Command, and LTG Raymond Odierno to \nbe General and Commander, Multi-National Forces--Iraq.\n  Over the past few years under the leadership of these two men we have \nseen vast improvements in the conditions on the ground in Iraq, the \nquality and number of the Iraqi security forces, and increasing \nownership of the political process and issues facing their country by \nthe Iraqi government and the Iraqi people. These accomplishments are \ndue to the efforts of our young men and women in uniform who have \nsacrificed to defend our values and build democracy in Iraq. General \nPetreaus and General Odierno have led these men and women and they have \ndone so ably, wisely, and with integrity and professionalism. They are \nwithout question the right men for the jobs for which they have been \nnominated.\n  Our young soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in Iraq and \nAfghanistan have had the opportunity to be led by some of the greatest \nmilitary leadership we have witnessed in our era. General Petraeus and \nGeneral Odierno embody our military values and leadership principles in \nthe tradition of great military leaders who have come before them. \nThese two combat veterans, who between them have served our Nation in \nuniform for over 60 years, have demonstrated that they have the skills \nand commitment to carry out and complete our mission in Iraq and \nsafeguard our 150,000 servicemembers in Iraq.\n  With the right leadership--which these two generals can provide--Iraq \nwill continue to benefit from the implementation of our current \nmilitary and security strategy. I feel honored to have witnessed the \nefforts of these two soldiers and am certain that their leadership will \ncontinue to successfully guide our efforts in Iraq.\n  I have had the opportunity to visit one on one with both General \nPetraeus and Lieutenant General Odierno on the multiple trips I made to \nIraq. I often refer to David Petraeus as being the best soldier that \nthe U.S. Army has today. General Odierno is right there with him. They \nhave the greatest men and women serving under them. Without their \noutstanding leadership, certainly we would not have been able to \naccomplish what we have in Iraq over the past year and a half.\n  The first time I saw David Petraeus in action in Iraq was while \ntraining Iraqi security forces. He did a great job correlating the \nefforts of the Iraqi military on the ground with the security forces. \nHe had a way of directing the Iraqi military commanders in a way that \nwas extremely unusual, very positive, and very professional.\n  Today, what we are seeing as a result of the efforts of David \nPetraeus is an Iraqi military that is growing stronger, more confident \nand in the short term, is going to be in a much better position than \ncertainly they are even today of protecting the citizens of Iraq from \nexternal sources. They will also help the security forces provide \ndomestic security for Iraqi citizens.\n  General Odierno has made great sacrifices by being away from his \nfamily for so long. He just returned from Iraq. Now we are asking him--\nand he has graciously committed, once again, for the benefit of service \nto our country--to return to Iraq to be in the position of commander on \nthe ground. He is truly a great individual and certainly his record in \nthe military speaks for itself.\n  Both of these men deserve our utmost respect and certainly a strong \nvote in this body confirming their positions.\n  In closing, let me say a commitment to the military is a family \ncommitment. Both General Petraeus and General Odierno have made great \nsacrifices being away from their families for extended periods of \ntime--not just while they have been serving our country in Iraq and \nAfghanistan but certainly previous to that time also. I do know they \nhave been away from home for an extended period of time. Without the \ngreat support of their families they would not have been as successful \nas\n\n[[Page S6523]]\n\nthey have. I salute their families as well as saluting them both.\n  I urge this body to give a strong and resounding vote in favor of \nthese two men for the positions for which they have respectively been \nnominated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Georgia. He is a strong voice on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. His views with regard to the \nqualifications of these two officers with whom he has worked over these \nmany years are of great value to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I see the presence on the floor of our distinguished \ncolleague, another member of the committee, Senator Sessions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner. I would share a \nfew thoughts. You might ask why is it that generals throughout our \nhistory, particularly successful generals, have been as popular as they \nhave been? I think it is because they are called upon to lead our \nsoldiers in a life-and-death struggle. And at given times in history, \nsome people's talents and gifts and understanding of the nature of the \ncombat are such that they can bring us to success with the least \npossible cost and the least number of lives lost. I believe--not that \nother generals are not as good or as decent people--but at certain \ntimes certain people have those capabilities.\n  In General Petraeus we are fortunate to have one of our finest \ncommanders. We are particularly fortunate that his gifts and graces and \ntalents are such that they are perfectly suited to the type of combat \nin which we have been involved. He was a commander of the 101st \nAirborne. He is a warrior. He knows the nature of combat. He is a \nsensitive and decent person, but he understands the nature of combat \nand the importance of victory. He knows how to impose a cost on an \nenemy and minimize the losses to the American side. I think we are \nlucky to have him.\n  He finished at the top of his class at West Point, one of their \noutstanding graduates. He was No. 1 in his class at the Army's Command \nand General Staff College. He has a Ph.D. from Princeton University in \ninternational relations. He has taught that subject as well.\n  When I first met him he was in Iraq. The 101st had taken Mosul in the \nnorth. He had a superb grasp of the situation. He was reaching out to \nreconcile the disparate groups. He introduced me to the town council. \nOne member was a Kurd and one was a Christian and one was a Sunni and \none was a Shia. It was an effort that he understood was important: to \nreconcile the differences there. After his departure, things did not go \nas well as when he was there.\n  The second time I met him in Iraq was when he was in charge of \ntraining the local Iraqi police and military. President Bush had asked \nhim to go back and do that important task. It was a critically \nimportant task, the President believed, and General Petraeus was one of \nthe most talented people we had, so he was asked to go back. He worked \nin that capacity for a year.\n  He came home and then wrote the counterinsurgency manual for the \nDepartment of Defense. This thick manual is a doctrinal statement on \nhow to confront and defeat an insurgency, a very important skill at \nthis time in history. The ink was hardly dry on that document when \nPresident Bush and the Secretary of Defense asked him to go back to \nIraq and command our forces.\n  So in February of 2007 we confirmed him by an overwhelming vote to go \nback and lead our forces in Iraq. During that time the surge was \ndebated, and the Congress overwhelmingly, in a bipartisan way, \nconfirmed General Petraeus to go to Iraq. And later in May we voted to \nfund that surge. The phrase often used was: to give General Petraeus a \nchance. We wanted to give him a chance to employ new tactics a and more \nclassic counterinsurgency doctrine, in which he was an expert. As a man \nwho had already spent 2 years in Iraq, he was already closely attuned \nto all of the difficulties in that country. He went back and had \nextraordinary success.\n  General Odierno has also been there all along, and played an \ninstrumental role in the U.S. military's success. I had the opportunity \nto visit with him twice in Iraq, an extremely important man. In the \nWeekly Standard, Frederick Kagan and Kimberly Kagan, very astute \nobservers of the scene in Iraq, referred to General Odierno, as: ``The \nPatton of Counterinsurgency.'' They said:\n\n       With a sequence of brilliant offenses, Raymond Odierno \n     adopted the Petraeus Doctrine into a successful operational \n     art.\n\n  So we are lucky to have a good team here. The Kagans refer to \ngenerals coming in pairs. They noted: Eisenhower and Patton, Grant and \nSherman, Napoleon and Davout, Marlborough and Eugene, Caesar and \nLabienus. Well, I do not know why he did not mention Lee and Jackson in \nthat group. But generals do often come in pairs, and this pair is \nunique.\n  Now General Petraeus will be moving up to command the Central \nCommand. Of course his most critical areas are Iraq and Afghanistan. \nGeneral Odierno will be replacing General Petraeus, and I believe we \ncould not have a better circumstance from a command point of view. I \ncould not be happier with the team we have there. I will note that this \nMay, under their leadership, we saw the fewest U.S. deaths of any month \nsince the war began, and July is currently on pace to see even fewer. \nRemarkable progress has happened. We should confirm these people and be \nmost thankful that we have them as leaders.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nAlabama, a member of the committee. He is a very strong voice. I only \nadd to your observations, which are very accurate about the situation \nin Iraq, we all share a concern about the worsening situation in \nAfghanistan, and that will become General Petraeus's top \nresponsibility. We are fortunate that he is eminently qualified and has \nstudied the culture of the region, having understood the complexity, \nthe geopolitical situation with regard to Pakistan and Iran. He is \neminently qualified to step in and be the commander of those forces in \nthat region.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I agree. I note he has a Ph.D. from Princeton in \ninternational relations. He has taught that. So you are right. He has \nthe combat experience as well as the geopolitical expertise.\n  Mr. WARNER. But his boots are on the ground now, not writing \ndissertations.\n  Mr. President, I see our distinguished colleague from South Carolina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Levin and the \ncommittee for moving these names forward so we can get these two fine \nmen into new jobs. The committee worked very decisively and quickly, \nand we are going to have a vote here soon. I hope we can get as close \nto 100 as possible.\n  My observation about these two officers is very similar to what \nSenator Sessions said. But having met them and spent some time with \nthem in theater, and I got to know them pretty well, I need to say \nsomething on their behalf, that they could have not done this without \nthe people under their command.\n  I have spent a lot of time in Iraq, like many Members here. The \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, members of the Coast Guard, every \ncivilian force, have performed magnificently. General Petraeus came up \nwith a new strategy. Quite frankly, before he came along we were \nlosing.\n  You can talk about Iraq in any terms you want to, political or \notherwise. But it was my view that the situation on the ground in Iraq, \nbefore this new strategy, was going to result in losing, that we were \nlosing ground against the insurgency and that General Petraeus and \nGeneral Odierno came up with a new way of doing business, getting the \ntroops out into the field, the joint security stations, where our \nsoldiers would live with the Iraqi police and the army.\n  This has transformed the Iraqi Army, and the police are getting \nbetter. You see this in Basra, you see this in Mosul where the capacity \nof the Iraqi Army is a lot better than it was the last year in terms of \nthe capability and numbers. It was a direct result of changing \nstrategy, getting out from behind the walls, taking the fight to the \nenemy. The\n\n[[Page S6524]]\n\nAnbar Province strategy, with the Sunnis, the Shiaas turning on al-\nQaida, was the defining moment in this war. When General Petraeus came \nup with a strategy to try to get the Sunni population to break away \nfrom al-Qaida by providing better security, that turned the tide in \nAnbar.\n  The political progress we have seen with 15 of the 18 benchmarks \nbeing met by the Maliki government is a direct result of Ambassador \nCrocker and General Petraeus sitting down with the Iraqi leadership and \ndoing a lot of hand holding.\n  The military side of this is important, but I hope the members of the \nbody will appreciate how sophisticated General Petraeus, General \nOdierno, and Ambassador Crocker have been when it comes to the economic \nand political aspects of this. They have put money into projects that \nchanged the quality of life in Iraq, that got people more emboldened to \njoin with the Government. They pushed the Sunnis, the Shiaas, and the \nKurds to reach political compromise.\n  These are two of the most talented politicians I have ever met, even \nthough they are in uniform. They are American commanders who were dealt \na tough hand. And the politics of Iraq they understood as well, I \nbelieve, as the counterinsurgency problems the military faced. What \nthey have brought to the table will go down in history as the most \nsuccessful counterinsurgency operation in the history of warfare. I \nhave worked on judicial issues. They provided security to the judges, \nadditional capacity in the rule of law area. General Petraeus told me \nearly on: The population has to believe in the law, because if they do \nnot believe in the Government and the law, they will go to militias.\n  So we celebrate the success of these two men. But on their behalf, I \nwish to thank all of those who served under them, because they are the \nones who made it happen, along with great leadership. We are winning \nnow. We have not won yet, but the difference in Iraq before and after \nis stunning. It is for all of us to see--progress politically, \neconomically and militarily. I look forward to promoting these two fine \nofficers. Hats off to them and all those who serve in Iraq.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from South Carolina. \nHe is too modest to say it, but I think he has logged as many trips \ninto that region as any of us here, very often in the company of \nSenator McCain, who likewise has strong support for both of these \nofficers.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                             Road Home Tax\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his comments on \nthe pending nominations.\n  But I wanted to take a moment to speak about the housing bill that \npassed. It was a very significant piece of legislation. On behalf of \nthe people of Louisiana, I wanted to come to the floor to specifically \nthank Senator Dodd for his extraordinary leadership and tenacity in \ngetting this bill through the floor of the Senate. It has been stuck \nfor weeks. He got it unstuck this morning and passed it, and it has \nsignificant relief for homeowners throughout America, to help us stem \nthe foreclosure rate, to stem the tide of economic downturn in many \ncounties throughout our country. But for Louisiana, it has some very \nspecial relief. Part of that bill was actually crafted by Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley as chair and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, and there was a big piece of that in this housing bill. In \nthat Finance piece was a tax relief provision that is, in my view, \ncentral, crucial, and vital to the recovery, ongoing recovery of South \nLouisiana and the gulf coast.\n  We added this language to the Foreclosure Prevention Act back in \nApril, where it passed the Senate on a 74-5 vote and I am pleased to \nsee that the combined housing package preserves this critical \nassistance.\n  In short, the legislation ensures that hurricane survivors are \ntreated both fairly and with dignity as they struggle to rebuild their \nlives.\n  As you know, when these storms, Katrina and Rita, hit, now 3 years \nago, they were unprecedented in the size and scope of the destruction. \nThis country has not seen anything like it in well over 100 years, and \nhopefully we will not see anything like it for another 200 or 300 \nyears. When we went to the Federal toolbox, if you will, to see what \ntools were available to help the 250,000 homeowners who lost their \nhomes, many did not have insurance because their homes were paid for, \nor they were not in the flood plain. They lost everything, their homes, \ntheir business, their place of worship, the schools their children went \nto. So when we went to the toolbox, there were not adequate tools to \nhelp them. We have been crafting those tools slowly. It has been \nagonizing for people who are waiting for us to give them a hand.\n  Many of these taxpaying, hard-working citizens are not asking for \ncharity; they are asking for a chance to get their business back, get \ntheir feet back underneath them.\n  As you know, I am sure it is this way in Virginia. Most middle-class \nand upwardly mobile families have most of their net worth tied up in \ntheir home. So when their home is considered destroyed and the contents \nas well, it impacts the financial stability of that family.\n  That is why I have stayed focused on homes, on home rebuilding, and \non small businesses, because it is the backbone of our recovery. I am \nproud to say that in this bill, we were able to deliver $1 billion of \nrelief, literally $1 billion of relief to homeowners who you could \nargue deserve more help than almost any group of homeowners in America.\n  Again, these homeowners are suffering kind of a double whammy. Not \nonly did they go through Katrina and Rita, but they are also now in an \natmosphere of a slow real estate market; in some places a market that \nis spiraling downward because of the atmosphere of the country and the \neconomy; although actually at home our economy relative to the country \nis doing pretty well.\n  This underlying bill provides relief to homeowners along the gulf \ncoast who had their homes destroyed after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and \nWilma. In 2005, thousands of people along the gulf coast took casualty \nloss deductions on their tax returns due to damage that their \nproperties sustained from the hurricanes.\n  In 2007, many of the same people began to receive payments to cover \nuninsured losses to their property under Louisiana's Road Home program, \nMississippi's Housing Assistance program and similar programs in \nFlorida and in Texas.\n  The IRS has concluded, however, that individuals who took the \ncasualty loss deduction in 2005 and subsequently received a grant \npayment must add the value of the casualty loss deduction their 2007 \nincome.\n  This decision not only increases the amount of taxable income but \nalso: increases an individual's tax rate by bumping them into a higher \ntax bracket; subjects certain taxpayers to the Alternative Minimum Tax; \nphases out deductions; subjects an individual's Social Security \nbenefits to additional taxation; and makes a taxpayer ineligible for \nFederal student load aid.\n  So this relief was absolutely essential. Take the example of two very \nsimilar families--the Jones and the Smiths. Both earn $75,000 a year \nand both had homes that suffered substantial damage in Hurricane Rita. \nBoth of the families received a road home grant of $75,000 in 2007 to \ncover uninsured losses to their homes. So at this point, they are \nexactly the same.\n  In 2005, however, the Smiths took a $75,000 casualty loss deduction \nwhich entitled them to a refund of about $7,000.\n  According to the IRS, the Smith family had to add the value of their \n2005 casualty loss deduction, totaling $75,000, to their 2007 income. \nSo what is the result of this?\n  The Smith family had to pay $25,000 in taxes while the Jones family \nwill\n\n[[Page S6525]]\n\nhave to pay about $7,000 in taxes. That is over a 350-percent increase \nin taxes. Not only did the Smith's amount of taxable income increase, \nbut they were bumped into a higher tax bracket so their rate of taxable \nincome increased.\n  So what does this bill do? This bill would permit taxpayers to amend \ntheir 2005 tax returns to reduce or eliminate their casualty loss \ndeductions. By eliminating or reducing their casualty loss deduction, \nthey will not have to pay taxes on their road home grants. A current \nIRS regulation forbids individuals from amending their returns under \nthis circumstance.\n\n  So what effect would the bill have upon the Smith family. At the \noutset, they will not have over a 350 percent increase in their taxes. \nThey will, however, have to pay back their refund they got in 2005, \nwhich would be about $7,000 in addition to their normal taxes.\n  So by no means does this bill allow a free ride or any sort of \n``double dipping.'' They still have to undo their casualty loss, but \nthey will not be providing the IRS a windfall in taxes.\n  Finally, behind the numbers, it is important to remember that these \nare real people who have undergone a traumatic event, having their \nhomes destroyed.\n  The Smith family, before Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus came to \ntheir aid, would have had to pay over $24,000 in taxes. These families \nliterally are struggling to pay their electric bill, their utility \nbills, trying to pay double mortgages, rent and a mortgage on a house \ntrying to keep their house together. They could not have possibly come \nup with $25,000. That is what we have corrected it.\n  I thank this Senate for sending special care and attention to a \ngroup, hundreds of thousands of homeowners. It is not millions, it not \ntens of millions, but it is hundreds of thousands of homeowners along \nthe gulf coast who would truly benefit immediately and correctly. This \nmoney will go into their pocket and hopefully they will be spending it \non their new home or their new apartment or using it to pay back bills \nthey had to charge to their credit cards to literally survive these \nlast several years.\n  This bill also extends an important provision to spur investment in \nresidential and commercial property along the gulf coast. In response \nto Katrina and Rita, Congress enacted legislation that would permit \nbonus depreciation on new buildings.\n  In order to take advantage of the bonus depreciation, investors \nneeded to start construction on the property by December 31, 2007, and \nhave the property placed into service by December 31, 2008, for lesser \ndamaged counties and parishes and by December 31, 2010, for the most \ndamaged counties and parishes.\n  However, replacing the basic infrastructure needed to begin this \nconstruction has been slow and difficult. New environmental standards, \nbuilding codes, and the high price of insurance and labor have delayed \nnew construction. Many projects are planned, but these delays have \nresulted in few actual construction starts.\n  This bill would simply remove the commencement date to ensure that \nthe gulf coast can sustain and strengthen its recovery in the housing \nand commercial sectors. It does not change the completion date. By \ndoing so, we can continue to build new residential and commercial \nproperties that are necessary to our recovery.\n  I know this overall bill contains many critical parts to address our \nNation's housing troubles but I thought that it was important to \npersonalize how this bill will help thousands of people struggling to \nrebuild on the gulf coast.\n  I am very proud of the Senate. I do believe we should give tax relief \nwhen it makes sense. This most certainly makes sense. And $1 billion is \na lot of money. I know we are struggling to balance our budget, but I \nthink this was a very worthy expenditure. I thank Senator Dodd again, \nthank Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus particularly for remembering \nthe families on the gulf coast and for helping them to achieve \nsubstantial tax savings by the passage of this bill. It will go a long \nway, with the other provisions in this bill, to help our recovery that \nis underway in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            California Fires\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise today to express my deep \ngratitude to the men and women who are fighting the wildfires now \nraging in my magnificent State of California. Over the last month, a \nswarm of dry lightning storms sparked more than 1,800 fires across \ndrought-ridden land in California.\n  Governor Schwarzenegger and President Bush have declared a state of \nemergency in 11 counties and crews are still working to bring under \ncontrol over 300 fires burning across more than 600,000 acres of public \nand private land. Three hundred fires, and it is early July, and we do \nnot get rain usually until November.\n  In the fight against these fires, support has come from all quarters, \nincluding the National Guards of 11 States. I say to my colleagues all: \nThank you for your contribution. Help has come from the U.S. Marine \nCorps, the Navy, even from NASA.\n  I give special thanks to the more than 18,000--18,000--local, State, \nand Federal firefighters who have put their lives on the line over the \nlast several weeks and continue to do so to fight these fires and \nprotect our communities.\n  The people of California owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to the \nbrave men and women of CalFire and the U.S. Forest Service as well as \nthe California National Guard and all of the local fire departments who \nhave gone above and beyond the call of duty in fighting these fires.\n  Your courage and swift action during this recent series of firestorms \nhave truly been heroic. You have risked your health and your well-being \nfor the benefit of our people, of our communities, and we are all \ngrateful. You are the heroes.\n  Some 233 firefighter injuries have been reported in the past few \nweeks--233 firefighter injuries--and that is a testament to the great \npersonal risk these men and women undertake every day. These fires are \nunpredictable. The winds are unpredictable, and the danger shifts at a \nmoment's notice.\n  I am sad to report that these fires have claimed the life of one of \nour firefighters. Robert Roland, who had been with the Anderson Valley \nVolunteer Fire Department in Mendocino County for only 3 months, passed \naway on July 3, 2008, battling wildfires near the town of Philo. He was \n63 years old--a volunteer firefighter.\n  One of America's greatest strengths is its spirit of voluntarism, and \nnowhere is that spirit more evident than in the tradition of volunteer \nfirefighting.\n  We mourn his loss, and we remember and give thanks for his selfless \nefforts and those of all the firefighters--volunteer and professional--\nwho put their lives on the line throughout California.\n  The scale of these fires so early in the year is a stark reminder \nthat we cannot afford to shortchange our fire preparedness. Being \nprepared means making sure adequate resources are available to fight \nand prevent fires. That is why I have consistently fought against the \nproposed cuts to the Assistance to Firefighters Program. This program \nprovides Federal grants for equipment and training to local fire \ndepartments and emergency medical services organizations. I do not \nthink you need to look farther than the efforts being undertaken to \nsave lives and protect communities right now in California to \nunderstand that those proposed cuts are wrongheaded.\n  Preparedness is about more than funding. It also means making sure we \nhave a fully staffed firefighting force on our public lands.\n  I am concerned about the reports of inadequate staffing in our \nnational forests in California. Earlier this year, I called on the U.S. \nForest Service to resolve the pay disparities and retention issues that \nhave prevented them from recruiting and keeping qualified Federal \nfirefighters in California.\n  We also need to support the State and local efforts in order to \nmanage\n\n[[Page S6526]]\n\nthe risk posed by wildfires. One of the keys to preparedness is \nhazardous fuel reduction. Local communities and State agencies that do \ntheir part to remove hazardous fuel on local and State lands should not \nbe left at risk for fires because inadequate funds limit hazardous fuel \nreduction on Federal lands.\n  The Federal Government must be a good partner in not only fighting \nthe wildfires but in preventing them. That is why I have urged that we \ninclude $910 million for U.S. Forest Service and Interior Department \nfirefighting and fire prevention efforts--including efforts such as \nhazardous fuel reduction--in the legislation that Congress is expected \nto take up this session to address critical domestic priorities.\n  The unprecedented onset of the fire season in California is an \nimportant reminder that we cannot afford to continue reducing the \nresources available for disaster preparedness and expect emergency \nresponders to still be able to effectively protect our communities.\n  They are exhausted. They are working overtime and more. I want to \nread from a letter I am sending today to President Bush. I wrote this \nletter after speaking at length with my Governor, Governor \nSchwarzenegger:\n\n       With over 300 fires still actively burning in California, I \n     am writing to request that you immediately allocate \n     additional resources to assist with ongoing firefighting \n     efforts throughout my state. Governor Schwarzenegger has \n     informed me that an additional 41 helicopters, 302 hand \n     crews, 616 fire engines, and 773 support personnel are \n     urgently needed to help the thousands of Federal, State, \n     local, and volunteer fire fighters who are working so hard to \n     protect our communities from these dangerous fires.\n       Governor Schwarzenegger also informed me he plans to call \n     up as many as 2,000 more members of the National Guard in \n     addition to the over one thousand members that are currently \n     supporting fire fighting activities. In order to ensure that \n     our National Guard is ready for this mission, I request that \n     the Administration make available out-of-State Federal \n     firefighters to help train National Guard members for fire \n     fighting duties. Active fire crews are currently being taken \n     away from the front lines of fires to train National Guard \n     members, but if Federal personnel were on scene to help train \n     new arrivals, our crews could continue to fight active fires.\n\n  I might say what is happening is we are taking firefighters off the \nline to train the National Guard because they need to be extensively \ntrained in firefighting, and we need to get those firefighters back on \nthe line. So if we could have some Federal firefighters sent in, we \nwould be able to keep these firefighters on the line.\n\n       The Governor has also informed me that he requested the \n     U.S. Forest Service's Maximum Efficiency Level be increased \n     to 100 percent for the current fire season in California. \n     This will allow Federal incident commanders to make tactical \n     firefighting decisions as needed to protect lives and homes \n     without having to receive prior approval from the Office of \n     Management and Budget. I strongly support his request and \n     urge you to grant it immediately.\n       This unprecedented start to the fire season in California \n     has put incredible stress on the State's resources and on the \n     brave men and women fighting these fires. While the support \n     provided by the Administration has been very helpful thus \n     far, the severity of the ongoing fires and the strong \n     potential for more fires indicates an urgent need for \n     additional resources and support.\n       The residents of California need the Administration's \n     continued assistance and cooperation in protecting their \n     lives and property.\n\n  Madam President, this is one Nation under God, and we know that, and \nwe say it when we pledge allegiance every day here.\n  The fact is, we need to come to the aid of our citizens, whether it \nis in the devastating floods in Iowa or it is Hurricane Katrina or it \nis the fire that I well remember in North Dakota or what is happening \ntoday in California.\n  We must work together. I want to say right now that I will be making \na call to the head of Homeland Security, Mr. Chertoff. I hope he has \nheard my words. I hope he has received a copy of my letter. We are \ngoing to need this help quickly. We expect--and this is right from my \nGovernor--about a 5-month problem here. This is not going to be a \nmomentary problem. We need a long-term commitment from everyone in \norder to save lives and save property and allow our firefighters a \nlittle bit of rest, because when they are exhausted, their lives are \nput in danger, and we cannot have that.\n  I thank you very much for the time, Madam President, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Madam President, I come to the floor after reading something I find \nvery shocking. This is evidently in an interview with the Washington \nTimes, referred to today by Jonathan Weisman. It has this quote. Former \nSenator Phil Gramm, a top policy adviser of Senator John McCain's, said \nthe Nation is in a ``mental recession,'' not an actual one, and \nsuggested the United States has ``become a nation of whiners.''\n  Senator McCain is in my State of Michigan at this moment today. I \ncertainly want to go on record here on the floor of the Senate to say \nthat the people of Michigan are not whiners. The people of this \ncountry, who have seen their jobs slip away--over 325,000 jobs since \nJanuary, good-paying American jobs--are not whiners. People have seen \ngas prices going up and up and oil prices doubling over the last 10 \nmonths. This is not a nation of whiners. We are seeing food costs go \nup, health care costs go up, gas prices go up, everything in people's \nlives going up. Every middle-class family, every family in America is \nstruggling while they see their wages go down, if they have a job at \nall. This is not a nation of whiners; this is a nation of tough people \ntrying to survive, Americans who believe in this country, who believe \nin the American dream, who are fighting to keep their way of life in \nthis country today.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will my friend yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I will be happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am just stunned that Phil Gramm, who is a top adviser \nto Senator McCain--would you repeat exactly what he said?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes. I would be happy to. He said the Nation is in a \nmental recession, not an actual one, and suggested that the United \nStates has become a nation of whiners.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me get this straight. Senator McCain's top adviser--\none of his top advisers on the economy--says we are in a mental \nrecession, there is no actual recession, and we are whining about it.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Right, absolutely.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me ask my friend, what does she hear in her State \nabout gas prices from her constituents?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank my friend from California, who \ncomes to the floor and fights every day on behalf of middle-class \nAmericans and people struggling to make it. We in Michigan have the \nhighest unemployment rate in the country--8.5 percent as of the last \nnumbers. So people are losing their jobs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is that mental? Do they just think they are unemployed \nbut they are really employed? What is he talking about?\n  Ms. STABENOW. The Senator from California is absolutely right. The \nfact is that folks who are losing their jobs or who are seeing their \nwages cut in half are seeing gas prices go up and up and up.\n  We have had two oilmen in the White House for 8 years, and we have \nhad now the highest gas prices we have ever had to pay while they \nprotect oil profits, oil company profits over and over again. This is \nnot an accident, what has happened here. I think it is almost too \nobvious. We have two oilmen in the White House, and we are in the \nsituation we are today, with families struggling to get to work, to get \nthe children to childcare, maybe to go on a vacation, who can't hold \nthings together, and they are looking around, saying: What in the world \nis happening? Now, we are hearing from a top adviser of someone who \nwants to be the next President that this is a mental recession and that \nwe are whiners.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend continue to yield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am happy to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I didn't expect to stay here and engage my friend, the \nSenator from Michigan, but when she read this--I know what her State is \ngoing through, and I have to say that California is suffering as well. \nIf it were not for the fact that we have seen companies invest in \nalternative energy, and that is taking some of the jobs--\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\nand thank goodness--away from a crumbling housing industry, we would be \nin worse shape. We are not in good shape in California. We have real \nproblems.\n  My friend from Michigan makes a good point. Two men in the White \nHouse--and I remember when George Bush was running in the beginning and \nsaying: Well, put two oilmen in the White House, and we will see how we \nwill deal with gas prices. Well, we have seen.\n  Is my friend aware that since George Bush and Dick Cheney--two \noilmen--took over the White House, we have seen about a 255-percent \nincrease in the cost of gas per gallon? Is my friend aware of that?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am aware of that. It is outrageous. It is so stunning \nthat this would be happening and be so obvious in terms of allegiance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me ask one more question, and then I will leave her \nto the rest of her remarks. I know she has some thoughts she needs to \nshare. As Phil Gramm, the economic adviser to John McCain, says that \nAmericans are whining, we all know that the middle class is suffering, \nas the Senator from Michigan said, not just from gas prices but as a \nresult of food prices, health care prices, credit card rates. There is \na middle-class squeeze going on that is hitting our people very hard, \nand they are falling behind by thousands of dollars a year because of \nincreased prices. Now, Phil Gramm, he doesn't feel the pain. He \nprobably is in the top one-tenth of 1 percent of income earners, let me \nsay.\n  I wish to ask my friend, and then I will leave her to her speech, \ndoes she know how much the head of ExxonMobil made this year?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Well, I know this: I know ExxonMobil has made the \nhighest profits of any company ever in the entire world. I don't know \nthe exact number, but my guess is that it is a lot more than people in \nMichigan are making.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, the CEO, the chief executive officer of ExxonMobil, \naccording to my information, including his last paycheck and bonuses \nand the rest, made $400 million in 1 year. So no, he is not whining, \nand Phil Gramm is not whining. That is obvious. They are the winners in \nthis economy with two oilmen in the White House.\n  I wish to thank my friend.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I so much appreciate my friend from \nCalifornia and her advocacy on a daily basis on this floor for people \nwho are feeling the squeeze on all sides.\n\n  We are seeing a situation in this country where, frankly, most \nmiddle-class families, as well as small businesses and large businesses \nand those who want to do business in this country, just can't take any \nmore. We are at the limit right now of what we can absorb in terms of \nhigher and higher costs on people every day, with lower and lower \nwages, maybe losing a pension, maybe losing your health care.\n  What we have seen over the last 8 years is the creation of a race to \nthe bottom in a global economy, a race to the bottom where the average \nAmerican is told: If you only work for less, pay more in health care, \nand lose your pension, maybe we can be competitive. As Democrats, we \nbelieve in a race to the top. As Democrats, we believe it is critical \nthat we address the squeeze middle-class families are feeling if we are \ngoing to have an economy.\n  What has made us strong among nations around the world is a strong, \nvibrant middle class, folks who can have the American dream, who know \nthey can have that job. In Michigan, it is to have a home and maybe a \nlittle cottage up north or a boat to go around the beautiful Great \nLakes and enjoy fishing and hunting and know they can send the kids to \ncollege--all of those things that have meant the great American dream \nfor families in America. It is slipping away because of the policies of \nthe last 8 years, not paying attention to what is happening to our \nglobal economy and making it worse by, in fact, protecting those whose \nprofits are getting higher and higher at the expense of middle-class \nAmericans.\n  So I would just say that to hear we are a nation of whiners from \nsomeone who is advising someone who wants to be the President of the \nUnited States--alarm bells should be going off to every single person \nwho drives up to a pump today and has to pay somewhere between $4 and \n$5 a gallon for gasoline or goes to the store and sees the price of \nmilk going up and bread and everything else they need to feed their \nfamily or sees their costs of health care going up, if they are \nfortunate enough to have health care alone.\n  So I certainly invite Senator McCain to come to my State of Michigan \nas many times as he would like, and I hope he listens very, very hard. \nI hope he doesn't hear it as whining. I hope he hears it as a sign of \nproud, patriotic, America-loving people who just expect decisions here \nin this Government to be made in their best interests, not in the best \ninterests of oil companies or credit card companies or insurance \ncompanies that aren't willing to cover their health problems. People \nwant to know that, in fact, their families will be put first for a \nchange. That has not happened in the last 8 years. We certainly don't \nneed more of that.\n  Frankly, when I look at the gas price situation alone, I must say, if \nI remember correctly--and I will check this for sure--if I remember \nright, the gentleman who now calls us a ``nation of whiners'' actually \nauthored language that began to deregulate the energy markets back in \n2000, which has actually created much of the situation we are in today, \nwith lack of accountability and transparency and gas prices, oil \nprices, going up and up and up.\n  The people of this country have had enough, and they expect us to \nwork together in their interests. They expect that we will put them and \ntheir families first, that we will do everything possible to create a \nclimate where they can get a good-paying job and work hard every day \nand know that if they play by the rules in America, they are going to \nbe able to have a better life for their children than they have had for \nthemselves. That is all on the line right now in America because of \nwhat has been happening in the last 8 years.\n  We are not a nation of whiners. America is going through tough times. \nEven though times are tough, so are we. We are tough, resilient, hard-\nworking people. I am proud of the people of my State who are working \nhard to keep their heads above water, to keep their families and their \nhouses, to be able to keep some kind of an income coming in in the \nmidst of all of this. I am proud to fight for them every day, along \nwith a caucus that understands what is happening and which is going to \ndo everything we can to turn this around.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, Senator Grassley \nbe recognized to speak, to be followed by Senator Pryor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The first assistant bill clerk [William Walsh] proceeded to call the \nroll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Changes in the Tax System\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, as the upcoming Presidential election \napproaches, we are learning more about changes each of the major \ncandidates would make in our tax system.\n  Most of the attention in this regard is going to issues such as \nincome tax rates, corporate tax rates, and the alternative minimum tax. \nThese are very important parts of our Tax Code and do deserve the \nattention they are getting--particularly in a Presidential race--\nbecause then you have an opportunity not only to state your views but \nto educate the public about the complications of the Tax Code. This is \nwhat the public needs to know more about.\n  Now, my purpose for coming to the floor, too, is to discuss some of \nthe lesser known parts of the Tax Code that are becoming part of the \nPresidential debate on taxes. Changes made in these areas can still \nmake big differences in what citizens pay to the Government every year.\n  I am here to discuss what is termed the ``Pease limit,'' the overall \nlimitation on itemized deductions. That name comes from a Member of \nCongress probably 20 years ago who thought up the term. Then the word \n``PEP'' is a phaseout of personal exemptions. So we are talking about a\n\n[[Page S6528]]\n\npart of the Tax Code that does things in a stealth way to make people \npay higher marginal tax rates, even though the law would say that the \nmarginal tax rate is only 35 percent--or in the case of Senator Obama's \nproposal, 39.6 percent. But yet when you put limitations in there and a \nphaseout of the personal exemption, you have a higher marginal tax \nrate, but it doesn't look very--it is not transparent.\n  So PEP and Pease were originally enacted by a Democratic Congress as \na way of evading the first President Bush's refusal to raise the top \nstatutory tax rate. By phasing out the personal exemption and itemized \ndeductions for upper income taxpayers, the Democratic Congress was able \nto enact a kind of backdoor tax increase. However, in 2001, when I \nbecame chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Congress reduced PEP \nand Pease in order to reduce taxpayer confusion and minimize \ninequalities based on a taxpayer's understanding of the law. But from \nmy point of view, I figured if you are going to have a higher marginal \ntax rate, you should not camouflage them. You ought to simply say, \ninstead of a 33 percent marginal tax rate, we are going to have 36 or \n37 percent. Maybe for people who have income from subchapter S, it is \neven higher than that. Why not be honest with the taxpayers and say \nwhat the marginal tax rate is, instead of hiding it in this camouflaged \nway called PEP and Pease?\n  That bipartisan simplification was done at the recommendation of the \nnonpartisan Committee on Taxation to get around a principle that was \nput in place--or that recommendation was carried out by the nonpartisan \nJoint Tax Committee because we ought to be very transparent in our tax \nlaws.\n  Despite this, those who see more Government spending as the solution \nto all the problems are desperate to seize more money from the American \ntaxpayers.\n  We are hearing rumors of let's go back to camouflage. The junior \nSenator from Illinois would need more money to fund all the promises he \nis making. Restoring the phaseouts for itemized deductions and personal \nexemptions seems a likely source of some of that money. In discussing \nthe tax proposals of the likely Democratic nominee, I am referring to a \npublication titled ``A Preliminary Analysis of the 2008 Presidential \nCandidates' Tax Plans.'' This was prepared by an organization called \nthe Tax Policy Center. The Tax Policy Center is a joint venture of the \nUrban Institute and the Brookings Institution, both well-respected \nthink tanks.\n  According to this publication, my distinguished colleague from \nIllinois would restore PEP and Pease. In other words, he would bring \nless transparency to what is a higher marginal tax rate. That is, he \nwould restore the phaseouts and the complexity they would mean for \nmillions of tax-paying families. However, it is also noted that he \nwould set an increased income threshold of $250,000 for married couples \nfiling jointly. This is consistent with the candidate's stated goal of \ntargeting tax breaks to low- and middle-income taxpayers while shifting \nmore of the tax burden on the higher income taxpayers.\n  If your family makes less than $250,000 a year, you might think this \nsounds like a good deal. For singles, the threshold for phaseout of \npersonal exemptions would probably be lower, but the phaseout of \nitemized deductions would not vary with the filing status if current \nlaw is followed.\n  As an aside, the proposal of the distinguished junior Senator from \nIllinois would create a new marriage penalty. For those considered by \nthe Senator from Illinois to be low- and middle-income taxpayers, the \nidea of raising taxes on other people might sound like a good idea but \nhold on.\n  On March 14 of this year, this body approved a budget with 51 votes. \nOne of those 51 ``yea'' votes was cast by the Presidential candidate \nfrom Illinois. That same Senator voted again for the budget on June 4, \nwhen the Senate voted on that conference report. I am not sure if he is \nnot communicating with the rest of the Democratic caucus or was too \nbusy campaigning to become completely familiar with the budget. But he \nis making promises that the budget he voted for will not allow.\n  The budget passed by Congress earlier this year would protect \ntaxpayers in the 10-percent and 15-percent brackets but would subject \nfilers in the 25-percent bracket and brackets above to these camouflage \nprovisions I have been talking about that we call PEP and Pease. To get \nan idea of what this means, I wish to walk through the 25-percent \nbracket, the 28-percent bracket, and the 33-percent bracket.\n  These particular brackets are important because they contain families \nwith less than $250,000 in income and singles with less than $125,000 \nin annual income. It has been implied that the junior Senator from \nIllinois would protect these filers from tax increases as President. \nBut restoring PEP and Pease provisions within the confines of this \nyear's budget would subject filers in these brackets to this backdoor \ncamouflage, the less transparent tax increase. The Senator from \nIllinois may say he is going to protect families earning less than \n$250,000 a year, but the budget he voted for will not do that.\n  According to the Internal Revenue Service, single individuals falling \nwithin the 25-percent bracket in 2008 start at taxable income of more \nthan $32,550. That is not a high-income person. They earn taxable \nincome of no more than $78,850--in a lot of places in this country, \nthat is not a very high income. It is high for my State of Iowa, but it \nis not high for a lot of States. Singles in the 28-percent bracket will \nearn taxable income of more than $78,850 but less than $164,550. The \nimportant number is $125,000. If that many filers in the 25-percent and \n28-percent brackets make less than that, based on the Democratic \nbudget, these taxpayers would be hit with a PEP and Pease camouflage, \nless transparent rates of taxation.\n  Looking at the brackets for married filing jointly for the 2008 tax \nyear, according to the IRS, married filers in the 25-percent bracket \nwill start at a taxable income of more than $65,100. Taxpayers in this \nbracket will earn taxable income of no more than $131,450 annually. In \nthe 28-percent bracket, they will earn taxable income of no more than \n$200,300. For the 33-percent bracket, married filers filing jointly \nwill earn no more than $357,700 but more than $200,300. For married \nindividuals filing jointly, the important number is $250,000.\n  Filers in the tax brackets I have walked through may expect the \nSenator from Illinois to protect them from tax increases if he is \nelected President. But the budget he voted for earlier this year makes \nthat impossible.\n  As I said, the reinstatement of PEP and Pease amounts to a backdoor \ntax increase. I say backdoor because it increases the effective rate \nfor many filers without really increasing the statutory tax rate. That \nis why it is camouflaged. That is why it is less transparent. And if \nyou want to increase taxes, you ought to have guts enough to say what \nis the real marginal tax rate and put it in the tax laws, just like the \n25, the 28, the 33, and the 35 are now.\n  For a family of four, this backdoor tax increase would be \nsignificant. If your family falls in the 25-percent tax bracket, \naccording to the Finance Committee Republican staff analysis from March \n2001, PEP and Pease could make your actual rate 26 percent. We can see \nthe difference between the green line and the red line is when you are \nhit with PEPs and Peases. Your tax increase is going to be at a higher \nrate than what your tax form really says it will be. Again, why \ncamouflage it?\n  The news is even worse--and I will have charts on this point--for \nfilers in the 28-percent bracket and the 33-percent bracket. In the 28-\npercent bracket, a family of four could pay a real tax rate of 32 \npercent. So if you want people of that tax bracket to actually pay 32 \npercent, why don't you have a tax bracket that says it instead of \ncamouflaging it? A family in the 33-percent bracket, as we can see in \nthe next chart, a family of four could pay a rate of 37 percent. Again, \nthe difference between the 33 is what you are told in your tax rate \nchart you are going to pay, but as a practical matter, you are paying 4 \npercentage points higher.\n  I end by stating that I believe taxes are a necessary part of life. \nWe all benefit from the services our Government provides, and that \nGovernment needs money to function. We collect that money from taxes. \nHowever, I think our tax system should be transparent\n\n[[Page S6529]]\n\nand honest, not camouflaged. Raising money by limiting personal \nexemptions and itemized deductions is not transparent. As I have said, \nit amounts to a backdoor tax increase. If anyone thinks people should \nhand over a greater percentage of their income to the Government, that \nperson should openly advocate increasing statutory rates.\n  I am also concerned that many people around the country may be \nrelying on the latest campaign position of the junior Senator from \nIllinois. That latest campaign position says he intends to protect low- \nand middle-income tax filers from tax increases. Right now, he is at \nodds with his own party and with a budget for which he voted. I bet \nthat being subjected to a backdoor tax increase is not the sort of \nchange most Americans believe in, to say nothing of restoring what the \nnonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation stated was a very serious \nsource of complexity for the American taxpayers, a complexity we took \nout in the 2001 tax bill.\n  A series of correspondence has gone back and forth between the \nRepublican and Democratic leadership regarding the extension of \nexpiring tax provisions and energy tax incentives. On July 3, Leader \nMcConnell sent a letter to the majority leader urging that he work with \nus to find areas of bipartisan agreement in order to break the current \nimpasse over extending time-sensitive provisions that we call \nextenders, both for energy and the other category of extenders, such as \nR tax credits, an example of about 40 that have to be extended.\n  On that day, the majority leader responded in a fairly sharp manner:\n\n       While I am pleased the Republicans appear to have abandoned \n     their fiscally irresponsible ways when it comes to the \n     extenders bill, it is hard to comprehend why Senators \n     McConnell and Grassley would choose to cut programs to help \n     working families, seniors and veterans in need of health care \n     in Kentucky and Iowa in an effort to protect multinational \n     corporations and hedge fund managers.\n\n  On a preliminary point, in all the back and forth on this issue, I \nhave not criticized the majority leader by name. In the tensions that \ncome in Senate debate and the political environment, I think it is best \nto stick to that course. So I am disappointed that the majority leader \ndid not keep the discussion on that level.\n  With all due respect to him, he seems to have misread the letter, so \nI will set the record straight on a couple of important points.\n  First, a simple extension of expiring tax relief, including extension \nof the AMT patch, should not be offset with accompanying tax increases. \nThis does not mean we are opposed to offsetting the revenue loss from \nnew tax relief policy with spending reductions or revenue raised from \ntax proposals that are grounded in good tax policy.\n  Then my second point. The distinguished majority leader accused \nLeader McConnell and me of protecting hedge fund managers. This is \nsimply not the case, which I will demonstrate. In fact, the House \nextenders bill contains an offshore deferred compensation proposal.\n  This proposal that the Democrats actually support allows these same \nhedge fund managers a very generous tax break that is not available to \nthe average taxpayer. The House-passed hedge fund proposal allows these \nhedge fund managers to avoid paying taxes on their offshore deferred \ncompensation if they make a cash donation to a charity equal to 100 \npercent of the amount of the offshore deferred compensation. Meanwhile, \nthe average taxpayer is limited in how much they can deduct even for \ncontributions to charity. They can only deduct charitable contributions \nif those contributions do not exceed 50 percent of their adjusted gross \nincome. So if a teacher donated his or her entire salary to charity, he \nor she would only be able to claim about half of that as a deduction. \nBut a hedge fund manager who sheltered income in the Grand Caymans \nwould be allowed to claim a deduction for the entire amount of his or \nher sheltered income.\n\n  I want to make it clear, not only do I support the policy of changing \nthe tax treatment of offshore deferred compensation for hedge fund \nmanagers, but I would make sure that we corrected the giant loophole \nthat came over here from the House of Representatives benefiting hedge \nfund managers. We should make sure that if we are going to tax the \ndeferred income, we do not leave an escape hatch in the future.\n  With respect to the spending cut allegation, the majority leader's \ncomments again, with all due respect, implied that he has not read the \nRepublican leader's letter correctly. The Republican leader's offer to \nbreak the stalemate does not pit spending cuts for benefits for working \nfamilies, for seniors, for veterans against expired tax relief \nprovisions. The spending described in the letter is for unspecified and \nunwritten appropriations bills as far as 10 years in the future. The \ngeneral spending account identified represents the excess of new future \nspending levels over the current levels for nondefense discretionary \nspending plus inflation. None of the current-law levels of these \ncategories of spending would be cut. What is more, the Republican \nleader's offer would leave intact nearly all of the $350 billion in new \nextra spending. On its face, it is an extremely modest revision of this \nextra spending.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of the \nletter from the Republican leader and the majority leader's response.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n McConnell Proposes Compromise To Extend Tax Relief, Energy Incentives\n\n       Washington, DC.--U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch \n     McConnell sent the following letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi \n     and Majority Leader Harry Reid on Thursday calling on \n     Democrats to forge a compromise with Republicans to extend \n     expiring tax relief in a deficit-neutral manner, without \n     permanently raising taxes.\n                                                     July 3, 2008.\n       Dear Madam Speaker and Mr. Leader: This letter is in \n     response to a letter from the House Democratic Leadership, \n     dated June 12, 2008 and a letter from the Senate Leadership, \n     dated June 13, 2008. Both letters deal with the legislation, \n     H.R. 6049, which is designed to extend certain expiring tax \n     relief provisions and energy tax incentives.\n       We object to some of the assertions in both letters about \n     the position, record, and intentions of the Senate Republican \n     Conference regarding tax increase proposals and the \n     tax relief extensions. However, rather than respond to \n     overtly coordinated election-year letters in a partisan \n     fashion, we would like to focus on areas of bipartisan \n     agreement in order to break the impasse on these time-\n     sensitive tax matters.\n       The Senate Republican Conference places the highest \n     priority on fiscal responsibility. We believe that deficit \n     reduction should be considered with respect to all tax and \n     spending proposals. However, the first step toward mitigating \n     current adverse fiscal patterns is to do no more harm to the \n     fiscal situation.\n       New spending increases the deficit, whether it be the \n     expansion of discretionary spending or the expansions of \n     entitlement spending. New tax relief is scored as increasing \n     the deficit, even in instances where the resulting economic \n     growth raises far more revenue than is estimated to be \n     ``lost.'' Under Congressional budget accounting, however, the \n     extension of expiring tax relief looks like it increases the \n     deficit, while the extension of expiring entitlement spending \n     does not. This does not make sense.\n       Legislation to extend expiring tax relief, including an \n     extension of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) patch, and \n     legislation to extend expiring energy tax incentives all \n     enjoy overwhelming bipartisan support. Few would dispute the \n     merits of continuing these tax relief provisions. Indeed, \n     with these bipartisan tax relief provisions in place, \n     aggregate Federal tax collections have yielded revenue above \n     the post World War II average of 18.2 percent of gross \n     domestic product. Since these tax policies have yielded \n     revenue above the historic average, we see no reason to \n     condition their extension on new tax increases.\n       The conference report on the 2009 budget resolution \n     increases non-defense discretionary spending by $25 billion \n     above the President's request in 2009. When these amounts are \n     enacted, they will be perpetuated in the baseline and will \n     result in $350 billion in higher deficits over the next ten \n     years. The deficit effect of this new spending cannot be \n     ignored. It is surely as much of a fiscal burden as $350 \n     billion in tax policy extensions.\n       As a compromise, we suggest the following. The Senate \n     Republican Conference will agree to offset the revenue lost \n     from new tax relief policy with spending reductions or \n     revenue raised from appropriate tax policy proposals. In \n     exchange, the House and Senate Democratic Leadership would \n     revise the desired new non-defense discretionary spending in \n     the 2009 Congressional budget downward to a level sufficient \n     to offset the cost (relative to the Congressional Budget \n     Office baseline) of extending expiring tax relief. If agreed \n     to, extension of expiring tax relief, including extension of \n     the AMT patch and expiring energy tax incentives, could be \n     accomplished in a way that achieves your stated goal of being \n     deficit neutral, but without the unstated and unwarranted \n     result of increasing the size of the federal government.\n       The Senate Republican Conference is committed to, as the \n     letter from the House\n\n[[Page S6530]]\n\n     Democratic Leadership states, ``enacting legislation \n     extending tax relief to businesses and families in a fiscally \n     responsible manner.'' We look forward to working with our \n     friends in the House and Senate Democratic Leadership on this \n     time-sensitive legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate Republican Leader.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 2008.\n     The Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader McConnell: Thanks for your recent response to \n     the letter I sent you June 13 regarding extension of the \n     expiring tax provisions and energy tax incentives.\n       Let me begin by saying I strongly share your hope that the \n     Senate can work out a bipartisan solution to extend these \n     important tax incentives before the August recess. Such \n     action is as important as it is long overdue.\n       Although you have voted twice against just such a package, \n     I did note that your July 3rd response contains one \n     potentially positive thought that may make such a solution \n     more likely. As you know, under this Republican President and \n     a Republican-controlled Congress, the nation's debt and \n     deficits reached historic levels. Record budget surpluses \n     were transformed into record deficits and the nation's debt \n     grew by more than $3 trillion. Much of this was caused by the \n     fiscally irresponsible decision to cut taxes and increase \n     spending without corresponding offsets. Your July 3rd letter \n     appears to indicate you are now ready to set aside your \n     fiscally irresponsible ways when it comes to extenders and \n     adhere to pay-as-you-go budget rules Democrats enacted at the \n     beginning of the 110th Congress.\n       Unfortunately, rather than accept the noncontroversial \n     offsets contained in the bipartisan legislation passed by the \n     House and the substitute put together by Senator Baucus, your \n     letter indicates Senate Republicans believe we should instead \n     jeopardize important investments in our nation's health, \n     energy, and infrastructure sectors. Both the House-passed and \n     Baucus substitute bills rely on the same two offsets--one \n     ends the use by hedge fund managers of offshore accounts to \n     avoid paying taxes and the other merely extends an existing \n     delay in the implementation of interest allocation rules for \n     multinational corporations. Neither provision has generated \n     opposition from the affected industries and both are far \n     preferable to cuts in health care, energy, and infrastructure \n     programs that would harm Kentucky and many other states.\n       Despite your apparent decision to protect hedge fund \n     operators over critical national priorities, I remain \n     committed to taking up and passing bipartisan legislation to \n     extend important tax incentives before the August recess. The \n     fate of this legislation rests in your hands. I hope you and \n     those in your caucus who have blocked the Senate from passing \n     this legislation twice earlier this year will reconsider your \n     opposition and join Democrats to extend this much-needed tax \n     relief.\n       Sincerely.\n                                                       Harry Reid,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, to put the matter in some perspective, \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article \ncontaining a summary of an analysis by noted economist Kevin Hassett, a \nsenior fellow and director of economic policy at the American \nEnterprise Institute.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n [From American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, Feb. \n                               11, 2008]\n\n            How George Bush, Big Spender, Destroyed Nirvana\n\n                         (By Kevin A. Hassett)\n\n       If you could go back in time to President George W. Bush's \n     inaugural address and add one economic statement, what would \n     it be? For me, there is an obvious answer.\n       If Bush had promised in January 2001 that the baseline of \n     government spending that he inherited when he took office \n     would be the cap during his term, then we would have a big \n     budget surplus today. It would have been easy to do. He just \n     had to say: ``I will not spend one penny more than President \n     Bill Clinton planned to. I will veto any bill that tries \n     to.''\n       I have written before in this space that Bush has outspent \n     Clinton by a mile. With government spending still out of \n     control, the gap between where we are and where a disciplined \n     nation could have been is getting bigger and bigger.\n       With a recession looming, the policy implications of the \n     spending explosion are serious. If a deep recession occurs, \n     we will have less wiggle room.\n       To see how different the world could have been, I gathered \n     data from a number of sources and ran an alternative history. \n     In that wishful place, government spending was set equal to \n     the spending envisioned by the Congressional Budget Office in \n     the January 2001 long-run forecast, plus the spending for the \n     war in Iraq and to fight terrorism. This simulation assumes \n     that the war would have happened in spite of Bush's spending \n     promise, and wouldn't have induced him to seek cuts \n     elsewhere.\n       The difference between that spending path and the one we \n     are on is huge. Today, we expect federal spending in 2008 \n     will be $2.9 trillion. According to the alternative history, \n     spending would be $2.5 trillion.\n\n\n                            Surplus Fantasy\n\n       With spending at the lower level, we would have a surplus \n     of $152 billion if revenue were equal to what it is currently \n     projected to be.\n       Running the simulation forward, the gap between revenue \n     gets wider and wider. By 2017, we are scheduled to spend \n     almost $1 trillion more than we would have if we had stuck to \n     the Clinton baseline. With the low spending baseline we would \n     have a surplus in 2017 of $1.1 trillion, instead of the $151 \n     billion surplus that's currently forecast.\n       Think of it this way. If we now had the lower spending \n     levels that Bush inherited, we could extend his tax cuts, \n     repeal the alternative minimum tax, enact the current \n     stimulus package, and still have a 10-year budget surplus of \n     $1.9 trillion. And, remember, that allows spending to be \n     adjusted up for the Iraq war and the war against terrorists.\n       Many observers might say this scenario is unrealistic. The \n     2001 long-run forecast covered both discretionary and \n     mandatory spending. No administration, the argument might go, \n     could have held the line on the growth of Medicare and Social \n     Security spending.\n\n\n                             Hold the Line\n\n       There are two responses to that.\n       First, a president could always demand that spending be \n     capped and that discretionary spending be reduced to offset \n     unexpected increases in mandatory outlays. Social Security \n     might be the third rail of American politics, but it might \n     not be.\n       It has been changed before. Why couldn't it be changed \n     again? Families do that all the time. If Johnny needs braces, \n     then you take fewer trips to the restaurant.\n       The second response is perhaps more powerful. Let's see \n     what happens when we allow mandatory spending to go up as it \n     did. This lets Bush have his prescription-drug benefit, which \n     is now part of mandatory spending.\n       If we had held the line on everything else that is \n     discretionary, we could have had the prescription-drug plan, \n     the Iraq war and the war against terrorists. We could have \n     kept all the Bush tax cuts, made them permanent, repealed the \n     AMT and added the stimulus package and still ended up with a \n     balanced budget from 2008 to 2017.\n\n\n                             Bloated Uncle\n\n       It makes you sick to think about it. All that money wasted \n     on ethanol and bridges to nowhere has accumulated into a pile \n     that massive. Uncle Sam ate a whopping helping of apple pie \n     every day for seven years, and now he is obese.\n       This is important to bear in mind as we move forward to the \n     general election. We don't have a deficit because of Iraq, or \n     the tax cuts, or the drug benefit. We have a deficit because \n     the government grew fat. We can't fix that with tax \n     increases. Uncle Sam must go on a diet.\n       A simple way to start would be this: Whoever is elected \n     president this November should pledge that he or she won't \n     spend $1 more than we currently plan to. If Bush had done \n     that seven years ago, we would be in a different world.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. According to the analysis, if the last Clinton \nadministration budget were the baseline, Federal spending would be $400 \nbillion less than it is this fiscal year. Dr. Hassett's analysis \naccounts for spending increases for the global war on terror and \nrelated matters that were anticipated at the end of the Clinton \nadministration. The analysis shows that other Government spending is \ntrending $400 billion above where it otherwise would be.\n  In essence, the Republican leader's offered offset categories are \nfuture undefined spending budget room that did not materialize until \nthe conference report on the budget was adopted a few weeks ago. Keep \nin mind that this new undefined future spending sits on top of a \nbaseline that is, as Dr. Hassett's analysis shows, $400 billion higher \nthan the trendline from the Clinton administration.\n  If the majority leader does not engage us on this deficit-neutral \noffer, then he is putting taxpayers in his State at risk for the loss \nof several deductions they used on tax returns for last year. Included \nare the sales tax deduction, college tuition deduction, and teachers' \nclassroom expense deduction.\n  The latest IRS statistics of income data on the number of families \nand individuals claiming these benefits for the States of Nevada, \nKentucky, and Iowa will appear in the Record after my discussion.\n  The tradeoff is clear. Deal with these tax benefits which affect \ntaxpayers now. Offset them with undefined extra spending accounts for \nappropriations bills that will not be written until several years down \nthe road under the present budget. All that can be accomplished without \nadding a penny to the Federal deficit.\n\n[[Page S6531]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the IRS \nstatistics of income data to which I earlier referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n TABLE OF EXAMPLES OF NUMBERS OF TAX FILERS AFFECTED BY INACTION ON TAX\n                                EXTENDERS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           Nevada    Kentucky     Iowa\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSales Tax Deduction                        327,532     54,602     50,163\nCollege Tuition Deduction                   32,800     45,713     48,895\nTeachers Classroom Expense Deduction        22,789     39,735     35,238\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: IRS Statistics of Income (2004 tax year).\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask that I be allowed to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n    Sergeant First Class Anthony Lynn Woodham and Justin D. English\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, the acclaimed writer H.L. Mencken once \nsaid:\n\n       In war the heroes always outnumber the soldiers ten to one.\n\n  Today, I come to the floor to honor the lives of two of those heroes: \nSFC Anthony Lynn Woodham of Rogers, AR, and Justin English of \nSpringdale, AR. Madam President, we lost Specialist First Class Woodham \non Saturday when he paid the ultimate sacrifice while serving in Iraq \non his second tour as a member of the 39th Brigade Combat Team. As a \nvehicle maintenance supervisor at Camp Adder in Talil, he kept American \ntroops safe and their equipment and vehicles running. Throughout his 20 \nyears of National Guard service, he also trained countless mechanics, \ninstilling in them a strong work ethic, enthusiasm, and patriotism.\n\n  In 2004, Specialist First Class Woodham explained that a lot of \nsolutions for maintaining equipment are not found in the training \nmanual. He learned from trial and error and taught others the art of \nadapting and improvising in order to get the job done quickly and to \nget the job done right. For his leadership and his service, we are a \ntruly grateful nation.\n  MGEN William Wofford of the Arizona National Guard said of Woodham: \n``No words can fill the gap left by such a loss.'' I know those \nsentiments are also true for Specialist First Class Woodham's wife \nCrystal and three children, Patrick, 17, Mitchell, 11, and Courtney, 6.\n  Arkansas suffered another loss 11 miles away from Rogers, in \nSpringdale, AR. The English family is mourning the loss of 25-year-old \nJustin English. A former Springdale firefighter and EMT, he went to \nIraq for a larger mission--to protect United States personnel and \ninstallations in Iraq. A week into his mission--just a week into his \nmission--English's vehicle was struck by a roadside bomb near Baghdad \non Monday.\n  Those who knew Justin describe his friendliness, positive spirit, and \nwillingness to lend a helping hand. Janet English, his aunt, said he \nhad always wanted to join the military, find adventure, and serve his \ncountry. Indeed, he gave his country all.\n  Arkansas continues to make tremendous sacrifices to defend freedom \nand protect the ones we love. We will never forget the sacrifices made \nby the Woodham family, the English family, and so many other grieving \nfamilies who have lost their loved ones in combat. I urge my colleagues \nin the Senate to honor the service of these brave men and women and \nensure our troops have the resources they need both while in combat and \nwhen they return.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The first assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Air Force Tanker Decision\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 3 weeks ago, the Government \nAccountability Office issued a blistering decision about the Air \nForce's handling of one of the most important defense contracts in our \nhistory. The GAO found that in the competition between Boeing and the \nEuropean company Airbus to replace our military's aerial refueling \ntankers, the contest was unfairly skewed toward Airbus from the very \nbeginning. It said that but for the Air Force's prejudice, Boeing would \nhave had a substantial chance of winning.\n  The GAO was clear and emphatic that the Pentagon should reopen the \ncontract, get new proposals, and correct those errors. I rise today, \nbecause yesterday Defense Secretary Gates announced that he would \nfollow the GAO recommendations and rebid that contract. I am very \npleased that he says he is committed to a swift decision. But I have \nalso been a close observer of the Pentagon's decisionmaking process for \nmany years now, and I know the devil is always in the detail.\n  We do not know yet many of the details of this latest decision, and \nunfortunately I am already skeptical about whether the Pentagon is on \ntrack to get this right. The Defense Department has a high hurdle to \nclear in order to ensure this competition is fair and is transparent.\n  As I said earlier, the GAO raised serious questions about the Air \nForce's previous decision, and it described the competition as \nunreasonable, improper, and misleading. The GAO found that the Air \nForce changed direction midstream about what criteria were more \nimportant. It didn't give Boeing credit for providing a more capable \nplane, according to the Air Force's description of what it wanted, yet \nit gave Airbus extra credit for offering amenities it didn't ask for. \nIt said the Air Force deliberately and unreasonably increased Boeing's \nestimated costs. And when that mistake was corrected, it was discovered \nthat the Airbus tanker actually costs tens of millions of dollars more \nthan Boeing's.\n  The GAO said the Air Force accepted Airbus's proposal even though \nAirbus couldn't meet two key contract requirements. First, Airbus \nrefused to commit to providing long-term maintenance, as specified in \nthe RFP, even after the Air Force asked for it repeatedly. Second, the \nAir Force could not prove that Airbus could refuel all of the \nmilitary's aircraft according to procedure.\n  Those are very serious findings. It is still unclear whether the \nerrors were due to incompetence or impropriety, but the result was that \nthe military chose a plane that didn't meet the fundamental \nrequirements that were set out in their own RFP. That cannot happen \nagain. The Defense Department must do everything it can do to ensure \nthat this competition is fair and transparent.\n  That means the Pentagon must go back to the original request for \nproposals. It must ensure that both of the companies get the same \ninformation throughout the entire competition. It must prove the tanker \nit selects can actually perform all of the missions that are required \nby the military. It must do a full accounting of all of the life cycle \ncosts of flying and operating both planes. And it has to ensure that \nthe companies can only earn credit as it was spelled out in the \noriginal RFP.\n  That last point is extremely important. In its decision last month, \nthe GAO said the request for proposals was crystal clear about what \nkind of tanker the Air Force needed. Yet I have already heard that the \nDefense Department plans to reevaluate the life cycle costs of both \ntankers using a 25-year lifespan instead of a more accurate 40 years. \nIt wants to revise the RFP to give greater benefit to a larger plane, \neven if that means the tanker it buys is not capable of meeting its own \nmission. That fundamentally changes the rules of the procurement and is \nnot what is in the original RFP.\n  I am very concerned about both of these proposals. Changing the rules \nof the game when we are in overtime is simply going to result in a \nrepeat of the last contest--an unfair result, more protests, and more \ndelays. I look forward to hearing a thorough explanation from the \nDefense Department about how it is going to carry out this new \ncompetition and how it is going to ensure that this contract is finally \nfair.\n  Finally, I agree with Secretary Gates that it is vitally important \nthat we move quickly to finish this contract. Air men and women who fly \nout of Fairchild Air Force Base, in my home State of Washington, fly \nthese tankers.\n\n[[Page S6532]]\n\nI know they need these planes. They need them now. But we also have to \ndo this the right way. We have to have a competition that is not \novershadowed by questions of ethics or competence. If we don't, we risk \nanother challenge that is going to draw out this procurement process \neven further.\n  Even more importantly, we have got to get the right plane. Our aerial \nrefueling tankers--the ones we are talking about with this contract--\nare the backbone of our global military strength. They are stationed \ntoday across the world, and they refuel aircraft from every branch of \nour Armed Forces. Before our taxpayers spend $35 billion, they deserve \nto know the planes we are buying can actually refuel our military's \naircraft. Our service members deserve to know they are getting a plane \nthat will enable them to do their jobs and return home swiftly.\n  I welcome Secretary Gates' announcement yesterday that this contract \nis going to be rebid, but I remind all of my colleagues--those of us \nwho have watched this procurement process for many years now--to follow \nthe bouncing ball and see where it leads. We are going to follow this \ncarefully. It needs to be rebid with the original RFP, not changed in \novertime, to make sure this is a fair contract that results quickly in \nmaking sure our air men and women get the right aircraft as quickly as \nwe can possibly bring it to them.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The first assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Shutdown of DHL\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I share with my colleagues some bad news from my State \nthat I hope turns into better news; that is, there is a company in Ohio \ncalled DHL. It is an airfreight company. They are the second-largest, \nsingle-site private employer in Ohio next to the Honda Corporation in \nMarysville and other nearby places.\n  DHL is in Wilmington, Clinton County, southwest Ohio, where some \n8,000 people work pretty much in one facility in Clinton County. \nWilmington is the county seat of Clinton County. Wilmington is the home \nof Wilmington College, a Quaker school, a wonderful private 4-year \ninstitution in southwest Ohio.\n  Wilmington has only 13,000 people living there. This company, DHL, \nemploys close to 8,000, through a couple subsidiaries, a couple people \nthey contract with there, ABX and ASTAR. The announcement to close by \nthe owner of DHL, a German company called \nDeutsche Post, which I believe is the largest freight company in the \nworld and which used to be the German Post Office but now is a \nprivatized company, will have a devastating effect on this region and \nthese people.\n  Deutsche Post owns many facilities of all kinds around the world; one \nof them is DHL. They made a decision to shut DHL down in Wilmington, a \nloss of up to some 8,000 jobs. I was in Wilmington last week, conducted \na roundtable, listened to the concerns of pilots and material handlers \nand clerks and computer operators and mechanics and engineers and all \nkinds of people who fly the planes and service the planes and move the \nbaggage, often in the middle of the night. There are local farmers who \nwork there part time who get health care, there are very skilled \npilots, there are very skilled machinists and mechanics.\n  DHL is everything to a community of 13,000. Those 7,000 to 8,000 \nemployees live all over southwest Ohio, obviously not all of them in \nWilmington or in Clinton County. Many of them live in Hillsboro, \nHighland County; some live in Brown County and Adams County and \nHamilton County and Montgomery County and Clark County and Green \nCounty, all over southwestern Ohio.\n  We are not just accepting this tragedy as is. The mayor, Mayor Raizk, \nGovernor Strickland, Lieutenant Governor Fischer, the development \ndirector, Senator Voinovich, Congressman Turner and I and others are \nbanding together to fight this perhaps as an antitrust violation, \nperhaps in some other ways that we are working to try to stop this from \nhappening.\n  The contract has not yet been signed. We are hopeful that DHL, \nthat Deutsche Post, this German company will, in fact, listen to us and \nlisten to proposals from ABX and ASTAR to stop the bleeding, if you \nwill, to keep these jobs here. They have been productive. They took \nover a company called Airborne Express 4 years ago. The State of Ohio \nand Governor Taft in those days put together a $400 million package for \nthem. We thought it was the start of a long friendship, a long \nrelationship between Deutsche Post and DHL and the community of \nWilmington, the County of Clinton, and the State of Ohio. We have been \ndisabused of that notion, at least temporarily. We hope something \nbetter comes of it.\n  What I wish to share today is the background. I wish to share for 4 \nor 5 minutes some e-mails I received. I asked people in Clinton County, \nin Brown, Adams, Highland, Montgomery, Clark and Green Counties to \nshare with me on my Web site what this closing might mean to them and \nwhat this company means to them and to their prosperity and their \nmiddle-class lifestyle and all that.\n  I told them I would read some of these on the Senate floor. Last week \nwhen I had a roundtable discussion with about 20 people, we talked \nabout many of these issues. I wish to share with you today some of \nthese, three or four of these entries, if you will, from statements \nwritten by people who are affected directly.\n  I am not going to share the name. I think I probably could, I think \nthey gave us permission, but I will share their hometown. This \ngentleman from Wilmington wrote:\n\n       I am in my 15th year as a pilot with DHL/ASTAR. I was hired \n     by DHL Airways in January 1994 after serving as a C-5 pilot \n     in the United States Air Force. DHL later became ASTAR Air \n     Cargo due to U.S. Airline ownership laws. The airline pilot's \n     career is based on seniority; there are no lateral moves to \n     another airline. Losing my job with ASTAR due to Deutsche \n     Post's forcing DHL to use UPS [that is what actually happened \n     here] will result in the loss of not only my job but the loss \n     of my career. I do not have enough years left, due to \n     mandatory pilot retirement age at 65, to restart a commercial \n     pilot career with another airline and regain the salary I \n     earn now. I also own property in Wilmington based on working \n     for ASTAR Air Cargo. As these jobs go away my property \n     approaches being worthless and makes it likely I will have to \n     turn it back to the bank. The DHL deal will destroy many \n     careers, families, and create a duopoly in the U.S. Express \n     shipping industry, driving down competition, driving up costs \n     for business and for consumers.\n  A lady from New Vienna writes:\n\n       I know you are well aware of what is going on in Wilmington \n     with ABX/DHL. But you probably do not have any idea what it \n     is already doing to all of our workers. Our morale is at an \n     all-time low. We already know our time is short, but DHL is \n     cutting the rope shorter and shorter. I really do not know \n     how much more some of the people can take. I have heard of \n     many problems in marriages already. I know of many husband \n     and wives who work out there, my husband and I included.\n       The majority of us on days are full-time employees and are \n     scheduled to work 8-hour days. As of today, DHL has dictated \n     that whenever our work is finished we are to leave whether we \n     worked 6 hours, 7 hours or 8 hours.\n       My husband and I were planning on taking whatever we could \n     out of our last paychecks and put away because of what awaits \n     us. Now we are not even allowed to stay and get our 8 hours \n     so we only get paid for time worked.\n\n  Generally, at these roundtables I heard this discussion over and \nover. We are not giving up. We are still trying to save these jobs. \nPeople who work at ASTAR, who work at ABX, who are part of DHL, \nobviously have real fears.\n  Another lady from New Vienna writes:\n\n       My husband is one of the many employees being laid off by \n     ABX after putting in 26 years with them. I cannot begin to \n     tell how much this is going to hurt us in many, many ways, \n     along with 6,000 plus other employees here.\n\n  When I said up to 7,000, I was including, you know, some of the \nancillary supply jobs in the vicinity.\n\n       The reason I am e-mailing you is to see if there is any way \n     you or any government employee can help all of the employees \n     and their families that are being let go. With the economy \n     the way it is, it is hard enough trying to keep food on your \n     table let alone trying to do without a job. Please, Senator\n\n[[Page S6533]]\n\n     Brown, fight for all of us at ABX, ASTAR and DHL. We need all \n     of you in our government to fight hard for us and Ohio.\n\n  Someone from Blanchester, just south of Wilmington, said:\n\n       I am a 19-year pilot for Astar Air Cargo; a 16-year member \n     of the pilot's union. My wife and I became residents of Ohio \n     when DHL consolidated their main sort facility in Wilmington, \n     OH.\n       At first we did not want to move, but as a loyal employee I \n     wanted to live close to my employer. So my wife and I built a \n     home in Brown County near town, and I looked forward to \n     finishing my career there. We, unlike DHL, made a long-term \n     commitment to the local area. I am realistic that I realize \n     the last flight of ASTAR is on the horizon. I know in today's \n     business environment there is usually little chance of \n     stopping large corporations from following through with their \n     announced plans. My wish is that you use any influence you \n     might have with the Department of Justice or other agencies \n     that will have to approve DHL's planned partnership with UPS \n     to compel DHL to abide by their commitment to the pilots of \n     ASTAR, the commitment to job security, growth and a long \n     career they promised in the latest collective bargaining \n     agreement.\n\n  DHL and their owner, the Deutsche Post, needs to be held accountable \nfor commitments they made to the people, the workers, and the \ncommunities of southwest Ohio.\n  The last note I will share is from someone in Midland.\n\n       I am writing today to ask you to all consider the \n     devastating effect that the loss of these thousands of jobs \n     will do to our families, counties, and State, if DHL does, in \n     fact, pull out of Wilmington, OH. Everyone I know has a \n     family member or friend who works in that facility. I have \n     two daughters who work there as well. They are single \n     parents, and the fear of loss of income, home, and car is in \n     their every thought at this time. I cannot imagine how \n     terrible this will be for them, and they have family to fall \n     back on. What will happen to others who do not have that \n     support system in place?\n       We are all fighting to keep this place open. It matters to \n     our economy, it matters to our State, it matters individually \n     to so many people.\n\n  Those were four or five of them. In the communities, you know what \nhappens when people lose their jobs, and there are so many of them, \nespecially in a small town. You know what it means to the school \nsystem, what it means to police protection, fire protection, all that \npeople in our middle-class society and workers rely on. That is why I \nshare these stories. I will share these with the White House, I will \nshare those same stories with Deutsche Post. We want them to come to \nthe table and talk to us about a different contract that can keep those \nworkers there. It will matter for Wilmington, it will matter for \nsouthwest Ohio, it will matter for our country.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6533-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6533-S6535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATIONS OF GENERAL DAVID H. PETRAEUS AND LIEUTENANT GENERAL RAYMOND \n                        T. ODIERNO TO BE GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session and continue consideration of the \nfollowing nomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Gen. David H. Petraeus, \nDepartment of the Army, to be general.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will vote no on the nomination of GEN \nDavid H. Petraeus, the current commander of the Multi-National Force--\nIraq, to be Commander, U.S. Central Command. I was unable to attend \nGeneral Petraeus' nomination hearing before the Armed Services \nCommittee because I was managing the supplemental appropriations bill \non the Senate floor, but I reviewed his testimony. I also posed a \nnumber of questions to General Petraeus after the hearing, and studied \nhis responses.\n  I appreciate General Petraeus' evident intelligence and his expertise \nand experience in Iraq. He wrote the book on countering insurgencies \nfor the Army. He led the 101st Airborne Division during the V Corps \ndrive to Baghdad in 2003. He established the Multi-National Security \nTransition Command Iraq in 2004. He has served as Commander of the \nMulti-National Force--Iraq since January 2007. He is the architect of \nthe so-called surge strategy that is even now being played out in Iraq.\n  The surge strategy is, in fact, one of the reasons why I believe \nGeneral Petraeus should remain in his current position as Commander of \nthe Multi-National Force--Iraq. Marshal Ferdinand Foch, Supreme \nCommander of the Allied Armies at the conclusion of World War I, \nobserved in his 1920 book, ``Precepts and Judgments'', that ``Great \nresults in war are due to the commander. History is therefore right in \nmaking generals responsible for victories--in which case they are \nglorified; and for defeats--in which case they are disgraced.'' The \nbook is still out on the success or failure of the surge strategy. \nGeneral Petraeus should bring it to its conclusion before he is \nrewarded with a promotion.\n  Continuity of command has been a problem in Iraq. Historically, when \nthe United States has been involved in protracted conflicts, continuity \nof command has been maintained, be it Generals Eisenhower or MacArthur \nduring World War II, or General Westmoreland during the Vietnam \nconflict. General Petraeus has only been in his current position for 18 \nmonths. Since President Bush believes that General Petraeus has done \nwell in his current position, but he, Secretary Gates and General \nPetraeus have all described the security situation in Iraq as tenuous \nand reversible, it does not seem prudent to remove the mastermind \nbehind the fragile successes that have been thus far achieved.\n  Almost 1 year ago, on July 14, 2007, President Bush said in a radio \naddress that, ``When America starts drawing down our forces in Iraq, it \nwill be because our military commanders say the conditions on the \nground are right--not because pollsters say it would be good \npolitics.'' That strategy does not work well, however, when you keep \nchanging commanders. No new commander is going to come in and say \n`reduce the troop levels on my watch,' because if, through their lack \nof familiarity with the conditions on the ground, they are wrong, that \ndefeat would be their disgrace, just as Marshal Foch observed in 1920. \nSo, a year after President Bush's statement, troop levels in Iraq are \nonly just returning to something close to the pre-surge levels of \nJanuary 2007, when General Petraeus assumed command in Iraq. If, as \nGeneral Petraeus has said, no further decisions on additional drawdowns \nwill be made until sometime in the fall of 2008, a new commander will \nbe called upon to make that decision.\n  I am also concerned about General Petraeus' unwillingness to address \nquestions regarding other regional issues, such as in Afghanistan or \nIran, during his nomination hearing. Such evasiveness is not politic; \nit is troubling at a time when news reports suggest that the Taliban is \nresurgent in Afghanistan and that President Bush may be contemplating \nmilitary action against Iran. Despite the press of his responsibilities \nin Iraq, General Petraeus must be concerned with how other operations \nor other political considerations in the same theater affect his \noptions in Iraq. Equally, he must consider how political changes in his \nchain of command might affect his operations in Iraq, yet he will not \nadmit even the existence of contingency plans for potential troop \ndrawdowns that might be required by a new administration. If the \ncompeting priorities for manpower and materiel are to be sorted out at \nthe CENTCOM level, it must be done with a clear understanding of what \nis possible and what is achievable, by someone willing to take a stand \nin support of all the men and women who will be called upon to carry \nout those priorities, not by someone who only salutes and carries out \norders or by someone who knows only a fraction of the full situation. \nGeneral Petraeus' career will be judged in large part by his role in \nthe Iraq conflict; his reticence to address other regional issues \nraises questions about his willingness to devote the focus and the \nresources needed to address them properly.\n  Finally, the repeated rotations of U.S. soldiers to Iraq and \nAfghanistan\n\n[[Page S6534]]\n\nare taking a toll on our military. Elements of the 4th Infantry \nDivision, 1st Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division, and the 172nd \nInfantry Brigade are facing a third tour in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nElements of the 82nd Airborne Division are facing a fourth tour. With \nthese repeated tours and the continuation of the ``stop loss'' policy \nof forcibly retaining troops on active duty in order to maintain unit \nintegrity necessitated by the strain this war is placing on our forces, \nit is difficult to understand why these troops should not be entitled \nto a continuity of command. The troops appreciate the effectiveness of \nworking together as a unit when confronting danger on a regular basis. \nThey deserve a leadership corps that, like them, functions together as \na unit and stay together.\n  More than 12,000 servicemembers are currently affected by ``stop \nloss'' orders that prohibit them from retiring or leaving the service \neven though they are eligible for retirement or their terms of \nenlistment have expired. That total includes 6,800 active-duty Army \npersonnel, about 3,800 Army National Guard personnel and almost 1,500 \nArmy Reservists who are not allowed to leave military service despite \nhaving fulfilled their service obligations.\n  LTG James Thurman, the Army's deputy chief of staff for operations, \nhas said that he hoped, but could not promise, that if the demand for \ntroops stabilized at around 15 combat brigades, the use of the ``stop \nloss'' could be ended by the end of fiscal year 2009, or the beginning \nof fiscal year 2010--in September or October of 2009, more than a year \nfrom now. ``But demand exceeds supply right now,'' he stated. For the \n12,000 affected servicemembers, and those who will become eligible to \nretire or leave service between now and late 2009, this amounts to \nanother 18 months of forced conscription. Until the practice of ``stop \nloss'' is ended, perhaps General Petraeus and other military leaders \nshould remain in their current assignments until the U.S. can \ntransition the responsibility for the security of Iraq to Iraqis.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I thank all the Members of the Senate. We \njust had two historic votes. The men and women in the Armed Forces, \nparticularly those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, will be greatly \nheartened to hear that the Senate has given the strongest possible \nadvice and consent, each Member coming to the floor and casting their \nvote. I think it is a landmark situation and one which is respected and \nappreciated across our uniformed services and the many civilians who \nserve with them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is generally my policy to defer to \nPresidents on executive branch nominations. Accordingly, I voted to \nconfirm the nominations of General Petraeus and Lieutenant General \nOdierno. However, I am concerned that General Petraeus has not always \nbeen forthright in his congressional testimony about matters such as \nthe limitations of the Iraqi Security Forces and Iran's influence over \nthe Iraqi government. I am also concerned that General Petraeus, as \nCENTCOM Commander, would continue to prioritize deployments to Iraq \nover Afghanistan, despite al-Qaida's safe haven along the Afghanistan \nborder in Pakistan and its support for a resurgent Taliban. I look \nforward to a new administration that recognizes that the Iraq war is a \ndistraction from our top national security priority--the global fight \nagainst al-Qaida and its affiliates.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, the Senate considered nominations \nfor two very important positions that will affect how our country moves \nforward in Iraq and the Middle East. While I highly respect the service \nthat these men have provided to their country, I do not believe that \neither General Petraeus or Lieutenant General Odierno will take the \nUnited States in the direction that we need, particularly in Iraq where \nwe need a timetable for redeployment of United States forces so that \nour country can begin to more effectively address the very real\n\n[[Page S6535]]\n\nthreat posed by terrorists in other areas, such as Afghanistan, as well \nas around the globe.\n  I believe that General Petraeus has been an unapologetic supporter of \nthis misguided war in Iraq, continually toeing the administration's \nparty line and failing to acknowledge many of the grave failings that \nhave occurred. The military alone will not be able to stabilize Iraq, \nwe must understand the political and diplomatic situation at hand, and \nI do not believe that under General Petraeus' leadership, the necessary \nreconciliation to allow the Iraqi Government to take control has \noccurred. General Petraeus has shown no willingness to take us in this \nnew direction, and it is for this reason that cannot support his \nnomination.\n  With respect to Lieutenant General Odierno, I believe that his past \ncommand of the 4th Infantry Division demonstrated what I consider to be \nserious flaws in judgment. General Odierno refused to characterize the \ninsurgency that began after the fall of the Saddam Hussein regime as \nanything that was serious and worthy of U.S. strategy shift. As we \nknow, the failure to correctly assess the nature of the insurgency \nhelped fuel years of violence in Iraq.\n  We are long overdue for a new course in Iraq. The tragically \noverwhelming costs of this war in both lives and resources have \ndistracted us from the initial task of fighting al-Qaida. It is time \nthat we have leaders who will be able to independently assess our \nmilitary mission in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Middle East rather than \nunquestionably support the failed policies of this administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6535-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to take a moment to speak about \none of the most important issues facing our country right now, and that \nis the energy crisis, in terms of the high cost of energy and the fact \nthat people will be suffering very significantly this coming winter--in \nfact, this summer--if we do not address it.\n  In that regard, on June 24, I introduced S. 3186, the Warm in Winter \nand Cool in Summer Act, to provide immediate relief to millions of \nsenior citizens, families with children, and the disabled, who are \nstruggling to pay their home energy bills. Specifically, this bill \nwould nearly double the funding for the highly successful Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, commonly called LIHEAP, in fiscal year \n2008, taking LIHEAP from $2.57 billion to $5.1 billion, a total \nincrease of over $2.5 billion.\n  I thank Majority Leader Reid for completing the rule XIV process for \nthis important piece of legislation and placing it directly on the \nSenate calendar. My understanding is that we will have this bill on the \nfloor before we recess for the August vacation. It is important we do \nthat, and I thank Senator Harry Reid very much for allowing us to move \nforward in that direction.\n  I also thank the 26 Senators who are cosponsors of this tripartisan \nlegislation. This bill absolutely is a tripartisan piece of \nlegislation. At this point, we have 18 Democrats on board, we have 8 \nRepublicans on board, and I expect more will be coming on in the coming \ndays and weeks. I thank Senators Obama, Coleman, Leahy, Smith, Durbin, \nSnowe, Murray, Sununu, Landrieu, Collins, Murkowski, Clinton, Lugar, \nCantwell, Gregg, Kerry, Cardin, Kennedy, Schumer, Brown, Klobuchar, \nMenendez, Casey, Bingaman, Stabenow, and Lautenberg for their support.\n  This legislation not only has strong bipartisan support here in the \nSenate, it is also moving in the House, and it also has been endorsed \nby numerous groups all across this country, including the AARP, the \nNational Grange, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the \nNational Community Action Foundation, the National Association of State \nEnergy Officials, the Alliance For Rural America, the Northeast Public \nPower Association, the National Consumer Law Center on behalf of its \nlow-income clients, the Edison Electric Institute, the National Fuel \nFunds Network, and the Petroleum Marketers Association of America.\n  I think we are going to show more and more support in coming weeks, \nbut there is a widespread understanding that we are facing a crisis in \nthis country and that the President and the Congress have to act.\n  Let me read a support letter I received from the AARP, the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons. As you know, the AARP represents over \n39 million Americans, and this is what the AARP said.\n\n       AARP fully supports the Warm in Winter and Cool in Summer \n     Act. This legislation will provide needed relief for many \n     older persons who may not receive assistance--despite their \n     eligibility--due to a lack of funding. Older Americans who \n     are more susceptible to hypothermia and heat stroke know the \n     importance of heating and cooling their homes. They often \n     skimp on other necessities to pay their utility bills. \n     However, today's escalating energy prices and the Nation's \n     unpredictable and extreme temperatures are adding to the \n     growing economic hardships faced by seniors. LIHEAP is \n     underfunded and unable to meet the energy assistance needs of \n     the program's eligible households.\n\n  I thank the AARP very much for their strong support of this \nlegislation.\n  Let me also quote from a very recent New York Times editorial. This \nis what the New York Times said the other day.\n\n       A bill just introduced in the Senate would provide about \n     $2.5 billion under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \n     Program. Half would be released to the States to help low-\n     income residents pay their energy bills and half would sit in \n     a contingency fund that could be tapped at the discretion of \n     the President. When the bill comes up for a vote, likely \n     later this month, Congress should approve it and President \n     Bush should sign it into law. As the economy slows and oil \n     prices rise, helping Americans who cannot afford to heat \n     their homes is a matter of public health and safety as well \n     as a moral imperative. People without adequate heat are \n     vulnerable to illness, and people struggling to pay the \n     heating bills may be tempted to skimp on medicines and even \n     food. No one should have to choose between heating and \n     eating. If they act this summer, as they must, before the \n     Presidential and congressional campaigns send everyone home, \n     Congress and President Bush can help make sure that nobody \n     has to make that choice.\n\n  That is from the New York Times, and I appreciate the support of the \nNew York Times on this issue.\n  Make no mistake about it, we have an energy emergency in Vermont and \nall across this country, and it is about time the President and the \nCongress treated this as the emergency it is. As many of my colleagues \nunderstand, the price of heating oil skyrocketed last winter, making it \nextremely difficult for some of my constituents and people all across \nthis country to stay alive, especially when the temperature dropped \nwell below zero. Next winter will even be worse.\n  At this time last year, heating oil prices were about $2.50 a gallon. \nToday, they are about $4.50 a gallon. Fuel dealers in Vermont are \ntelling me that if this trend continues, heating oil prices could \nsurpass $5 a gallon by December. I must tell you, Madam President, that \nall across my State people are very worried about how they will in fact \nbe able to adequately heat their homes next winter.\n\n[[Page S6536]]\n\n  Meanwhile, LIHEAP funding is 23 percent less than it was 2 years ago, \ncompletely eviscerating the purchasing power of this extremely \nimportant program. In fact, after adjusting for inflation, the Federal \nGovernment spent more money on LIHEAP 20 years ago than it is spending \ntoday. So we have a real crisis we have got to address.\n  It is not an exaggeration to say this is a life-and-death situation. \nPeople use that phrase often, but in this sense we are describing the \nreality facing a number of people. According to the Centers for Disease \nControl, over 1,000 Americans all across this country died from \nhypothermia in their own homes from 1992 to 2002, the latest figures we \nhave available. Over 1,000 Americans died from hypothermia. In other \nwords, they froze to death in the United States because they were \nunable to afford to heat their homes. How many of these deaths were \npreventable? Well, the answer is, all of them, according to the CDC.\n  We will probably not know for several years how many Americans died \nlast winter because they could not afford to heat their homes, but \nclearly one death is too many. And everything being equal, if we do not \nact, I think we can reasonably expect the number of people dying of \nhypothermia in this country will only go up. If heating oil even \napproaches $5 a gallon by next winter, we will have a public health \nemergency throughout the northern tier of this country, and this is \nsomething we have to address.\n  I wish also to point out that, although I come from a cold weather \nState--and I hope and expect all of my colleagues understand this--\nLIHEAP does not only help constituents in the northern part of our \ncountry stay warm in the winter, it also helps people in the South and \nthe West stay cool in the summer. Right now, many people in the \nsouthern and western States are suffering with temperatures frequently \nsoaring past 100 degrees while their electricity prices are rapidly \nincreasing.\n  I was in Nevada last week, and the temperature there was something \nlike 110 to 115 degrees. That is hot. I cannot imagine a frail or \nelderly person, somebody who is ill, trying to survive in that kind of \nweather. Those people are going to need help today as much as people in \nthe North will need help when the winter comes.\n  Recently, USA Today ran a headline on its front page and it said:\n\n       Price jolt: Electricity bills going up, up, up.\n\n  That was a headline, front-page story. According to this story:\n\n       Utilities across the USA are raising power prices up to 29 \n     percent, mostly to pay for soaring fuel cost. . . . The \n     spikes come after rising fuel prices already have driven up \n     utility bills nearly 30 percent the past 5 years, the \n     sharpest jump since the 1970s energy crisis.\n\n  Let me give an example of why LIHEAP funding is vital, right now, for \nthese hot-weather States. Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Kentucky, \nMississippi, and Florida have either exhausted all their LIHEAP funding \nor are on the verge of running out of funds. In other words, they will \nhave absolutely no support from the Federal Government to help millions \nof senior citizens on fixed incomes, low-income families with kids or \nthe disabled stay cool this winter. They are running out of funds right \nnow.\n  As I have indicated, with the price of electricity going up and up, \nwith the economy in the tank, people are having a harder and harder \ntime paying their electric bills, air-conditioners are run on \nelectricity, and if you don't have your electricity, you don't have \nyour air-conditioner, and if you are old and you are frail and you are \nsick, you are in a lot of trouble.\n  From 1999 to 2003, over 3,400 deaths in this country were due to \nexcessive heat. All these deaths were preventable, and air-conditioning \nis the best way to prevent these deaths from occurring, according to \nthe Centers for Disease Control. In fact, more people in the United \nStates--and this is an interesting fact that I think many people are \nnot aware of--more people in the United States have died from the \nextreme heat than from floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes combined, \nsince 1998.\n  CNN may not be in a senior citizen's bedroom when she expires because \nof heat exhaustion. They are there with the floods and hurricanes and \ncyclones and tornadoes--we understand that. But we need to reiterate \nthat more people in the United States have died from the extreme heat \nthan from floods, tornadoes, and hurricanes combined.\n  Meanwhile, the Federal Government spends less money preventing these \ndeaths from occurring than any other natural disaster we face, \naccording to the CDC.\n  My point is, hurricanes and floods certainly are emergencies. I have \nalways supported efforts to address these emergencies. I want my \ncolleagues to know that when the weather gets 20 below in Vermont and \nMaine and New Hampshire, that is an emergency. When the weather gets to \n110 degrees in California or Nevada, that is also an emergency. We have \nto act.\n  My legislation will begin to move us in the right direction. If this \nlegislation becomes law, as I certainly hope it will be, the State of \nArizona would receive over $24 million, the State of Kentucky would \nreceive over $34 million, the State of Georgia would receive over $70 \nmillion, and the State of Florida would receive over $80 million to \nkeep their residents cool this summer.\n  The point I am making is, I don't want anybody to think that because \nI represent Vermont and we are from the Northeast, that this is simply \na cold-weather issue. It is not. It is an issue for every region of \nthis country.\n  In addition to all that I have said, it is important to understand \nthat tens of thousands of Americans have had their utility and natural \ngas service shut off this year, and millions more are in danger of \nhaving these services cut off because they are at least 1 month late in \npaying their bills. There is a lot of attention, obviously, on housing \nforeclosures that we have been focusing on. But let us not forget that \nas people lose their jobs, as people's wages decline, as utility bills \ngo up, we are looking at utility cutoffs in a very dramatic way.\n  Increasing LIHEAP funding will allow these Americans to turn their \nelectricity and other essential utility services back on right now so \nthey can cool their homes this summer and heat their homes next winter. \nAccording to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association, a \nrecord 15 million American families, or nearly 15 percent of all \nhouseholds, are at least 30 days overdue in paying their utility bills.\n  Let me conclude by thanking the 26 cosponsors, including 8 \nRepublicans, who are onboard this legislation. Let me thank AARP and \nthe many national organizations that are supporting this. Let me thank \nSenator Reid for completing the rule XIV process.\n  I hope very much that in a week or two, certainly before we break for \nthe August recess, we will be voting on this legislation. I hope we win \nit by a very large majority.\n  I thank Majority Leader Reid and all my colleagues who are supporting \nthis legislation and look forward to, in the very short term, \nreassuring people throughout this country that we are mindful of the \nimpact high energy costs are having on their lives, and we are here to \ndo something about it.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask the question, are we in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in morning business.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for a few minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We are all aware of the impact rising energy costs have \nhad on Americans and our economy. Every home and business in America \nhas seen energy costs skyrocket. That is true with the price of home \nheating oil, electricity generated from natural gas or the gasoline and \ndiesel for our cars and trucks, and probably a lot of\n\n[[Page S6537]]\n\nother energy uses and sources of energy you could throw in there as \nwell. These costs permeate through our economy by driving up costs for \nthe transportation and production of food, to the manufacturing and \nindustrial sectors of our economy. Obviously, those hurt most are the \nfamilies who feel it in their pocketbooks when they pay their utility \nbills, fill their cars or trucks to get to work or take their kids to \nschool, or even buy groceries. They do not have the ability to pass it \non, as do people in the middle of the chain.\n  A key component of a strong and vibrant economy is reliable and \naffordable energy. For businesses to grow, for productivity to \nincrease, we need more energy. And in the process of more energy, I \nmean more sources of energy, but I do not preclude any way we can save \nenergy, and an ethic to save energy as well.\n  It is a fact of life that each American generation has lived better \nthan the predecessor generation, and my generation and the next \ngeneration and the next generation expects to live a little better than \nthe previous generation. That is the American dream; that is the \nAmerican way. It is not going to happen if we do not have affordable \nenergy. To have affordable energy, it is as simple as economics 101: \nwhen the price is high, with an increased supply, the price will go \ndown.\n  So all of this means that we need to use energy not only more but \nmore efficiently. It also means you cannot rely just on fossil fuels. \nGod only made so much of that. We need to develop alternative and \nrenewable sources of energy. But renewable energy and energy efficiency \nare only a part of the solution. I guess I would say that when you talk \nabout energy, you talk about three: No. 1, more sources of present \nfossil fuels; No. 2, alternative energy--and for a guy like me from \ncorn country, I am not talking only about ethanol, but biodiesel, \nbiomass, wind. I happened to sponsor, 15 years ago, the wind energy tax \ncredit that now exists and which has brought vibrant wind energy to a \nlot of the Midwest. And also, lastly, conservation. I am talking about \nnot only a Government policy on conservation which we have in place in \nthe sense of a tax incentive for fuel-efficient cars and also tax \nincentives for energy-efficient home appliances, to name two, but there \nis a personal ethic of more conservation that we are seeing in America \nright now. The latest figures I know of are March 2008 versus March \n2007. Because of the increased price of gasoline, we drove 5 percent \nless miles this March than a year ago, and that is the largest decrease \nor greatest decrease in energy use since energy was this high on an \ninflationary basis back in 1979.\n  So Americans are conserving price, they are conserving when they buy \nthese fuel cell cars where you get the tax credit. But it cannot only \nbe conservation. And too often I hear in this body: Do not drill; \nconserve.\n  You have to do drilling and you have to do conserving. But you also \nhave to have that third factor, which is very popular with a person \nlike me, alternative energy, because alternative energy, in the case of \nethanol as an example, is good for farmers, is good for the \nenvironment, and it is good for jobs in rural America. We never thought \nwe would have these kinds of jobs where we set up a refinery in rural \nAmerica to make alternative energy. It is good for our national \nsecurity, and it is good for our economic security. So you have to have \na broad base.\n  One area in which we have done little, though, to help ourselves is \nthe developing of domestic sources of traditional energy. For too many \nyears, we have shunned the use of domestic affordable coal and we have \nhindered the expansion of our domestic nuclear energy. Why would we do \nthat when France gets 80 percent of its energy from nuclear? Why would \nwe not have the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel when they do it in \nother countries to reduce the necessity of finding a storage place for \nit to such a great extent as we have in this country?\n  What is it that people, young people, would come to my office last \nfall and say: We ought to stop using coal. Well, when you generate 55 \npercent of your electricity on average from coal, what do they expect--\nthat we should not have lights, we should not have electric motors on \nour air-conditioning, et cetera? Where do they get ideas like that?\n  There is something wrong when there is not some reality to what the \nenergy situation is in this country and you should not use coal and you \nshould not use nuclear energy. Where does that sort of thought take \nyou? It does not meet the commonsense test that we would establish in \nthe Midwest of something being a good idea or a bad idea.\n  As a result of our policies here in Washington, we have driven the \nexponential demand for clean-burning natural gas and pushed our oil \ndependancy to nearly 60 percent. Yet we have done very little to \nincrease the supply of energy to meet new demand because of an attitude \nof ``no drill, no drill.''\n  What is the sense of paying $140 for a barrel of oil, sending it over \nto some Arab nation where they are going to train terrorists to kill us \nbecause they do not like us? It would be better to keep that $140 here \nin the United States. It would be good for our economy. It would be \nbetter for our national defense. It would be better all around.\n  It is intellectually dishonest to talk about the offensively high \nprices of home heating fuel or $4 gasoline for our cars while also \nopposing every effort to increase the supply of home heating oil and \nnatural gas that would lower these prices, a la economics 101: if you \nincrease supply, the price goes down. It seems to me that some of my \ncolleagues whom I listen to here--the very same ones who are blaming \nhigh gasoline prices on the Bush administration are the very same ones \nwho do not want to drill. It does not add up. That is why I say it is \nintellectually dishonest. It is disingenuous to clamor about the cost \nof crude oil and gasoline while ignoring half of the law of supply and \ndemand.\n  Members of this body continue to point out the outrageous burden to \nour citizens because of high energy costs. I would suggest that some \nshould look closely at the votes they cast that limited the development \nof our domestic resources. We have a responsibility here in Congress to \naddress the underlying causes of high energy costs. That includes \nincreasing energy efficiency, producing alternatives and renewables, \nand developing domestic traditional sources. In other words, let me get \nback to the three-finger rule: No 1, more drilling; No. 2, Government \nincentives for alternative energy; No. 3, Government incentives for \nconservation and also what individuals can do in conservation.\n  I point out something that is just irrational, irrational right here \non Capitol Hill. I saw it--let's see, what time was it today? It was 11 \no'clock. I was out on the steps to meet with members of the Iowa FFA, \nthe Future Farmers of America, the leaders who are here to study \nleadership and to learn about the political process. Lined up across \nthis new brick area out here east of the Capitol were a whole bunch of \nblack SUVs idling, parked and idling. Why can't we have an ethic on \nCapitol Hill, whether it is Ambassadors who are coming up here, whether \nit is the Vice President coming up here, or whether it is our own \nelected leaders who have chauffeur-driven cars, to turn off the cars? \nIf you want to stay cool, come in this building and save the $4 gas. We \nhave to promote some leadership on conservation here, and it can start \nright here with the Federal Government. I do not know who owns those \nblack SUVs. I got a couple of license plates I am going to look up. But \nwe can set an ethic here.\n  But you have to have all three of these, and conservation is one of \nthem. You can have tax incentives for conservation, but you can also do \na lot of personal conservation. Even with my own staff sometimes, you \ndrive up to park to go into a town meeting, and they sit there for 10 \nseconds before they turn off the ignition. I have learned to reach over \nand turn it off just as soon as the car has come to a complete stop or \neven just a little bit before.\n  Another problem we have in this country is the United States is the \nonly country I am aware of that is choosing not to drill where we know \noil and gas exist.\n  How many times have we heard on the Senate floor: There is only 13 \nbillion barrels of oil in Alaska. It is going to take 10 years to \naccess and get it down here. It is not going to make any difference.\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\n  That is not supposed to be a big deal? If that isn't a big deal, how \ncome just within the last year they found 5 or 6 billion barrels of oil \noffshore of Brazil, and it was a big deal, a big deal from the \nstandpoint of energy efficiency for Brazil? And it was a big point for \nenhancing the inventory of known oil supplies worldwide because, just \nlike money is fungible, oil is fungible. Wherever you find another drop \nof oil, it has some impact on the inventory. It has some impact on \nsupply. So it ought to be just as big or twice as big of a deal because \nwe have 13 billion barrels of oil in Alaska, as an example.\n  Isn't this silly? Here in the United States, these lower 48, we have \nMexico south of us, Canada north of us. They are doing everything they \ncan to find every drop of oil they can; in Canada, getting it out of \nthe tar sands. Yet what is unique about the United States? We are part \nof North America. We are right in the middle of North America. North \nand south of us is every attempt to get every drop of energy they can \nbut not here. Isn't there something wrong with us when we take that \nattitude? But while you take that attitude, it is OK to ask the Saudis \nfor more oil. It is OK to ask to be dependent on countries such as Iran \nand Venezuela for our economic security. It is OK to send $140 a barrel \nover there. But, boy, don't take a drop of oil out of the ground here \nwhere we are not drilling now and keep the $140 here. It is not OK to \nopen areas at home where we know there is oil and gas.\n  As I say so often, this defies common sense. I think my constituents \nknow it because in every one of the 14 town meetings I had Monday, \nTuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of last week in western Iowa, this \nissue of why we don't drill for our own oil has come up. For 4 years \nbefore that, I don't think I heard much about it. But it sure is a big \ndeal waking up people. Maybe that is some advantage of $4 gas. It is \nharmful to the economy, harmful to middle-income people, more harmful \nto low-income people, but it might wake up America to have a more \nbalanced energy policy, which is threefold: drill, alternative energy, \nand conservation.\n  There are some on the other side of the aisle who wouldn't be able to \npoint to a single area where we should look for oil and natural gas. We \nhave four or five people on my side of the aisle. So this is just not a \nDemocratic thing, but there are more Democrats who believe that than \nRepublicans.\n  In 2006, Congress took action and voted to open 8.3 million acres in \nthe Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas drilling. However, when the Senate \nconsidered the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act in August of that \nyear, 24 Democrats, including Senator Obama, or 57 percent of the \ncaucus opposed that legislation. This was even after Hurricanes Katrina \nand Rita ripped through the gulf without a single oil or gas incident.\n  Today oil is more than $135 a barrel. Families, small businesses, and \ntruckers are suffering from the increased cost of energy. Farmers have \nbeen forced to pay outrageous prices for anhydrous ammonia fertilizer \nthis spring because of the cost of natural gas. Ten years ago we \nproduced domestically nearly all of our fertilizer needs. Now we are \ndependent upon other countries for 55 percent of that fertilizer. \nCongress must act to develop our resources at home. We can take action \ntoday to develop in responsible ways our own domestic supplies of oil \nand natural gas What I am saying is, you can do this and not harm the \nenvironment.\n  A bill I recently cosponsored, introduced by Senator McConnell, would \ntake action to reduce gas prices. It would allow States to explore for \noil or natural gas in the Outer Continental Shelf. It would allow \nGovernors in coastal States to petition for a lifting of a moratorium \nwithin their State boundaries. The Pacific and Atlantic regions of the \nOuter Continental Shelf, which this bill would allow for leasing, hold \nan estimated 14 billion barrels of recoverable oil and 55 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas. But a moratorium currently prohibits \nproduction in those very areas. The Gas Price Reduction Act would take \nsensible action to allow these resources to be developed.\n  It is time that we end the obstruction of reasonable, environmentally \nresponsible development of domestic oil and gas resources.\n  Bottom line: I hope my colleagues will recognize the extreme burden \nAmerican consumers are experiencing. It is past time to take action to \nincrease our energy supply, increase our economic and national \nsecurity, and develop the resources that God gave us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise to talk about the very serious \nenergy situation. There is a crisis focused around gasoline prices that \nwe face in our country. I want to start by complimenting the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa for doing the same, for focusing on \nthis crucial priority that every American is facing, is struggling with \nin terms of dealing with the family budget. I certainly agree with my \ncolleague, this is the No. 1 concern of every American I talk to. \nLiterally everyone I talk to says this is the top priority. This is a \ntrue crisis. This isn't just hitting me in the pocketbook every day, \nevery week, every month. This is threatening our future. This is \nthreatening our economy.\n  Given that, there is an obvious question that those same Louisianans \nand Americans are also asking. The question is, why isn't Congress \nacting? They hear us talking and making speeches and squabbling back \nand forth, but the obvious question they are asking is, why isn't \nCongress acting on this crisis that all of us face every day, every \nweek, every month, that threatens our families' futures, that threatens \nour economy?\n  I don't have a good answer. Congress should not only talk and make \nspeeches and jabber about this, but Congress must come together in a \nbipartisan way and act. Congress must take the advice of the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa and not do either/or, this or that, no \njust this, no just that. We need to do all of the above. Our energy \nsituation is so dire, we need to use less and find more right here at \nhome. And we have the ability to do that. So, once again, why aren't we \nacting?\n\n  Unfortunately, right now this question could not be clearer because \nwhile Americans in every State of the Union face this challenge every \ntime they go to the gas station, every time they look at their family \nbudget, the Senate is doing something very different. The distinguished \nmajority leader is planning to turn from the legislation on the Senate \nfloor now regarding housing and next take up not energy, not gasoline \nprices, but a bill that would triple the level of foreign aid that we \nsend overseas in terms of AIDS relief. AIDS is a very serious worldwide \nproblem. But let me say two things. First, under President Bush's \nleadership, the United States has led the world in addressing that \nissue, particularly in Africa, in a very aggressive way. I support \nthat. President Bush has led that, with others in the private sector \nsuch as Bono. But we are doing that.\n  The question I am bringing up is, is it really appropriate now at \nthis moment to take up a bill to more than triple that foreign aid \nrather than taking up a bill to address energy and gasoline prices by \nusing less and finding more right here at home?\n  I can tell you what the American people would say. Everyone in the \nState of Louisiana, everyone I know across the country would say: that \nis not a close call. That is not a close call. Global AIDS is a huge \nproblem, and we have acted aggressively to help address it. The United \nStates has led in that effort. But what is hurting us every day, every \nweek, every month, every time we go to the gas station, every time we \nhave ever more painful discussions at the family kitchen table about \nthe budget, what is impacting us is gasoline prices and energy. They \nwould say that is not a close call.\n  In this context, I urge the majority leader to turn to what is \nclearly the top priority of the American people. It is real simple. \nThey elect us to come to the Senate, to come to the House and act \ntogether as grown-ups in a bipartisan way to solve real problems. It is \nalso real simple: The biggest very real problem they face is gasoline \nprices and energy. Why aren't we acting? They are asking that over and \nover. Yes, we talk and speechify and jabber and often finger point, but \nwhy aren't we acting?\n  I believe the solution is simple. As soon as we finish the matter \nwhich we will hopefully wrap up today, the housing bill, we should turn \nto what is by far the top priority, worry, concern of\n\n[[Page S6539]]\n\nthe American people. We should turn to legislation to directly address \ngasoline prices, the energy situation, by both using less at home and \nfinding more right here at home to lessen our dependence on foreign \nsources.\n  Again, that is a pretty clear choice. What do we go to next? The \ndistinguished majority leader's suggestion is a bill to more than \ntriple the foreign aid we already send overseas for HIV/AIDS relief. \nAgain, that is a serious issue and a serious problem. We have been \naddressing it in a serious way: $15 billion for that program under \nPresident Bush's leadership. But the question is, what do we do next? \nTurn to a bill that would more than triple that or turn to a bill to \naddress the top concern, bar none, of the American people, gasoline \nprices and energy? I would obviously suggest the latter.\n  There are lots of ideas around about what we need to do on the energy \nfront. The first consensus we should reach is that we should do a whole \nlot of these ideas. It is not either/or, one side or the other. It is \nnot just conserve or just drill. It is, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa said, all of the above. We need to use less and find more and \nproduce more right here at home.\n  Many of us, well over 40 in this body, have come together around such \na bill. That bill is S. 3202, the Gas Price Reduction Act. That bill is \naimed to directly address this current gasoline price crisis and the \ncurrent energy situation. It would do it in a broad-based way, not \neverything under the Sun. It is fairly focused, but it would do it in a \nbroad-based way by both using less and finding more, producing more \nright here at home. It has four main components, each of which is \nimportant.\n\n  First of all, let me mention the component I worked very hard on. I \ndrafted this component as a stand-alone bill, but the main outline of \nthe provisions was also adopted in the broader bill; and that would be \nto open our vast, significant resources of oil and natural gas that lie \nin our ocean bottoms off the coasts of the United States.\n  When I explain this to most folks in Louisiana, they are stunned that \nwe have major, significant untapped resources in our ocean bottoms well \noff our coasts, but Congress has acted in the past to take almost all \nthat off the table. In fact, of all those oil and natural gas resources \nwe have in our ocean bottoms off our coasts, Congress has said we \ncannot touch 85 percent of it.\n  Fifteen percent, yes. That is mostly in my part of the world, in the \nGulf of Mexico, and mostly the western gulf. But for 85 percent, \nCongress has said: No. Can't touch that. Can't get that. Yes, it will \nlessen our dependence. Yes, we can do it in an environmentally \nsensitive way. Yes, we have new technology. Yes, we have lateral \ndrilling, horizontal drilling, and the like, but you can't touch that. \nEighty-five percent of that is off limits.\n  The first component of our bill, S. 3202, the Gas Price Reduction \nAct, would say we can go after those resources that are 50 miles or \nmore off our coasts if the host State involved wants us to do that, and \nif we give a fair revenue share of 37.5 percent to that host State to \ncompensate that host State for any difficulty and involvement and \npartnership involved.\n  In so doing, that would be expanding on a very important precedent, a \nvery important policy we set 2 years ago when we established that \nhistoric revenue sharing specifically--37.5 percent--in opening new \nareas of the gulf. So that is part 1 of the bill.\n  Part 2 of the bill turns to the enormous resources we have on land in \nthe United States. It turns to States in the Western part of the United \nStates, where there are enormous shale resources, and says: We will \nallow production of energy in those shale deposits. If you think it is \nmaybe the wrong policy to put 85 percent of our resources offshore off \nlimits, in the instance of Western shale, it is worse. Congress has put \n100 percent of that energy off limits because of a bar, a moratorium, \nCongress has set saying: We cannot use any of that energy.\n  Once again, the American people are stunned. They do not get this. \nThey face a real crisis in terms of energy. They know more supply, \nparticularly here at home, can stabilize prices, can increase our \nindependence, and yet a majority in Congress is saying: 100 percent of \nthat is off limits. That does not make sense. So part 2 of this bill, \nS. 3202, the Gas Price Reduction Act, would allow exploration in those \nWestern shale deposits.\n  Part 3 turns to the demand side because it is not either/or. It is \nnot just one thing or just another. It is not drill, drill, drill, and \ndo nothing else. But we also need to conserve and use new sources of \nenergy. So title III of the bill would create major new incentives to \npush forward technology and bring it to market more effectively in \nterms of electric and plug-in cars.\n  That is a very exciting technological development that is \nprogressing. But we can push it along. We can create tax and other \nincentives to hasten the development of larger batteries so these plug-\nin cars can be part of the answer in terms of our transportation issue, \ncan lessen our use of gasoline, can lessen our reliance on dangerous \nforeign sources. The third part of the bill does that. It creates major \nincentives. It is a major push to the development of more plug-in, \nelectric, and related technology cars that can lessen our demand.\n  Then, the last part of the bill, part 4 of S. 3202, the Gas Price \nReduction Act, would look at this very worrisome issue of speculation. \nIt would give new power, new authority to the agency that has authority \nand a role in the regulation of speculators. It would put more \npolicemen on the beat, if you will, to make sure there is not \ninappropriate, out-of-control speculation that may be running the price \nup even more than the normal forces of supply and demand.\n  So that is part 4 of the bill, addressing legitimate concerns about \nspeculation, putting more cops on the beat, giving more authority to \nthose regulatory bodies which are supposed to be looking after that \nissue.\n  These four components of this bill are not the only four good ideas \nout there. There are plenty more good ideas. There are plenty of other \nthings we do need to do. I would like to open up ANWR, the Alaska \nNational Wildlife Refuge. I would like to put additional incentives in \nplace for fuel efficiency and conservation and new sources of energy. \nThere are a lot of exciting possibilities in my own State of Louisiana \nfor certain biofuels, including that produced from sugar, that produced \nfrom new crops with sorghum, and other very promising biofuels that do \nnot have nearly the significant impact on food and commodity prices as \nethanol does.\n  So we need to do more. These four parts of this bill are not the only \nfour good ideas out there. But we need to have this debate in a \ngrownup, bipartisan way. We need to come together with all the good \nideas out there and present them in the best tradition of the Senate, \nwhich is open debate and open amendments, and then--and this is the \nmost important part--and then we need to act. We need to stop simply \nspeechifying, simply posturing, simply talking, and act.\n  So I believe we must turn to this top concern and priority of the \nAmerican people next. I believe we should not move from this housing \nbill which we are on right now to a bill that would more than triple \nour foreign aid that currently goes overseas to combat the very serious \nproblem of AIDS and HIV. But instead we should turn to the top priority \nof the American people: gasoline prices and energy.\n  With that in mind, I offer a very simple and straightforward \nunanimous consent request. It would say: Yes, this is the top priority \nof the American people, so we are going to turn to it, and we are going \nto have an open debate, and we are going to let amendments come to the \nfloor, we are going to have an open process and actually have debate \nand votes on all those amendments, and then we are going to act because \nthat is what the American people want.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3202\n\n  So, Madam President, in that spirit, I ask unanimous consent that \nupon disposition of H.R. 3221, the housing legislation, the Senate \nimmediately proceed to the consideration of calendar No. 854, which is \nS. 3202, the Gas Price Reduction Act, a bill to address record-high gas \nprices at the pump; and I further ask unanimous consent that there be 4 \nhours of general debate, equally divided, and upon the use of yielding \nback of that time, the Senate then proceed to consider amendments to \nthe bill in a full and open amendment process, as is the tradition of \nthe Senate.\n\n[[Page S6540]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, on behalf of the Democratic \nleadership, who intends to bring a comprehensive bill to deal with gas \nprices to the floor, I have to object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, reclaiming the floor and reclaiming my \ntime, let me say that is very unfortunate. I am sure the American \npeople are excited to hear that Congress might get to it someday. The \nproblem is, they have been straining under these record-high prices for \nmonths and they have been looking at Congress and they have been seeing \na lot of hot air and no action. Now what they see is the Senate taking \nup a bill to more than triple foreign aid that we send overseas for \nHIV/AIDS relief rather than taking up what is the most important \nchallenge and crisis they face every day: High gasoline prices and our \nenergy situation.\n  In my mind, nothing could underscore more clearly how out of touch \nthe distinguished majority leader is from the concerns of the American \npeople. We need to turn to this--not sometime, not in the future--we \nneed to turn to this now. We need to recognize--not sometime in the \nfuture--that this is an issue. We need to recognize now that this is \nthe top issue, bar none, of the American people, and we need to act.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: I understand we \nare in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator, the Senate is considering a motion to \ndisagree to two House amendments under cloture. But Senators have \nrequested time to speak as in morning business.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Let me ask another parliamentary question: I am free to \nspeak at this point without limitation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may speak for up to 1 hour on the \nquestion before the Senate or the Senator could request to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I am going to speak on the motion, and that is the \nmain purpose of my coming, but I do wish to say that, in fact, we will \nbe having a gas price bill and dealing with those issues on the floor \nvery soon. I know the Senate Democratic leadership intends to bring \nsuch a bill, but it will be a bill that is, hopefully, comprehensive in \nits nature and creates real opportunities to reduce gas prices and meet \nwith the challenges.\n  One of the factors we have today that we could get going on already \nis the 68 million acres that the oil industry already has access to and \nis largely not drilling on. So before we ask for more, why don't they \nmove on that which they already have to drill on?\n  Secondly--\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, after I make my statement, I would be \nhappy to.\n  Secondly, I think Americans would be shocked to know that a lot of \nthe domestic production in the country is sold abroad. It is not used \nhere at home. That is something we want to deal with as well, and that \nwill be part of a comprehensive bill that will come forward.\n  Those are two items that could be dealt with immediately. I think it \nis critical, and one of those two does not even need a legislative \nresponse, although, unfortunately, it is going to have to get one \nbecause the industry is not pursuing 68 million acres they already \nhave. So that is alarming.\n  I am glad to hear that some of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle finally agree that market speculation is a critical part of this \nissue. We have been at this for some time, and this is the first time \nwe have heard that is a critical component. It is a big part of what \nmany of the oil industry executives have testified to before Congress.\n  Finally, I would note it is interesting to me, we brought bills here \non critical extenders in the area of making sure that renewable energy \nsources were incentivized and brought to the mass market concentration \nwe need so we can break our dependency on oil, period, whether it would \nbe foreign or domestic, and our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle objected. So you cannot have it both ways.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator. My \nonly question, which I propose through the Chair to the distinguished \nSenator, is, I am excited to hear we might turn to all these issues \nsometime in the future. I would like to know what that timetable will \nbe. Specifically, will the majority leader give us assurance that we \nwill turn to this in a full way, in an open amendment process, before \nthe August recess?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, reclaiming the floor, I will be happy \nto give my observation. I do not pretend to speak for the majority \nleader in this regard, but I do believe that, in fact, we will see such \naction before this recess is over, maybe as early as next week. So I am \nvery hopeful, and believe very much so, that it is every intent of the \nmajority to deal with this in very short shrift.\n  Mr. VITTER. Would the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to yield for one more question before \nI get to the focus of my statement.\n  Mr. VITTER. That would be the second part of my unanimous consent \nrequest which is very important for consideration of these issues, to \ninvolve a full, open amendment process on the floor of the Senate, \nrather than the distinguished majority leader doing what he has done \nevery time in the recent past, which is filling up the tree and \nblocking amendments.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Reclaiming my time on the floor, let me simply say, it \nis always the majority leader's desire to have a full and open debate \nof the Senate. However, there are those of our colleagues who wish to \nuse that full and open debate to pursue amendments that have nothing to \ndo with reducing gas prices and dealing with our energy crisis or to be \nable to pursue a course that can bring conclusion to a bill and would \ngive that type of relief to the American people but string it out and \nstring it out on issues that are not relevant. That is when the \nmajority leader has faced the necessity of moving in a different \ndirection.\n  So I do have the expectation that we will have a good debate and, \nmore importantly, we will have a good bill that will be comprehensive \nand that will give relief to the people, and I am happy to have \nanswered my colleague's questions.\n  The main purpose for which I come to the floor as we debate the \nhousing bill is to rise again to be a voice for those who have no voice \nin this housing crisis. Certainly, one of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle seems to not to hear the cries of children who are \nbeing, in one respect, punished through no actions of their own--2 \nmillion of them in this country.\n  I am not talking about homeowners, although I am certainly pleased \nthat the bill we are considering today will have a powerful impact on \nour Nation's families. I am not talking about those on Wall Street, as \nthey seem to be the first group the administration rushes to support. I \nam talking about our Nation's children.\n  I rise on behalf of nearly 2 million children who will be directly \nimpacted by the mortgage crisis. These children are not only taking a \nhuge hit as padlocks get put on their front doors, but now they are \nlikely taking another hit, as my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle threaten to block a critical amendment that could give them \nrelief.\n  My amendment authorizes $30 million in additional funding to the \nexisting McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Program to support these \nchildren. By the way, these children didn't decide to go out and get a \nmortgage. They had no legal authority to make those decisions. They are \nthe ones who get swept up in this process. They are, for all intents \nand purposes, the worst victims of this process.\n  As I said, an estimated 2 million children and young people, \nincluding 50,000 children in my home State of New Jersey, 20,000 in \nSouth Carolina, to mention one other State, and over half a million \nLatino children nationwide\n\n[[Page S6541]]\n\nwill be directly impacted by the foreclosure crisis, placing them at \nrisk of poor school performance, behavioral problems, and other \nchallenges as well. What happens is they lose not only their home, they \nlose the school they go to. They get moved around. They don't have a \nhome and they get moved from school to school. If you are a student--\nand it is not so long ago that I can't remember--and you get yanked in \nand out of school, in and out of school, your ability to perform is \nsimply undercut dramatically.\n  In one school district in New Jersey, the number of homeless students \ndoubled--doubled--this year, from 200 last year to 423 this school \nyear, and that is only in one school district. The foreclosure crisis \nis clearly having an impact, and the time is now to stop any more \nschoolchildren from being affected.\n  An infusion of funds into the McKinney-Vento Homeless Education \nProgram will help to ensure that students who become homeless and are \nforced to move from their homes do not also have to leave their \nschools.\n  There are some who may be able to shrug this off as a small \nsacrifice. They are the victims of this process or they are the \ncalamities or casualties of this process, but there is nothing small \nabout the impact of changing schools during this type of crisis. These \nchildren are less likely to perform at grade level in math and reading, \nmore likely to be held back, less likely to graduate. There are long-\nterm consequences to what for some may seem a short-term crisis.\n  They are likely to have behavioral issues. One study found that kids \nforced to move frequently were 77 percent more likely to have behavior \nproblems than their peers. Another study found they were 20 percent \nmore likely to have violent behavior. Now, what is the cost going to be \nto us collectively in our society when that happens?\n  At the end of the day, these children are forced to say goodbye to \nnot only their home they grew up in and have had to leave their friends \nbehind, but they also have had to leave behind familiar schools and \nsupportive teachers and return to a strange home at night where their \nlives are often turned upside down. All stability is gone. They are \nthrown into a riptide with no lifevest, while we sit here in Washington \nhoping they survive the storm. Hoping is not enough. We have to do more \nthan hope for them; we have to give them a lifeline. This funding would \nactually help these children.\n  The McKinney-Vento Homeless Education Program provides homeless \nstudents with a variety of supports such as transportation to school, \ntutoring, and counseling.\n  Children are the voiceless victims of the foreclosure crisis. As we \nlower interest rates, as we support the home building industry, as we \nreform mortgage lending practices, several children's organizations and \neducation organizations have asked for this amendment as a modest way \nthat our Nation can support the nearly 2 million children who are \nsuffering the consequences of decisions made completely outside of \ntheir control.\n  The foreclosure crisis is damaging our economy, yes, but let us not \nforget the children are the real victims of this crisis, and--even \nworse--they are the silent victims. They can't speak up for themselves. \nThey have no lobbyist here in Washington roaming the halls, advocating \nfor them. It is not fair that these children get lost in the paperwork. \nThey deserve our full support.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by several of our colleagues, including \nSenator Murray and Senator Brown, and it has the full support of \nSenator Kennedy. I wish to thank Senator Enzi, who worked with me on \nthe language for this amendment to make it acceptable, and Senators \nDodd and Shelby, the chair and the ranking member of the committee, who \nagreed to include it in their provision in the managers' amendment. Had \nI known that in fact we were going to have the objection of one of our \ncolleagues to a bipartisan package, I would have sought an individual \nvote, but I am beyond that ability today.\n  In conclusion, USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, and the Chicago \nTribune have all written about this critical issue, and a number of \nrespected groups also support this amendment, including First Focus, \nthe National Association for the Education of Homeless Children and \nYouth, the National School Boards Association, and the National \nEducation Association, to name a few.\n  We have an opportunity to do something for these children. I hear \ngreat speeches on the Senate floor about family and values and the \nvalue of families and the value of our children and how our children \nare, in fact, our No. 1 asset, and that is true as a nation. They are \nalso our most vulnerable asset. Yet when it comes time to be able to \nhelp these children, the question is: Is Congress going to listen?\n  Our colleague on the other side of the aisle seems to not be \nlistening to their challenges and their pleas. One Member is likely \ngoing to block this and other important amendments, and the result is \nthat our children, once again, are going to be unheard and are going to \nbe the victims of something they had no role in creating; something \nthat, in fact, where they are going to find themselves not only \nhomeless but also having the foundation of their educational \nopportunities completely disrupted in a way that will more likely \ncreate failure than success.\n  I hope my colleagues who talk about family values understand the \nimportant value of helping our children in this regard. We have to \nreconsider our priorities, and I, for one, don't intend to rest until \nthese children receive our help and get our support.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Legend has it that as Rome burned many years ago, the Emperor Nero \nstood on his balcony and fiddled. Now, we know he wasn't exactly \nfiddling because the fiddle was not invented until over 1,000 years \nlater, but we do know that he became synonymous with people who don't \nget it, who don't get the urgency and the seriousness of the issues \nthey are dealing with. If there has ever been an organization that fit \nthat metaphor better than Nero himself, it is this Congress, because \nclearly Congress is fiddling while America is burning.\n  Americans are hurting. It is no exaggeration. We hear it talked about \nhere on the floor, but all we do is talk about it. Gas prices are \nliterally tearing families apart. Electric utilities have announced \nthey will raise their rates by over 30 percent because of the increase \nin the cost of fuels. The speeches here on the floor of the Senate have \ntried to blame everyone but the people who are responsible. We try to \nblame big oil or speculators or Bush, when anyone--any thinking \nAmerican who looks in--can conclude immediately that over the last 20 \nyears this Congress has stopped the development of American energy and \nallowed us to be held hostage by other countries and has allowed prices \nto go up to the point that Americans are now being badly hurt.\n  What do we do when it becomes obvious that our lack of energy and our \ndependence on foreign oil is raising the prices to the point that \nAmericans can no longer live; that $700 billion a year is leaving our \ncountry, devaluing our dollars, and causing us to borrow more and more \nmoney as a nation? At a time of war, at a time of debt and economic \ndownturn, what do we do? Well, I can hear the fiddling coming from the \nmajority leader's office and the Democratic cloakroom. The fiddling is \nfilling this place up because all we are doing is fiddling.\n  We are talking about climate change legislation that would add huge \ntaxes to energy in America and run more jobs offshore. We have spent \nthis week talking about how we are going to bail out the mortgage \nindustry which made loans that they shouldn't have made for people \nbuying homes that were more expensive than they could afford. We want \nto bail them out. We want to borrow over $300 million from the future--\nfrom our kids and grandkids. We are doing this while people at home are \nhurting because of the cost of energy and gas prices.\n  Now, incredibly enough, the fiddling noise gets louder, because the \nmajority leader wants to go to a foreign aid package. He wants to \nborrow $50 billion more and send it to different parts of the world--\nwith good reason, for good causes. Certainly HIV and AIDS in Africa and \nother parts of the world is a\n\n[[Page S6542]]\n\ndistressing problem that we would love to help with as Americans if we \ncould. However, at a time when Americans are hurting, when we are at \nwar, when the economy is in downturn and our country is facing debts we \nhave never seen before, should we borrow another $50 billion and spend \nanother week debating while we fiddle instead of doing something to \nincrease the energy supply here in America?\n  It is time for us to act as a Congress. Americans expect us to act as \na Congress to open up America's energy, to develop more supply as we \ndevelop alternatives and learn to use less. We cannot allow ourselves \nto be brought to our knees as a nation because we are so unwilling to \ndo what anyone with common sense would tell us we need to do, and that \nis open our own energy supplies.\n  It is incredible, if you look at the last 20 years, that we have cut \noff nuclear generation and natural gas development, oil and gasoline, \nand now we are trying to blame someone else. Congress does not get it. \nCongress does not recognize the seriousness of what is going on. We \nwant to change the subject, and that is what the majority leader is \ntrying to do now--go to another subject and spend another week doing \nsomething else, giving away more American resources, selling off and \nborrowing on our future. It is time that we do something. I agree with \nthe Senator from Louisiana and his unanimous consent request.\n  I advise the majority that I will make a unanimous consent request at \nthis time. I am not sure if the Chair is ready to deal with this. Would \nthe Parliamentarian advise me if I can make that request now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair, in my capacity as a Senator from \nMinnesota, on behalf of leadership, objects to that.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Well, before we start fiddling, I have not made the \nrequest yet.\n  I ask unanimous consent that upon disposition of H.R. 3221, the \nhousing legislation, the Senate immediately proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 854, which is S. 3202, the Gas Price \nReduction Act, a bill to address record-high gas prices at the pump.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 4 hours of general \ndebate, equally divided; that upon the use or yielding back of time the \nSenate then proceed to consider amendments to the bill in a full and \nopen amendment process, as is the tradition of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As Senator Menendez did, in my capacity as a \nSenator from Minnesota, on behalf of leadership, I object.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Obviously, I am disappointed that we are still unwilling \nto address a very basic energy bill that would open deep sea \nexploration in our country and would allow us to access oil shale in \nthe middle of the United States to help create incentives for electric \ncars.\n  These are simple things that Americans know we need to do. We need to \nproceed to it immediately, and we need to stop fiddling. We don't need \nto spend another week talking about foreign aid when we have yet to \nhelp Americans who have elected us to support them in our own country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is considering the motion to \ndisagree with the House amendment. Senators can request to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will speak on the bill. I wish to associate myself with \nthe comments of the Senator from South Carolina. I am not sure why, \nwhen it is costing $4.40 to put a gallon of gas in your car, when we \nare looking at a winter where energy prices may be as high as $5 a \ngallon, which is going to just overwhelm and create a horrific \nsituation in parts of the country like my own, where people's ability \nto survive depends on their ability to buy heating oil, why we would be \nmoving to a bill which essentially, dramatically expands an AIDS \nprogram in Africa.\n  Now, the PETFAR Program has been a success, and I congratulate the \nadministration for initiating it. We, as a people, are very \ncompassionate. We have made a commitment to Africa and the nations \nthere to help them with this terrible AIDS epidemic they are dealing \nwith. There is no question but to take a hard look at this program and \nmaking some good decisions on improving it is appropriate. But \ncertainly on our list of priorities it should not be above doing \nsomething substantive on the issue of how we increase supply in the \narea of energy in this country and how we energize more conservation in \nthe area of energy in this country.\n  We, as a people, need to pursue a course of more production--American \nproduction--and more conservation. There is much this Congress can do \nto assist in this area. It needs to be done now because--at least in \nproduction--there is significant lead time. But the one thing we could \ndo which would affect the price of oil and which would impact the \nspeculation in the marketplace that is occurring today is to make it \nclear that we, as a government, are going to support initiatives that \nare reasonable, environmentally sound, and will produce significant \namounts of new energy through production. That will have an immediate \nimpact on those folks out there who are driving up the price of oil.\n  The price of oil is driven up as a result of people presuming that \nsupply will be stagnant and will not expand and, therefore, demand, as \nit goes up, will increase price. If we can put in place policies which \nincrease production, and therefore supply, and make an American \nproduct, we will do two very good things: We will reduce the \nspeculation in the price of oil and thus cause it to go down. Secondly, \nwe will actually be producing American product and spending American \ndollars--hard-earned dollars--in America rather than sending them over \nto nations many of which don't like us to begin with.\n  So there are at least three major areas of production we should be \npursuing and which we need legislation on to pursue. The first is \ndrilling on the Outer Continental Shelf. We know we have years and \nyears of supply in the Outer Continental Shelf. But it is locked up by \nlegislation that was initiated by the other side of the aisle, which \nessentially took off limits almost all the new, available resources on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf. What has been proposed and what is a \nreasonable approach is that States that believe they are willing to \npursue drilling off of their shores--over the horizon, by the way, 50 \nmiles out in most instances--following the example of Louisiana, for \nexample, and Mississippi and Alabama which already do this, States such \nas Virginia, for example, which has said they may be willing to pursue \nthese resources, that they be given the option to do that and not be \ntold they cannot do it, which is what the law says now. That is \nreasonable. It will open a huge amount of potential supply of both oil \nand natural gas.\n  In addition, we know we have more oil reserves in oil shale in three \nStates--Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah--than all of Saudi Arabia has. We \nhave three times the amount of reserves Saudi Arabia has, and the oil \nshale can be recovered in an environmentally sound way, and the \nrecovery doesn't require anything to happen at the surface. It is all \ndone under the surface. The technology is there and it is viable and it \nis economically viable when oil exceeds $70 a barrel or maybe $60 a \nbarrel. We know we can do it.\n  But we are stopped from doing it by rules and regulations put in \nplace by the Congress and by the prior administration. We ought to \nrevisit those. We ought to debate those on the floor of the Senate. We \nought to be willing, in my opinion, to pursue programs that will, in an \nenvironmentally sound way, use that oil resource, which is so huge--\nhuge--and which is American oil. We will be using American product \nrather than product that comes from nations that not only don't like us \nbut, in some cases, want to do us harm.\n  Thirdly, we have the issue of nuclear power. France gets 80 percent \nof its energy from nuclear power. China is adding new nuclear \npowerplants all the time. We have not added a new nuclear powerplant \nsince the late 1980s. Nuclear power is clean energy. People who are \nconcerned about the environment--as many of us are, and I think most \npeople are--and about the issue of global warming, nuclear power is an \nenergy source that has no impact at all on global warming. It has no \nemissions.\n\n[[Page S6543]]\n\n  We know how to make nuclear powerplants that are safe. Nobody has \never died in a nuclear accident in this country. More important, when \nyou look at nuclear power as an energy source, it is American made, \nAmerican produced, and it means that instead of having to buy product \nfrom overseas to produce our electrical energy, we can produce it here \nwith American product, made in America through nuclear powerplants. We \nshould be adding nuclear powerplants. We made some improvements in the \nregulatory process, but it still is an extraordinarily long process to \nbring on line nuclear powerplants.\n  In fact, in France, I think it takes something like less than 2 years \nto license and get a powerplant on line. In the United States, we are \nlooking at 4\\1/2\\ years, or something like that, to license it, to get \nthe plant under construction. It takes longer to construct them, \nobviously.\n  So there are things we can do in this area. Those are the areas of \nproduction we should be aggressively looking at. They are \ncontroversial, and they should not be at a time when oil is at $140 a \nbarrel and gasoline is costing us $4.50 a gallon and home heating oil \nis costing as much as $4.85 a gallon. At a time like this, we should be \nlooking at those resources that can be produced in the United States \nand that will take the pressure off of our economy.\n  One of the big problems with the price of oil and energy and \ngasoline, beyond the fact that it is stretching the average American's \nbudget, people are legitimately worried and fearful about what will \nhappen to them this winter. One of the other consequences of the price \nis that we are taking a huge amount of American capital, hundreds of \nbillions of dollars' worth a year, and instead of retaining it in the \nUnited States where it can be used and reinvested and produce jobs, it \nis being sent overseas on a daily basis. Some of it is coming back \nthrough investments in our bonds, but we are then paying interest to \nforeign governments and foreign individuals.\n  It would be much smarter of us to try to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil by increasing domestic production. We need to aggressively \npursue programs of conservation and renewables also. That is why the \nEnsign-Cantwell bill on extending renewable tax credits is so \nimportant. I am sorry we have not been able to get to that and it has \nbeen blocked. That should be passed. Clearly, conservation needs to be \naggressively pushed.\n  So we should be producing more, and we should be using less. What we \nshould be producing more of is American product. I think next week, \nrather than debating whether we should expand a foreign aid program by \nthree times--the program was initially a $15 billion program, and it is \nproposed to take it up to $50 billion--rather than debating that, an \nauthorization bill, we should be focusing on what America really needs \nto have done today, which is address the energy needs.\n  I understand the Senator from Texas may make a unanimous consent \nrequest here. If he does, I certainly hope it will be accepted. It is \nreasonable that we should be pursuing and addressing those in the \nSenate--how we are going to produce more and use less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to say to the Senator from New \nHampshire that I agree with virtually every word he said about the \nurgency of this issue. Frankly, I do not understand why next week, as \nreported, if it is true, we intend to turn to a foreign aid package of \n$50 billion, which is authorization for new spending which is not \noffset in any way--in other words, our children and grandchildren will \nend up paying the price--instead of dealing with what is the most \nurgent problem facing the country, which is the impact of high gasoline \nand high energy prices.\n  The Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, said it was the majority \nleader's intention to bring an energy bill to the floor sometime before \nwe break in August. I hope that is true. It is welcome news if that is, \nin fact, the case, and I would love to have the majority leader \nreassure us that is his intention.\n  I do not think it is responsible for Congress to adjourn for the \nAugust recess, I do not think it is responsible for us to go home \nhaving not done anything to help the American people with the pain they \nare feeling at the pump which, of course, is rippling through our \neconomy in hundreds of ways, not the least of which is driving up the \ncost of food because of the increased energy consumption for our \nfarmers to grow it, harvest it, and then get it to markets. It is hard \nfor me to think of an issue that is more urgent in terms of our \neconomy.\n  The housing bill which is on the floor today and which has been on \nthe floor for a while is an important piece of legislation. But I tell \nyou, Madam President, I believe if we are successful in dealing with \nthe subprime loan crisis and housing crisis, the economic impact of \nhigh energy costs may well dwarf the impact of that on our economy and \nthe ripple effect, as I say, that it will have.\n  I hope the Energy bill the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nMenendez, mentioned that the majority leader plans to bring to the \nfloor includes something other than what our friends on the other side \nof the aisle have proposed previously when it comes to so-called Energy \nbills, things such as windfall profits taxes, which has been tried \nbefore and found to actually diminish domestic production in this \ncountry in a time when we ought to be encouraging more production so we \nrely less on imported energy from places such as the Middle East.\n  Then there is this idea which I can only characterize as crazy of \nsuing OPEC, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, not the \nleast of which I wonder where in the world you are going to find a \ncourt that somehow is going to accept jurisdiction of an antitrust \nclaim against sovereign foreign nations and what the impact would be in \nterms of waiving of our sovereign immunity to allow suits to go forward \nin those other countries. I think it would have a dramatic impact on \nour international relationships. But assuming you could do it, what \nwould you ask the judge? What kind of relief would you ask the judge to \naward if, in fact, we could have a lawsuit against the Organization of \nPetroleum Exporting Countries? The only one I can think of is ask the \njudge to order them to turn the spigot open wider, which does nothing \nto diminish our dependency, which does everything to increase our \ndependence.\n  The fact is, if you talk to any impartial observer, you will find out \nthere is rising demand for the oil that is being produced globally in \ncountries such as China and India, with more than a billion people \neach. They are buying cars, they are consuming gasoline, and they are \nusing more and more oil. The problem really is multifaceted but \nprimarily driven by increased global demand because other countries \nwant the kind of prosperity we have come to enjoy by making a claim to \n20 percent of the oil being produced globally, using 20 percent of it \nright here in the United States.\n  I agree with the Senator from New Hampshire, who says we need a \nmultipronged approach. We need to become less wasteful and more \nefficient and conserve energy because it makes sense to do so. It is \nthe responsible thing to do. But then we need to deal with more than \njust the demand side. We need to deal with more supply.\n  It has been interesting to me to see polling that has been done over \nthe last few months which has demonstrated a pretty dramatic change in \nattitude of the American people. It is one thing to say we don't want \nto explore and produce oil from the submerged lands along the coastline \nof the United States or to go onto the western lands where the oil \nshale lies or to go to Alaska, to the Arctic, where Alaskans \noverwhelmingly want to allow production. It is one thing to say we are \nnot going to do that when gasoline is at $2 a gallon. It is another to \nsay we are not going to do that when gasoline is at $4.11 a gallon, \nwhich it is on national average today.\n  Of course, there is really no indication whatsoever that prices are \ngoing to continue to go anywhere but up because demand is going to \ncontinue to go up and prices are going to continue to go up if supply \nremains static. That is good old supply and demand.\n  We do need, particularly as we transition to different types of \nalternative energy, particularly when it comes to transportation, \nthings such as coal-to-liquid technology that has been used by the U.S. \nAir Force to make jet fuel\n\n[[Page S6544]]\n\nto fly our B-1 bombers and B-52s. We know the technology exists, so why \naren't we doing more of it? We need to be doing more of that, to find \nalternatives to dependency on oil.\n  We also need to be doing more when it comes to electricity generation \nbecause ultimately we are going to be driving around in a different \nfashion in the years to come than we are today, perhaps in vehicles \nsuch as plug-in hybrid cars, which are going to be introduced by many \nof the major car manufacturers come 2010, where you literally will have \na battery in a car you can plug into an outlet at night and drive that \ncar the next day. Again, the electricity is going to have to come from \nsomewhere. Right now, it comes from nuclear, natural gas, and coal.\n  We know the pollution concerns about burning coal. So I agree with \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, we are going to have to increase the \nuse of nuclear power in order to get that electricity production up as \nour economy continues to grow.\n  The consequences of Congress's inaction--and it is not just a passive \ninaction; it is actually the fact that Congress has imposed a ban since \nthe early eighties on about 85 percent of our domestic energy supply in \nAmerica. On the oil shale out West, there was legislation slipped into \na bill just last year that banned the development of that shale out in \nthe West that could produce a huge volume of oil.\n  This is perhaps the most urgent issue confronting our economy, \nconfronting our national security, and affecting working families in \nthe State of Texas and around the United States. The fact that Congress \nwould even dream of taking its August recess without addressing this \nissue and allowing for an opportunity for an appropriate debate and \noffering amendments and then voting on those amendments to me is \nunthinkable. So I hope the majority leader will not allow us to adjourn \nfor the month of August before we address this issue in a realistic \nway. I do think there is some basis for a bipartisan compromise.\n  I see the distinguished Democratic whip on the floor. I read--I trust \nthese comments were reported accurately--that he said he was not \nopposed to domestic production. That is positive. I see the Gang of 14 \nwho met previously on judicial nominations. Now we have a Gang of 10--5 \nDemocrats, 5 Republicans--trying to come together in a bipartisan way \nand come up with a common ground and consensus when it comes to \nnational energy policy.\n  But I tell you, it would be a terrible mistake for us just to deal \nwith one aspect of this issue and to pretend like we have actually done \nsomething. For example, the issue of speculation on the commodities \nfutures markets--there is a growing consensus on both sides of the \naisle that we need to deal with this issue, but we need to be careful \nabout it as well. Certainly, more transparency in the way this \ncommodities futures trading system works is important. We need more \ncops on the street. We need more regulators to investigate to make sure \nthere are not abuses of the commodities futures trading system.\n  If we are not careful, if we overreach, we could force some of that \nactivity to other countries. I know that is not what we would want to \ndo, is have an unintended impact of driving those jobs elsewhere.\n  I am more optimistic than I have been in a while about the \nwillingness of Congress to enter into some sort of bipartisan \ndiscussion, debate, and vote, and actually do something that will get \nCongress out of the way and make the Federal Government part of the \nsolution and not part of the problem when it comes to imposing \nmoratoria and bans on production of about 85 percent of America's \nnatural resources.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The assistant majority \nleader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Joseph Dunn\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the late Senator Paul Simon was my closest \nfriend in politics. He was my boss for several years, and he is the \nreason I am in the Senate today.\n  Paul Simon used to like to tell the story about Meriwether Lewis, \nhalf of the fabled exploration team of Lewis and Clark. In the story--a \ntrue story--Meriwether Lewis returns to his hometown after helping lead \nthe historic journey of the uncharted West to the Pacific coast. At a \ndinner in his honor, Meriwether Lewis tells the people of his hometown:\n\n       Patriotism is not words, it's work. It's what we do.\n\n  Paul Simon believed that, and he surrounded himself with others who \nshared that belief. Patriotism is not words, it is works.\n  For Joseph Dunn, that was the creed of his political faith. Most \npeople in the Senate have not heard of Joe Dunn, but if you care about \nsocial and economic justice and the survival of small towns, small \nbusinesses, and family farms, you would have liked him. If you live in \nsouthern Illinois, there is a good chance your life is better today \nbecause of Joe Dunn.\n  Joe was the quintessential smalltown American. He loved his family, \nhis church, and his community. For 15 years, he, too, worked for Paul \nSimon in the House, then in the Senate. For most of that time, he was \nSenator Simon's downstate director in Illinois.\n  When Senator Simon retired in 1996, Joe took a salary cut to work for \nthe ICCS, the Illinois Coalition of Community Services. It is a \nnonprofit organization whose motto is ``helping communities help \nthemselves.'' Two years later, Joe became its director.\n  ICCS works with people in struggling communities in southern \nIllinois, mostly small farm belt and coal belt towns that have been \nlosing jobs and residents for a long time. ICCS helps residents in \nthose towns identify their community's specific challenges and \nstrengths and work together for a better future.\n  As a friend wrote:\n\n       Joe believed there was no community without assets, no \n     individual devoid of talents. He spent his life working in \n     partnership with these communities and individuals, taking \n     advantage of their assets and talents. He was a kind, sweet, \n     thoughtful, passionate man.\n\n  Last Friday, on the Fourth of July, Joe Dunn's caring heart stopped. \nHe suffered a fatal heart attack while he was exercising at home. Joe \nwas 55 years old. Joe learned the meaning of patriotism from his mother \nJohanna and his father Ben, a World War II POW and survivor of the \nBataan Death March.\n  Joe learned about community growing up in Gorham, a small town in the \nMississippi River Bottoms of southern Illinois bordering on the Shawnee \nNational Forest. This is how Joe described his hometown last year:\n\n       The median household income of Gorham is a mere $22,750. \n     Kids have to be transported at least 12 miles to school. Most \n     residents who work must travel an average 34 miles to their \n     jobs. But in spite of this and the fact that you cannot buy \n     either a loaf of bread or a gallon of gas there, Gorham \n     remains.\n\n  Joe went on to say it is not unique.\n\n       The isolation that poverty has brought to Gorham affects \n     many, many other small communities in Illinois.\n\n  Joe asked:\n\n       What can residents in such towns do to combat their \n     isolation? They must organize . . . and be willing to work \n     very hard to keep their sense of community intact. . . . \n     [T]hey must also organize and join with the voices of others \n     to let our legislators and other decisionmakers know that \n     [residents of small towns] have the same human rights as \n     residents of more prosperous and affluent Illinois \n     communities.\n\n  Joe Dunn was committed to the notion that America should be a land of \nopportunity for all, not just for some, and he spent his life working \nto improve the lives of others. He worked tirelessly to better the \nlives of people living in poverty by changing public policy and \nproviding creative community solutions.\n  Like Paul Simon, Joe believed government could be a force for good. \nAt Eastern Illinois University, where Joe earned a degree in political \nscience in 1975, he was the student senate speaker. He was a political \nnatural. He knew how to build and use political power. But he used his \npolitical and organizing skills to serve others, never himself.\n  He brought joy wherever he went. His laughter was warm, his humor was \nquick but never mean. Joe always had a smile on his face.\n  Joe was born with a condition that left him with a pronounced limp, \nbut he was so full of energy that you quickly forgot he had any \nphysical limitations, and he had so much faith in the\n\n[[Page S6545]]\n\nability of everyday people to change their lives so the people with \nwhom ICCS were working forgot about their supposed limitations.\n  Under his leadership, ICCS helped dozens of communities create \ncommunity development programs, neighborhood cleanup and rehabilitation \nprograms, community policing programs, and volunteer community \nlibraries. Joe helped establish afterschool programs and school and \nsummer lunch programs that fed tens of thousands of young people in my \nState. He helped create new partnerships between community and faith-\nbased groups, and new bridges between generations.\n  Before joining Senator Simon's staff, Joe worked for the Illinois \nFarmers Union-CETA, and he coordinated summer youth programs in four \nsouthern Illinois counties. He was a member of the Governor's Rural \nAffairs Council, the Illinois Poverty Summit Steering Committee, the \nIllinois Collaboration on Youth and the Service Learning Task Force of \nthe Illinois State Board of Education and the Steering Committee of the \nAlliance of Communities for Faith and Justice.\n  Through these programs, and the people he inspired, Joe's work will \nlive on.\n  Days before he died, Joe sent some friends an e-mail that ended with \nthese words:\n\n       By the way, happy 4th of July, and remember that one of the \n     most patriotic things we can do is strengthen our \n     communities.\n\n  He was a profoundly good man who made life better for many people and \na great friend of mine. I can't tell you how many times we worked \ntogether on projects in communities around our State. We had this \ncommon political heritage in Paul Simon. It rubbed off, I hope, on me \nbut certainly on Joe Dunn. I knew Joe was going to live up to those \nvalues, those Simon values that inspired so many of us over the years.\n  What a tragedy it was to learn of his passing on the Fourth of July. \nWhen Kappy Scates in my downstate office contacted us, it was hard to \nbelieve. Joe was too young, too alive, too necessary. But now he is \ngone.\n  In closing, I wish to extend my deep condolences to Joe's family, \nespecially his wife Tempa; their daughters Abby and Katie, and the two \ngrandchildren Joe loved so much, as well as his many friends. Joe Dunn \nhas left his legacy in my State of Illinois. His caring heart may have \nstopped on the Fourth of July, but his caring for the people of my \nState will not end.\n\n\n                         Republican Filibusters\n\n  Mr. President, I listened a minute ago to the Senator from Texas \ntalking about energy, and I thought to myself: Doesn't he remember that \na few weeks ago we brought energy bills to the floor and we asked him \nand the Republicans to join us in a bipartisan effort to deal with the \ngasoline prices in this country? Is he suffering from political \namnesia? Has he forgotten that we tried unsuccessfully over and over to \nget a bipartisan group of Senators to start the debate he is begging \nfor today?\n  I took a look at some of these rollcall votes to try to remember who \nwas on which side when it came to bringing up the issues, and here we \nhave, for example, a vote on June 10 of this year--June 10, not that \nlong ago, less than a month ago--and we were trying to bring up the \nbasic tax credits for energy development in this country--something \nthat is about to expire and that we want to make sure will go forward. \nUnfortunately, we were stopped. On these tax extender votes of June 10, \n2008, we needed 60 votes to go forward. We had 50 votes.\n  I looked to see what Republicans joined us in this effort. There were \nthree. The Senator from Tennessee, Senator Corker, Senator Smith of \nOregon, and Senator Snowe of Maine, which led to a total of 50. We \nneeded 60. The Senator from Texas, unfortunately, voted against \nstarting that debate.\n  So he comes to the floor today and says that we surely can't leave \nfor the August recess until we start a bipartisan debate. Sadly, on \nJune 10, he voted against a bipartisan debate on tax extenders.\n  But that wasn't the only time that day he voted against a debate on \nenergy policy. I don't wish to single him out, but he came to the floor \nand made the speech, and I will make it clear that many others joined \nhim. We brought up a bill that wasn't just an extension of tax \nincentives so companies could start building more wind turbines and \nresearch into renewable and sustainable sources of energy. It went \nfurther. In fact, I think it was a very balanced and proactive effort \nto bring down gasoline prices and to try to take control of an element \nthat is not only hurting families and businesses but our economy. We \ncame forward with the Consumer-First Energy bill, and we said we want \nto debate this on a bipartisan basis.\n  Here is what it said. First, we are going to roll back the $17 \nbillion in tax subsidies that we are giving the oil companies. Listen, \nthey are turning in and reporting the biggest profits in their history. \nThey don't need subsidies from Federal taxpayers. We could put that \nmoney to better use. What if we gave consumers across America a helping \nhand in paying for gasoline? What if we gave independent truckdrivers \nseveral thousand dollars to defray the expenses they are running into \ntrying to fuel their rigs and make a living? I would rather put $17 \nbillion in that kind of tax relief than in tax relief to ExxonMobil. \nBut that is what we are doing. So the bill said, let's change that.\n  The bill also said we were going to impose a 25-percent windfall \nprofit tax on these oil companies to let them know the sky is not the \nlimit when it comes to profit taking. There is a point where the \nFederal Government will take that money back for consumers, for \ninvestment in renewable and sustainable fuels.\n  We also wanted to suspend oil shipments to the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve for the rest of the year. Why do we keep buying this expensive \noil, taking it off the market and sinking it in the ground, making it \nmore expensive for our economy? It doesn't make sense.\n  We also had a provision to protect consumers from price gouging. I am \nafraid that is going on here. This bill gave the President the \nauthority to declare an energy emergency and set aside excessive price \nincreases.\n  We also set limitations on oil market price speculation. Most people \nunderstand that is part of the issue. We had it in our bill.\n  We had a clear message to OPEC by allowing enforcement actions \nagainst companies that collude to set the price of oil and natural gas.\n  Well, that was the bill. Those were the provisions. They could have \nmade a difference. But in order to get that bill to the floor and to \nstart debating it, we needed 60 votes. That is what the Senate \nrequires, 60 votes. So we called it for consideration on June 10, 2008, \nand we had 51 votes. The following 6 Republicans joined 45 Democrats. \nColeman, Collins, Grassley, Smith, Snowe, and Warner. The Senator who \nwas just on the floor, who says we shouldn't go home in August without \ndebating a bipartisan measure, voted not to debate a bipartisan measure \non June 10, 2008.\n  We tried again on June 17. We believe it is important. We tried to \nbring up these tax extenders again to encourage the kind of investment \nthat is necessary. Well, unfortunately, again we couldn't get 60 votes. \nWe had 52. Republicans voting with Democrats: Coleman, Collins, Corker, \nSmith, and Snowe. Sadly, the Senator who spoke on the floor was not \namong those voting to go forward on June 17. On three separate \noccasions he refused to vote to start the debate on this energy issue, \nand now he is complaining that we should be starting the debate on the \nenergy issue.\n  Well, I hope he will reconsider his previous votes, and I hope he \nwill join us in a bipartisan effort to go forward. But I must say that \nif we are going forward on this bill and others, then the policy and \nstrategy of the Republican Senators has to change. This chart shows we \nhave had 82 Republican filibusters so far in this session of Congress.\n  Now, people say: Is that a lot? How many do you expect? In the \nhistory of this Senate, there have never been more than 57 filibusters \nin a 2-year period. So far, in a little over a year, we have had 82 \nRepublican filibusters. What is a filibuster? A filibuster is using the \nSenate rules to stop the debate on a bill, to stop the debate on an \namendment or a nomination. Any Senator can stand and do that, and then \nyou have to wait 30 hours and see if you can get 60 votes together to \novercome that Senator's filibuster.\n\n[[Page S6546]]\n\n  Well, we have 51 Democratic votes. When you do your Senate math, you \nfind out we need nine Republicans to join us to move forward on \nanything. Eighty-two times the Republican Senators have stopped debate \non issue after issue. On the three separate occasions that I have made \nreference to, when the Democratic majority of 51 tried to get 9 \nRepublican Senators to join us in a bipartisan debate to bring down \ngasoline prices, to talk about investment in renewable and sustainable \nfuels, they refused. They give us just a few Senators. Coincidentally, \nmost of them are up for reelection. They give us a few, but never \nenough to reach 60. That has been their strategy. That is the \nRepublican strategy, the strategy of opposition to debate and moving \nforward.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield for \na question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I have been listening \nover the last hour, as we have heard our colleagues from the other side \ncome and excoriate us for not allowing them to bring a bill to the \nfloor on energy and assailing the Senators on this side for prohibiting \nthem from doing that.\n  That was astonishing to me because, as the Senator from Illinois \nknows, I have been coming to the Senate week after week and saying how \nmuch I pay for gas when I go home. It is now up to $4.45 a gallon that \nI paid last Sunday. I have been a part of this majority that has tried \nto bring a bill to the floor to deal with renewable energy, to try to \ndeal with the issue of speculation, and to try to deal with a number of \nissues. How many times now have we been blocked from bringing an energy \nbill to the floor to deal with these gas prices?\n  Mr. DURBIN. In the last 6 weeks, we have been blocked three different \ntimes by the Republicans, who refuse to give us the necessary 60 votes \nto bring the bill to the floor--something they are now complaining \nabout. Some of the Senators complaining the loudest voted against \nhaving a bipartisan debate on an energy bill.\n  I guess they think the Congressional Record is written in \ndisappearing ink; that we don't have a permanent record here of their \nvotes. We do. We know where they have been. We know how they have \nvoted.\n  I wish to say something else for the Senator from Washington, and I \nam sure she will agree. They come and argue that the Democrats are \nagainst domestic exploration for oil. That is not true. I don't know of \na single Democrat, I don't know of a single Senator who is against \ndomestic exploration and production of oil. In fact, as the Senator \nfrom Washington knows, we have 68 million federally owned acres that we \nlease to the oil companies for exploration and production of oil and \ngas.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Well, Mr. President, if the Senator will once again \nyield, didn't we do a bill several years ago to actually add 8 million \nacres to that, to allow more drilling?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. So we had the 68 million, and we added the 8 million \njust a year ago--in the Caribbean, if I am not mistaken--in offshore \ndrilling. So there is this pool of opportunity for the oil and gas \ncompanies. They must be opportunities because they are paying us, the \nFederal Government, a lease. They believe there could be oil and gas \nthere. But when you ask the question: Well, how much are they drilling \nof that 68 million, it turns out about a fourth of it. A fourth of it.\n  So you have some 34 million acres offshore of Federal land available \nto the oil companies, and they could be drilling it right now.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if the Senator will continue to yield, if \nI am not incorrect, I believe that 68 million doesn't include the \nadditional millions of acres off the shore of Alaska that they also are \nallowed to drill in and that they currently aren't drilling in.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is right. I don't know the exact number in Alaska, \nbut there are a significant number of acres, millions of acres \navailable off Alaska where they can be drilling.\n  So I would say to the Senator from Washington, if they have so many \nmillions of acres available for drilling, why is it that they are \nmaking the argument that they don't have any opportunities here for \ndrilling and exploration? I think it is, frankly, because they have no \nother answer.\n  What it boils down to is that for 8 years we have had two oilmen at \nthe highest levels of Government in America. When you do the math, 8 \nyears, divided by two oilmen, equals $4 gas. That is what we are \npaying.\n  I wish to thank Senator Whitehouse for inspiring me. I helped him \nwith the mathematical equation on this, but it was his inspiration that \nled to that last statement. I would say that is part of the problem. \nAny President looking at the mess in our economy and the hardship \nimposed on American families and businesses would have called the oil \nexecutives in a long time ago. Not this President. He used to be in the \nsame fraternity. He was in the oil business. Many of them believe this \nis the way it works; this is the market at work.\n  If this is the market at work, we better take a look at the market \nbecause it is destroying America's economy--cutting back on airlines, \nreducing the number of flights, reducing the number of employees. All \nthat tells me is that we need some leadership. Leadership will not be \nserved by Senators coming to the floor, who voted to maintain \nfilibusters, and then beg us to start a debate. That is what it is all \nabout. They had their chance and they didn't join us.\n\n  I would say at this point, before I yield the floor, we need to \ntackle this issue. There is no more important issue facing America \ntoday. We need exploration. We need to have investment in new \nopportunities. We need to be aggressive. We need to move right now.\n  We need, for example, to move to a point where we are not putting oil \ninto SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but actually taking it out \nand selling it and the proceeds will be used to not only bring down the \nprice of oil in that sale but the proceeds are used to help American \nconsumers, families, and business get through this energy crisis we \nface as a nation. We have to stop this indefensible subsidy of American \noil companies at a time when they are reporting the highest profits in \nhistory. Put that money back into the economy for the right \ninvestments. We need a windfall profits tax to stop what is going on \nthere, excessive profit-taking at the expense of the people who get up \nand go to work every day, and stop the price gouging and speculation \nthat is leading to higher prices for oil and gasoline. This is the kind \nof initiative we need.\n  That was included in the bill on June 10 which the Senator from Texas \nvoted not to take up and not debate. I want to take it up. I am ready \nto do that at any time the Senator from Texas wishes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for \ncoming and highlighting the number of times we have tried to bring a \nbill to the floor to deal with the very critical energy crisis that is \nin front of us. There is no doubt this is harming Americans today. For \nour friends at home and for all of us, when we have to pay $4.45 a \ngallon, as I did last weekend, that means we will not have as much \nmoney to spend on other things. We are hearing about people who are \ncutting back at the grocery stores, not being able to even go to work \nbecause they cannot afford the price to put the fuel into their car to \nbe able to go to work. This has a huge impact. It has an impact on our \nschools and our communities, that are trying to get their schoolbuses \nready for the fall and wondering how they are ever going to be able to \nbudget for that. It is affecting our truckdrivers in tremendous ways as \nthey try to get their goods to market. It is affecting every single \nAmerican family, every single business, every single community, every \nsingle government agency.\n  It is an issue that we on this side of the aisle believe we have a \nresponsibility to address. We have tried to bring a bill to the floor, \nnot once, not twice, but three times, and have faced a filibuster from \nthe other side.\n  We are going to keep working and keep trying to get to a point where \nwe can finally address this. I think all of us recognize there are two \noil men in the White House and it is going to take an election for us \nto get to the long-term issues we need to address in this\n\n[[Page S6547]]\n\nNation. But there are things we can do today. We want to do them today. \nAs Democrats we are going to keep working because America deserves it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to again urge \nmy colleagues to join in the leadership of Senator Dodd and his efforts \nto address one of the crises of economics we have going on in America \ntoday and that is the housing crisis which is causing so much pain all \nacross America, in each of our respective States. It is causing pain to \nthose who own their homes and are losing their homes, but it is also \ncausing pain to so many homeowners across America whose dream of home \nownership is being torn asunder as they are seeing their home value \ndecline in unprecedented ways. I think it is incumbent upon this \nCongress to take action to move forward to try to create an environment \nthat puts together this cornerstone of our economy which has been so \ncrumbled by all of the difficulties it has had over the last several \nyears.\n  In my home State of Colorado, we have seen a very significant \nincrease in the number of foreclosures. In 2007 in Colorado, as you can \nsee on this chart, approximately 1 per 45 households--1 per 45 \nhouseholds--filed foreclosure. That is the equivalent to nearly 40,000 \nforeclosures that were filed across my State of Colorado. That is up \nnearly 200 percent in a 5-year time period. If you look back at the \nyears 2003 and 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, we see what is happening: The \nnumber of foreclosures is rising at an extraordinary level. That rise \nin foreclosure levels is not something we can say is over. We can't say \nthis is an economic phenomenon we have been through and that we have \nalready gotten to the end and, therefore, the times ahead of us are \nrosy. We are facing some difficult times ahead of us as we deal with \nthe housing crisis.\n  This next chart is a projection of where we see ourselves going in \nColorado. This is information provided by the Center for Responsible \nLending, which indicates that in the year 2008 and the year 2009, as \nthe adjustable rate mortgages continue to adjust upward, we are going \nto see additional foreclosures in the State of Colorado. It is expected \nthat this year, 2008, and into 2009, we are going to have almost 50,000 \nadditional foreclosures. So if we have an additional 50,000 \nforeclosures in the State of Colorado, what is the consequence to \nothers?\n  First, there is a consequence, of course, to those who lose their \nhomes. There are some from whom I have heard, including people who are \nin their 60s, who are not able to continue to make the payment on their \nhomes and who end up in their later years of life essentially losing \ntheir dream of home ownership because they cannot afford the higher \nrates, the higher payment rates that come about through adjustment of \nthe ARMs. So it definitely affects those people who have to go through \nforeclosure in huge, significant, and very painful ways. But it also \naffects others, because it is surrounding homes in the neighborhoods \nthat are affected by the decline in home values. In my State alone, it \nis estimated that about 750,000 homes will have declining values over \nthe next several years. That is almost half of the housing stock within \nthe State of Colorado. So we have a lot of pain going on with respect \nto what is happening in the home world.\n  There are many people who have seen these signs, I am sure, as people \nhave driven through their neighborhoods throughout the State of \nColorado. We see these kinds of signs. They are commonplace. We see \nthem in counties such as Adam County, Denver, Conejos County; we see \nthem in Pueblo County and all over the place where people have had a \nhard time selling their homes. We see these signs that say ``Price \nReduced'' time and time again. That is, in fact, something which is \ncommonplace.\n  It is also true that there are things that can be done to help us \naddress this issue. This is a sign from our foreclosure hotline in \nColorado. That foreclosure hotline has been set up as our central \nsource for people who are having a problem with respect to staying in \ntheir homes to be able to make a telephone call to try to see whether \nthey can get some assistance to be able to stay in their home. We have \nhad more than 29,000 Coloradans call this foreclosure hotline over the \nlast several months. The foreclosure hotline in Colorado has been able \nto provide major assistance to the people of the State of Colorado who \ncall in for assistance. About 80 percent of the people who call the \nforeclosure hotline end up creating some kind of negotiation with their \nlender that ultimately allows them to stay in their home. That is good \nfor the homeowner because they can stay in their home, and it is good \nfor the lender as well because they don't go through the things they \nhave to go through with the costs incurred in foreclosing on a home, \nrestoring the home, and selling the home.\n\n  Senator Dodd and his committee have been working on trying to address \none of the most significant pains affecting the people in America \ntoday--and rest assured, there is pain in America. This dream of our \neconomic engine is somewhat teetering. When we look at what is \nhappening with the high rise in the cost of gas, and we see what is \nhappening with the high cost of health care, and all the rest of the \ncosts that are economic pocketbook issues affecting America, they are \nsaying why isn't our Government helping in terms of addressing some of \nthe fundamental issues at stake here?\n  The housing legislation, which has been crafted and worked on by \nSenator Dodd and others, is an effort to try to address this housing \ncrisis. I hope we are able to move forward with that legislation very \nsoon, because we need to start restoring confidence on the part of the \nAmerican people that we can address some of these critical issues \nfacing us in America at this time.\n  This is not a Republican or Democratic or Independent issue. The \nissue of home ownership and the issue of having a strong housing \nmarket, a strong housing construction industry, that is an American \nissue, an American challenge we all face. So we need to come together \nto push this legislation and get it done and get it to the President \nfor his signature as soon as possible.\n  For those who will try to create obstruction along the way to have us \ncontinue to not be able to get to this are doing a disservice to the \nAmerican people. We need to address this housing crisis. Senator Dodd \nand those who have worked on this legislation for a long time are \ngiving us that opportunity. I hope before the end of the day we will be \nable to take a significant step toward creating the remedy that will \nprovide some relief to those suffering from this housing crisis in \nAmerica today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will speak on another matter, if I may, \nbut first I thank my colleague from Colorado for his kind comments \nabout the efforts we made on the housing bill. I thank him for his \nobservations about his own State and what is going on there with the \npeople in the western part of our country.\n  This issue is a national problem. I think there are occasions when \npeople assume this is a localized issue in a few spots in the Nation. \nUnfortunately, we have all learned, painfully, with more and more news \nthat comes out that this problem is in every State; in some, it is far \nmore pronounced. In my State, we have had about 15,000 foreclosures, \nand another 12,000 are anticipated this year--in a State of 3 million \npeople. Home values have come down.\n  I appreciate the Senator's comments about what is going on and his \nappreciation of what we are trying to do with this bill. Every single \nday, between 8,000 and 9,000 people file for foreclosure. In the month \nof June, 250,000 people moved into that category. Those are the \nnumbers. As I said this morning, those are families--a mother, father, \nand maybe children--who have to find alternative living conditions \nbecause they are about to lose their homes. Think about that on an \nindividual basis, what it means, and the fact that we have had to take \nso\n\n[[Page S6548]]\n\nlong on this bill that could have been, frankly, passed a week or more \nago. Colleagues on both sides of the political aisle have expressed \nstrong support for our efforts. A handful of people here have slowed \nthis down and done everything in their power to derail this effort.\n  This morning's vote of 84 to 12 once again indicates the strong \ndesire by most of us here to get something done on this issue. I thank \nmy colleague for his generous comments and help in this effort.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd and Mr. Levin pertaining to the introduction \nof S. 3252 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Energy Crisis\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have noticed that late this afternoon a \nnumber of speakers have come to the floor of the Senate decrying the \nfact that there is not oil drilling here or there or elsewhere and \nsuggesting that they and they alone have the answer to our energy \nproblems. I wish to respond by saying this issue of drilling for oil is \nan important issue. I, along with my colleagues, Senator Bingaman, \nSenator Domenici, and Senator Talent, introduced the bill in the Senate \nthat opened what is called Lease 181 in the Gulf of Mexico. That is now \nlaw. We now have companies exploring for oil and gas in Lease 181 in \nthe Gulf of Mexico. Why? Because I think it makes sense to do that. If \nyou take a look at the oil reserves in Outer Continental Shelf, in the \nGulf of Mexico, off the west coast, and off Alaska, by far the majority \nof the available reserves are in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  But having said all that, we are already drilling in a lot of areas--\nincluding in North Dakota. I asked the U.S. Geological Survey to do an \nassessment of oil resources in what is called the Bakken Shale \nformation in North Dakota. I asked them to perform the assessment about \n2 years ago. They completed their report a couple months ago, and they \nestimated that there is 3.6 to 4.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil \nusing today's technology in eastern Montana and western North Dakota. \nSo now we have nearly 80 drilling rigs drilling in western North \nDakota. I don't know how many are in Montana, but there is a \nsubstantial amount of drilling activity, which I strongly support.\n  This is the largest assessment of recoverable oil ever made in the \nlower 48 States. Let me say that again. The U.S. Geological Survey just \ncompleted its assessment that there is up to 4.3 billion barrels of \nrecoverable oil using today's technology and we have oil companies \nthere drilling and I support it. We are drilling in this country, in \nNorth Dakota, eastern Montana, and we have other oilfields. This \nhappens to be a brand new one, the biggest assessment ever made in the \nlower 48. It is exciting, in my judgment.\n  As I indicated, we have activity happening now in Lease 181 in the \nGulf because we opened that. Off of Cuba, it is estimated that there is \na half million barrels a day that is available for leasing by the \nCubans. Many countries have leases there--Spain is there, Canada is \nthere, India is there, and Venezuela is there. They are very \ninterested. But our companies can't secure the leases because the Bush \nadministration says, no, we can't drill in Cuban waters. We have this \nembargo with respect to Cuba. So there is a half million barrels that \nour oil companies can't produce.\n  I say to my colleagues: You want to drill? Let's allow our companies \nto go access some of that off the coast of Cuba. China wants to be \nthere, and India wants to be there, but we can't be there.\n  The fact is we need to do a lot of things and do a lot of things well \nif we are going to address this energy issue. Now, the price of oil is \nbouncing around at $140, $144 a barrel. My understanding is that in the \nlast 4 or 5 minutes of trading today, it went up, I was told, $4 or $5 \na barrel. There is unbelievable, relentless, in my judgment reckless, \nspeculation going on in the oil futures market. Now, it wouldn't matter \nso much if these were future markets dealing with something that wasn't \nso essential to the economic well-being of our country, but our country \ndesperately needs oil. We run on oil. The fact is we use a prodigious \namount of it.\n  I have described before, on many occasions, the way this works. We \nhave a substantial amount of oil halfway around the world under the \nsands. That is where there is a lot of the oil. The largest reserve is \nin Saudi Arabia, second and third is either Iran or Iraq, depending on \nhow you count reserves in those two countries. So the largest reserve \nis in Saudi Arabia, then Iran and Iraq. But where is the largest \ndemand? Well, here in the United States.\n  We suck out 86 million barrels a day from this planet. Of that 86 \nmillion barrels of oil we suck out from these little straws called \ndrilling rigs and pumps, we use one-fourth of it here in this spot on \nthe planet called the United States of America. We are big users of \nenergy.\n  So what do we do to address this issue when oil prices spike like \nRoman candles to $140 a barrel, and it does enormous damage to our \ncountry, to our economy, and injures farmers, families, truckers, and \nairlines? What do we do? We do a lot of everything, it seems to me.\n  I described that we are drilling exciting new wells in our region of \nthe country. We are going to be drilling in Lease 181 in the Gulf of \nMexico. But in addition to drilling, we need to do a lot more. We need \nsubstantial, aggressive conservation. We need significant efficiency \nand conservation. Everything we use throughout the day--if we turn a \nswitch, push a button, dial a knob, turn a key--everything we do all \nday long has to do with energy. We get up in the morning and we want \nlight, in the closet, in the bedroom. We use our finger to flip a \nswitch, not understanding, of course, so much--because we take it for \ngranted--that is energy. Perhaps we use an electric razor, then heat a \npot of coffee, then put a key in the ignition of a vehicle. Every one \nof those actions is using energy, and we never give it a second \nthought.\n  Now, all the things we have--yes, including air-conditioners and \nrefrigerators--can be made much, much, much more efficient. We are \ngetting rid of the incandescent light bulb. It will not be long until \nyou will never see another one because we can find ways to produce \nlight for all our manufacturing facilities and our homes all across \nthis country with 80 percent less electricity than we now use. So we \nneed to engage in conservation, efficiency, and then renewables.\n\n  Now, renewables represent something our country ought to say to the \nworld: Here is where we are headed. Yes, we are going to drill some and \ndo all these things. We are going to conserve and develop more \nefficient methods of using all this electricity. But it is also the \ncase that renewables represent a significant opportunity. Renewables, \nwith respect to wind energy and solar and biomass and biofuels.\n  You know what we have done for renewables? Well, in 1992, the \nCongress put in place something called the production tax credit--a tax \nincentive for renewables. But it was short term and not very deep. So \nwe have extended it five times, short term. By the way, the production \ntax credit will expire at the end of this year. We have extended it \nfive times, and we let it expire three times. So anybody interested in \ninvesting in renewables will take a look at this country and say: You \ndon't have much of a commitment to renewables. Look what you have done, \nstutter, start, stop. That is not a commitment.\n  Here is what we did for oil. In 1916, we put in place tax \nincentives--big, juicy, fat tax incentives--and we said: We want you to \ngo look for oil and gas. If you find them, good for you because that is \ngood for our country, and you get big tax incentives. We put the \nincentives in place in 1916 and they have stayed forever. What did we \ndo for renewables? Well, in 1992 we gave them a tax credit, which has \ngone through the phases of start, stop, start, stop, expire. That is a \npathetic, anemic response by a country that acts like it doesn't care \nvery much.\n\n[[Page S6549]]\n\n  I have introduced legislation in this Congress that says: You know \nwhat, we ought to put in place a production tax credit for renewables \nfor 10 years. We ought to say to the world: Here is where we are \nheaded, and you can count on it. Here is what we believe in, and you \ncan count on it. This country is making a significant concerted effort \nfor renewable energy, to be less dependent on the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, \nthe Venezuelans, and others. That is what our country has a \nresponsibility to do.\n  So we need to do a lot of things. At the moment, however, I wish to \nconcentrate on not the myriad of things we must do and do well, but I \nwish to talk about the urgent need to do something that addresses this \nspike, this unbelievable spike in oil prices and, therefore, gasoline \nprices that has happened in the last 12 to 14 months.\n  There is nothing in the supply and demand of oil that justifies this \nkind of a price spike. Nothing. In fact, if anything, demand is down. \nToday's newspaper describes that we are using 2 percent less gasoline \nhere in this country. The first 4 of 5 months in this country we had \nincreased inventory of crude oil stocks. Inventory is up, demand is \ndown. What happens to price? It goes straight up. Why? Because there is \nexcess speculation in the futures market.\n  Those futures markets were designed for a specific purpose and that \nwas to allow producers and consumers to hedge risk of a physical \nproduct--perfectly legitimate and an important thing to do. It has now, \nin my judgment, been taken over by excess speculation. Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt warned about that in 1936, when he signed the legislation \nthat created this market.\n  Now we have unbelievable speculation in this market. The new pension \nfunds and others that have come into this marketplace in a few short \nyears have spiked from investing somewhere around $13 billion to $260 \nbillion. Are the people flooding into this marketplace wanting to hold \na 5-gallon can of oil? No, these interests never want to touch oil. \nThey never want to own oil. They want to do what Will Rogers talked \nabout 80 years ago: They want to buy what they will never get from \npeople who never had it and make money on both sides. And then walk \naround with a permanent grin, walking into the bank with our money to \nmake their deposits. Yes, the OPEC countries do that and so do these \nspeculators as they have driven up the prices. The problem is it \ninjures this country's economy.\n  It is devastating, for example, to various industries--the trucking \nindustry, the airline industry, and farming to have such high oil \nprices. It's also devastating to ordinary consumers, trying to figure \nout how on Earth do I scrape up the money to fill my gas tank to be \nable to drive back and forth to work. How do I do that?\n  Now, I think we have a responsibility to address this excess \nspeculation. When markets are broken, we have a responsibility to \naddress it. I have often said I taught economics ever so briefly in \ncollege. I taught a little economics, and I kid people by saying I was \nable to overcome that experience. Economics is psychology pumped up \nwith a little helium. People think: Well, we know this produces that, \nthere is an action and a reaction--supply and demand. We all understand \nthat. The problem is, at the moment, if you take a look at this \ncountry, its economy, and what the psychology of the American people is \nas they look at what is happening in this country, there is a pretty \ngood reason to be very concerned about the future and a pretty good \nreason to believe we need action that is urgent, important action that \nactually has some grip and some teeth.\n  We have been through a subprime loan scandal. The credit markets were \nfrozen. The fact is we had an orgy of greed in these credit markets and \na lot of problems still exist. In fact, some of the resets on some of \nthese bad mortgages are still in front of us. So take a look at that \nkind of a credit crisis and the subprime loan scandal and then combine \nthat with the issue of the deficits, dramatic Federal budget deficits \nbecause we are fighting a war the President will not pay for. He says \neverything we use for this war, I want to borrow, and he has borrowed \nalmost three-quarters of a trillion dollars for it. He refuses to pay \nfor it. I will send the soldiers to war, and I ask the American people \nto go shopping, he says.\n  The subprime loan scandal, unbelievable fiscal policy recklessness, a \ntrade policy out of balance over $700 billion a year. You can't do \nthat. Then, on top of that, the price of oil going to $144, and we \nthink this economy is able to withstand that? This is a resilient \neconomy, the American people are resilient people, but they expect and \ndemand appropriate action by this Congress.\n  Now, we have people who view themselves as a set of human brake pads. \nTheir only role in life is to come to the floor of the Senate and say: \nOh, no, no, no. You can't do that. We are going to dig in our heels and \nprevent anyone from doing anything. That is not public policy we should \nbe proud of. We are trying very hard to construct some public policy in \nall these areas that give us a chance to move forward. I know there are \nreasons for some to object to certain activities. But we have seen, in \nthe last 5 or 6 months, a steady stream of people coming to this floor \nand saying: My goal is to stop anything from happening. Meanwhile, all \nthese issues pile up in a way I think is a danger to this country's \nfuture and a danger to our economy. It is starting with this issue of \nenergy, as I began the discussion today.\n  We have a responsibility in the short term, and I know the majority \nleader and others believe it as well.\n  We have a responsibility to at least tackle excess speculation and \nthe relentless dangerous speculation of this commodity futures market \nthat is driving up the price of oil and injuring this country's \neconomy.\n  I have introduced legislation to do that. I hope to talk about it \ntomorrow. Some others have also introduced legislation. We ought to \ntake the best of the legislation that exists and move forward to \naddress this country's problems.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2731\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have worked very hard tonight trying to \ncome up with an agreement to move forward. We have been close, but \nclose doesn't count on Senate business. We have a most important bill \nwe are working on, which is the global AIDS bill. It is a bill that the \nPresident supports. We have been in touch with his people during the \nweek. There are no requests of Democrats to offer amendments. We have \nbeen working with the distinguished Republican assistant leader, \nSenator Kyl. There has been a proposed 13 amendments, as I recall. We \nhave agreed to seven of those amendments. The others, at this stage, we \nhave been unable to work on. We have tried to work on ways of not \nhaving Senators come tomorrow and vote and wind up at the same place on \nMonday. But there has been a Senator--or two--on the Republican side \nwho, I assume, wants to show that he has a lot of power as a Senator. \nAny one Senator has a lot of power. So at this stage, it appears that \none Senator is going to require all Senators to come to vote tomorrow \nat 5:21 in the afternoon. That is when time runs out on the housing \nlegislation. And following that, which will complete the housing \nlegislation, we will send it back to the House. Following that, we will \nautomatically have a vote on PEPFAR, the global AIDS bill.\n  What we wanted to do is avoid those votes and come in Monday, and we \nwould wind up at the same place. But we were not able to get agreement. \nSo we will do directly what we could have done indirectly, but we would \nhave wound up the same way.\n  First, I appreciate everyone's patience. The Presiding Officer has \nspent a lot of time here. Senator Dodd, who is chairman of the \ncommittee, has been here because it is a housing piece of legislation. \nWe have had a number of conversations with Senator Shelby. The staff \nhas been tremendous. We have had staff working on trying to resolve \nthese amendments. I really appreciate Senator Durbin, my friend and \nassistant leader, who has been here throughout the night.\n\n[[Page S6550]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed to S. 2731, the global AIDS bill, occur on Monday, July 14, at \n5:30, p.m., with the hour prior to the cloture vote equally divided and \ncontrolled between the leaders or their designees; that if cloture is \ninvoked, all postcloture time be yielded back, the motion to proceed be \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and the \nSenate proceed to consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I do object on behalf of Senator DeMint. Let \nme make a very brief statement.\n  The distinguished majority leader is correct. It is almost 11:30 this \nevening, and we have been working since about 3 o'clock this afternoon \nto try to reach agreement on how to proceed with this very important \nbill. We have made a lot of progress. A lot of Members have been \nwilling to make concessions to try to limit the number of amendments \nthat would be considered so this bill could be completed sometime next \nweek. But we haven't worked out everything. Unfortunately, because \neverything hasn't been worked out at this late hour tonight, it wasn't \npossible for us, one of our Members, to agree to this particular \nrequest. The majority leader is correct about how we will have to \nproceed as a result.\n  It is my strong hope that because this is a very important piece of \nlegislation--Members have different views about aspects of it--an \nagreement could be reached by which an appropriate number of amendments \ncould be considered and debated and voted on next week and the bill \nfinally disposed of at a point next week. There is a fairly \nconstructive way to do this, and then there is a way to do it that \nisn't as constructive.\n  So I appreciate the effort the majority leader and others have put \ninto this tonight. It would be my hope that in that same spirit, we can \ncontinue to talk about this tomorrow and hopefully reach an agreement \nwe would be able to proceed with in order to complete the bill sometime \nnext week.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there was an objection, I understand, by my \nfriend.\n  There has been tremendous work on this bill for months and months. \nThe principal workers on this bill have been the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Biden, and the ranking member, Senator Lugar. They \nhave worked on this for months. I have, for more than a month, had \nstatements made to me: Give us another day, another day. That has been \ngoing on for a long time. We are in a situation here where we ran out \nof days, and we had to move forward. Senator Lugar and Senator Biden \nhave accepted numerous amendments from Members wanting to make this \nbill better. I am confident they did make the bill better. But the fact \nis--I want everyone to understand--the work on this bill did not start \ntonight. Senators Lugar and Biden thought all the work had been done on \nit.\n  So we are where we are. Senators have a right to suggest changes to a \nbill, even though we have spent a lot of time on it.\n  I say to my friend, the distinguished Republican whip, we are anxious \nto finish this bill. I personally think it is good legislation. I think \nit is something we as a country need to do. But also understand that we \nhave been willing to accept on this piece of legislation any germane \namendments that relate to this bill. We have even agreed tonight to \nwork on some things that are not, but we have agreed to do that in an \neffort to move this forward. I hope over the weekend, perhaps even \ntomorrow before we leave, maybe something can be done. If not, maybe \nMonday we can do something. Otherwise, we find ourselves in this \nposition. Monday we are on the bill. We would at that time, of course, \nhave to file cloture on the bill itself.\n\n  Now, I think we could constructively use some time. If there are \nSenators who want to change this legislation and do it in a germane \nfashion, we should spend that 30 hours--actually the 2 days it would \ntake for cloture to ripen--on trying to improve the bill. We would be \nhappy to do that. We would even be willing to consider, as my friend \nknows, the junior Senator from Arizona, amendments, as we have talked \nabout tonight, that may not be technically germane. I hope we can do \nthat.\n  But as we have seen in this Presidential election year, we have two \nof our Senators running for President, and it makes it extremely \ndifficult to legislate in a way that we perhaps would like to. But that \nis the process in which we find ourselves. So hopefully something will \nwork out well during the night or, if not, maybe tomorrow or, if not, \nover the weekend. I hope we could spend our week constructively \ndisposing of this legislation the President wants.\n  We will finish the legislation very likely, one way or another, next \nweek. I cannot imagine the President's own party would stop this bill \nfrom passing. But we have been surprised in the past. So we will do \nwhat we can to help the President. This is a bill I believe in. The \nvast majority of the Democrats--in fact, I do not know of a Democrat \nwho does not like the bill. But we hope there would be some \nreasonableness on the other side to try to help the President's program \nalso.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I make a point of clarification?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. KYL. I think the majority leader will agree with this. When the \nmajority leader speaks of accepting amendments, it is not a matter of \naccepting an amendment to the bill.\n  Mr. REID. No. To debate and vote on them.\n  Mr. KYL. But rather agreeing to allow an amendment to be offered, \ndebated and voted on.\n  Mr. REID. That is right. I am sorry I did not make that clear.\n  Mr. KYL. No, No. I knew the Senator would want to be clear on that. \nThere are some nonrelevant or nongermane amendments that have been \nproposed. It is certainly understandable that the majority would not \nwant to have those amendments considered as a part of the debate. For \nthose amendments, however, that are relevant to the subject matter at \nhand, that is what most of the discussion has been about, and we are \nhoping at the end of the day an arrangement can be agreed to where \nthose amendments could be considered by the Senate, debated, voted \nupon, maybe rejected, but at least the Members would have had an \nopportunity to vote on the amendments, and, as I said before, and, as \nthe majority leader said, to conclude the bill then sometime next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. So Mr. President, I have asked the first consent, which was \nthat we have no votes until Monday. That was objected to.\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. So, Mr. President, now I ask unanimous consent that on \nFriday, after all the postcloture time has expired on the motion to \ndisagree--that time occurring at 5:21 p.m.--the Senate proceed to vote \non the motion to disagree to the amendment of the House adding a new \ntitle and inserting a new section to the amendment of the Senate to \nH.R. 3221; that upon disposition of that motion, the Senate then \nproceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to \nproceed to S. 2731, the global AIDS bill; that if cloture is invoked, \nthen all postcloture time be deemed expired, and on Monday, July 14, \nfollowing a period of morning business, the motion to proceed be agreed \nto, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the \nSenate then proceed to the consideration of S. 2731; that if cloture is \nnot invoked, then a motion to reconsider the vote by which cloture was \nnot invoked be considered to have been entered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority whip.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6550-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the efforts of \nNoticias 15,\n\n[[Page S6551]]\n\na Nevada news program that has gone to great lengths to realize the \nbenefits of U.S. citizenship for many new Americans.\n  Noticias 15 has shown the impact news media can have by supporting \nprograms like ``Ya Es Hora . . . Ciudadani'' or ``Now is the Time . . . \nCitizenship'', which motivates and assists lawful permanent residents \nto navigate the often daunting legal hurdles of our immigration system \nthrough a comprehensive civic engagement strategy.\n  Noticias 15, working with its sister programs in the Entravision \nCommunications Corporation, provides a strong example of the support \nthat can help to more fully engage immigrant communities and \ntraditionally underrepresented minority groups in civic participation. \nAs one of the top-rated local early evening newscasts in the Las Vegas \nmarket, the news program has disseminated critical information on \napplying for U.S. citizenship, featuring segments on citizenship \neligibility, requirements, and the application process. In addition, it \nhas partnered with local and national agencies to boost voter \nregistration among viewers.\n  This is particularly relevant in Nevada, where we have experienced \nrapid population growth in the Hispanic community--now nearly one in \nevery four Nevadans is of Hispanic descent. We must encourage the \nactive participation in civic life of every eligible Nevadan, and I am \npleased that Noticias 15 is a partner in this effort.\n  Like many of my fellow Nevadans, I am aware of the challenges we have \nfaced in increasing civic participation among Hispanics. Our proverbial \nwheels are spinning as we fight to make the American dream attainable \nfor all families who work hard and play by the rules, level the playing \nfield so that Latinos can become viable candidates for elective office, \nand remove the unfair barriers that hinder the Latino community from \ncoming out to vote. Noticias 15's actions help to provide the traction \nthat will keep our wheels from continually spinning up dust.\n  Today, I recognize Noticias 15 for its valuable support of ``Ya Es \nHora . . . Ciudadani.'' The momentum that has been created by this \nprogram and others will lead to better opportunities for the Hispanic \ncommunity and for the larger community in which we all live. I look \nforward to seeing more contributions from this important organization \nin the Silver State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6551-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6551-S6553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORTS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to submit to the Senate the first \nbudget scorekeeping reports for the 2009 budget resolution. The \nreports, which cover fiscal years 2008 and 2009, were prepared by the \nCongressional Budget Office pursuant to section 308(b) and in aid of \nsection 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended.\n  The reports show the effects of congressional action through July 7, \n2008 and include the effects of Public Law 110-252, the Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, 2008, which the President signed into law on June \n30, 2008. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are \nconsistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con Res. \n70, the 2009 budget resolution.\n  For 2008, the estimates show that current level spending is below the \nbudget resolution by $5.4 billion for budget authority and $2.6 billion \nfor outlays while current level revenues are above the budget \nresolution by $4 billion. For 2009, the estimates show that current \nlevel spending is below the budget resolution by $983 billion for \nbudget authority and $615.8 billion for outlays while current level \nrevenues are above the budget resolution level by $67.8 billion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters and accompanying tables from \nCBO be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2008.\n     Hon.

This report is submitted under \n     section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \n     Budget Act, as amended.\n       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues \n     are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of \n     S.

Res. 21, provisions \n     designated as emergency requirements are exempt from \n     enforcement of the budget resolution. As a result, the \n     enclosed current level report excludes these amounts (see \n     footnote 2 of Table 2 of the report).\n       Since my last letter, dated January 24, 2008, the Congress \n     has cleared and the President has signed several acts that \n     affect budget authority, outlays, or revenues. These amounts \n     were included in the budget aggregates of S. Con. Res. 70. \n     Please see footnote 1 of the accompanying report for a list \n     of those acts. In addition, the Congress has cleared and the \n     President has signed the Supplemental Appropriations Act, \n     2008 (Public Law 110-252). This is CBO's first current level \n     report since the adoption of S. Con. Res. 70.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Robert A.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our friend \nand former colleague, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina. When \nSenator Helms passed away on the Fourth of July, our country lost a \npatriot and a strong conservative voice.\n  Senator Helms' life was about public service. During World War II, he \nserved in the U.S. Navy, where he first developed his commitment to a \nstrong U.S. military and America's security at home and abroad. He \nserved in a number of public roles in Washington, DC, and in his home \nState of North Carolina, and in 1972 was elected to the U.S. Senate--a \nposition he held for five consecutive terms.\n  Senator Helms was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nwhen I came to the Senate in 1996, where I have served for 12 years. As \nchairman, he consistently maintained a powerful and determined voice in \nhis efforts to strengthen America. I will always be grateful for his \nmany personal courtesies and his constant encouragement and assistance \nover the 6 years that we worked together.\n  Senator Helms was outspoken, strong-minded, and unwavering in his \nbeliefs. He was a leader who will be missed. Lilibet and I extend our \nthoughts and prayers to Jesse's widow and our friend Dot and his \nwonderful family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6553-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6553-S6554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES UPDATE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to update the Senate on \nthe deteriorating situation in California.\n  Simply put, the situation is untenable.\n  In the past 2 weeks, 1,781 wildfires have burned roughly 688,000 \nacres--an area roughly the size of Rhode Island. Today, 323 fires \ncontinue to burn including the Camp Fire, in Butte County. As a result \nof that fire, 14,000 residents have had to evacuate their homes and \nnearly 50 homes have been destroyed in the past 48 hours.\n  It is likely to get worse--with a heat wave and more lightning \nstrikes forecast--just as State and Federal resources are being \ndepleted.\n  Governor Schwarzenegger has told the Federal Government that \nCalifornia cannot continue to fight these fires--that with current \nresources the State cannot protect lives and property.\n  California needs the following: Personnel: The Governor needs 302 \nmore hand crews to put on the front lines and 773 support personnel. \nThe State has tapped out its resources; it is time for the Federal \nGovernment to step up to the plate.\n  And the Forest Service is also short on staff. Key supervisors and \nfirefighters are missing from our national parks, hampering \nfirefighting and brush clearing efforts. Last month the agency reported \n380 vacancies in California--roughly 8.5 percent out of a total force \nof 4,432. These positions must be filled. Agriculture Under Secretary \nMark Rey promised me these vacancies would be filled by July 8. But as \nof today only 289 positions have been filled. We need to do more.\n  A Full Emergency Declaration: Governor Schwarzenegger has declared \nemergencies in 11 counties: Butte, Trinity, Shasta, Santa Barbara, \nSanta Clara, Monterey, Mendocino, Santa Cruz, Plumas, Kern, and \nMariposa. But President Bush has issued only a limited emergency \ndeclaration. California is asking the President for a full disaster \ndeclaration, which will open the State to broader assistance under the \nStafford Act. I fully endorse this request.\n  Funding: California's fire emergency is burning up Federal \nfirefighting dollars at an alarming rate. The Forest Service has \nalready expended $704 million--more than half the $1.2 billion in \navailable funds--and fire season has just begun. Therefore, I am asking \nfor $910 million in emergency appropriations for the Forest Service and \nInterior Department.\n  This emergency funding, to be used throughout the United States as \nneeded this year, includes: $610 million for wildfire suppression; $125 \nmillion for fuels reduction on State and private lands; $100 million \nfor rehabilitation; $50 million for fuels reduction on Federal lands; \nand $25 million for firefighter recruitment and retention in high risk \nareas.\n  Air assets: The Governor has told President Bush that we need an \nadditional 41 helicopters in California. I am committed to working with \nthe President to make these aircraft available from other States, the \nmilitary, or foreign nations. Whatever it takes, we need these \nresources.\n  We also need to permanently station military firefighting aircraft in \nCalifornia. It is increasingly clear to me that the key to these \nwildfires in remote geographic areas is immediate aerial assault on the \nfires. You cannot get firefighters into these areas fast enough. \nEarlier this year I asked the President and Defense Secretary Robert \nGates to permanently station two C-130 tankers at Point Mugu. This is \nvital; several C-130s are working these fires today, but they had to \ntravel great distances to get to California. This is unacceptable.\n  I am writing to the President again to renew this critical request.\n  Let me share with you a letter written by Henry Renteria, Director of \nGovernor Schwarzenegger's Office of Emergency Services, to R. David \nPaulison, Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n  It says in part:\n\n       We are in an unprecedented draw-down in the state's \n     emergency resources. Many fire departments are barely able to \n     maintain sufficient resources for initial attack on new \n     structure fires, while still participating in the statewide \n     mutual aid effort to address these wildfires.\n\n  Even with the assistance of more than 24,000 firefighters from 40 \nStates, ``California has outstanding orders for fire resources that it \nis unable to fill,'' the letter states.\n  Yesterday there were requests for 230 engines that went unfilled, and \nat one point last week there were requests for 400 crews of 15-20 \nfirefighters that were not met.\n  The Governor's letter continues:\n\n       California is in the untenable position of having orders \n     for firefighting resources remaining unfilled for multiple \n     days. The Governor has taken the extraordinary action this \n     week to direct the training of 400 California National Guard \n     soldiers in basic firefighting. These soldiers will be \n     assigned to the firefight as quickly as they can be trained \n     and equipped.\n\n  Mr. Renteria--again, the Governor's authorized representative--\nconcludes by warning that ``the cumulative impact of these disasters \nhas exhausted state and local resources to the point in which \nCalifornia cannot avert threat to live and improved property \nadequately.''\n  This is without question a clear and present threat to the largest \nState in the Nation.\n  California is on the precipice of a major catastrophe. California has \nspent more than $300 million fighting these fires--that is more than it \nspent on last year's firestorms. And this is only the second week of \nJuly.\n  Let me remind you of what the fall brings to southern California. It \nbrings strong Santa Ana winds, which fuel massive and deadly \nfirestorms: In 2003 in California, huge wildfires burned roughly 1 \nmillion acres; killed 21; and destroyed more than 5,000 homes. And last \nyear in California, wildfires blackened 1,087,110 acres; killed 10; and \ndestroyed 3,079 structures.\n  We are in a new and dangerous time.\n  The great bulk of the fires that have burned since last month--more \nthan 1,000--were sparked by more than 8,000 dry lightning strikes.\n\n[[Page S6554]]\n\n  California is now faced with dry lightning strikes at a level that I \ncannot remember in my lifetime. And more are forecast this week.\n  The State is also facing extreme heat. Across the State, nearly in \nevery county, there are excessive heat warnings.\n  And the State is in the midst of a serious drought--Governor \nSchwarzenegger has declared a drought emergency.\n  The State's reservoirs are below normal, and drought has produced \nrecord amounts of dry brush. In many areas, there is more dry brush \nthan at any point in the 27-year recorded history of the data.\n  This dry brush is like an unexploded bomb.\n  Last month--the halfway point of the year--more than 272,969 acres in \nCalifornia had burned. That's up from 42,214 acres burned at the same \npoint last year. And up from the 5-year average of 30,938 acres burned \non State land at that time of year.\n  The facts are clear and cannot be ignored. California is in great \nperil. And California's peril is the Nation's peril, for the costs of \nfighting these fires is fast draining our Federal firefighting \nresources.\n  Bottom line: California and the Nation need help now. A potentially \nrecordbreaking fire season is upon us. We need to do more. We need to \nprepare. And we need to do it now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6554-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6554-S6555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering over 1,000, are heartbreaking \nand touching. To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail \nsent to me through energy_prices@crapo.senate\n.gov to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       To whom it concerns:\n       Here's how rising gas and diesel prices are affecting this \n     Idahoan and her family:\n       We are a one-income (plus overtime) middle-income family \n     living in Boise. The huge increase in fuel prices has caused \n     subsequent increases in the price of consumer goods (due to \n     price increases for fuel to manufacture, transport, and \n     deliver consumer goods). Thus, our entire cost of living has \n     increased at a rate higher than that of my husband's annual \n     raise. Our standard of living is dropping, regardless of his \n     continued raises, and we are having to cut corners from our \n     budget, in every direction.\n       Due to our sons' disabilities, it has been imprudent for me \n     to work full time. However, in light of the growing costs of \n     living due to fuel costs skyrocketing, I will most likely \n     need to return to work this year, NOT to purchase hobby \n     equipment or upgrade our vehicle, but to continue to make our \n     mortgage payment and to EAT PROPERLY.\n       To our Congress: PLEASE STOP OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN \n     FUELS. We're lining the pockets of oil-rich nations while \n     stealing the quality of life from our own citizens.\n       Nuclear energy is NOT the way to go, in my opinion. The \n     dangerous waste by-products of nuclear-generated power are \n     not worth the savings in costs of energy to our citizens. \n     There are many other methods to generate energy for homes and \n     businesses (and vehicles) that are cleaner, renewable, and \n     completely non-polluting, such as solar energy; wind energy; \n     hydro-electric energy (why not let all the dams in our state \n     run at full capacity rather than leave one or two turbines \n     unused most of the time, and STORE the excess energy we \n     generate to keep our costs down, or sell it to profit our \n     state's economy); and the transformation of our society's \n     garbage into usable, non-polluting hydrogen fuel for vehicles \n     that run on hydrogen.\n       There are always local (American) solutions to local \n     (American) problems.\n     Teresa, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I should think it would be obvious to all sentient beings \n     by now that we are on the wrong trajectory. The notion that \n     we can consume more and more each year without some \n     FUNDAMENTAL changes is wrong. I search your words in vain for \n     ideas about something new. No luck. Same old mindset. What \n     about conservation of finite resources? What about \n     alternative energy resource development? The large and very \n     profitable oil companies benefit enormously from tax breaks. \n     Where is the policy incentive for non-polluting alternate \n     forms of energy? Where are the incentives to promote more \n     efficient use of the old sources? Pull your head from the \n     sand. It is high time you realized a new era is upon us.\n     Cristina.\n                                  ____\n\n       To Whom It May Concern,\n       Fuel costs are killing the average citizen in Idaho. It is \n     bad enough that the price of getting to work is costing more \n     than many can afford, but the prices in the grocery stores \n     are also rising exponentially as the cost of shipping \n     skyrockets and the cost of running farm equipment to produce \n     the food skyrockets. To make things worse, Congress, once \n     again with good intentions but not a clue of the damage they \n     would do, are adding to the situation with the ridiculous \n     bio-fuels subsidies. Bio-fuels are horribly inefficient, but \n     the cost of corn to feed dairy cattle and fatten beef cattle \n     is becoming unaffordable. To make things worse, these \n     terrible incentives to plow up hay fields and raise corn is \n     leaving livestock owners unable to buy hay. Horses are being \n     turned loose or shot by owners who cannot get or afford hay \n     to feed them. Once again the bloated farm bill is putting \n     billions of dollars into the hands of a few farming \n     corporations while small farmers and livestock owners are \n     left to struggle against high fuel and feed costs created by \n     Congress. PLEASE repeal these stupid restrictions on oil \n     exploration and refining, as well as that awful subsidy on \n     bio-fuels. They are counterproductive and just plain stupid.\n     Pat, Priest River.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo,\n       High gas and energy prices are affecting everyone \n     negatively but I would rather respond to the second part of \n     your email.\n       Americans are not ``too dependent on petroleum,'' as you \n     said; we are just too dependent on foreign petroleum. We can \n     thank Mr. Clinton and subsequent leaders and legislators for \n     the predicament we find ourselves in today. They have caved \n     in to the ``environmentalists'', a very small percentage of \n     Americans, and not allowed us to provide for our own oil \n     needs. These foolish politicians have put us and our economy \n     in a very precarious position.\n       We need to pursue nuclear power and domestic drilling and \n     refining of petroleum and take control of providing for our \n     needs instead of relying on foreign volatile suppliers. If \n     Congress would pass just one piece of legislation to allow us \n     to drill and supply our own oil, our foreign suppliers would \n     drop prices immediately in fear that we will completely cut \n     them out of the loop someday. We do not need to continue any \n     ``food for fuel'' programs as you can see what that has done \n     to our economy and the food shortage in other parts of the \n     world.\n       Finally, please inform others in Congress that our country \n     is a capitalistic society and that oil companies deserve to \n     profit for the risks they take and the product they supply to \n     Americans. If anybody has received a ``windfall'' it is the \n     federal, and to a lesser degree state, government which \n     receives undeserved profits. They receive much more money \n     from the sale of gas in our country than the oil companies \n     and they have not done one thing for the money they get for \n     each gallon sold. The latest figures I have read were that \n     oil companies average 4 percent of profit from each gallon \n     sold while taxes account for 16 percent of each gallon sold.\n       Please understand that I am angered by this situation but \n     that anger is in no way directed at you. You have done a fine \n     job representing the views of us conservative Republicans in \n     Idaho. Keep up the good work.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robyn.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator,\n       I'm a fan of yours, as is my wife. We both have been \n     registered Democrats all our lives, but in the mid-term \n     election of 2006, we both re-registered as Independents so as \n     to distance ourselves from our party, as they seem to have \n     gone off the deep end. I remember when Democrats were proud \n     Americans. And though there are a few of us left, most of the \n     party of Rosie O'Donnell, Michael Moore, Al Franken, and \n     certain Senators and Congressmen (and women) are little more \n     than Socialists. And that is giving them the benefit of the \n     doubt. My wife and I both voted for Reagan, by the way, and \n     we will vote Republican till we see a difference in the far \n     left that has taken over our party. Who knows? We may be \n     registered Republicans before too long.\n       Enough about our distaste for the Democrat Party of today, \n     except to say that it seems voting on issues such as this go \n     down party lines, with even a few Republicans taking the \n     wrong side on issues such as energy, illegal immigration, and \n     homeland security which I consider to be one and the same.\n       We know there are many billions of barrels of crude off our \n     shores, but the Democrats keep us from drilling. There is \n     even more possibly in the Dakotas and Montana, not to mention \n     the shale oil out here in the West and the coal-to-oil or \n     coal-to-gas technology. All we have to do is start drilling \n     and build more refineries and the price of oil from OPEC will \n     drop drastically! I dropped out of college, but I know this, \n     so Washington should too. I do not know what is up with\n\n[[Page S6555]]\n\n     the Democrats, but they want the United States to fail in \n     every way, it seems!\n       Now, a little more about my wife and I. We are both \n     disabled after working hard all our lives and had a good \n     income till our disabilities set in. She went down first, and \n     I followed a few years later. God put us together for a \n     reason, I have to believe. It must be so we could lean on \n     each other. But needless to say we live on a small, fixed \n     income and, eight years ago, my wife's mother had to come and \n     live with us because she has Alzheimer's Disease. We got \n     along OK, I guess, till the gas prices shot up.\n       I remember 1973 and 1981. I know the prices go up and never \n     come back down to the point they were, even long after the \n     ``crisis'' is over. In ten or so years, it is possible we \n     could be self-sufficient as far as petroleum and natural gas \n     go. If we drill everywhere we can, build refineries to \n     process the crude, in 10-12 years, we could have gas prices \n     back to something where we could afford to eat.\n       Because it is not just the gas prices, it is everything \n     that has to be trucked or shipped by air. Airlines are going \n     belly up, we cannot afford to eat food that is good for us so \n     we have to go to a high starch, low protein diet which will \n     kill us quicker. The long term solution is other means and \n     other types of fuel. But in the short term, the NOW term, we \n     need to drill and I'll even say, having lived in Alaska for a \n     few years, if people knew how vast the 49th state is, they \n     would say ``Go right ahead, drill!'' Because it would not \n     hurt any animals, the pipeline could hook right up to the one \n     that already runs from Prudoe Bay to Valdez. It is simple \n     really, but Congress has always found a way to make it hard. \n     Our whole government seems to be ``out of touch'' with its \n     citizens' needs.\n       Did you know that ANWR is 700 miles from the nearest tree? \n     There is nothing there! But oil if we drill it. And we \n     wouldn't have to drill there if we drilled off shore, in the \n     Dakotas and Montana, used coal-to-oil technology. The ocean \n     floor pollutes more in seepage than drilling ever could \n     because we have ``green'' technology, and they do not shoot \n     up toward the skies anymore like the old black and white \n     movies always show it.\n       But these gas prices just kill people like my wife and \n     others in our situation. We get our fair share every month on \n     the third because we both started working when we were \n     teenagers (I was told this helped with the money part), and \n     my wife's mother is 71 and worked her whole life. But we are \n     still a family of three with kids who are grown, and six \n     wonderful grandchildren who we like to make sure their \n     birthdays and Christmases are filled with gifts from us that \n     cost money which we do not have. If I could afford a Prius, \n     I'd buy one! (maybe). But the fact is I have a '96 Plymouth \n     Voyager and that has to last me the rest of my life, \n     hopefully.\n       So I need lower gas prices and, as I ramble on here (you \n     invited me to--LOL), I know the solution and so do most of \n     the Republicans and even some Democrats, except they won't \n     let us drill. It seems that the parties have to follow like \n     lemmings and they just cannot think for themselves.\n       Other countries are drilling OUR oil right off our coasts! \n     They are, and I'll tell you how. They drill down and then \n     make a 60-90 degree turn and go under our waters and even \n     under our land and are going to get our oil while leasing \n     waters from Cuba! This, sir, makes me sick!!! If I were in \n     charge, I'd drill right through a polar bear's skull, if I \n     had to, to get at the oil that we have more of than Saudi \n     Arabia! We do! OK. Not really.\n       But the polar bear was put on the endangered species list, \n     when they have grown sixfold in number (where's the sense in \n     that?). There are five, six times as many polar bears now \n     than there were 255 years ago, and NOW they decide to put \n     them on the endangered species list? And merely to keep us \n     from drilling in Alaska. I'll close by saying this: Please \n     try to persuade all Republicans and any Democrats you know \n     that may come over to the common sense side of it all and \n     allow us to drill! That is the only way we will be energy \n     self-sufficient in the next ten years, unless Al Gore is \n     going to buy me an electric minivan.\n       And just a quick note: I do not know if I believe global \n     warming exists, but even more, I am pretty sure that, if it \n     does indeed exist, man is not responsible for it. I have \n     personally talked to scientists and saw an interview on the \n     ``Glenn Beck'' program with the founder of ``The Weather \n     Channel'' and he said that global warming or climate change \n     is the biggest hoax ever pulled on the American people and \n     the world! It is merely a cycle the earth goes through and if \n     you look back to about 60-70 years ago, you'd see the same \n     cycles and temperatures and storms, etc.\n       OK, Senator, I'm done. I hope you find time to personally \n     read this, because you are one of the good ones who seems to \n     be in touch with the people's needs, along with the country's \n     needs. You have always done a good job and, for the most \n     part, I like the way you vote.\n           Thank you,\n     Richard and Kelley.\n                                  ____\n\n       Now you are talking, Senator. . . . If more Senators and \n     Congress Representatives started asking the people to share \n     their thoughts, ideas, and struggles that we are all being \n     put through with this energy crisis, we could believe that \n     government really had our interest at heart, instead of just \n     their own. I have done a lot of research in past months, and \n     find it hard to understand with all the oil we have here in \n     our own country, and we know we have it. Why do we go \n     elsewhere for it and, literally, held ransom while someone \n     else profits?\n       And on another issue of being held hostage for energy, are \n     all these utility companies. We always hear on the news, how \n     much profit they made, and then how much more it is going to \n     cost us, ``We the People,'' for its use, and then they have \n     the gall to announce their big corporate raises. If we have \n     to suffer the higher costs, then they should also, by waiving \n     their raises until things are under control again. That is my \n     thought on this, as well as many others.\n       We are a family of four seniors on fixed incomes, all with \n     health issues. My mom is 85, bedridden. And my brother-in-law \n     is a three-time cancer survivor, a shell of a man. He served \n     two terms in Vietnam in the midst of Agent Orange and cannot \n     even get any veteran's compensation. His wife is his \n     caregiver, and she suffers horribly from fibromyalgia. I'm a \n     widow and a caregiver for my mom, who is also now a widow. We \n     have had to come together in order to survive. So we have to \n     watch carefully every penny we spend. We live 15 miles out of \n     town, and have to watch how many trips we take into town so \n     as not to waste gas. We have cut back to using one car, and \n     try to correlate our doctor visits and trips to the pharmacy. \n     And it still costs as much or more than it did using two cars \n     before the price gouging.\n       I am a lot more in tune to what is going on in this country \n     and how we are being treated by our own government. It is \n     really criminal to say the least. We, who have worked our \n     whole life paying into our system and serving our country in \n     loyalty, and with our lives, we deserve to be treated with \n     far more respect than we get. Senator, we know that this \n     system is working hard to take our sovereignty from us. We \n     are not stupid people; we see and read beyond what the system \n     wants us to know. Please be one of those who are on the side \n     of people, for our freedom of Constitutional rights.\n       Long live the United States of America, where our flag \n     flies with pride, and blood has been shed in her honor.\n           Respectfully,\n     Andrea.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo,\n       I manage an insurance agency with twenty independent \n     salespeople at Farm Bureau Insurance. I could give you quite \n     a few stories, but the one I am most familiar with is my son \n     that works for us. He is 35 years old and has triplets that \n     are two-and-one-half years old. He also has an eleven-year-\n     old and a nine-year-old, so he has a full house. His wife is \n     obviously now a stay-at-home mom, but the energy crunch along \n     with grocery inflation is absolutely devastating. He coaches \n     his Little League baseball traveling team and so between his \n     sales career, baseball, and running kids all over, his gas \n     bill alone is between $600 and $700 per month. With the \n     triplet children, the vehicle has to be a large, used SUV. \n     Couple that with his pick-up, and the gas mileage is not the \n     greatest! The larger vehicles, however, are a necessity. This \n     is just the icing on the cake when you also consider the \n     larger house that they now live in with increased utility \n     costs plus the inflated cost of groceries, especially milk. \n     It is time that we start drilling and looking for an \n     effective domestic energy policy and quit outsourcing on \n     energy to foreign soil. We sincerely hope that Congress does \n     something and soon, and that they develop a long term \n     comprehensive policy to prevent future similar crises.\n     Ron.\n                                  ____\n\n       To the powers that be:\n       I am a handicapped woman existing on my Social Security and \n     let me tell you, it only goes so far. I live outside of town \n     about six miles and granted, that is not a great distance, \n     but it adds up very fast. As you know, Social Security really \n     is not enough to live on, and now I am having to add in \n     outrageously high fuel prices for my furnace and car.\n       We live in the greatest nation, the richest nation and \n     still we are dependent on foreign fuel to meet our needs. Why \n     is that? We have the capacity to be so much more independent \n     and yet, the consumer, me, pays out and pays out until there \n     is nothing left. Will I be able to save any money to pay for \n     my burial? No, not at the rate things are going. It is a sad \n     commentary on the government when those who have not have to \n     take care of those that have. . . . sad, indeed.\n       It is time for government to be ``of the people'' once \n     again, and not out for their own individual gain.\n     Cindy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6555-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6555-S6556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            THILMANY PAPERS\n\n Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, today I recognize the 120th \nanniversary of State veterans' homes, SVHs.\n  Following the Civil War, a large number of newly disabled veterans \nstruggled to earn a living as they adjusted back to civilian life. \nWhile the Federal Government operated national homes for qualifying \nUnion volunteer soldiers, the total number of veterans in need of care \nwas overwhelming.\n  In order to meet this need, a number of States independently opened \nSVHs to care for those injured in service to their country. The first \nsuch home opened in Rocky Hill, CT, in 1864.\n  In August 1888, aware it had a responsibility to assist those who had \nso diligently and honorably served their country, Congress pledged \nFederal funding to assist with the operation of existing and future \nSVHs. This original $250,000 appropriation provided States with $100 \nper eligible veteran enrolled in an SVH to assist in providing needed \nsupport to those who could no longer care for themselves.\n  Over time, as the number of veterans requiring care increased, the \nFederal Government responded by providing the States with added \nassistance. With the establishment of the Veterans' Administration, VA, \nin 1930, SVHs were expanded to include three levels of care, and in \n1960, Congress established a per diem payment system to replace the \nannual appropriation and better reflect the funding needs of the \nNation's SVHs. Finally, in 1964, Congress initiated the State Home \nConstruction Grant Program, which provided further Federal assistance \nand created the opportunity for a dramatic increase in the quantity and \nquality of SVHs.\n  During this time, the National Association of State Veterans Homes, \nNASVH, was founded to promote legislation at the national level and \nincrease communication among the Nation's SVHs. In partnership with the \nVA, the NASVH continues to advocate in support of the country's needy \nveterans and has been instrumental in increasing per diem and other \nfunding rates.\n  Today, 120 years since the original appropriation, this State and \nFederal partnership has flourished. Currently, SVHs serve as one of the \ncountry's largest long-term care providers--offering approximately \n30,000 total beds at more than 130 SVHs nationwide. In a typical year, \nState veterans homes will furnish nearly 7 million days of nursing home \ncare and about 1.5 million days of domiciliary care.\n  In New Hampshire, veterans receive the highest quality of care under \nthe watchful eye of Commandant Barry Conway and his extremely capable \nstaff in Tilton. It is because of these dedicated men and women in New \nHampshire and around the country that our elder veteran community \nreceives the care they have earned and deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6556-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING AMBER MULDER\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to assist volunteer fire companies in coping with the \nprecipitous rise in fuel prices; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nalong with my colleagues Senator Sanders and Senator Mikulski, that \nwill provide immediate assistance to our Nation's volunteer \nfirefighters who have been severely affected by the rising cost of \ngasoline and diesel fuel. This bill, the Supporting America's Volunteer \nEmergency Services Act, or SAVES Act, will establish a new grant \nprogram at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to help \nqualifying volunteer fire companies cope with the strain that today's \ngas and diesel prices have put on their already tight operating \nbudgets. According to the United States Fire Administration, over \n22,141 fire companies, 89 percent of all fire companies in the United \nStates, are volunteer or majority volunteer companies. 39 percent of \nour country's population, some 117 million people, relies on these \nvolunteer forces to protect their homes and businesses. In recent \nmonths, I have heard from fire chiefs across Pennsylvania about the \neffect that high gas and diesel prices are having on their daily \noperations. Some have expressed serious concerns that fuel costs are \npreventing them from responding to emergency calls with the amount of \nequipment recommended by their National Fire Protection Association \nguidelines. This poses a serious risk to public safety. Congress has an \nobligation to address this issue, for we simply cannot afford to let \nhigh gas prices stand in the way of firefighters' ability to provide \nlocal families and businesses with the help they need.\n  I was lucky to have 6 fire chiefs from York County, Pennsylvania, on \nhand today to help me bring attention to this issue. These gentlemen, \nDeputy Chief Barry Emig of the York Area United Fire and Rescue, Deputy \nChief Joe Madzelan of the Manchester Township Fire Services, Chief \nWilliam Carlisle of the Fairview Township Fire Department, Assistant \nChief Trever Rentzel of the Manchester Union Fire Company, chief Tony \nMyers of the Shrewsbury Fire Department, and Chief John Senft of York \nCity Fire and Rescue, have helped me and others understand the impact \nthat high fuel prices have made on each of their departments' bottom \nline. I want to thank them for going above and beyond the call of duty \nto help me in this effort.\n  The program created under the SAVES Act would set a baseline gas and \ndiesel price using 2007 price data. Each year, volunteer companies that \nwished to participate would submit their annual fuel receipts. They \nwould then be eligible to receive 75 percent of the difference between \nhow much they paid for gas and diesel that year, and how much that same \namount of fuel would have cost at 2007 prices. This straightforward, \ncommonsense approach will help to ensure that volunteer fire companies \ndo not have to restrain their response to emergency calls.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues Senator Sanders and Senator \nMikulski for agreeing to serve as original cosponsors of this important \nlegislation. In addition, I appreciate the leadership of Congressman \nJason Altmire in offering companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will join me \nin helping to pass the SAVES Act immediately so that our volunteer fire \ncompanies can receive some much-needed relief on their next trip to the \npump.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3237\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting America's \n     Volunteer Emergency Services Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to the Federal Emergency Management \n     Administration, in 2006 there were--\n       (A) 807,150 volunteer firefighters, nearly 73 percent of \n     all active firefighters; and\n       (B) 19,915 all-volunteer fire companies nationwide, \n     servicing 22.6 percent of the population of the United States \n     and 4,105 companies comprised of a majority of volunteers, \n     servicing 16.3 percent of the population of the United \n     States.\n       (2) These volunteer companies, especially those serving \n     communities of fewer than 5,000 residents, rely heavily upon \n     fund-raising efforts and other potentially unreliable sources \n     of funding for their basic operating expenses.\n       (3) According to the Energy Information Administration, \n     between June 2003 and June 2008, the price of regular grade \n     gasoline and diesel fuels rose 171 percent and 229 percent, \n     respectively.\n       (4) These rising costs represent an unavoidable burden, and \n     have placed serious constraints on the ability of volunteer \n     companies to respond to fire emergencies.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF QUALIFIED VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``qualified volunteer fire \n     department'' has the same meaning given that term in section \n     150(e) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n[[Page S6562]]\n\n     SEC. 4.

Each department shall also provide a sum \n     total of the--\n       (A) aggregate number of gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel \n     purchased by the department during that calendar year; and\n       (B) costs of purchasing such gasoline and diesel fuel.\n       (2) Determination of subsidy amounts.--The Secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development shall reimburse a qualified \n     volunteer fire department for 75 percent of the difference \n     between--\n       (A) the actual expenditures of the department for gasoline \n     and diesel fuel for a calendar year as determined under \n     paragraph (1); and\n       (B) the amount that such expenditures would have cost had \n     the department determined such expenditures utilizing the \n     baseline fuels costs determined under subsection (a).\n       (3) Special rule relating to states sales tax.--If the \n     State in which a qualified volunteer fire department is \n     located does not charge local or State fuel taxes on such \n     departments when such departments purchase gasoline or diesel \n     fuel, the amount of such omitted sales tax shall be added \n     back in to any determination made under paragraph (2)(A).\n       (c) Regulations.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development shall promulgate such regulations as may be \n     necessary to implement and administer the grant and subsidy \n     programs authorized by this section.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Tester, Mr. Barrasso, \n        Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n        Salazar, and Mr. Nelson of Nebraska):\n  S. 3238. A bill to prohibit the importation of ruminants and swine, \nand fresh and frozen meat and products of ruminants and swine, from \nArgentina until the Secretary of Agriculture certifies to Congress that \nevery region of Argentina is free of foot and mouth disease without \nvaccination; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to discuss \na critically important issue to the livestock industry in South Dakota \nand across the United States, that being the United States Department \nof Agriculture's, USDA, proposal to regionalize Argentina for Foot-and-\nMouth Disease, or FMD. FMD is a highly contagious and airborne disease \naffecting ruminants and swine. The disease is so destructive that FMD \nis considered to be the most economically devastating of all livestock \ndiseases, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. An \noutbreak in Great Britain in 2001, for example, cost the economy nearly \n$20 billion and led to the slaughter of over 6 million animals. It is \nwith concern for the health and viability of our domestic cattle, \nsheep, and swine farmers and ranchers that Senator Enzi joins me today \nin introducing legislation to stop this fundamentally flawed proposal.\n  This legislation enjoys significant organizational support from our \nlivestock sector, including the American Sheep Industry Association, \nthe South Dakota Cattlemen's Association, R-CALF, the South Dakota \nStockgrowers Association, the U.S. Cattlemen's Association, the \nNational Farmers Union, the Western Organization of Resource Councils, \nand Dakota Rural Action. As a highly credible scientific and veterinary \nentity, a poll was take within the National Assembly of State Animal \nHealth Officials, NASAHO, and an overwhelming majority of respondents \nare opposed to regionalization of Argentina for FMB. Our South Dakota \nState Veterinarian and the President of NASAHO, Dr, Sam Holland, has \nbeen invaluable during this process and I thank him for his guidance \nand extensive expertise on this issue. The majority of veterinarians \nwithin NASAHO oppose regionalizing for FMD for a variety of reasons, \nand Dr. Holland relayed the following causes of concern from State \nveterinarians for USDA's proposed rule: Economic benefits do not \njustify the tremendous risk. Inability to effectively monitor risk. \nResources, biosecurity, and experience in monitoring freedom are \ninadequate. Regionalization for one of the world's most highly \ncontagious virus disease, FMD, is much more complicated than \nregionalization for tuberculosis, brucellosis and many other diseases. \nFMD virus is not only arguably the most contagious virus known for \nanimals, but also is particularly resilient in the environment and may \npersist in fomites and be transmitted by such through aerosol or \ncontact. Argentina has not experienced an extended timeframe of several \nyears of FMD freedom.\n  This bill would prohibit the importation of ruminants and swine and \nfresh or frozen ruminant and pork products from any region of Argentina \nuntil the United States Department of Agriculture can certify to \nCongress that Argentina is free of Foot and Mouth Disease without \nvaccination. While regionalization may be a viable option for other \nlivestock diseases, the extremely contagious nature and significant \neconomic impact of FMD dictates that we must treat countries as a \nwhole, and that a country must demonstrate its ability to remain free \nof FMD. While the USDA is moving to set a precedent with this rule \nregarding its protocol for FMD, this bill is a common sense response \nthat USDA's proposal is simply not good policy for American ranchers \nand farmers and for our domestic livestock herds.\n  Mr. ENZI. To my friend from South Dakota, I ask whether this \nlegislation would interfere with the current status of trade with \nproduct from countries with a presence of FMD?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. My friend from Wyoming raises an excellent question and \nI'm pleased to answer it. It is not our intention or the effect of this \nbill to disrupt the status quo, and our legislation would leave the \ncurrent state of trade intact. Our Code of Federal Regulations allows \nfor the importation of certain dried, cured or cooked product from \ncountries with a known presence of FMD. This bill will only prohibit \nproduct that poses a risk for disease transmission, including fresh, \nchilled or frozen, product or live animals.\n  Mr. ENZI. Another point of clarification would be why it is necessary \nto specify that no product or live animals should be imported until \nArgentina is free of FMD without vaccination. Can the Senator from \nSouth Dakota also discuss the intention of that prerequisite?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The Johnson-Enzi bill mandates that Argentina's FMD-free \nstatus must be achieved without vaccination. This is the acceptable \nstandard for trade and also ensures that the disease is truly \neradicated from the herd, and not suppressed or hidden. While this one \nregion in Argentina is thought to be FMD free, this one region within \nArgentina and Argentina as a whole is surrounded by the presence of \nFMD, while the United States has been free of FMD since 1929 and is \nfree of FMD without vaccination. Additionally, the United States shares \nborders with our FMD-free neighbors, who are certified as free without \nvaccination.\n  As discussed by NASAHO, Argentina has, quite simply, failed to remain \nfree of FMD for any length of time, which is a basic component to \nproving the continuity and adequacy of Argentina's infrastructure. As \nrecently as 2001, Argentina experienced an FMD outbreak that it failed \nto report for months. This raises serious questions about Argentina's \napproach to communication about this disease in the future, and I don't \nfeel that these questions have been adequately answered at this time.\n  I thank Senator Enzi and the organizations who have dedicated their \ntime and support for this measure, and I will continue to work with my \ncolleague from Wyoming in the best interest of our American farmers and \nranchers.\n\n[[Page S6563]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I am pleased to support this bill with my colleague from \nSouth Dakota. My friend has done an excellent job of explaining how \nthis legislation is an important safeguard for our livestock producers, \nand I would like to add a few comments about the continued need for \nvigilance when it comes to animal health threats. A wide range of \nveterinary professionals and livestock producers recognize the threat \nthat Foot-and-Mouth Disease poses to the U.S. livestock industry. If \nthe United States is to continue producing and selling the highest \nquality meat products in the world, our country must be free of the \nmost dangerous ailments that affect the livestock which enter the \nmarket.\n  The economic threat Foot-and-Mouth Disease poses to our country \ncannot be underestimated. Disease outbreaks threaten the livelihood of \nour nation's ranchers and undermine foreign markets for our meat \nproducts. One can only look to the economic damage Foot-and-Mouth \nDisease caused to Britain in 2001 to gauge how significant this threat \nis to the United States. The highly contagious nature of this disease \nand the growing international trade of livestock equate the \nregionalization of Foot-and-Mouth Disease in Argentina to mixing fire \nwith gasoline. I am glad that my colleague mentioned how Foot-and-Mouth \nDisease is unique and that regionalization would not work with this \ndisease as it has with other animal ailments.\n  Our cattle, sheep, and swine already face a number of animal health \nchallenges and now is not the time to open up our country to new \ndiseases. Requiring Argentina to be FMD free without using vaccination \nis not asking too much. This is the same condition the United States \nand our neighbors already operate under in the trade of livestock. This \nbill, respected by a large number of state veterinary officials, \nrecognizes this threat and ensures that the proper safeguards remain in \nplace to prevent Foot-and-Mouth Disease from reaching our shores.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3238\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Box 339--San Lucas, CA 93954\n\n       USCA (July 10, 2008)--The U.S. Cattlemen's Association \n     (USCA) today hailed the introduction of legislation in the \n     U.S. Senate that would block meat shipments from Argentina \n     until that country is free of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD), \n     an airborne livestock disease that is devastating to \n     livestock production.\n       Senator Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Senator Mike Enzi (R-WY) \n     introduced the Foot and Mouth Disease Prevention Act of 2008, \n     which would add common sense to a proposal by the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture (USDA) that would allow importation \n     of Argentine fresh and prepackaged beef, lamb and other meat \n     from select regions of Argentina, as well as live animals.\n       ``Cattlemen from across the country appreciate Senator \n     Johnson and Senator Enzi along with the other co-sponsors of \n     this important legislation,'' said Jon Wooster, a California \n     rancher and USCA president. ``We're calling it the `Keep \n     America FMD-Free bill'.''\n       Wooster explained that an outbreak of FMD within the U.S. \n     cattle industry would bring livestock commerce to a \n     standstill overnight and would likely result in the \n     depopulation of millions of cattle, hogs, lambs, goats and \n     wildlife.\n       The American Veterinary Medical Association has deemed FMD \n     the most economically devastating of all livestock disease. A \n     recent study by Kansas State University found that an \n     outbreak of FMD would cost the State of Kansas alone nearly \n     $1 billion.\n       ``Despite the risks, the Department of Agriculture \n     continues to consider the implementation of a regionalized \n     beef trade plan with Argentina,'' noted Wooster. ``FMD is an \n     airborne disease that will not stop at an imaginary border \n     controlled by a foreign nation. Argentina has proven time and \n     time again that it does not have America's best interests at \n     heart. This is a country that has attacked U.S. agriculture \n     in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and has intentionally \n     turned its back on, and still refuses to pay, billions in \n     U.S. loans despite U.S. court judgments mandating it do so.'' \n     .\n       Senators Tim Johnson (D-SD) and Mike Enzi (R-WY) along with \n     Senators Jon Tester (D-MT), John Barrasso (R-WY), Claire \n     McCaskill (D-MO), Pete Domenici (R-NM), Byron Dorgan (D-ND), \n     Ken Salazar (D-CO), and Wayne Allard (R-CO) are co-sponsors \n     of the Foot and Mouth Disease Prevention Act of 2008. USCA \n     has worked diligently to maintain import standards that will \n     keep the U.S. cattle industry on the offensive rather than \n     the defensive when it comes to controlling the introduction \n     of foreign animal disease into the U.S.\n       ``We will continue to work on moving this bill forward by \n     adding co-sponsors and garnering support both on Capitol Hill \n     and in the country. USCA is firmly resolved to ensuring the \n     U.S. cattle industry is protected by the highest import \n     standards possible, and to seeing that the `Keep America FMD-\n     Free' bill becomes law,'' said Wooster.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       National Farmers Union,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2008.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: On behalf of the family farmers, \n     ranchers and rural residents of National Farmers Union (NFU), \n     I write in strong support of your legislation to prohibit the \n     importation of Argentine ruminants, swine, fresh and frozen \n     meat, and products from ruminants and swine until the U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary certifies the \n     country Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) free. I applaud your \n     leadership to ensure all measures are employed to protect the \n     American livestock industry and consumer confidence in our \n     meat supply.\n       The ban proposed in your legislation is necessary in order \n     to prevent jeopardizing our own efforts to eradicate \n     livestock diseases, and thereby protecting the food supply. \n     Your legislation enhances food safety through requiring every \n     region of Argentina to be FMD-free without vaccination before \n     exporting ruminants, swine and meat products to the United \n     States.\n       FMD is a highly infectious virus that, if introduced into \n     the United States, could contaminate entire herds and leave \n     producers in financial ruin, as infected herds must be culled \n     to prevent the spread of the disease. FMD is so devastating \n     the American Veterinary Medical Association considers it to \n     be the most economically destructive of all livestock \n     diseases. The United States suffered nine outbreaks of FMD in \n     the early twentieth century, but has been FMD-free since \n     1929. According to USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection \n     Service, the economic impacts of a re-occurrence of FMD in \n     the United States could cost the economy billions of dollars \n     in the first year alone.\n       America's family farmers and ranchers produce the safest, \n     most abundant food supply in the world. FMD presents a very \n     real threat to American agriculture and its introduction into \n     the United States can and must be prevented. Requiring a \n     country like Argentina, with such an apparent problem with \n     this devastating disease, to prove FMD-free status is an \n     acceptable standard to trade. Opening our borders to \n     Argentine ruminant products is a risk that American producers \n     simply cannot afford. Your legislation is needed to ensure \n     harmful products are not allowed into the United States and \n     that Argentina is not an exception to the rule.\n       I thank you for introducing this important legislation, and \n     look forward to working with you to ensure its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Tom Buis,\n                                President, National Farmers Union.\n\n[[Page S6564]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                        R-CALF United Stockgrowers\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                       Billings, MT, July 3, 2008.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson, On behalf of the thousands of cattle-\n     producing members of R-CALF USA located throughout the United \n     States, we greatly appreciate and strongly support your \n     legislation to prohibit the importation of certain animals \n     and animal products from Argentina until every region of \n     Argentina is free of foot and mouth disease without \n     vaccination.\n       Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is recognized internationally \n     as one of the most contagious diseases of cloven-hoofed \n     animals and it bears the potential to cause severe economic \n     losses to U.S. cattle producers. Your legislation recognizes \n     that the most effective prevention measure against this \n     highly contagious disease is to ensure that it is not \n     imported into the United States from countries where FMD is \n     known to exist or was recently detected.\n       R-CALF USA stands ready to assist you in building both \n     industry and congressional support for this important, \n     disease-prevention measure. Thank you for initiating this \n     needed legislation to protect the U.S. cattle industry from \n     the unnecessary and potentially dangerous exposure to FMD \n     from Argentinean imports.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 R.M. Thornsberry,\n     President, R-CALF USA Board of Directors.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      South Dakota\n\n\n                                      Cattlemen's Association,\n\n                                        Pierre, SD, July 10, 2008.\n     Senator Tim Johnson,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC\n     Senator Mike Enzi,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Johnson and Enzi: I am writing on behalf of \n     the 1,000 beef producer members of the South Dakota \n     Cattlemen's Association (SDCA) to express support for the \n     Foot and Mouth Disease Prevention Act of 2008. SDCA supports \n     free and fair trade based on OIE standards that will protect \n     the health of our cattle herd and the economic livelihood of \n     our cattlemen.\n       Our top trade priority is to regain market access for U.S. \n     beef in order to recapture the lost value of exports that \n     occurred after the occurrence of BSE in 2003. To that end, \n     we've worked closely with elected and regulatory officials to \n     ensure adequate measures are taken to protect our herd health \n     and maintain consumer confidence in U.S. beef.\n       In light of numerous unanswered questions regarding the \n     status of Foot and Mouth Disease in Argentina, we believe \n     passage of the Foot and Mouth Disease Prevention Act is \n     critical to ensure this devastating disease doesn't enter the \n     U.S. cattle herd through the importation of Argentine cattle \n     and beef products. We commend your willingness to stand up \n     for South Dakota's beef producers and look forward to working \n     with you on this important issue.\n           Regards,\n                                                    Jodie Hickman,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   South Dakota Farmers Union,\n\n                                Huron, South Dakota, July 9, 2008.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: On behalf of the family farmers and \n     ranchers of the South Dakota Farmers Union (SDFU), I write to \n     express support of your legislation The Foot and Mouth \n     Disease Prevention Act of 2008 to require the U.S. Department \n     of Agriculture (USDA) to prevent the importation of livestock \n     from Argentina until the USDA can certify that Argentina is \n     free of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) without vaccination.\n       As you know, the possibility of the importing live animals \n     and fresh meat with FMD would put our herds at risk and cause \n     an economic hardship for our producers. The devastation that \n     FMD can cause was seen first hand in England in 2001. SDFU \n     fears that a similar situation would have severe economic \n     consequences not only for producers in our state but \n     nationwide. Your legislation is a proactive measure that will \n     insure that this does not occur. As a result, until USDA \n     certifies that Argentina is free of FMD, the importation of \n     live stock and meat product should not be allowed. We owe it \n     to both producers and consumers to protect their livestock \n     herd and provide a safe food product.\n       SDFU fully supports your legislation to require USDA to \n     certify Argentina free of FMD. I look forward to working with \n     you and your colleagues for a quick passage of this important \n     legislation to help protect American livestock producers and \n     consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Doug Sombke,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 3239. A bill to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from \nissuing new Federal oil and gas leases to holders of existing leases \nwho do not diligently develop the land subject to the existing leases \nor relinquish the leases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to talk about the strong \nconcerns I am hearing back home about gas and diesel prices and about a \nbill I am introducing today in response to those concerns.\n  We all know that over the past 12 months, the price of a gallon of \ngas has risen over a dollar, from around $3 last year to over $4 today. \nDiesel has increased from $2.91 a year ago to $4.72 per gallon today.\n  At the listening sessions I hold in every county of my State each \nyear, Wisconsinites are, of course, talking about how those soaring oil \nprices are hurting their pocketbooks. And it is not just at the pump. \nThey are feeling the pain also at the grocery store, on the farm, and \nat the ticket counter. Those high fuel prices are having a rippling \neffect throughout our entire economy. Wisconsinites, like Americans all \naround the country, are feeling squeezed. With no relief in sight, the \nanxiety and tension keep building. Americans are emotionally, \nphysically, and financially drained. My colleague from Minnesota, \nSenator Klobuchar, had it right when she stated that Americans are \nrunning on empty.\n  Here is what I am hearing from Wisconsinites. One constituent told \nme:\n\n       I have done everything I can to use as little gas as \n     possible, even before prices got so high. My two-parent \n     family (with two children) has only one car. I ride my \n     bicycle or walk to work and use the car as little as \n     possible. However, the rising cost of fuel is causing higher \n     prices for food and other necessities which are becoming more \n     difficult for my family and others.\n\n  From another parent:\n\n       I have an adorable child I am trying to raise on a budget \n     that no longer reaches from paycheck to paycheck. I currently \n     work an hour away from where I live as the jobs are not \n     available in [my] area. Between the rising price of gas, \n     electric/heat and food, my husband and I can barely pay our \n     mortgage.\n\n  I have heard from many others who are struggling as they care for \nelderly parents. One lady has a mother in a nursing home, and she used \nto visit her three times a week. However, with the nursing home 20 \nmiles away and high fuel prices, now she can only afford to visit her \nmother once a week. That, to me, is a very poignant example--one of so \nmany examples--of the real human impact these gas prices have.\n  Even those who have managed their money well and have saved are \nstruggling. One constituent commented that he had planned to put extra \nmoney toward retirement and pay down debt. With the high fuel prices, \nhe does not have any extra money and is worried that he will end up on \ngovernment assistance at the age of 57.\n  There are more letters and more e-mails and more phone calls. The \nhigh cost of driving affects all kinds of people and livelihoods. It \naffects kids whose parents cannot drive them across town to a friend's \nhouse or to soccer practice because they have to conserve gas to get to \nwork. It affects young students and senior citizens who are on fixed \nincomes. Small businesses are finding they need to increase prices to \ncover increased transportation costs. Farmers are, of course, feeling \nthe pinch in one way or another, whether it be fertilizer or fuel or \ntransportation or feed for livestock and dairy farmers.\n\n  All over the country, people have resorted to alternative forms of \ntransportation in an effort to escape these costs. There is a range of \npositive proposals to improve systems in Wisconsin from the Kenosha-\nRacine-Milwaukee commuter rail, extending Amtrak to Madison, or just \nadding buses or routes. While I strongly support long-term plans to \ninvest in mass transit, I also recognize that at least for the time \nbeing in many parts of Wisconsin and in this country, it is unrealistic \nfor many to rely on mass transportation. Commuting to work, be it \nacross a large city or between two towns, is a gas- and dollar-guzzling \ntask that many people cannot avoid or, increasingly, afford.\n  For the large number of Americans living in predominantly rural \nareas, this is especially challenging due to the typically longer trips \nand fewer transportation options. So Wisconsinites want to know: When \nis the Federal Government going to provide some relief?\n  With my support, Congress has made some progress. Last December we \nenacted energy legislation, H.R. 6, that\n\n[[Page S6565]]\n\nraises corporate average fuel economy standards for vehicles while \nprotecting American jobs. It also increases the requirement for \nalternative fuels from 8.5 billion gallons in 2008 to 36 billion \ngallons in 2022. I also recently cosponsored an amendment to make the \nFederal Government stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which \nis 97 percent full. Fortunately, Congress passed this legislation, and \nthe administration finally agreed to stop taking oil off the market to \nstore it underground. The bill, H.R. 6022, was signed into law in May.\n  We also made some progress in preventing market manipulation. I \ncosponsored the Oil and Gas Traders Oversight Act, S. 577, which would \nhelp ensure that the previously unregulated trading commodities are \nsubject to greater Federal oversight by requiring the reporting of \ntrades, and then a similar provision was included in the final version \nof the farm bill which was recently enacted.\n  These are positive steps, but much more needs to be done. So today I \nam introducing legislation that seeks to answer a question more and \nmore Americans are asking, which is: Why aren't the oil companies \ndeveloping 66 million acres of land that they are already leasing from \nthe U.S. Government? Those same companies, and some of my colleagues, \nsay we need to open more Federal lands to drilling. Well, I guess I \nwould like to know then why the oil companies are not producing on most \nof the Federal lands they already have under lease.\n  At a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, I actually had the \nchance to ask the top five oil executives in the country just that \nquestion, and it was incredible. They couldn't come up with any good \nexplanation at all. In fact, one of the executives told me they have \nthe manpower and the infrastructure to put all of their existing leases \nof Federal lands into oil production.\n  I find this troubling. No one is talking about pulling oil out of a \nhat, but with 75 percent of currently leased Federal lands and waters \nnot producing oil and gas, Congress needs to insist on some \naccountability on this point. This is why today I am introducing the \nResponsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act. This bill says if oil and \ngas companies want to lease additional lands, they must either be \nproducing or diligently developing their existing Federal leases, or \nthey have to give up those leases. This way, if a company makes the \nbusiness decision to terminate or not pursue exploration, then the \nlease will be made available to other companies who might actually \ndrill or figure out a way to get some oil out of this land. This is a \nresponsible way to increase production and keep the private sector \naccountable for production.\n  So with over 100 billion barrels of oil under Federal lands and \nwaters that are being leased or are available for leasing, Congress \nmust properly encourage their development, and oil companies should use \nthe land they already have before coming to Congress, hat in hand, \nasking for more land.\n  This bill is similar to legislation introduced by Representative \nRahall which the House considered last month. I will work to make sure \nthe Senate follows their lead. I am also cosponsoring a bill introduced \nby my colleague who is on the Senate floor, my good friend Senator \nDodd, that encourages oil companies to utilize the land they have been \ngranted by making them pay fees on land under lease but not in \nproduction.\n  There are a number of other steps Congress should take, including \naddressing the role of excess speculation in the energy futures market \nand clamping down on OPEC's price fixing. I am a cosponsor of S. 879, \nwhich would authorize the Justice Department and the FTC to sue foreign \ncountries under U.S. antitrust law for limiting the supply or fixing \nthe price of oil. Also, of course, we need to aggressively pursue \nalternative fuels, efficiency, and renewable energy because the facts \nshow that even if we drilled every corner of the country, and offshore \ntoo, that wouldn't solve our energy problems.\n  In the long term, the Government's Energy Information Administration \nreports that opening more Outer Continental Shelf regions to drilling \n``would not have a significant impact on domestic crude and natural oil \ngas production or prices before 2030,'' nor will it significantly \naffect prices after 2030, the agency reports, ``because oil prices are \ndetermined on the international market.'' In short, the facts are \ntelling us that we simply cannot just drill our way out of this, and \nmore drilling does not necessarily mean lower prices at the pump.\n  Unfortunately, a minority of Senators have repeatedly blocked efforts \nto expand renewables and address price gouging and excess energy market \nspeculation. I sincerely hope we can get beyond this partisan \nbickering. My constituents don't want finger-pointing or name calling; \nthey want some relief, and they deserve it. They also deserve to know \nthat we are pressing forward on plans that embrace a new energy future.\n  Thirty years ago, our Nation was rattled by our reliance on oil. If I \nam still here in 30 years, for the sake of my constituents, I hope we \nwill have succeeded at diversifying our energy uses and oil does not \nstill have a stranglehold over our citizens and the economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. \n        Kerry):\n  S. 3245. A bill to increase public confidence in the justice system \nand address any unwarranted racial and ethnic disparities in the \ncriminal process; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Constitution guarantees all Americans \nthe right to the equal protection of the law. Nowhere is the guarantee \nof equal protection more important than in our criminal justice system. \nIn a criminal justice system that imprisons a record 2.3 million, even \nthe perception of bias on the basis of race, ethnicity, or any other \nprotected class is unacceptable and should be guarded against at all \ncosts.\n  Unfortunately, studies, reports, and case law from the last several \nyears have documented racial disparities during many of the stages of \nthe criminal justice system--law enforcement contact with a suspect, \narrest, charging, plea bargaining, jury selection, and sentencing. \nNowhere are the effects of these racial disparities more evident than \nin our prisons. By some estimates, nearly three-quarters of prisoners \nin the United States are either African-American or Hispanic. One of \nevery three African-American men born today can expect to go to prison \nin his lifetime. These numbers, and studies and reports that show \nsimilar disparities during other stages of the criminal justice \nprocess, engender a crisis of public trust in the integrity of our \ncriminal justice system and raise the possibility that we are failing \nto make good on the constitutional promise of equal protection.\n  Both the reality and the perception of inappropriate disparate \ntreatment of minorities in the justice system erode respect for the law \nand undermine public safety.\n  Communities become increasingly reluctant to report crimes to and \ncooperate with police and prosecutors. They become reluctant to \nparticipate in juries and, when they do participate, to vote for \nconviction where the defendant is a minority. To fulfill the promise of \nthe Constitution, and to effectively fight crime and deliver impartial \njustice, it is essential to identify and address unjustified \ndisparities in the criminal justice system.\n  The Justice Integrity Act establishes a pilot program within the \nJustice Department to identify and eliminate unjustified disparities in \nthe administration of justice. Ten U.S. Attorneys designated by the \nAttorney General will each appoint and chair an advisory group, \ncomposed of Federal and State prosecutors and defenders, private \ndefense counsel, Federal and State judges, correctional officers, \nvictims' rights representatives, Civil Rights organizations, business \nrepresentatives and faith-based organizations engaged in criminal \njustice work.\n  The advisory group will systematically gather and examine data \nregarding the criminal process in its district and seek to determine \nthe causes of any racial or ethnic disparity. The advisory group will \nproduce a report on its findings and recommend a plan to reduce any \nunwarranted racial and ethnic disparities and thereby increase public \nconfidence in the criminal justice system. The U.S. Attorney will \nconsider the advisory group's recommendations and adopt a plan and\n\n[[Page S6566]]\n\nsubmit a report to the Attorney General. At the end of the pilot \nprogram, the Attorney General will produce a comprehensive report to \nCongress on the results of the pilot program in all ten districts and \nrecommend best-practices.\n  The Justice Integrity Act has been endorsed by the National Criminal \nJustice Association, The Sentencing Project, the American Bar \nAssociation, and a number of former United States Attorneys. I am proud \nto introduce this important bill with the support of my colleagues and \nfriends--Senators Arlen Specter, John Kerry, and Ben Cardin. We urge \nother members to join us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3245\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Justice Integrity Act of \n     2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the pursuit of justice requires the fair application of \n     the law;\n       (2) racial and ethnic disparities in the criminal process \n     have contributed to a growing perception of bias in the \n     criminal justice system;\n       (3) there are a variety of possible causes of disparities \n     in criminal justice statistics among racial and ethnic groups \n     and these causes may differ throughout the United States, \n     including factors such as--\n       (A) varying levels of criminal activity among racial and \n     ethnic groups and legitimate law enforcement response to that \n     criminal activity; and\n       (B) racial discrimination, ethnic and cultural \n     insensitivity, or unconscious bias;\n       (4) the Nation would benefit from an understanding of all \n     factors causing a disparate impact on the criminal justice \n     system; and\n       (5) programs that promote fairness will increase public \n     confidence in the criminal justice system, increase public \n     safety, and further the pursuit of justice.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to set the standard mileage rate for use \nof a passenger automobile for purposes of the charitable contributions \ndeduction; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, the Fair \nDeal for Volunteers Act. In today's economic climate, Americans need \nrelief from sky-rocketing oil and gas prices. This applies to everyone, \nincluding people who engage in much-needed volunteer work. My bill will \nprovide immediate relief for volunteers serving our elderly, poor, \nfrail, and at-risk Americans. It gives the Internal Revenue Service \nauthority to change the mileage rate--currently set by statute at 14 \ncents per mile--for calculating the deductible cost of operating a \nvehicle for charitable purposes. We can't let an out-of-date mileage \nrate exacerbate the pinch at the pump for volunteers who selflessly \nprovide so many vital goods and services in every community across \nAmerica. I'm pleased that the senior Senator from Maine, Senator Snowe, \nand my colleague, the senior Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, \nare original cosponsors of this bill and I thank them for their \nsupport.\n  The Internal Revenue Code does not fix a rate for individuals who are \nrequired to use their own vehicle for work, or for individuals taking a \nmileage deduction for moving purposes. The IRS is able to increase the \ndeduction amount for these purposes to reflect the current economic \nclimate and dramatically higher fuel prices. This is exactly what the \nIRS recently did.\n  As of July, the IRS modified the standard mileage rates for computing \nthe deductible costs of operating an automobile for business, medical, \nor moving expenses. The revised standard mileage rate for business \npurposes increased from 50.5 cents per mile to 58.5 cents. For medical \nand moving expenses, the IRS increased the rate from 19 cents per mile \nto 27 cents per mile. I think the Nation's volunteers who travel on \nbehalf of charitable organizations deserve an increase in their mileage \nrate, too.\n  My bill gives the IRS flexibility in setting the rate so that \nvolunteers for charitable organizations could be given the same tax \nbenefit accruing for moving, medical, and business expenses. In today's \nclimate of increasing food and fuel prices, this bill will help relieve \nsome of the pressure on charitable organizations and their volunteers.\n  Take Meals on Wheels, for example. This organization delivers \nnutritious meals and other nutrition services to men and women who are \nelderly, homebound, disabled, frail, or otherwise at-risk. The services \nMeals on Wheels provides significantly improve the recipients' quality \nof life and health, and often help to postpone institutionalization.\n  Over the past year, there has been nearly a 20 percent increase in \nfuel and food prices, coupled with reduced government funding and fewer \ndonations across the country. Nearly 60 percent of the estimated 5,000 \nprograms that operate under the auspices of the Meals on Wheels \nAssociation of America have lost volunteers, in large part because it \nis too expensive for the volunteers to drive back and forth. Nearly \nhalf the programs have eliminated routes or consolidated meal services. \nAbout 38 percent of the programs have switched to delivering frozen \nmeals, and about 30 percent are cutting personal visits from 5 days a \nweek to one.\n  In Maryland, the Central Maryland Meals on Wheels has experienced an \nincrease of 7 percent in food costs and suppliers are charging higher \ndelivery fees. The cost to fill up the vans with gas has increased. \nFuel costs averaged $72,538.70 in fiscal year 2007; this year, the \ncosts have jumped to $86,790.63. This is an organization with \nvolunteers serving over 3,100 elderly, disabled, frail and at-risk \nMarylanders. Its volunteers deserve relief from high gas prices just as \nmuch as people who use their car for work or for medical purposes or \nfor moving.\n  Throughout the United States, Meals on Wheels served over 3 million \npeople and more than 250 million meals in fiscal year 2006. This is \njust one of thousands of charitable organizations. We need to encourage \nand support the Meals on Wheels volunteers and all other volunteers who \nneed their cars to help their neighbors and communities. The Fair Deal \nfor Volunteers Act will do just that, and I hope my colleagues will \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Deal for Volunteers Act \n     of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF STANDARD MILEAGE RATE FOR CHARITABLE \n                   CONTRIBUTIONS DEDUCTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (i) of section 170 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to standard mileage \n     rate for use of passenger automobile) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(i) Standard Mileage Rate for Use of Passenger \n     Automobile.--For purposes of computing the deduction under \n     this section for use of a passenger automobile, the standard \n     mileage rate shall be the rate determined by the \n     Secretary.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to miles traveled after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 3248. A bill to amend the Commodity Exchange Act to clarify \ntreatment of purchases of certain commodity futures contracts and \nfinancial instruments with respect to limits established by the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission relating to excessive speculation, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nCommodity Speculation Reform Act of 2008, with my colleague Senator \nCollins, the ranking minority member of our Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. The legislation is designed to wring \nout of the commodity markets the excessive speculation--and I stress \nthe word ``excessive''--that we believe has helped lead to the sudden \nand soaring spikes in the prices Americans pay for food and energy.\n  We are going to do this by returning the commodity markets to what \nthey\n\n[[Page S6568]]\n\nwere meant to be--a place where producers and consumers of specific \ncommodities can enter into futures contracts that help hedge the risks \nof price fluctuations common to their industries.\n  These commodity market traders--farmers, airlines, refineries--\nactually intend to produce or take delivery of specific commodities as \npart of doing business.\n  On the other hand, financial speculators, including pension funds, \nuniversity endowments, and other large institutional investors, have \npoured billions and billions of dollars into these markets over the \npast 5 years betting on rising prices--and let's make it clear, that \nthese are bets--without ever intending to actually own a barrel of oil \nor a bushel of corn. They are looking for nothing more than paper \nprofits.\n  In a series of hearings held by our Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, we heard testimony that this kind of \nexcessive speculation in the commodity markets may have added as much \nas $40 to $60 to the cost of a barrel of oil.\n  Some say these figures are too high. But I would say that even a \nsingle dollar increase due to excessive speculation is a dollar too \nmuch because of the inflationary effect it can have not only on the \nU.S. economy, but around the world.\n  Consider this: according to the Air Transport Association, every $1 \nincrease in the price of a barrel of crude oil adds $470 million a year \nin jet fuel costs--almost half a billion dollars--to the U.S. airline \nindustry. These costs are passed on to consumers in the forms of higher \nticket prices and other surcharges that are now keeping potential \npassengers on the ground and has the industry reeling.\n  These increases directly hit consumers in the global economy through \nhigher gas and food prices. Moreover, the negative effects of commodity \nprice inflation ripple through the economy as the high cost of energy \nand raw materials weakens our manufacturing base, and the high cost \nassociated with transporting goods impedes international trade.\n  The profits made by the speculators do not produce one new barrel of \noil, put one new acre of farmland into production, put one new mine \ninto operation, or add one new gallon of refinery capacity.\n  If speculators really want to invest in commodities, they can buy \nstock in an energy company or an agricultural firm. They can purchase \nthe royalty rights to land. Any of these options would benefit from \nmarket trends related to commodity prices and would also bring needed \ninvestment into means of production that would increase supplies and \neventually contribute to lower commodity prices.\n  Unfortunately, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has ignored \nthe urgent task of providing our front line defense against rampant and \nunmanaged speculation. To this day, the Commission has yet to recognize \nthat speculation affects commodity prices.\n  Instead, the Commission has delegated much of its regulatory \nauthority to the for-profit exchanges. Moreover, in contradiction with \nCongress's original legislative intent, the Commission views its \nmission as confined to a single purpose--preventing market \nmanipulation. On the contrary, Congress fully intended the Commission \nto regulate market manipulation AND excessive speculation.\n  Our bill effectively closes the door to excessive speculation, but in \na rational and reasonable way by, in effect, perfecting current law. \nFirst, it requires the CFTC to consider the overall effect of \nspeculation when it sets the position limits that restrict the amount \nthat any one investor can invest in a commodity. This is a critical and \nnecessary change--if the Commission does not acknowledge and embrace \nits obligation to prevent excessive speculation, all of our efforts \nwill be in vain.\n  Second, it extends the existing rules that apply to the regulated \nexchanges to currently unregulated over-the-counter and foreign \nmarkets. Over the last 10 years, over-the-counter trading in \ncommodities has exploded. The over-the-counter investment vehicles are \nsimply economic substitutes for futures contracts. There is no rational \nreason that they should not be subject to the same laws and regulations \nthat apply to futures contracts.\n  This change also eliminates the ``swaps loophole'' that allows \npension funds and other large investors to invest in index funds that \ncircumvent the position limits. From 2003 to 2008, investment in \ncommodity index funds has swelled from $13 billion to $260 billion and \nhas, in effect, chased up prices and taken control of the commodity \nmarkets away from the industries and producers that must use them as a \nmeans of doing business.\n  Other important provisions would direct that the speculative position \nlimits must be set by the CFTC, not the futures exchanges, and repeal \nthe CFTC's authority to substitute meaningless reporting requirements \nfor actual speculative position limits.\n  In the course of our Committee hearings and in later deliberations we \nlooked at a number of legislative options, including banning certain \nlarge investors, such as pension funds, from the commodity markets \naltogether.\n  But we feel the approach we've come up with in this bill is a \nreasonable, commonsense approach that will help bring order back to the \ncommodity markets while preserving the liquidity it needs to function \nproperly.\n  Some have suggested that Congressional action will simply push \ninvestors to foreign markets. Our bill actually discourages flight from \nthe major exchanges because it puts all trading platforms under the \nsame regulatory umbrella. Speculators are subject to the same position \nlimits regardless of whether they invest in New York, London, Dubai, or \nover-the-counter.\n  Is excessive speculation the sole cause of rising prices? Of course \nnot. Global economic growth, particularly in emerging nations like \nChina and India, has put tremendous upward pressure on the prices of \nenergy, food and raw materials.\n  But there is little doubt--even among most skeptics of our \nlegislation--that excessive speculation has had an effect on rising \nprices. Our bill will end that and help create a more orderly market \nfor the industries and producers who must deal in commodities as a \nmatter of business.\n  The father of modern capitalism, Adam Smith, overall wanted to limit \nthe role of government in free markets. In fact, in ``The Wealth of \nNations'' Smith said speculators served many useful functions in a free \nmarket and many of his observations are still true today.\n  But Smith knew there had to be limits, writing: ``those exertions of \nthe natural liberty of a few individuals, which may endanger the \nsecurity of the whole society, are, and ought to be, restrained by the \nlaws of all governments.''\n  With this bill we seek that kind of restraint so that the few don't \ngain exorbitant profits at the expense of the average American reeling \nunder spiraling prices for food and fuel.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3248\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

However, the position limits no longer serve their \n     original purpose. Large institutional investors, such as \n     pension funds, can circumvent the position limits by \n     investing in over-the-counter markets. Through a regulatory \n     ``swaps'' loophole, financial institutions that serve the \n     over-the-counter markets also circumvent the position limits.\n       The bill will reduce excessive speculation by closing the \n     swaps loophole and eliminating the exemptions that apply to \n     investors that are not taking physical delivery of food and \n     energy commodities. The bill applies the position limits if \n     the position is not\n\n[[Page S6570]]\n\n     related to a bona fide hedging activity. The bill \n     incorporates the CFTC's definition of bona fide hedging, but \n     clarifies that it does not include hedging financial risks \n     associated with over-the-counter derivatives, such as swaps \n     and structured notes.\n       In the evolving commodity marketplace, trading is \n     increasingly occurring in unregulated over-the-counter \n     markets or overseas. By extending the position limits to \n     holdings regardless of where they are held, the position \n     limits will no longer create an incentive to trade off-\n     exchange or overseas. The bill would require the CFTC to \n     develop a methodology that allows investors to aggregate \n     their positions on the exchanges and in over-the-counter \n     markets for purposes of regulatory enforcement of the \n     position limits.\n       The legislation requires the CFTC to set the individual \n     position limits at amounts necessary to prevent excessive \n     speculation while still ensuring sufficient market liquidity.\n       The CFTC currently sets the speculative position limits at \n     amounts the Commission believes are necessary to prevent \n     market manipulation by individual market participants. In \n     contradiction with the original intent of the Congress, the \n     CFTC does not set the position limits at amounts necessary to \n     control the harmful inflationary effects of excessive \n     speculation. The bill clarifies that the position limits \n     should be set at amounts no greater than necessary to ensure \n     sufficient market liquidity for the conduct of bona fide \n     hedging activities.\n       The legislation directs that the speculative position \n     limits must be set by the CFTC, not the futures exchanges.\n       The bill would repeal the CFTC's authority to delegate the \n     responsibility for setting the position limits to the \n     exchanges. The major exchanges are no longer nonprofit \n     entities, but rather for-profit businesses. The position \n     limits should be set by a regulatory entity that has a single \n     mission--serving the public interest.\n       The legislation repeals the authority that permits the CFTC \n     to substitute reporting requirements for actual speculative \n     position limits.\n       Currently, position limits apply to an investor's holdings \n     in the spot month, any single month, and all months combined. \n     With respect to energy futures contracts, the position limits \n     are replaced with a simple reporting requirement, or \n     ``position accountability level'', in the all-months time \n     period. The bill would extend actual speculative position \n     limits to the all-months time period.\n       The legislation requires foreign futures exchanges to \n     provide the CFTC with daily trading information comparable to \n     the information provided by domestic exchanges.\n       Increasingly, foreign futures exchanges are offering cash-\n     settled futures contracts that are based on commodity prices \n     set by contracts traded on U.S. exchanges. These ``look-\n     alike'' contracts arguably offer investors a competitive \n     alternative to contracts that are traded and physically \n     settled through U.S. exchanges. The CFTC recently indicated \n     it will require foreign exchanges offering look-alike \n     contracts to provide trading information comparable to the \n     information provided by domestic exchanges. This provision \n     codifies the new CFTC policy. The provision lays the \n     statutory framework necessary for a seamless system of \n     information reporting and improved transparency that will \n     ensure the CFTC has the ability to monitor and enforce the \n     new speculative position limits.\n       The legislation increases the resources available to the \n     CFTC to carry out is its expanded responsibilities under the \n     Act, including additional funds for staffing and technology.\n       The legislation constitutes a historic expansion of the \n     CFTC's mission. Significant new resources will be needed to \n     carry out these directives. As soon as practicable after the \n     date of enactment, the legislation requires the CFTC to hire \n     100 additional full-time employees and authorizes such sums \n     as are necessary to implement its new responsibilities. No \n     later than 45 days after enactment, the CFTC must report to \n     the Congressional appropriations committees with an estimate \n     of the additional funding necessary to fully administer the \n     Act.\n       The legislation directs the CFTC to review trends in \n     speculative activity related to metals, and report to \n     Congress on whether the Commission's new authority should \n     extend to trading in metals.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, high energy prices are having a \ndevastating impact on our economy and our people--especially in large, \nrural States like Maine. Truckdrivers, loggers, fishermen, farmers, and \ncountless others are struggling with the high cost of oil and gasoline. \nIn Maine, where 80 percent of homes are heated with oil, many families \ndo not know how they can afford to stay warm next winter.\n  The high cost of energy is also taking a toll on businesses, both \nlarge and small. Katahdin Paper recently announced plans to shut down \nits plant in Millinocket due to the cost of oil. If this occurs--and \neveryone is working to prevent it--the community would be devastated by \nthe loss of more than 200 good jobs.\n  Many factors affect energy prices, including the value of the dollar, \nglobal tensions, and demand in other countries, such as China and \nIndia. But Senator Lieberman and I have heard persuasive and troubling \nevidence in hearings of our Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs that another factor is also at work--excessive \nspeculation in futures markets for energy commodities.\n  At issue is the activity of noncommercial traders who do not produce \nor take delivery of oil or agricultural products, unlike commercial \ntraders such as oil producers and heating oil dealers, farmers and \ncereal companies. Instead, these noncommercial investors use futures \ncontracts and related transactions solely for financial gain.\n  Speculation in commodity markets by noncommercial investors has grown \nenormously. In just the last 5 years, the total value of their futures-\ncontract and commodity index-fund investments has soared from $13 \nbillion to $260 billion.\n  These massive new holdings of oil-futures contracts by pension funds, \nuniversity endowments, and other institutional investors appear to be \ndriving up prices beyond what they would otherwise be. These investors' \nintentions may be simply to provide good returns, a hedge against \ninflation, and diversification, but many experts believe their \nactivities are distorting commodity markets.\n  I have worked with Senator Lieberman to produce a comprehensive and \nbipartisan bill, the Commodity Speculation Reform Act of 2008, which we \nare introducing today.\n  Our bill takes some very strong steps toward countering excessive \nspeculation.\n  First, it would remedy staffing shortfalls at the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission by adding 100 staff to improve its market oversight \nand enforcement capabilities. This is a vital step. The CFTC tells us \nthat more than 3 billion futures and options contracts were traded last \nyear, up from 37 million in 1976. Yet the Commission is operating with \nfewer employees than it had 30 years ago.\n  Second, our bill closes the so-called ``swaps loophole,'' which \ncurrently allows financial institutions to evade position limits on \ncommodity contracts that regulators use to prevent unwarranted price \nswings or attempts at manipulation.\n  Third, our bill directs the CFTC to establish position limits that \nwill apply to an investor's total interest in a commodity, regardless \nof whether they originate on a regulated exchange, the over-the-counter \nmarket, or on foreign boards of trade that deal in U.S. commodities.\n  Fourth, our bill instructs the CFTC to permit no foreign boards of \ntrade to deal in U.S.-linked commodity contracts unless they agree to \nreporting and data- accessibility standards at least equivalent to that \nrequired of U.S.-regulated exchanges. This is not a matter of telling \nother countries what to do: foreign boards of trade request ``no-\naction'' letters from the CFTC so they can maintain trading terminals \nhere while remaining regulated by their own authorities. The CFTC has \nrecently taken positive steps to require comparable reporting, and our \nbill codifies those improvements.\n  These are powerful measures, but they are also prudently designed. We \nrecognize that producers, handlers, and purchasers of commodities who \nuse those markets to lock in prices, hedge risks, and see clues for \nprice trends require some level of participation by non- commercial, \nfinancial investors.\n  Our bill does not prevent financial investors from participating in \ncommodity markets. It simply places some limits on their presence by \ndirecting the CFTC to set position limits across trading venues at a \nlevel no higher than that needed to ensure that commercial participants \ncan always find counterparties for their contract needs.\n  These and other provisions of our bill--which applies to agricultural \nas well as energy commodities--will provide a stronger regulator, \nimproved flows of information, new and more consistent protections \nagainst excessive speculation, and assurance to both businesses and \nconsumers that our markets in basic commodities are transparent, \ncompetitive, and effectively policed.\n  The Commodity Speculation Reform Act of 2008 represents a balanced \nand bipartisan approach. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Lieberman \nand me in supporting it.\n\n[[Page S6571]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 3249. A bill to restrict any State or local jurisdiction from \nimposing a new discriminatory tax on mobile wireless communications \nservices, providers, or property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, 100 years ago the automobile revolutionized \nthe way Americans lived and did business. Government responded by \nmaking a massive investment in infrastructure to support this new \ntechnology. That investment gave our industries a real competitive \nadvantage in the world marketplace for much of the 20th century by \nmaking it cheaper and easier to move goods around the country.\n  Today, information technology has brought an equal, if not greater, \nrevolution to American business. But this time, rather than investing \nin infrastructure and fostering growth, we have allowed the country's \nIT infrastructure to be taxed at dangerous and unhealthy levels that \nput American business at a competitive disadvantage.\n  The information revolution has changed the way we learn, the way we \nwork, the way we hold elections, and the way we communicate as a \nsociety, among other things that keep our country working. It has made \nvast educational, health care and entrepreneurial opportunities \naccessible to our most remote communities. But telecommunication taxes \nin the U.S. have been levied at a rate much higher than other types of \nsales and business taxes.\n  Rather than investing in IT infrastructure, we have left it to the \nprivate sector to build and maintain our telecommunications networks. \nAnd while this practice has sometimes served Americans well, we are \nfalling behind some major international competitors in far too many \nareas.\n  I am not today calling for anything as far-reaching as Federal \ninvestment in IT infrastructure--today I am simply asking that we stop \nyoking our most innovative IT networks with increased taxes.\n  Wireless broadband holds the promise of connecting even our most \ndistant communities to the rest of the world. In time, these \nconnections will bring health care, educational, communications and \ncommercial services to Americans who have been left out for far too \nlong. This growth will not happen if we keep burdening this important \ntechnology with what amounts to discriminatory taxation.\n  I have fought for many years to expand the development of the \nInternet and our telecommunications infrastructure. Along with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, I worked to successfully protect \nour network providers from content-related litigation. Four times now, \nI have fought to protect the Internet from being hit with multiple \ndiscriminatory taxes from thousands of State and local tax \nauthorities--and have worked to extend that protection indefinitely.\n  Today I am proposing something far more modest--if just as \nnecessary--that we put a moratorium on new or increased taxes on our \nwireless telecommunications infrastructure and services for the next 5 \nyears.\n  Along with my colleague Senator Snowe, I am introducing the Mobile \nWireless Tax Fairness Act to keep mobile wireless services and \nfacilities free from new discriminatory taxes.\n  This bill would not impact a single current tax that has been levied \nby a State or locality. It will not remove a single dollar from their \ncommunal coffers. What it will do is guarantee our wireless network \nproviders protection from even greater taxation at a time when we are \nasking them to implement the largest technology upgrade in history--an \nupgrade that will bring economically important, true broadband speeds \nto wireless customers for the first time.\n  I will admit that there are lots of problems with the way Federal, \nState and local taxes are levied on telecommunications services. This \nlegislation addresses only one of those problems, but it is a big one.\n  Taxes on wireless services are some of the most regressive taxes in \nthe Nation. Cell phones and other wireless devices have become \nessential to many working Americans, for their jobs, for their safety \nand for maintaining the communications they need to stay in touch with \nfamilies when both parents work and raise children. Piling increased \ntaxes on these families at a time when budgets are being stretched by \nskyrocketing gas and food prices is not only unreasonable, it is \ndownright wrong.\n  I am proud that my colleague Senator Snowe joins me in introducing \nthis important legislation. Senator Snowe has long been an advocate for \nthe improvement and expansion of our IT infrastructure and today we \nhave taken another important step that will help strengthen our country \nand our economy today and in the future. This proposal joins H.R. 5793 \nby Congresswoman Lofgren and Congressman Cannon in the House and I look \nforward to working with them to see this important legislation passed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3249\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mobile Wireless Tax Fairness \n     Act of 2008''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is appropriate to exercise congressional enforcement \n     authority under section 5 of the 14th amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States and Congress' plenary power \n     under article I, section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution of \n     the United States (commonly known as the ``commerce clause'') \n     in order to ensure that States and political subdivisions \n     thereof do not discriminate against providers and consumers \n     of mobile services by imposing new selective and excessive \n     taxes and other burdens on such providers and consumers.\n       (2) In light of the history and pattern of discriminatory \n     taxation faced by providers and consumers of mobile services, \n     the prohibitions against and remedies to correct \n     discriminatory State and local taxation in section 306 of the \n     Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (49 \n     U.S.C. 11501) provide an appropriate analogy for \n     congressional action, and similar Federal legislative \n     measures are warranted that will prohibit imposing new \n     discriminatory taxes on providers and consumers of mobile \n     services and that will assure an effective, uniform remedy.\n\n     SEC. 3. MORATORIUM.\n\n       (a) In General.--No State or local jurisdiction shall \n     impose a new discriminatory tax on or with respect to mobile \n     services, mobile service providers, or mobile service \n     property, during the 5-year period beginning on the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this Act:\n       (1) Mobile service.--The term ``mobile service'' means \n     commercial mobile radio service, as such term is defined in \n     section 20.3 of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations, as in \n     effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, or any other \n     service that is primarily intended for receipt on, \n     transmission from, or use with a mobile telecommunications \n     device, including the receipt of a digital good.\n       (2) Mobile service property.--The term ``mobile service \n     property'' means all property used by a mobile service \n     provider in connection with its business of providing mobile \n     services, whether real, personal, tangible, or intangible and \n     includes goodwill, licenses, customer lists, and other \n     similar intangible property associated with such business.\n       (3) Mobile service provider.--The term ``mobile service \n     provider'' means any entity that sells or provides mobile \n     services, but only with respect to the portion of such \n     entity's trade or business that sells or provides such \n     services.\n       (4) New discriminatory tax.--The term ``new discriminatory \n     tax'' means any tax imposed by a State or local jurisdiction \n     that--\n       (A) is imposed on or with respect to, or is measured by the \n     charges, receipts, or revenues from or value of--\n       (i) any mobile service and is not generally imposed, or is \n     generally imposed at a lower rate, on or with respect to, or \n     measured by the charges, receipts, or revenues from, other \n     services or transactions involving tangible personal \n     property;\n       (ii) any mobile service provider and is not generally \n     imposed, or is generally imposed at a lower rate, on other \n     persons that are engaged in businesses other than the \n     provision of mobile services; or\n       (iii) any mobile service property and is not generally \n     imposed, or is generally imposed at a lower rate, on or with \n     respect to, or measured by the value of, other property that \n     is devoted to a commercial or industrial use and subject to a \n     property tax levy, except public utility property owned by a \n     public utility subject to rate of return regulation by a \n     State or Federal regulatory authority; and\n       (B) was not generally imposed and actually enforced on \n     mobile services, mobile service providers, or mobile service \n     property prior to the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (5) State or local jurisdiction.--The term ``State or local \n     jurisdiction'' means any\n\n[[Page S6572]]\n\n     of the several States, the District of Columbia, any \n     territory or possession of the United States, a political \n     subdivision of any State, territory, or possession, or any \n     governmental entity or person acting on behalf of such State, \n     territory, possession, or subdivision and with the authority \n     to assess, impose, levy, or collect taxes or fees.\n       (6) Tax.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``tax'' means any charge imposed \n     by any governmental entity for the purpose of generating \n     revenues for governmental purposes, and is not a fee imposed \n     on an individual entity or class of entities for a specific \n     privilege, service, or benefit conferred exclusively on such \n     entity or class of entities.\n       (B) Exclusion.--The term ``tax'' does not include any fee \n     or charge--\n       (i) used to preserve and advance Federal universal service \n     or similar State programs authorized by section 254 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 254); or\n       (ii) specifically dedicated by a State or local \n     jurisdiction for the support of E-911 communications systems.\n       (c) Rules of Construction.--\n       (1) Determination.--For purposes of subsection (b)(4), all \n     taxes, tax rates, exemptions, deductions, credits, \n     incentives, exclusions, and other similar factors shall be \n     taken into account in determining whether a tax is a new \n     discriminatory tax.\n       (2) Application of principles.--Except as otherwise \n     provided in this Act, in determining whether a tax on mobile \n     service property is a new discriminatory tax for purposes of \n     subsection (b)(4)(A)(iii), principles similar to those set \n     forth in section 306 of the Railroad Revitalization and \n     Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (49 U.S.C. 11501) shall apply.\n       (3) Exclusions.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act--\n       (A) the term ``generally imposed'' as used in subsection \n     (b)(4) shall not apply to any tax imposed only on--\n       (i) specific services;\n       (ii) specific industries or business segments;

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nWyden, in introducing legislation that will stop the increasing \nfinancial burden being placed on wireless consumers by discriminatory \ntaxes. On average, the typical consumer pays 15.2 percent of his/her \ntotal wireless bill in Federal, State, and local taxes, fees and \nsurcharges--this is compared to the 7.07 percent average tax rate for \nother goods and services.\n  The Mobile Wireless Tax Fairness Act of 2008 would ensure that these \ntax rates don't increase further by prohibiting States and local \ngovernments from imposing any new discriminatory tax on mobile \nservices, mobile service providers, or mobile service property for a \nperiod of 5 years. The bill defines ``new discriminatory tax'' as a tax \nimposed on mobile services, providers, or property that is not \ngenerally imposed on other types of services or property, or that is \ngenerally imposed at a lower rate.\n  The wireless era has changed the way the world communicates. More and \nmore people are using the cell phone as their primary communication \ndevice as well as for data and Internet services. The increased \nmobility and access wireless communications provide have improved our \nlives, our safety, and the productivity of our work and businesses. To \ndate, there are more than 260 million wireless subscribers in the U.S., \nand total usage exceeded 1 trillion minutes in June 2007 alone.\n  However, as more consumers embrace wireless technologies and \napplications, more States and local governments are embracing it as a \nrevenue source and applying these excessive and discriminatory taxes, \nwhich show up on consumers' bills each month. In fact, the effective \nrate of taxation on wireless services has increased four times faster \nthan the rate on other taxable goods and services between January 2003 \nand January 2007.\n  These excessive and discriminatory taxes discourage wireless' \nadoption and use, primarily with low-income individuals and families \nthat still view a cellular phone as a luxury when many Americans \nconsider it a necessity. By banning these taxes, we can equalize the \ntaxation of the wireless industry with that of other goods and services \nand protect the wireless consumer from the weight of fees, surcharges, \nand general business taxes. We cannot allow this essential and \ninnovative industry as well as the consumers who benefit from its \namazing services and applications to suffer excessive tax rates.\n  Placing a moratorium on new discriminatory wireless taxes will make \ncertain consumers continue to reap the benefits of wireless services. \nCongress took similar action with the Internet--passing the Internet \nTax Freedom Act Amendments Act of 2007 this past fall--because of the \nincredible impact the Internet will continue to have on consumers and \nbusinesses alike. The future of wireless is just as bright and that is \nwhy we must ensure its continued growth. That is why I sincerely hope \nthat my colleagues join Senator Wyden and me in supporting this \ncritical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Tester, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Casey, Mr. Obama, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sanders, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 3252. A bill to amend the Consumer Credit Protection Act, to ban \nabusive credit practices, enhance consumer disclosures, protect \nunderage consumers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my friend and colleague from Michigan is \nhere, as well, who has been deeply involved in the issue of credit \ncards and the problems that are occurring.\n  I rise with my colleague Senator Levin to introduce legislation that \nwould reform and prohibit credit card practices that harm rather than \nhelp American consumers and their families. The legislation is called \nthe Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act, or \nthe Credit CARD Act. It will, in my view, help bring an end to industry \npractices that candidly cost American families billions of dollars each \nand every year.\n  I cannot think of a better time to introduce this much needed \nlegislation. This Chamber will, in very short order this evening, or as \nlate as tomorrow, pass legislation to address the most important issue \nconfronting our Nation's economy and the financial stability of our \ncitizens--the collapse of the subprime housing market and the credit \ncrisis it has brought about.\n  Unfortunately, far too many American families who are already being \nsqueezed by the rising cost of food, oil, and gas, now find themselves \nforced to rely on short-term, high-interest credit card debt to finance \nlife's daily necessities--including their mortgage payments--because of \nthe ongoing credit crisis and a weak economy.\n  That growing reliance was highlighted in a report released last week \nby the Federal Reserve. The Fed's study reported that in May, revolving \nconsumer debt, which is primarily credit card debt, reached an all-time \nrecord high of slightly over $961 billion. That is a 7-percent increase \nin the last month alone, which is on top of a 7-percent increase last \nyear, and a 6-percent increase in 2006. At this rate, revolving \nconsumer debt in our country, which is again primarily credit card \ndebt, will\n\n[[Page S6573]]\n\nreach $1 trillion by the Christmas season of this year.\n  When I assumed the gavel of the Senate Banking Committee last \nJanuary, one of the very first hearings I held was on the issue of \ncredit card practices. At that hearing, I challenged card issuers, \nbanks, and associations to stop engaging in practices that they were \nnot prepared to defend before the committee.\n  It was my hope that the hearing and that warning would encourage the \ncredit card industry to go through a period of intense self-\nexamination. I had hoped the industry would scrutinize its practices \nand policies to ensure that credit was extended in the fairest and most \ntransparent of terms to credit card customers. To be fair, some in the \nindustry heeded that call. I applaud them and thank them for their \nefforts. Over the past year, a few credit card companies have \nvoluntarily made changes to the way they do business, and many \nAmericans have benefitted from those improvements.\n  Regrettably, however, far too few embraced this call. Even more \nregrettably, some that have made voluntary changes are reconsidering \nthose steps in the face of mounting pressure to find new streams of \nrevenue and capital, and to compete in a market where other industry \nparticipants are not engaging in these reforms, as their subprime \nmortgage market-related losses continue to rise. The temptation to go \nback to older practices to increase revenue streams is there. \nUnfortunately, the use of confusing, misleading, and very predatory \npractices, in some cases, appears likely to remain the standard \noperating procedure for many in the credit card industry for the \nforeseeable future if we fail to act. The list of these troubling \npractices is lengthy: Charging predatory rates and fees; engaging in \ndeceptive marketing to young people; practices such as universal \ndefault; double-cycle billing; retroactive interest rate increases; \n``any time, any reason'' repricing; and billings shenanigans--like \nshortening the period consumers have to pay their bills, or charging \nfees for payment by telephone--are just a few of the practices that \ncould merit induction into a fairly crowded industry ``hall of shame.''\n  Even the financial regulators, whom I have been openly critical of \nfor lack of appropriate oversight and response throughout the subprime \nmortgage market crisis, have recognized the harm these sinister \npractices pose not only to credit card customers but to our economy as \nwell. In May of this year, the Federal Reserve, the Office of Thrift \nSupervision, and the National Credit Union Administration proposed \nrules aimed at curbing some of the very practices I have identified. In \nmy view, this joint rulemaking is an important step in providing needed \nconsumer protections in some areas, including a ban on retroactive \ninterest rates and rules on payment allocation. But the proposed rules \nfall far short in other important areas--failing to address issues \nincluding universal default, ``any time, any reason'' repricing, \nmultiple over-limit fees, and youth marketing.\n  These shortcomings underscore the need for the legislation Senator \nLevin and I will be talking about this evening.\n  I want to make it very clear--and I know my colleague feels the same \nway--that we are not opposed to credit cards. They are very valuable, \nvery useful tools for consumers. So this bill is not designed in any \nway to deprive consumers of the use of credit cards. That is not the \nissue. When provided on fair terms, and used wisely and responsibly, \ncredit cards are a valuable financial tool for millions of our fellow \ncitizens. They can help an individual to build his or her credit \nhistory and to better pursue his or her financial goal.\n  But like many credit products, credit cards pose the potential to \nharm consumers as well as help consumers. Card companies have been far \ntoo apt to exploit the needs of consumers who are increasingly becoming \n``hooked on plastic.'' That potential to harm consumers has grown in \nrecent years as credit card usage has risen. Let me share some numbers \nwith you to give you some idea of what has happened in this explosion \nof credit card usage by Americans.\n  Today, nearly 75 percent of American households have a credit card or \na debit card, and 700 million credit cards are used to purchase in \nexcess of $2.4 trillion in goods and services from over 7 million \nlocations in the United States annually. In 1970, only about 16 percent \nof U.S. households used credit cards, and fewer than a million \nbusinesses accepted them.\n  As Americans have become increasingly reliant on credit cards, credit \ncard companies have become more and more innovative in finding ways to \naccess their customers. Over $17 billion in credit card penalty fees \nhave been charged to the American people--new fees--in the last 2 \nyears, since 2006. That is a tenfold increase from what was charged 10 \nyears ago. That is $17 billion in new penalties and fees since 2006. \nCredit card companies are turning to innovative ways to profit--\nincluding at the gasoline pump. They are laying on fees to gas station \nowners for each credit card transaction made at the pump. At the very \ntime they are watching the price of gasoline skyrocket, the credit card \ncompanies are gouging the people struggling to meet those fees. Again, \ncard companies are laying on fees to gas station owners for each credit \ncard transaction made at the pump--a charge that those owners \nimmediately pass on to customers, increasing the cost of gas for \ndrivers. In some places, these fees can add an average of 3 percent for \neach gasoline transaction.\n  The combination of the growing needs for revolving debt and hidden \nfees charged by card companies is contributing to the avalanche of debt \nunder which American consumers increasingly find themselves buried. \nListen to this number, because this is the one that is stunning. To \ngive you an idea of what has happened to the average family in this \ncountry with credit card balances, today the average household that \ncarries a credit card balance owes close to $10,000 in revolving debt \non their credit cards. The average family has a balance of $10,000 in \nrevolving debt on their credit cards.\n  That is a millstone around the neck of the average American and their \nfamilies--families that are already struggling to make ends meet and \nare under pressure from rising gas prices, food prices, skyrocketing \nhealth care costs, and a mortgage crisis that has robbed many families \nof their home equity or, worse yet, their homes.\n  That is why we are introducing the Credit CARD Act. This bill will \nhelp reform credit card practices that drag so many American families \nfurther and further into debt. It strengthens regulation and oversight \nof the credit card industry and prohibits the unfair and deceptive \npractices that in far too many instances work to harm, not help, a \nconsumer's efforts to move up the economic ladder.\n  Specifically, the CARD Act would prohibit the worst of the industry's \npractices, including imposition of excessive fees; retroactive rate \nincreases; universal default; ``any time, any reason'' changes to \ncredit card agreements; and unfair payment allocation.\n  The bill also, importantly, contains a number of provisions aimed at \nprotecting young consumers.\n  This legislation builds on legislation I have introduced in previous \nCongresses. It also incorporates several key concepts included in the \nlegislative proposals put forth by some of my colleagues, notably my \ncolleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, and Senators Menendez, \nMcCaskill, and Obama. Each is an important cosponsor of this \nlegislation, as are Senators Reed of Rhode Island, Akaka, Tester, \nClinton, Kerry, Sanders, Whitehouse, and Casey.\n  This bill also has the support of a wide array of consumer advocates \nand labor organizations, including the Consumer Federation of America, \nConsumers Union, National Consumer Law Center, the National Council of \nLa Raza, Service Employees International Union, the Center for \nResponsible Lending, U.S. PRIG, Consumer Action, Demos, Connecticut \nPRIG, and the National Association of Consumer Advocates.\n  As policymakers, we should expect consumers will act responsibly when \nit comes to using credit cards, and that should be an important point \nto make. But we also expect no less when it comes to companies that \nissue these cards. They need to act responsibly, and they are not, in \nmy view. The Credit CARD Act will help strike the\n\n[[Page S6574]]\n\ncorrect balance of responsibility between credit card users and the \ncard issuers. And by striking that balance, it will help provide \nAmerican consumers with a fair chance to secure economic security for \nthem and their families.\n  I thank Senator Levin and others--especially Senator Levin who \nalready held hearings on this issue. We have talked about this at \nlength over the years. We tried in other Congresses with very modest \nproposals to deal with some of these problems. We have always lost \nthose battles. But I think the American consumers, regardless of their \nincome, regardless of their social or economic status, feel very angry \nabout what is happening to them. As a result, I think there is a \ngrowing opportunity for us to get something done on this issue.\n  So while our focus today has been on foreclosure issues, the credit \ncard problem in this country that so many Americans are facing is one \nthat I think is ripe for congressional action. Our hope and intention \nis to bring a bill to the floor of this Chamber before we adjourn for \nthe year to give our colleagues a chance to express themselves on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3252\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I know the Senator from Connecticut has to \nleave, but before he does leave the floor, I congratulate and commend \nhim on this bill. He has put a huge amount of effort into this issue \nover the years. This bill reflects that effort. His leadership in this \nmatter will make a huge difference in getting this bill enacted. I \nthank him for that leadership and thank him for this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today is \ngoing to combat credit card abuses that have been hurting American \nconsumers for far too long. With all the economic hardship facing \nAmericans today, from falling home prices to rising gasoline and food \ncosts, it is more important than ever for Congress to act now to stop \ncredit card abuses and protect American families from unfair credit \ncard practices.\n  Credit card companies regularly use a host of unfair practices. They \nhike the interest rates of cardholders who pay on time and comply with \ntheir credit card agreements. They impose interest rates as high as 32 \npercent. They charge interest for debt that was paid on time. They \napply higher interest rates retroactively to existing credit card debt. \nThey pile on excessive fees and then have the gall to charge interest \non those fees. They apply consumer payments first to the debt with the \nleast expensive interest rate, saving the higher interest rate debt to \nbe paid off last. And they engage in a number of other unfair practices \nthat are burying American consumers in a mountain of debt. It is long \npast time to enact legislation to protect American consumers.\n  The bill we are introducing today will not only help protect \nconsumers, but it will also help ensure that credit card companies \nwilling to do the right thing are not put at a competitive disadvantage \nby companies continuing unfair practices.\n  Some argue that Congress does not need to ban unfair credit card \npractices. They contend that improved disclosure alone will empower \nconsumers to seek out better deals. Sunlight can be a powerful \ndisinfectant, but credit cards have become such complex financial \nproducts that even improved disclosure will not be enough to curb the \nabuses. Some practices are so confusing that consumers cannot easily \nunderstand them. Additionally, better disclosure does not always lead \nto greater market competition, especially when essentially an entire \nindustry is using and benefiting from practices that unfairly hurt \nconsumers.\n  Credit card issuers like to say they are engaged in a risky business, \nlending unsecured debt to millions of consumers. But it is clear they \nhave learned to price credit card products in ways that produce \nenormous profit. For the last decade, credit card issuers have \nmaintained their position as the most profitable sector in the consumer \nlending field and reported consistently higher rates of return than \ncommercial banks.\n  In 2006, Americans used 700 million credit cards to buy about $2 \ntrillion in goods and services. The average American family now has \nfive credit cards. Credit cards are being used to pay for groceries, \nmortgage payments, and even taxes, and they are saddling U.S. \nconsumers, from college students to seniors, with a mountain of debt. \nThe latest figures show that U.S. credit card debt is now approaching \n$1 trillion. These consumers are routinely being subjected to unfair \npractices that squeeze them for ever more money, sinking them further \ninto debt.\n  While the remaining legislative days in this Congress are dwindling, \nthere is still time to enact strong credit card reform legislation. Too \nmany American families are being hurt by too many unfair credit card \npractices to delay action any longer.\n  I commend Senator Dodd for tackling credit card reform. I look \nforward to Congress taking the steps needed this session to ban unfair \npractices that are causing so much pain and financial damage to \nAmerican families today.\n  Credit card abuse is a topic, as Senator Dodd mentioned, with which I \nhave been deeply involved over the past several years through a number \nof investigations in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. We \nheld two subcommittee hearings in 2007, and based on our investigative \nhearings, I introduced legislation called the Stop Unfair Practices in \nCredit Cards Act, S. 1395, to ban the outrageous credit card abuses \nthat were documented in the hearings. I was pleased that Senators \nMcCaskill, Leahy, Durbin, Bingaman, Cantwell, Whitehouse, Kohl, Brown, \nStevens, and Sanders, our Presiding Officer, joined as cosponsors.\n  This new bill, the Dodd-Levin bill introduced today, as Senator Dodd \nmentioned, incorporates almost all the provisions of S. 1395, and it \nadds other important protections as well. It is the strongest credit \ncard bill yet in Congress.\n  I would like to add to the record more detailing of the provisions of \nthis bill, along with an overview of some of the most prevalent abuses \nthat we uncovered and some of the stories that American consumers \nshared with us during the course of the inquiries carried out by my \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n  With regard to excessive fees, the first case history we examined \nillustrates the fact that major credit card issuers today impose a host \nof fees on their cardholders, including late fees and over-the-limit \nfees that are not only substantial in themselves but can contribute to \nyears of debt for families unable to immediately pay them.\n  Wesley Wannemacher of Lima, OH, testified at our March 2007 hearing. \nIn 2001 and 2002, Mr. Wannemacher used a new credit card to pay for \nexpenses mostly related to his wedding. He charged a total of about \n$3,200, which exceeded the card's credit limit by $200. He spent the \nnext 6 years trying to pay off the debt, averaging payments of about \n$1,000 per year. As of February 2007, he had paid about $6,300 on his \n$3,200 debt, but his billing statement showed he still owed $4,400.\n  How is it possible that a man pays $6,300 on a $3,200 credit card \ndebt, but still owes $4,400? Here is how. On top of the $3,200 debt, \nMr. Wannemacher was charged by the credit card issuer about $4,900 in \ninterest, $1,100 in late fees, and $1,500 in over-the-limit fees. He \nwas hit 47 times with over-limit fees, even though he went over the \nlimit only three times and exceeded the limit by only $200. Altogether, \nthese fees and the interest charges added up to $7,500, which, on top \nof the original $3,200 credit card debt, produced total charges to him \nof $10,700.\n  In other words, the interest charges and fees more than tripled the \noriginal $3,200 credit card debt, despite payments by the cardholder \naveraging $1,000 per year. Unfair? Clearly, I think, but our \ninvestigation has shown that sky-high interest charges and fees are not \nuncommon in the credit card industry. While the Wannemacher account \nhappened to be at Chase, penalty interest rates and fees are also \nemployed by other major credit card issuers.\n  The week before the March hearing, Chase decided to forgive the \nremaining\n\n[[Page S6580]]\n\ndebt on the Wannemacher account, and while that was great news for the \nWannemacher family, that decision doesn't begin to resolve the problem \nof excessive credit card fees and sky-high interest rates that trap too \nmany hard-working families in a downward spiral of debt.\n  These high fees are made worse by the industry-wide practice of \nincluding all fees in a consumer's outstanding balance so that they \nincur interest charges. It is one thing for a bank to charge interest \non funds lent to a consumer; charging interest on penalty fees goes too \nfar.\n  Another galling practice featured in our March hearing involves the \nfact that credit card debt that is paid on time routinely accrues \ninterest charges, and credit card bills that are paid on time and in \nfull are routinely inflated with what I call ``trailing interest.'' \nEvery single credit card issuer contacted by the Subcommittee engaged \nin both of these unfair practices which squeeze additional interest \ncharges from responsible cardholders.\n  Here is how it works. Suppose a consumer who usually pays his account \nin full, and owes no money on December 1, makes a lot of purchases in \nDecember, and gets a January 1 credit card bill for $5,020. That bill \nis due January 15. Suppose the consumer pays that bill on time, but \npays $5,000 instead of the full amount owed. What do you think the \nconsumer owes on the next bill?\n  If you thought the bill would be the $20 past due plus interest on \nthe $20, you would be wrong. In fact, under industry practice today, \nthe bill would likely be twice as much. That is because the consumer \nwould have to pay interest, not just on the $20 that wasn't paid on \ntime, but also on the $5,000 that was paid on time. In other words, the \nconsumer would have to pay interest on the entire $5,020 from the first \nday of the new billing month, January 1, until the day the bill was \npaid on January 15, compounded daily. So much for a grace period. In \naddition, the consumer would have to pay the $20 past due, plus \ninterest on the $20 from January 15 to January 31, again compounded \ndaily. In this example, using an interest rate of 17.99 percent, which \nis the interest rate charged to Mr. Wannamacher, the $20 debt would, in \none month, rack up $35 in interest charges and balloon into a debt of \n$55.21.\n  You might ask--hold on--why does the consumer have to pay any \ninterest at all on the $5,000 that was paid on time? Why does anyone \nhave to pay interest on the portion of a debt that was paid by the date \nspecified in the bill--in other words, on time? The answer is, because \nthat is how the credit card industry has operated for years, and they \nhave gotten away with it.\n  There is more. One might think that once the consumer gets gouged in \nFebruary, paying $55.21 on a $20 debt, and pays that bill on time and \nin full, without making any new purchases, that would be the end of it. \nBut you would be wrong again. It's not over.\n  Even though, on February 15, the consumer paid the February bill in \nfull and on time--all $55.21--the next bill has an additional interest \ncharge on it, for what we call ``trailing interest.'' In this case, the \ntrailing interest is the interest that accumulated on the $55.21 from \nFebruary 1 to 15, which is time period from the day when the bill was \nsent to the day when it was paid. The total is 38 cents. While some \nissuers will waive trailing interest if the next month's bill is less \nthan $1, if a consumer makes a new purchase, a common industry practice \nis to fold the 38 cents into the end-of-month bill reflecting the new \npurchase.\n  Now 38 cents isn't much in the big scheme of things. That may be why \nmany consumers don't notice these types of extra interest charges or \ntry to fight them. Even if someone had questions about the amount of \ninterest on a bill, most consumers would be hard pressed to understand \nhow the amount was calculated, much less whether it was incorrect. But \nby nickel and diming tens of millions of consumer accounts, credit card \nissuers reap large profits.\n  I think it is indefensible to make consumers pay interest on debt \nwhich they pay on time. It is also just plain wrong to charge trailing \ninterest when a bill is paid on time and in full.\n  My subcommittee's second hearing focused on another set of unfair \ncredit card practices involving unfair interest rate increases. \nCardholders who had years-long records of paying their credit card \nbills on time, staying below their credit limits, and paying at least \nthe minimum amount due, were nevertheless socked with substantial \ninterest rate increases. Some saw their credit card interest rates \ndouble or even triple. At the hearing, three consumers described this \nexperience.\n  Janet Hard of Freeland, MI, had accrued over $8,000 in debt on her \nDiscover card. Although she made payments on time and paid at least the \nminimum due for over 2 years, Discover increased her interest rate from \n18 percent to 24 percent in 2006. At the same time, Discover applied \nthe 24 percent rate retroactively to her existing credit card debt, \nincreasing her minimum payments and increasing the amount that went to \nfinance charges instead of the principal debt. The result was that, \ndespite making steady payments totaling $2,400 in 12 months and keeping \nher purchases to less than $100 during that same year, Janet Hard's \ncredit card debt went down by only $350. Sky-high interest charges, \ninexplicably increased and unfairly applied, ate up most of her \npayments.\n  Millard Glasshof of Milwaukee, WI, a retired senior citizen on a \nfixed income, incurred a debt of about $5,000 on his Chase credit card, \nclosed the account, and faithfully paid down his debt with a regular \nmonthly payment of $119 for years. In December 2006, Chase increased \nhis interest rate from 15 percent to 17 percent, and in February 2007, \nhiked it again to 27 percent. Retroactive application of the 27 percent \nrate to Mr. Glasshof's existing debt meant that, out of his $119 \npayment, about $114 went to pay finance charges and only $5 went to \nreducing his principal debt. Despite his making payments totaling \n$1,300 over 12 months, Mr. Glasshof found that, due to high interest \nrates and excessive fees, his credit card debt did not go down at all. \nLater, after the Subcommittee asked about his account, Chase suddenly \nlowered the interest rate to 6 percent. That meant, over a one year \nperiod, Chase had applied four different interest rates to his closed \ncredit card account: 15 percent, 17 percent, 27 percent, and 6 percent, \nwhich shows how arbitrary those rates are.\n  Then there is Bonnie Rushing of Naples, FL. For years, she had paid \nher Bank of America credit card on time, providing at least the minimum \namount specified on her bills. Despite her record of on-time payments, \nin 2007, Bank of America nearly tripled her interest rate from 8 to 23 \npercent. The bank said that it took this sudden action because Ms. \nRushing's FICO credit score had dropped. When we looked into why it had \ndropped, it was apparently because she had opened Macy's and J.Jill \ncredit cards to get discounts on purchases. Despite paying both bills \non time, the automated FICO system had lowered her credit rating, and \nBank of America had followed suit by raising her interest rate by a \nfactor of three. Ms. Rushing closed her account and complained to the \nFlorida attorney general, my subcommittee, and her card sponsor, the \nAmerican Automobile Association. Bank of America eventually restored \nthe 8 percent rate on her closed account.\n  In addition to these three consumers who testified at the hearing, \nthe subcommittee presented case histories for five other consumers who \nexperienced substantial interest rate increases despite complying with \ntheir credit card agreements.\n  I would also like to note that, in each of these cases, the credit \ncard issuer told our subcommittee that the cardholder had been given a \nchance to opt out of the increased interest rate by closing their \naccount and paying off their debt at the prior rate. But each of these \ncardholders denied receiving an opt-out notice, and when several tried \nto close their account and pay their debt at the prior rate, they were \ntold they had missed the opt-out deadline and had no choice but to pay \nthe higher rate. Our subcommittee examined copies of the opt-out \nnotices and found that some were filled with legal jargon, were hard to \nunderstand, and contained procedures that were hard to follow. When we \nasked the major credit card issuers what percentage of persons offered \nan opt-out actually took it, they told the Subcommittee that 90 percent \ndid not opt out of the higher interest\n\n[[Page S6581]]\n\nrate--a percentage that is contrary to all logic and strong evidence \nthat current opt-out procedures do not work.\n  The case histories presented at our hearings illustrate only a small \nportion of the abusive credit card practices going on today. Since \nearly 2007, the subcommittee has received letters and e-mails from \nthousands of credit card cardholders describing unfair credit card \npractices and asking for help to stop them, more complaints than I have \nreceived in any investigation I have conducted in more than 25 years in \nCongress. The complaints stretch across all income levels, all ages, \nand all areas of the country.\n  The bottom line is that these abuses have gone on for too long. In \nfact, these practices have been around for so many years that they \nhave, in many cases, become the industry norm, and our investigation \nhas shown that many of the practices are too entrenched, too \nprofitable, and too immune to consumer pressure for the companies to \nchange them on their own.\n  Mr. President, in summary, this is what our bill contains:\n  No interest on debt paid on time.\n  The bill prohibits interest charges on any portion of credit card \ndebt which the credit card holder paid on time during the grace period.\n  The bill prohibits credit card issuers from increasing interest rates \non cardholders who are in good standing for reasons unrelated to the \ncardholder's behavior with respect to that card.\n  The bill requires increased interest rates to apply only to future \ndebt and not to debt incurred prior to the increase.\n  The bill prohibits the charging of interest on credit card \ntransaction fees, such as late fees and over-the-limit fees.\n  The bill prohibits the charging of repeated over-the-limit fees for a \nsingle instance of exceeding a credit card limit.\n  The bill requires payments to be applied first to the credit card \nbalance with the highest rate of interest and to minimize finance \ncharges.\n  The bill requires the credit card issuers must offer consumers the \noption of operating under a fixed credit card limit that cannot be \nexceeded.\n  The bill prohibits charging a fee to allow a credit card holder to \nmake a payment on credit card debt, whether that payment is by mail, \ntelephone, electronic transfer, or otherwise. Believe it or not, many \ncredit card companies actually charge you a fee to make your payment.\n  The bill contains some of the following provisions as well:\n  It requires issuers to lower penalty rates that have been imposed on \na cardholder after 6 months if the cardholder commits no further \nviolations.\n  The bill gives each Federal banking agency the authority to prescribe \nregulations governing unfair or deceptive practices by banks and \nsavings and loan institutions.\n  The bill requires issuers to provide individual consumer account \ninformation and disclose the total period of time and interest it will \ntake to pay off the credit card balance if only minimum monthly \npayments are made.\n  And, as the Senator from Connecticut said, the bill contains a number \nof protections for young consumers from credit card solicitations.\n  Again, I commend Senator Dodd for taking the leadership on this \nissue. As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, his leadership will \nmake a huge difference. It gives us a real chance of passing reform \nlegislation relative to credit card abuses this session of the \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/10/senate-section/article/S6581-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.
