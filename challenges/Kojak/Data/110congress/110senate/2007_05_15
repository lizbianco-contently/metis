Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business for 60 minutes, with the majority controlling the \nfirst half and the Republicans controlling the second portion.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe water resources legislation. Several amendments were offered to \nthis bill yesterday, and this morning one of those amendments--the one \noffered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, No. 1090--will be \ndebated until 11:45, and then a vote will occur with respect to that \namendment.\n  The Senate will recess, as usual, from 12:30 to 2:15 for the party \nconferences. Other votes with respect to amendments to the water \nresources legislation will occur this afternoon.\n  As the majority leader mentioned yesterday, a lot of work needs to be \ndone prior to the Memorial Day recess, so Members should plan \naccordingly.\n  The majority leader has offered two amendments on the issue of Iraq, \nand cloture votes will occur on those amendments on Wednesday.\n  Additionally, cloture was filed on the motion to proceed to the \nimmigration legislation. That vote will occur at a time to be \ndetermined on Wednesday.\n  I am certain every Member of the Senate is conscious of the fact that \nwe have a Memorial Day recess fast approaching at the end of next week. \nWe have an ambitious goal we hope to reach by that time. We hope to \ndeal with these outstanding pieces of legislation and to, of course, \nprovide supplemental appropriations for the war in Iraq.\n  At the outset, I will say that the Water Resources Development Act, \nwhich Senator Boxer of California and Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma will \nbring to the floor in a few moments, is a bill that has been pending \nbefore the Congress for, I believe, 7 years--at least 6 years. Our \nfailure to enact this bill has delayed the construction of critical \ninfrastructure across America for 6 or 7 years. This is infrastructure \nthat is important to every part of America--in the Midwest, dams on the \nMississippi and Illinois Rivers, which are vital arteries when it comes \nto agribusiness and other uses to create profitability and employment. \nAll of these are in a state of disrepair, and we want to address the \nmodernization and safety measures for these locks and dams and many \nother projects.\n  For 6 or 7 years, the debate has gone on unresolved. The House passed \noverwhelmingly the Water Resources Development Act. The Senate has the \nsame opportunity, but we need to do it on a timely basis.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, who is offering an amendment this \nmorning. I am told by the manager of the bill, Senator Boxer, that he \nhas been cooperative in terms of reducing the debate time, giving \nenough time to explain his amendment, for others to speak to it, and \nbring it to a vote.\n  I urge every other Senator that this is the day; if you have an \namendment to the Water Resources Development Act, bring it to the floor \ntoday. After 2:15, bring your amendments to the\n\n[[Page S6080]]\n\nfloor. Let's have the debate and have the vote. By the end of the day, \nlet's have all of the relevant amendments considered to this \nlegislation. I think we owe it to the people who have worked so hard to \nbring us to this moment, and now individual Senators should know that, \nto delay this, there is no excuse. Bring the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act amendments to the floor.\n  In addition, the majority leader filed two amendments relative to the \nwar in Iraq, which will be considered on a procedural basis to this \nWater Resources Development Act. It is a way to measure the sentiment \nof the Senate on two different approaches to resolving our difficulties \nbetween the White House and Congress on the funding in Iraq. There will \nbe a cloture vote on those amendments tomorrow. That is an opportunity \nfor Members to express their feelings.\n  As everybody knows, it takes 60 votes to invoke cloture. We hope we \nwill have a strong bipartisan vote for one of those two approaches. I \nurge my colleagues to understand this is a very important and timely \nmatter. We have little time left to deal with the requirements of \nfunding our troops before the Memorial Day recess. The Democratic \nmajority, as well as the Republican side, has made it clear we will \nfund our troops. At the end of the day, our troops will not go without \nthe resources they need to provide for their own safety and a safe \nreturn home.\n  Also, we hope this week to initiate a conversation on the immigration \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/15/senate-section/article/S6080-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, it is obvious to most Americans our \nimmigration system is broken. There are 12 million undocumented \nimmigrants living in the United States today, and hundreds of thousands \nare arriving each year. In America today, unscrupulous employers hire \nundocumented immigrants because they can pay them less than American \nworkers and force them to work in conditions that Americans would not \ntolerate. Employers can do this with impunity because our Government \ndoesn't enforce immigration laws that prohibit hiring undocumented \nimmigrants.\n  Immigration is a complicated issue that ignites strong passions. Some \nwould rather avoid this issue because it is so sensitive. But Congress \nhas an obligation to fix our broken immigration system. We need a \ncomprehensive approach, one that is tough but fair. We need, first, to \nimprove border security by increasing manpower and deploying new \ntechnology. We need to enforce the law against employers who are hiring \nmillions of undocumented workers. We need a realistic approach to the \n12 million undocumented workers who live and work in our country.\n  I commend our majority leader, Senator Reid of Nevada. He is not \nafraid of tackling tough issues, including immigration reform. He knows \nit is an important national priority. Last week, Senator Reid \nintroduced immigration reform legislation that the Senate will begin \ndebating this week. Senator Reid did a reasonable thing. He said we \nshould begin the debate where it ended last year, with the bipartisan \nKennedy-McCain, Hagel-Martinez bill.\n  This bill, sponsored by Republican Senators Chuck Hagel, Mel \nMartinez, Arlen Specter, John McCain, Sam Brownback, and Lindsey \nGraham, and many Democrats, passed the Senate last year on a bipartisan \nvote of 62 to 36.\n  Of course, that Hagel-Martinez bill was only the starting point for \nthe Senate's debate. Senator Reid has set aside 2 full weeks to \ncomplete that debate. Members will have ample opportunity to offer \namendments. This is the right place to start.\n  This is not a perfect bill. I voted for it, realizing there were real \nimperfections, but it reflects the culmination of months of work last \nyear, including hearings and marathon markups in the Judiciary \nCommittee, on which I serve, and over 30 rollcall votes on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  The bill is flawed, but it is comprehensive. It includes provisions \nto secure our borders, strengthen enforcement of our immigration laws, \nand addresses undocumented immigrants living in our country.\n  I am confident that over the next 2 weeks, through the amendment \nprocess, we can improve this bill and pass legislation that will be an \nimportant step in fixing our broken immigration system.\n  Unfortunately, there has been a hue and cry from the other side of \nthe aisle. Some object to debating this bill. It is ironic, to say the \nleast, that those on the other side who don't want to debate bipartisan \nlegislation are objecting to a bill written, in large part, by their \nown side of the aisle--a bill that was passed when the Republican side \nof the aisle controlled the Senate last year. It is hard to understand \nhow 21 Members of the Senate who voted for this bill last year now \nobject to even proceeding to it now as the base bill for our debate. \nThey understand, as we do, that this bill is going to change once it \ncomes to the floor. If they object to even bringing the measure to the \nfloor--the same bill they voted for last year--one has to question \nwhether they are committed to comprehensive immigration reform.\n  Some on the Republican side argue that backroom negotiations between \nthe White House and Republican and Democratic Senators are close to a \ndeal and that starting debate on immigration before that deal is \nreached is premature. I don't think that is a legitimate argument. I \nhave been in many of these negotiations, and I will say a great amount \nof effort has been expended to move this bill forward. Some parts of it \nare very positive. An agreement between the White House and the Senate \nis a step forward. There are some parts that are very controversial.\n  Human nature and political nature are interesting. People will not \nmove toward a goal unless they face a deadline. How many people wait \nuntil the last minute to file their tax returns or wait too long for \nthe checkup at the dentist? When we know we are facing a deadline and \ntime is running out, we make important decisions. The same will be true \nfor the immigration debate. Bringing last year's bill to the floor, \nwhich passed with an overwhelming bipartisan rollcall vote, as the base \nbill is going to move those negotiators in that room to a conclusion \nmore quickly. To leave this open-ended and say that at some time in the \nfuture we will get back to it is an invitation for talks to break down \nand for the participants to disappear.\n  We don't want that to happen. We cannot afford to wait. The Senate's \ncalendar is full this year. There are so many things we need to do to \nmake sure this congressional session is much more productive than those \nin the past, not the least of which is passing important appropriation \nbills, which now must be accomplished in order to fund the Government. \nWe don't want to fall into the same circumstance as the previous \nRepublican Congress, when they failed to pass appropriation bills and \ntried to play catchup and failed, leaving it to the new Congress, the \nDemocratic Congress--an awesome responsibility--to fund the Government \nfor the remainder of this fiscal year.\n  There are some who feel it is now or never for immigration. What the \nmajority leader has done is to tell the negotiators this is the time to \nwrap things up. This is the time to reach an agreement. This is the \ntime to decide who at that table is there in good faith and who is \nthere to stop the process. If they reach an agreement, it can be \nconsidered on the floor of the Senate as an amendment to the bipartisan \nKennedy-McCain, Hagel-Martinez bill, which is being offered as the \nstarting point of this debate. If there is no agreement, these \ndifferences can be debated and voted on over the next 2 weeks.\n\n[[Page S6081]]\n\n  I understand negotiations continue as I speak. I hope they reach an \nagreement that is comprehensive, tough but fair, and one every Member \ncan seriously consider supporting. But these negotiations are no excuse \nfor avoiding public debate.\n  At some point, you have to move beyond the closed doors of the rooms \nin the Capitol and into the bright lights of the Senate Chamber and let \nMembers speak to their wishes and their intentions on this important \nlegislation.\n  I disagree with some of the ideas being proposed by those on the \nother side of the aisle. I am sure they disagree with some of my \napproaches. I respect their views, and I hope they will look at this as \na constructive opportunity.\n  Should the Senate tomorrow fail to invoke cloture and to move forward \non the immigration bill, it will be a lost opportunity. If the 21 \nSenators who voted for comprehensive immigration reform will not even \nallow us to bring the matter to the floor at this moment, it will be \ndifficult to explain. They will have their chance to amend. They will \nhave their chance to make changes they think are important. They will \nhave their chance to act as Senators considering important measures.\n\n  There has been a lot of criticism of Congress for good reason. When \nwe look at the list of issues the American people think are important, \nvery seldom do we find those issues being debated on the floor of the \nSenate. We need to change that situation. One of the issues on which \nmost Americans agree is that our immigration system cannot be \nsustained. There are too many undocumented workers in this country \nliving in fear, being exploited in the workplace, uncertain of their \nfuture. There are too many still streaming across our borders, borders \nthat are too porous. There are ways to deal with those issues and ways \nthis bill will address them.\n  The Senate can offer, debate, and vote on amendments on all these \nissues. That is how the Senate is supposed to work. Some of my \ncolleagues have suggested they will block this debate from taking place \nby filibustering this bipartisan bill which passed over the past year. \nI hope they don't. It reaches the point where we need to be held \naccountable. I hope that point will be this week and next, as Senator \nReid, the majority leader, has set aside a reasonable amount of time to \ndebate it. The American people deserve more than closed-door, backdoor \nnegotiations. The time has come for Congress to fix our broken \nimmigration system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/15/senate-section/article/S6081-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6081-S6082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, time is running out to fund the troops. \nThere are many of us who believe the policy in Iraq is a failed policy. \nThe numbers we are given every week are stark and frightening: Over \n3,370 American soldiers have now lost their lives in the war in Iraq. \nAnother five were killed yesterday. Over the weekend, three American \nsoldiers were kidnapped. There is a manhunt underway to try to find \nthem and rescue them as quickly as possible. And to all those involved, \nthey have our prayers and our wishes for Godspeed.\n  But we understand the reality of this war, a war where almost 30,000 \nAmericans have been killed or disabled, a war where many soldiers have \nreturned home with injuries that they will have to cope with for a \nlifetime. This war has cost us over $500 billion, $500 billion that \ncould have been spent in America for many issues important to us--\nimproving our schools and education, making certain every American has \nbasic health insurance, making sure our children all across America \nhave the kind of health care and attention they need at an early age to \nbe healthy through the rest of their life, money that could have been \nspent at the National Institutes of Health looking for new cures for \ndiseases and illnesses from which we suffer in America. There are so \nmany programs in which we could have invested that money.\n  Instead, we have invested that money in a war with no end, a war that \nis now in its fifth year. The war in Iraq has lasted longer than the \nKorean war, has lasted longer than World War II. It is the most \nexpensive war in the history of the United States, save World War II, \nwhich was, in fact, a world war where the United States made a total \nnational commitment. But we now find that second in rank in terms of \ncost is this war in Iraq.\n  There are many of us who understand that Americans across the board \nmay have supported the initial invasion but had second thoughts. I was \none of 23 who voted against this war at the outset in October 2002. \nThere were colleagues on both sides of the aisle who in good faith \nthought the President should have the authority to deal with Saddam \nHussein. They were misled, as the American people were misled by \nintelligence estimates that were just wrong, intelligence estimates \nthat said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and threatened \nthe United States, fear of nuclear holocaust, fear of mushroom-shaped \nclouds. All of these images were paraded before the American people a \nshort time after we had gone through the tragedy of 9/11. It is \nunderstandable the American people were concerned and fearful, and they \nsupported the idea of invading Iraq in the hopes of keeping America \nsafe.\n  We learned that in so many ways the information given to the American \npeople before the invasion of Iraq was wrong. There were no weapons of \nmass destruction, there were no nuclear weapons, there was no \nconnection between Saddam Hussein and the events of 9/11 that were \nsponsored by al-Qaida. But the invasion took place.\n  Many of us felt that once our soldiers were in the field, it was time \nto close ranks behind them, stop the debate. They volunteered, they are \nserving our country, they didn't write this policy. They are risking \ntheir lives right now, and we should stand behind them. So many of us, \neven those who opposed this war and voted against it from the outset, \nvoted year after year for the emergency appropriations President Bush \nsent to Congress, money for our troops in the field. Now we are in the \nfifth year, and there is no end in sight.\n  We have been told by our military leaders that even the best military \nin the world in the United States cannot save Iraq. Only the Iraqis can \nsave Iraq. It has to be the Iraqi people through their Government who \ndecide to move forward toward stability. We cannot police a civil war. \nWe cannot contain the violence in Iraq even with 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 \nmore American soldiers. That is a reality and one we should face. \nRegardless, the President concluded a few months ago that he would \nescalate this war and send even more American soldiers into harm's way. \nI think that was a mistake. I think the President was moving in the \nwrong direction. As I said, I don't believe our military, though it be \nthe best in the world, can really contain the violence of the civil war \nin Iraq. I certainly don't believe our military, as good as it is, can \ngive spine to Iraqis leaders who can't seem to reach conclusions and \ndecisions on timetables about their future.\n  So the war continues. The President asked for more money, $80 \nbillion, $90 billion at a time to continue this war in Iraq. Many of us \nbelieve we should do two things: fund the troops, make sure they have \nall that they need, but change the policy, start bringing American \nsoldiers home. Tell the Iraqis once and for all that we will not be \nthere indefinitely. We are not going to stay until you work up the \npolitical courage to make decisions to govern your country. We are \ngoing to start coming home. As we come home, these Iraqi soldiers whom \nwe have spent millions of dollars to train and equip need to stand up \nand defend their country. The Iraqi Parliamentarians and leaders of \ntheir Government need to stand up and make the hard political \ndecisions.\n\n  That is the reality of Iraq today. It is a reality we are reminded of \nevery morning with the newscasts that tell us of the suffering and \ndeath which takes place in that country.\n  I wish to say a word, too, about the Iraqi people. I was reminded \nover the weekend when I was home in Illinois--and a good reminder it \nwas--that when we speak about the loss of life in Iraq, don't forget \nthe innocent Iraqis who have lost their lives as well. We don't even \nknow what that number is today. We know that close to 3,500 American \nsoldiers have lost their lives, and we know the coalition forces who \nhave lost their lives. We don't know how many innocent Iraqis have lost \ntheir lives as victims in the civil war or even of our invasion.\n\n[[Page S6082]]\n\n  Mr. President, ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday night had a gripping story \nabout a youngster, 12-year-old, who, during the bombing of our invasion \nof Iraq, lost both his arms. This young boy, whose name is Ali, came to \nthe attention of people across the world and was given a chance to go \nto England, where he goes to school now. He was really inspiring when \nhe talked about how he was going to make something of his life even \nthough he lost both his arms. He is just an innocent victim of this war \nwho lost family and friends in a bombing, a tragic incident we wished \nnever occurred.\n  Keep in mind that these innocent Iraqis are part of this calculation \nabout the future of Iraq as well. If this civil war is to come to an \nend, we not only need to start bringing American troops home, we need \nfor the Iraqi Government to start making decisions to protect their \npeople and project their future in a positive way.\n  I sincerely hope that at the end of next week when we present to the \nPresident the money necessary for the troops, we will also make it \nclear that we are taking a step forward to correct this failed policy \nin Iraq.\n  I might also add that if we are not successful in changing the policy \nwith this bill, it is not the end of the debate. We are 4 months into \nthis new Congress, 4 months since the Democratic majority took control \nof the House and Senate. In a little over 4 months, we have seen a \ndramatic change in the national debate on the war in Iraq. For the last \n4 years, we have been sleepwalking through this policy in this war in \nIraq with few challenges from Capitol Hill. The legislative branch of \nour Federal Government did little or nothing to meet its constitutional \nresponsibility, to challenge the Executive when it came to policy and \nexecution of that policy.\n  Now things have changed. Now, with a Democratic majority in the House \nand the Senate, the debate is underway, as it should be, a debate on \npolicy. I think most Americans would agree that over the last 4 months \nwith this new Congress, we have had a more active and vigorous debate \non Iraq than any time since this war started. That is the way it should \nbe. The American people believe Iraq is the primary issue on which we \nshould focus, and we have, and we will continue to focus on Iraq. Even \nbeyond the supplemental appropriations bill, we will move to a Defense \nauthorization bill and a Defense appropriations bill, giving ample \nopportunity for Members on both sides of the aisle to come up with \nalternatives to deal with this failed policy.\n  In conclusion, there is one key to changing the failed policy in \nIraq. The key to changing the failed policy in Iraq is 11 Republican \nSenators. When 11 Republican Senators reach the point that they want \nthis policy changed, it will happen. We have 49 Democratic Senators who \nhave voted repeatedly to change that policy. Two Republican Senators--\nthe Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, and the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. \nHagel--have stepped forward and joined us on the Democratic side. We \nneed nine more. With nine more Republican Senators, the failed policy \nin Iraq will change. Why does it take so many? It takes 60 votes in the \nSenate to move forward a significant and controversial measure such as \na change of policy in the war in Iraq.\n  I was heartened to learn last week that some Republican House Members \nmet with the President. There were press reports afterward that they \ntold him point blank that they can no longer continue to support his \npolicies. Change has to take place. The President needed to hear that. \nI hope Republican Senators who feel the same way will step forward.\n  It is not enough for them to say we will come up with 11 different \nideas and vote one at a time for each of them. That isn't the way this \nworks. We have to put our minds together and try to find compromise and \ncooperation so that we can serve the best needs of America--not only \nour national security needs but the needs of our troops in the field \nand the needs of the Iraqi people. If 11 Republican Senators will join \nthe 49 Democrats, this policy can change. We will give them that \nopportunity tomorrow with two cloture votes and then beyond that some \nvotes I am sure next week on a conference report when we reach that \nstage in the proceedings, and then in subsequent legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the spirit of \ncompromise and cooperation to try to find ways that we can end this war \nin an honorable way, bring our troops home to the heroes' welcome they \ndeserve, and say to the Iraqi people: The Americans have given you more \nthan any nation could ever ask for. We have given you over 3,300 \nAmerican lives of the best and bravest soldiers in the world. We have \ngiven you 25,000 injured soldiers, some with serious injuries they will \ncarry for a lifetime. We have spent $500 billion. We have stood behind \nyour country as you deposed your dictator, put him on trial, and \nexecuted him. We have stood behind your country when you wrote your \nConstitution and held your elections. We have been there for more than \n4 years. Now it is your turn. Now it is the turn of the Iraqis to step \nforward and guide their nation forward.\n  We need to understand that we won't have a change in policy unless \nthe President agrees to change--and it is unlikely he will--or this \nCongress forces a change. The only way that occurs is when 11 \nRepublican Senators join 49 Democrats to make it happen and make it a \nreality.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time for the majority \nin morning business. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on \nthe Republican side be equally divided among myself, Senator Cornyn, \nand Senator Gregg.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we celebrate anniversaries around here. \nWe find times to look back. Today happens to be the fourth anniversary \nof the Senate passage of the last of the Bush tax cuts. We have heard a \nlot of rhetoric around here about those tax cuts. We heard it in \nadvance, we heard it as they have gone along, we continue to hear it.\n  I thought on the fourth anniversary of the Senate passage of the tax \ncuts it might be a wise idea to spend some time with some facts.\n  Our former colleague, Senator Gramm of Texas, always used to say: I \ntell my children never argue about the facts. Facts are things you can \nlook up. Argue about what the facts might mean, but don't argue about \nthe facts.\n  We don't take his advice as much as I think we should. We spend too \nmuch time arguing about the facts. Let's look them up.\n  One of the things we are told constantly is that since the passage of \nthe tax cuts, the rich have gotten richer, the tax burden has shifted \nfrom the rich to the poor, and that this is terrible and we need to \nreverse that trend. Well, let's look at a few facts. Let's go back to \nthe 8 years prior to the time of the Bush administration and see what \nhappened in terms of the rich getting richer and the poor getting \npoorer.\n\n  While President Clinton was the President, dividing into five \nquintiles, which is what economists do, we see what happened to pretax \nincome. During the Clinton years, in the lowest 20 percent, the bottom \nquintile, pretax income went down. In the second quintile, the pretax \nincome went down. The red bars are prior to Clinton and the blue bars \nare after. In the middle 20th percentile, the pretax income went down. \nIn the second highest quintile, pretax income went down. In the top \nquintile, pretax income went up between the time when Clinton was \nelected and the end of the Clinton administration.\n  Our source for this is the Congressional Budget Office. These are the \nfacts.\n  What has happened since President Bush has been in office? Let's take \na look at the same areas and look with the new data plugged in. It is \nvery interesting.\n  Since Bush has been elected, the lowest quintile has seen their \npretax income go up. The second lowest quintile has seen their pretax \nincome go up. The middle quintile has seen their pretax income go up. \nThe second highest quintile has seen their pretax income go up, but the \ntop quintile, the\n\n[[Page S6083]]\n\ntop 20 percent, has seen their pretax income come down.\n  Once again, the source for these facts is the Congressional Budget \nOffice. On this side of the chart, we see the share of pretax income. \nThis is the number of people to focus on.\n  The share of income is very high for the top 20 percent and low for \nthe bottom 20 percent. So we look at share and ignore the trend if we \nwant to make the case that the tax cuts have been bad for people at the \nbottom. In fact, since Bush has been President, we see things have \ngotten better for people at the bottom.\n  This comes as somewhat of a surprise to those who were advising us \nwhen we passed the Bush tax cuts. I would like to quote from the \nBrookings Institution. They viewed the tax cuts, as they were proposed, \nand they had this cogent statement to make about the future, and I \nquote:\n\n       Our findings suggest that the tax bill will reduce the size \n     of the future economy, raise interest rates, make taxes more \n     regressive, increase tax complexity, and prove fiscally \n     unsustainable. These conclusions question the wisdom and \n     affordability of the tax cut and suggest that Congress \n     reconsider the legislation, especially in light of the \n     economic downturn and terrorist attacks that have occurred \n     last summer.\n\n  Very interesting. Reduce the size of the future economy? Since Bush \nhas been President, the U.S. economy has grown more than the entire \nChinese economy. Under the Bush Presidency, the U.S. economy has grown \n$2.7 trillion in GDP. The total Chinese economy is $2.3 trillion. They \nmissed that one.\n  Raise interest rates? No. Make taxes more regressive? Well, let's \nlook at that one in another chart. Increase tax complexity? I will \ngrant them that. Congress increases tax complexity every time we pass a \nlaw. That is an easy prediction to make. And prove fiscally \nunsustainable? I don't think so.\n  Here is the relative income tax burden by income group, taking the \nspecific prophecy made by the people at the Brookings Institute. The \npeople in the lowest quintile were receiving that much earned income \ntax credit. In other words, their tax payments were negative. They \nreceived money in transfers. Now, since the passage of the tax cut, the \namount of money they have received has been greater. The second lowest \nquintile used to pay a little taxes; now they receive transfer \npayments. The middle quintile paid that much taxes; now they pay less. \nThe second highest quintile, virtually identical, but the trend line is \ndown. Who has paid the most taxes? Who has had the greatest increase in \ntaxes? It is the top 20 percent.\n  At the end of the Clinton administration, this is where it was, and \nat the end of the Bush term, this is where it is. Brookings was wrong \non virtually every point, except their prediction that we would make \nthe tax law more complex. That, as I say, is a prediction one can \nalways make and always be sure of.\n  What about fiscal sustainability? I remember when I ran for \nreelection in 2004, right after the tax cuts, my opponents said, we \nhave to bring down the deficit. The deficit is too high. I said: Not \nonly is it going to come down, it is coming down. We see year after \nyear, since the passage of the tax cuts, that the deficit has shrunk. \nIt has shrunk in absolute dollars and it has shrunk as a percentage of \nGDP. We have the same word out of the Congressional Budget Office and \nOMB at the end of the first quarter.\n  Why would we get a shrinking deficit when we have cut tax rates? The \nanswer lies in the dynamism of the American economy, and we look back \nagain on this anniversary date to see what has happened to people's \npredictions. The red bars are the predictions that the Congressional \nBudget Office made of the amount of revenue we would receive from \ncapital gains. They predicted that the capital gains revenue would stay \nflat or barely increase as a result of the reduction in capital gains \ntax rates.\n  We reduced the capital gains tax rates, and guess what happened. That \nis shown in the blue lines. The capital gains realizations--that is the \nmoney that came in--went up in 2003, higher than the CBO projection. It \nwent up in 2004 even higher. It went up in 2005 even higher. In 2006, \nit knocks your socks off. They had predicted $54 billion in \nrealizations, and the fact is, it was $103 billion. The actual capital \ngains tax receipts were substantially higher than projected by CBO.\n  Well, how can that be? If we cut the tax rates, how can we get more \nrevenue? The answer to that, of course, is a reality that we so often \nforget around here, and that is the economy is not static. The economy \nis not a sum zero game that says: All right, if you cut it here, then \nyou have to see it rise there. If we cut tax rates, we have to see the \ndeficit go up.\n  We have seen exactly the opposite. We have cut tax rates, and we have \nseen the deficit go down. Why? Because people respond to economic \nincentives. When they have an economic incentive to form a new \nbusiness, create a new opportunity, modernize a plant--because they \nwould not have to pay so much in taxes as they previously had to pay--\nthe new business, the new opportunity, the modernized new plant will \ncreate new jobs and creates new income and, therefore, more taxes, more \ntax revenue, even as the tax rates come down.\n  We have seen this historical fact again and again for decades, yet we \ncontinue to ignore it. The computers at the Congressional Budget Office \nare programmed not to take into account the growth in the economy and \nnot to predict this kind of result.\n  So on this anniversary date, I thought I would simply share with the \nSenate a few facts that demonstrate that the tax cuts have been good \nfor America.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to join the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah, Mr. Bennett, who gives, to my mind, one of the most cogent \nand understandable explanations for the economy given around here, and \nI wish to add a few comments about the fourth anniversary of the Jobs \nand Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.\n  While we have a lot of people trained in a lot of disciplines who \nmake their way to the Senate, I daresay there are not very many of us \nwho have a background in economics or accounting or the type of \ndisciplines that would help them make good economic decisions. The good \nnews is that I think the fundamentals are pretty clear when it comes to \nwhat provides people an incentive to work hard and save, and what \nGovernment policies--particularly tax increases--make it harder for \npeople to save their hard-earned money and invest it as they see fit--\nwhether it is spending it on their family, investing in their \nchildren's college education or perhaps buying things that they would \nprefer--rather than having Uncle Sam stick his hand in their pocket and \nspend it on things the Federal Government wants.\n  It is important to go back and highlight some of the challenges our \neconomy was facing when the Senate first passed this protaxpayer \nlegislation 4 years ago. The economy was hit with not just a one-two \npunch but with a one-two-three punch. We were dealing with the fallout \nfrom the corporate accounting scandals of the late 1990s, the bursting \ntech bubble and, of course, the horrific attacks of September 11, 2001. \nAll these events combined would have knocked out any other economy in \nthe world. But because we acted with well-timed tax relief that put \nmoney back in the pockets of working men and women, small businesses \nand entrepreneurs, our economy bounced back. Indeed, our economy has \nroared back.\n  The 2003 act accelerated a number of individual and small business \ntax relief provisions Congress passed 2 years earlier. We allowed \nparents to take the $1,000 tax credit sooner. We accelerated relief \nfrom higher marginal tax rates--the marriage tax penalty and the \nalternative minimum tax. This legislation, passed 4 years ago, provided \ncapital gains and dividends tax relief, which has helped increase \neconomic activity and fill the Federal Government's coffers.\n  How could it be that Federal revenue has seen historic highs even as \nwe cut taxes 4 years ago? Well, it is for all the obvious reasons: \nPeople respond to financial incentives when they know they are going to \nbe able to keep more of what they earn. They work harder, risk takers \nand entrepreneurs invest in ventures that generate revenue not only for \nthem--and create new jobs--but generate a lot more revenue for\n\n[[Page S6084]]\n\nUncle Sam as well. That is exactly what happened here.\n  Since 2004, Government revenues have outpaced projections by the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and the deficit this year \ncould tumble to $150 billion, or about 1 percent of our Nation's gross \ndomestic product. Things such as bonus depreciation and the $100,000 \nexpensing provision have allowed entrepreneurs and small businesses to \ngrow and create jobs. This tax relief has helped produce 22 straight \nquarters of growth, with 7.8 million new jobs over the past 44 \nconsecutive months. That is an outstanding accomplishment, which makes \nAmerica the envy of the world, and it is a trend we must continue as we \nface significant fiscal challenges ahead.\n  We can and we should take great pride in the economy's performance \nand look with optimism toward the future. As we move forward, the last \nthing we should consider is reversing the policies that have generated \nthis kind of beneficial economic activity and created so many jobs in \nAmerica. Unfortunately, this tax relief will soon expire, resulting in \na tax increase for all taxpayers without a single vote on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  The other side is now pushing a budget that will result in a $736 \nbillion tax hike for taxpayers over the next 5 years. This, unless it \nis reversed, will not only jeopardize future economic growth but also \nthe financial well-being of millions of Americans--families, small \nbusinesses, and seniors. If Congress fails to make this tax relief \npermanent, the fourth anniversary of which we are celebrating today, \nevery American taxpayer will see their taxes go up. For instance, a \nfamily of four with two children, making $50,000 in annual income, \nwould see an increase of $2,092 a year in their tax bill, or a 132-\npercent hike.\n\n  Four years ago, many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nargued that the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 \nwould not only not benefit our economy, they actually said it would \nendanger the economy. For example, the now-majority whip said:\n\n       The Republicans who push this tax plan have to face \n     stubborn facts, and facts can be stubborn. The last time they \n     got a tax cut through, the American economy fell backwards. \n     We did not make progress. We lost jobs. We lost opportunity. \n     We lost a lot of hope in this country.\n\n  There is one thing I agree with the distinguished majority whip \nabout, and that is facts are, indeed, stubborn things. Four years ago, \nthe Senate voted for hope and against fear. It voted for progress and \nagainst stagnation. It voted for the entrepreneurial spirit and against \ncommand and control out of Washington, DC.\n  I think 4 years later we all have seen and can celebrate tremendous \nresults as an outcome of this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from Texas for \nhis elegant statement and accurate statement. I want to pick up where \nthe Senator has left off.\n  The Senator talks about the facts--and this is a fact--that revenues \nto the Federal Government have jumped dramatically in the last 3 years. \nIn fact, in the last 3 years we have seen more revenues flowing into \nthe Federal Government than ever in history, and the percentage of \nincrease in those revenues has also been historic. As this chart \nclearly shows, we are now seeing revenues to the Federal Government \nwhich actually exceed the historic revenues to this Government. \nHistorically, the Federal Government has gotten about 18.2 percent of \nthe gross national product in revenue. Today we are up around 18.5 \npercent. We are headed towards 18.7 percent. That is a significant \nincrease in revenues to the Federal Government.\n  What effect does that have? As the Senator from Texas said, it has \nhad a dramatic effect on the deficit. Because we have gotten all this \nadditional revenue, it has caused the deficit to drop dramatically.\n  The other side of the aisle argues: So what. Taxes are still too low \non Americans. We should raise the taxes on Americans. So they brought \nout a budget which is going to increase taxes on Americans by about \n$700 billion. It is the largest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry, should that budget actually come to fruition--and it looks \nlike it is going to pass, and I assume they are going to follow up on \nit. They mean what they say, on the other side of the aisle.\n  What will that do to Federal revenues, that dramatic increase in \ntaxes? What will that do to the economy? We are not sure, but we \nsuspect it will slow the economy dramatically. Some of these great \ngains that we have seen in the economy, the 22 months of expansion, the \n7.4 million new jobs, may be significantly impacted by that type of a \ntax increase.\n  We also know it will create a Tax Code that is taking a lot more \nmoney out of Americans who work hard. We happen to believe, on our side \nof the aisle, we should let Americans keep the money they earn as much \nas possible, have a fair tax system, and as a result generate a benefit \nto working Americans by saying: Listen, if you are going to work hard, \nwe are going to give you more money. We are also going to get more \nrevenues, which is the way this has worked out.\n  Why have we gotten more revenues even though we reduced the tax \nburden on the American people? The answer is pretty simple. It is \ncalled human nature. When you set tax levels at a fair level--which is \nwhat we have today--people are willing to go out and invest. They are \nwilling to go out and take risks. They are willing to work harder \nbecause they know they are going to get to keep more of what they earn. \nWhat does that do? That creates a stronger economy which puts more \npeople to work, and that is what we want, more jobs for people and, of \ncourse, the more jobs you have the more tax revenues you end up \ngetting.\n  In addition, especially in the area of capital gains, if you have a \nfair capital gains rate, which is what we have today, it causes people \nto go out and sell an investment which they might otherwise hold on to. \nIf a person has an asset, say, a home or small business or stock, they \ndon't want to sell that asset when they are going to have to pay 30 \npercent or 25 percent in taxes on that sale because they don't want to \nhave to pay all those taxes for that asset they spent their whole life \nbuilding up, trying to make ends meet, trying to create a nest egg for \nthemselves. When you put a fair capital gains rate on that sale, which \nis today 15 percent--which is the fair rate which was put into place by \nPresident Bush's proposals--then people are willing to go out and sell \nthat asset.\n  When they sell that asset, what happens? Two things which are very \ngood for the Federal Government happen. No. 1, capital gains occur so \nwe get revenues; otherwise, we would not get those revenues because \npeople would just sit on those assets; they are not going to sell them \nand pay the high tax rate. When you have a fair tax rate, they sell \nthem, the Federal Government gets the revenues, and the second thing \nthat happens is they take that new money they have from the sale of \nthat asset and reinvest it. By human nature, they reinvest it in \nsomething that is more productive. So you have a more productive \nsociety, where capital assets are being used more effectively, and as a \nresult you get this great job creation and this economic growth.\n  In fact, in the area of capital gains, we have seen a dramatic \nincrease in revenues. Capital gains have increased over what the \nprojection was by CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, by 47 percent. \nIt is a huge jump in revenues we didn't expect--or at least the \nCongressional Budget Office didn't expect--but which we received \nbecause human nature kicked in and people were willing to sell \nassets, take that money and reinvest it in things that are productive, \ncreate jobs, and as a result we got those revenues. That is why today \nthe Federal Government is actually getting more in revenues than it got \nunder the old tax law where the rates were a lot higher. That is why we \nhave gotten more economic expansion, more jobs. That is the good news.\n\n  From the other side of the aisle we hear this constant patter: The \nrich are not paying enough taxes, and these tax laws are \ndisproportionate in their application. I think we need to talk about \nthat a little bit because let's see what has happened as a result of \nreducing these tax rates.\n\n[[Page S6085]]\n\n  Basically, what has happened is that even with the lower tax rates \ntoday, wealthy people are paying more in revenues to the Federal \nGovernment than at any time in history. Today the top 20 percent of \npeople in this country who have income are paying about 85 percent of \nthe tax burden.\n  Let me restate that. The top 20 percent of people with income in this \ncountry are paying 85 percent of the Federal tax burden. Under the \nClinton years, the top 20 percent of people with income paid 81 percent \nof the Federal tax burden. So even though we have cut rates, we have \nactually created more revenues from high-income individuals.\n  Again, you are going to say: How does that happen? Again, it is \ncalled human nature. If you have a high-income situation, individuals \nwith a high income, they could either invest in opportunities which are \ngoing to produce taxable events or not produce taxable events. They \nhave the position to do that. So if you have a fair tax rate they will \ntake the risk. They will make the decision. They will be the \nentrepreneurs who create the job. As a result, they will make an \ninvestment which is taxable. But if you have a tax rate that is too \nhigh, which is what the other side of the aisle likes to have, then you \nbasically create an atmosphere where these folks are going to go out \nand invest a fair amount of their money in things that are tax \navoidance, legal tax avoidance but tax avoidance. They are going to \ninvest in nontaxable events, stocks and bonds that do not generate \nincome to them that is taxable.\n  What we have done is we have created a tax law where essentially \nhigh-income people are willing to go out and take risks and do it in a \ntaxable way that generates revenue back to the United States. As a \nresult, we have the top 20 percent of American income earners pay more \nin taxes today, significantly more than they did under the Clinton \nyears.\n  The alternative is also fairly interesting. At the low end of the \nincome scale, the bottom 40 percent of people who have income do not \nbasically pay income taxes. Obviously, they pay withholding taxes, but \nas a practical matter that segment of our society pays virtually \nnothing in income taxes. They get money back, in fact, on the earned-\nincome tax credit and other benefits the Federal Government puts in \nplace.\n  Under the law today, under President Bush's law, those bottom 40 \npercent of income earners are now getting about twice as much back from \nthe Federal Government as they did under the Clinton years. So what is \nthe combined effect of these two facts, of these two things? The tax \nlaw--even though we are generating a lot more revenue for the Federal \nGovernment, even though we are well over that mean number of 18.2 \npercent of gross national product, even though we have had jumps in \nrevenue of 11 percent, 9 percent, 15 percent--we actually have a tax \nlaw today that is generating more revenue but is also more progressive. \nHigh-income individuals are paying more of the tax burden. Low-income \npeople are getting more money back from the Federal Government.\n  There is another factor that needs to be pointed out, and that is \nwhat is happening to senior citizens. Senior citizens \ndisproportionately benefit from a low dividend tax rate. Why? It is \nlogical, obviously. Most seniors are retired. If they have income, it \nis going to be Social Security, some pension program, or dividends, and \nmost pension programs also involve dividends. So senior citizens are \nreally the people who are benefiting the most from a low dividend tax \nrate. Yet the folks on the other side of the aisle have just passed a \nbudget where they want to jump the tax rate on dividends by 100 \npercent. They want to go from a 15-percent tax rate to a 30-percent tax \nrate on dividends. Who are they going to hit? They are going to hit \nsenior citizens, primarily. That is the people they are going to hit.\n  If you look at the proposals from the other side of the aisle, they \ncome out of a 1930s philosophy of economics, which was pretty soundly \nrejected in the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s, but they \nare still attracted to it.\n  It is a theory that says you just raise taxes. The Federal Government \nwill get more money, and we will spend it for you. In other words, \nthere is a theory that says we are smarter than you. We have been \nelected to the Senate. We are good members of the Democratic Party. We \nknow more than you know. Therefore, we should take your money and we \nshould spend it for you and we can spend it more effectively than you \ncan spend it.\n  That is a philosophy that should and has been rejected as we move \ntoward a much more market-oriented economy. It is also a philosophy \nthat presumes the higher taxes always generate more revenue to the \nFederal Government, which is not true. Higher taxes, actually, in many \ninstances reduce revenues to the Federal Government because they reduce \neconomic activity. They certainly reduce expansion of the economy, and \nthey reduce the creation of jobs.\n  Three Presidents have proved beyond any reasonable doubt when you \nlower income tax rates, you generate economic expansion because people \nare just people. They just have common sense. If they know they are \ngoing to be able to keep more of their money, they are willing to go \nout and work harder to get more money. But they also know if the \nFederal Government is going to take more of their money, and a \ndisproportionate amount of their money, they are not going to work \nquite so hard. They are not going to take that risk. They are not going \nto create that restaurant or open that little small business, create \nthose jobs, because they don't want to have to pay all of their money \nto the Federal Government.\n  President Kennedy knew that and that is why he cut income tax rates \nand was successful in generating revenue to the Federal Government. \nPresident Reagan knew that and he cut income tax rates. As a result, \nthe revenue to the Federal Government jumped and the economy expanded. \nPresident Bush has shown it once again: Cut income tax rates, expand \nthe economy, and as a result get a fair tax level and human nature \nkicks in and revenues flow into the Federal Treasury.\n  What is unique about President Bush's initiatives is that at the same \ntime he has cut rates, he created this much more progressive system \nwhich I just outlined. The fact that high-income taxpayers are now \npaying so much more of the Federal share of income taxes than they did \nunder the Clinton years, and lower income individuals are getting much \nmore back than they did under the Clinton years, makes for a more \nprogressive system. It also disproportionately benefits senior \ncitizens, people on fixed incomes, because of the dividend rate.\n  Unfortunately, though, we now have the Democrats presenting to us a \nbudget which wants to take us to the French path, which essentially is \ngoing to dramatically increase the cost to the Federal Government, to \nAmericans, and as a result dramatically increase the tax level on \nAmericans. We will go down that path that France has gone down.\n  I have to tell you, it doesn't work in France. Productivity is not up \nin France. Jobs are not being created in France. People don't want to \ngo out and work harder in France. And they certainly do not have a more \nprogressive or effective economic system than we have in the United \nStates.\n  I think we should reject the Democratic approach under their budget \nof raising taxes and stay with this tax law that is raising so much new \nrevenue and is so progressive and has such a strong benefit for senior \ncitizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey).

Under the previous order, the time until 11:45 \na.m. shall be equally divided for debate with respect to amendment No. \n1090 between the Senator from California and the Senator from Oklahoma \nor their designees.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry because I \ndon't know when my ranking member will be here. Do I understand the \nChair correctly that I would have 15 minutes and he would have 15 \nminutes, so I should conclude my remarks after such time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 13 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Presiding Officer please let me know when that \ntime has come?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 2007 is on the floor of the Senate and that Members \non both sides of the aisle are very supportive of this legislation. \nThis legislation authorizes the projects and policies of the Civil \nWorks Program of the Army Corps of Engineers. Again, it has very strong \nsupport across party lines.\n  I think it is important for the Senate to know, as well as the \nAmerican people, that this bill is long overdue. Seven years ago, we \npassed the last WRDA bill. What does that mean? It means that very \nimportant flood control projects, wetlands restoration, environmental \nprojects, clean water projects--so many of these projects have been \ndelayed. When we are talking about the Nation's economy and public \nsafety and the environment, these are things we all want to address. We \naddress them in this bill. The beauty of it is that although Senator \nInhofe and I have some deep differences on issues, this is one bill we \nboth strongly support, and across the board we see support.\n  Every day I have come to the floor to talk about WRDA. I have \nstressed the strong support in the country for this legislation. I read \nyesterday from various letters of support. I want to call to Senators' \nattention--when they arrive to vote on the first amendment, which I \nhope we will all be opposing, or at least the vast majority of us--on \ntheir desks they will find, due to the good work of our pages, the \nletters of support I referred to yesterday. We have an amazing \ncoalition. We have the National Association of Manufacturers supporting \nthis bill. We have the American Farm Bureau Federation supporting this \nlegislation, with a direct letter. We have a letter from the National \nWaterways Conference supporting this bill. We have the Audubon Society \nsupporting this legislation. For those who may not be aware, it is a \nsociety of more than 1 million members and supporters who work very \nhard to restore America's natural resources. We have them supporting \nthis bill. We have the American Society of Civil Engineers supporting \nthis bill. We have the National Construction Alliance, which is made up \nof the Laborers International Union, the International Union of \nOperating Engineers, and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and \nJoiners of America. This is about as broad a coalition as we can have. \nIt concludes with a letter from the Associated General Contractors of \nAmerica. We have a bill that, as the National Construction Alliance \nsays, is a $13.9 billion authorization of Corps projects which is a \nnecessary first step in addressing our country's serious backlog of \nwater projects, from harbor improvement, to flood protection, to lock \nand dam construction, dredging, and environmental infrastructure.\n\n  That is what we address in this very important bill.\n  We certainly have many contentious debates on the floor of this \nSenate. We are going to have one again on Iraq. It tugs at the \nheartstrings. It is very difficult. But this is one piece of \nlegislation which should not be difficult for us. Senator Inhofe and I \nshare a commitment to shoring up our Nation's infrastructure, including \nour water resources. We have a true partnership on this issue. I hope \ncolleagues will join with us, as we work through the amendments. There \nwill be some amendments we can support, but we have made a pact that \neven if there are some amendments each of us individually supports, if \nthe four top members of the Environment and Public Works Committee have \nnot agreed on them, we will be forced to vote no. This is not a \npleasant situation for either of us. We think it is the way to maintain \nthe delicate balance of the legislation, because the bill is a product \nof bipartisanship.\n  I mentioned the other two members of the committee who have worked so \nhard, Senators Baucus and Isakson. I thank them.\n  The whole country is looking to see what we do to help the victims of \nHurricane Katrina and what we do to move forward so that we don't see \nanother tragedy as we witnessed recently. About 25 percent of this bill \nis directed at Louisiana. We have gone very far to meet their needs. We \ndo understand we haven't done 100 percent of what they need, but there \nwill be other WRDAs, and there may well be a couple of amendments on \nwhich we can move forward. We don't know at this particular point.\n  We have waited 7 long years for this bill. We are going to be having \na vote at a quarter of 12.\n  Before I yield to my good friend and colleague, the ranking member of \nthe committee, for his comments, I hope everyone will join in voting no \non the Coburn amendment. What he does in his amendment is, he has \ndecided--and he is here in the Chamber now--that one of the projects in \nCalifornia should wait until another project in California is totally \nfunded.\n  I call this amendment the Russian roulette amendment because the \nproject he wants to delay is an important project in the San Diego \narea. It is the city of Imperial Beach. There is a very important \nproject the Corps is recommending where the local match will be paid--\nthe initial stages, 30 percent; the final stages, 50 percent. We are \ntalking about protecting 2,083 businesses. There are 812 nonrental \nproperty businesses and 1,271 rental properties. We are talking about \n22 retail businesses, 217 businesses located along the beachfront, 195 \nare rental, and 19 businesses near the shoreline. What we are talking \nabout doing is a project that is so cost-effective, it has met every \ncriteria. It has gone through every phase. We received a letter from \nthe mayor which clearly states they will be picking up their share.\n  This is a project which needs to move forward. You don't say to \nsomebody in the southern part of a State: You don't deserve this flood \nprotection until someone in the northern part of the State gets flood \nprotection. We have to do it all. This is the United States of America. \nCalifornia, if we were a nation, would be the fifth largest economy in \nthe world.\n  All Members have a right to their opinion and a right to offer \namendments. I support my colleague's right to do so. But it is \nabsolutely wrong. He will present it as some kind of a beach project. \nHe makes it sound as if what we are doing is protecting a beach.\n\n[[Page S6087]]\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. We are using the replenishment \nin this project as a way to absorb the floodwaters.\n  I will speak for a minute on this later. I hope we will have a \nresounding ``no'' vote. Every Member has a right to say what he or she \nthinks belongs in this bill. But this bill has gone through a rigorous \nprocess. We don't have anything in here that doesn't meet the criteria. \nSenator Inhofe was very strong on that. I agreed with him completely.\n  With my time waning, I yield the floor and look forward to a strong \n``no'' vote on the Coburn amendment in 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield myself such time as I may consume. As I \nunderstand, we are now dividing time equally between the junior Senator \nfrom Oklahoma and the committee; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 3 minutes 20 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We have a total of 3 minutes left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 3 minutes 20 \nseconds. The junior Senator from Oklahoma has 13 minutes. The time is \ndivided between Senator Coburn and Senator Boxer. Senator Coburn has 13 \nminutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The main thing I want to get across, I can't get across \nin 3 minutes. But I can tell you right now--and by the way, the reason \nI wasn't here earlier is that I have been, in the last 3 days, in Iraq. \nAnd by the way, good things are happening there in spite of what the \npress will tell you.\n  I came back somewhat shocked to see some of these amendments because, \nquite frankly, a lot of people don't understand the process. I don't \nwant anyone out there watching what we are doing today saying that we \nare killing some useless project. It has nothing to do with that. This \nis an authorization bill. I will make this clear, but I can't do it in \nthis time unless the Senator from Oklahoma would like to yield 5 \nminutes of his time.\n  Mr. COBURN. Sure.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n  The amendment we will be talking about is the Imperial Beach \namendment. I have to remind my colleagues, as I did in the steering \ncommittee last Thursday, this is not an appropriations bill. What we \nare doing here today is not going to change anything at all in terms of \nmoney. I don't want anyone thinking we will have some useless project \nor spend money on it. We are not doing it with this bill today. We may \nbe doing it in the future. We may be doing it when the appropriations \nbills come up. I may be opposing it at that time.\n\n  But all we are doing through the WRDA bill is we allow ourselves the \nopportunity to make sure there is some level of discipline in putting \nprojects forward that people will eventually be voting on. They are not \ngoing to be voting on them today. This is the authorization process.\n  Now, we have criteria. We have to have an engineer's report from the \nCorps of Engineers. It has to say it is economically feasible, it takes \ncare of the environmental problems--all these things--and it ensures \nthere is cost sharing.\n  Let me tell you what would happen if we did not do this. If we did \nnot do it, and we had everyone coming up, swapping out their deals, and \nsaying: I have a project over here; it is my sweetheart project; the \nCorps of Engineers has never been there. We don't care. No one has ever \nevaluated it, but this is my humble opinion, since we are here in \nWashington making all these decisions in violation of what people back \nhome want. Then we will have a project.\n  That is the alternative. This is the same as the transportation \nauthorization bill. There we had criteria where we would talk about the \nqualifications of various projects, and they would have to be in that \ncriteria. Then we would bring it up later on and decide whether we were \ngoing to fund these things.\n  Now, on the project that is going to take place at Imperial Beach, it \nwas authorized. The Corps recommended this storm damage reduction \nproject because it is technically sound, economically justified, \nenvironmentally acceptable, and it will have the local cost share.\n  I have a letter from the mayor of Imperial Beach saying this is what \nthey want out there. It may not be what they want in Washington, but \nthis is what they want.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        City of Imperial Beach, CA\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                                    July 18, 2002.\n     Colonel Richard G. Thompson,\n     Los Angeles District Engineer, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, \n         Los Angeles, CA.\n       Dear Colonel Thompson: This letter should serve as a formal \n     indication of interest and intent by the City of Imperial \n     Beach to proceed with the recommended project indicated in \n     the Silver Strand Shoreline, Imperial Beach, California Draft \n     General Reevaluation Report dated, June 2002.\n       The City of Imperial Beach is willing and able to provide \n     all non-Federal requirements of the project including 36% of \n     the cost to construct the initial project and 50% of the \n     construction costs for each renourishment cycle.\n       It is anticipated that funds for the local share of initial \n     construction will come from $4.2 million currently earmarked \n     for this project in the California State Department of \n     Boating and Waterways FY 2002/2003 budget.\n       We thank you for your continued interest in this worthwhile \n     project.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Diane Rose,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Hopefully, when we get down toward the end of the debate, \nafter I hear what my colleague says about this issue, I will use more \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Boxer in \nopposition to the Coburn amendment. This amendment limits our ability \nto appropriate funding to projects in our State, and I would ask all \nSenators to vote against the amendment.\n  My colleagues may remember that during consideration of the fiscal \nyear 2006 emergency supplemental, we had an extended debate over flood \ncontrol projects in the bill for California because Senator Coburn \noffered an amendment to strip them out of the bill. I understand that \nyesterday, Senator Coburn acknowledged that he made a mistake in \nopposing the Sacramento River Bank project, which he now believes was \nlegitimate emergency funding. However, he has now offered another \namendment affecting California and this same project.\n  Senator Coburn's amendment would require that the Army Corps complete \nits work on the Sacramento riverbank flood control project before it \ncan begin any work on the Imperial Beach replenishment project. These \ntwo projects are separated by 500 miles and have no relation to each \nother, except that both protect homes and families.\n  I would like to briefly discuss these two projects. The Sacramento \nriver bank flood protection project is a long-term levee restoration \nproject. The project area is along 210 miles of the Sacramento River \nthat is constantly at risk of erosion. Areas protected by the levees \ncomprise over 1 million acres, 50 communities, $38 billion worth of \nimprovements, and approximately 2.3 million people.\n  The Corps of Engineers is dangerously close to the ceiling set in the \ncurrent authorization, with many more projects to be done. Senator \nBoxer and I support language in this bill to increase the Corps' \nauthorization by another 80,000 linear feet. It will be several years \nbefore the Corps will reach that threshold if we are able to fund the \nproject at full capability annually.\n  Yesterday, Senator Coburn referred to our discussion last year and \nthat I had said that life and property lay in the balance with the \nrestoration of these levees. I would say to my colleagues that \nstatement also holds true on other projects to protect homes in a \ndifferent part of my State that Senator Coburn will inhibit with this \namendment.\n  Imperial Beach is a small city adjacent to the U.S./Mexico border and \njust south of San Diego Bay and the naval installations on Coronado. \nIts beach, the Silver Strand, is losing 100,000 cubic yards of sand per \nyear, corresponding to a loss of 6.6 feet of beach.\n\n[[Page S6088]]\n\nSo much shoreline has been lost that there is no longer dry beach at \nhigh tide, leaving only a small embankment between the ocean and homes. \nAt the current retreat rate, the shoreline could reach homes within the \nyear. A high-tide storm event in Imperial Beach could affect 3,000 \nhomes within 3 blocks of the coast. Already these homes have \nexperienced flooding and structural damage and the soil is highly \nerosive and receding--the problem in Imperial Beach is now, and we \ncannot wait years to address it.\n  The problem is that the beach is no longer the recipient of sand from \nits natural sources. First, there is a lack of sediment transfer from \nthe Tijuana River because of three dams, two on the American side and \none on the Mexican side, which have stopped the historical flow of \nsediment to the shoreline. Second, the Army Corps-built jetty that \nprotects San Diego harbor also disrupts the flow of sand.\n  Yesterday, Senator Coburn stated that he believes the replenishment \nof this beach is a State responsibility. As we all know, all of these \nprojects are cost-shared with the State or localities involved. The \nState of California already has $4.2 million on the table for this \nproject as soon as it is authorized. So the State's commitment is \nthere.\n  The residents and local government are also doing their fair share to \nshoulder the costs. The Army Corps of Engineers has determined that \nevery dollar spent avoiding storm damage through beach nourishment will \nsave taxpayers close to $2.00. The total net benefit this project \nprovides due to annual costs from structural damage due to erosion, \nwave attack, or inundation costs, utility relocation costs, land loss, \ncleanup costs and other items related to the loss of sand will be at \nleast $1.8 million.\n  There are hundreds of very important projects authorized in this \nbill, and many States have multiple projects. This amendment would set \nthe dangerous precedent of requiring vital projects to wait until other \nprojects in the same State are completed. Not only does this have the \npotential to increase Federal costs if we have to respond to disasters \nthat could have been prevented, but it removes our discretion to \nevaluate projects independently, regardless of where they are located.\n  Senator Coburn has now decided that securing levees in my State is a \nhigh priority. It certainly is. However, I do not agree with him that \nhomes and families behind river levees are more important than homes \nand families behind an ocean beach. I hope that my colleagues will join \nwith us to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, to make sure everybody understands, this \nis not an amendment that eliminates this project. As I complimented the \nSenator from California and the Senator from Oklahoma yesterday, the \nidea behind this amendment is to make priorities.\n  What do we know? We know the Corps has a $58 billion backlog right \nnow. That is 27\\1/2\\ years of work at the way the Corps is funded now. \nAll this amendment says is, if you are in a family and you need a new \nroof, and you want to build a swimming pool, probably most American \nfamilies are going to put the roof on before they build the swimming \npool.\n  Sacramento has 1.8 million people. It is the largest city in this \ncountry at risk for flood damage. The canals and levees up there need \nto be reworked. All this amendment says is before we restore beaches--\nby the way, let me give a little background. The last time there was \nany flood damage at Imperial Beach was 1988. The total damage was \n$500,000 in 1988.\n  What we do know is, when you restore the sand, one winter storm will \nwipe it all out. That is why this is a 50-year project. This is planned \nto restore sand after sand after sand after sand for the next 50 years. \nIt may be the right thing to do, but in terms of making a choice about \npriorities, wouldn't we think that before we restore sand that is going \nto be washed away by the next winter storm, maybe we ought to ensure \nourselves that the people in Sacramento are safe. So this does not \neliminate this project.\n  I also go back to the history on this project. What is the Corps' No. \n1 way of fixing this project? It is not to continue to pump sand onto \nthe beach. It is to have an extended growing out until the beach \nredevelops and replenishes itself, which was proposed and never \nfinalized before they completed the environmental impact statement on \nit. That is the way to restore the sand to the beach in a natural way.\n  So what we have is we are going to take a low-priority item--very \nhigh-priority item for some of the people of Imperial Beach, CA, not \nall of them--we were submitted a letter yesterday by a large group of \npeople who oppose this--and we are going to say that is as important in \nterms of authorization as fixing the levee system in Sacramento. It is \nnot.\n  All this amendment says is before you start spending money on \nrestoring sand that is going to be washed away by the next winter \nstorm, you ought to fix the levees where you have 1.8 million people at \nreal risk for flood. It is the largest city in the United States at \nrisk. It has a greater risk of flood than New Orleans. It has an 85-\nyear risk compared to a 250-year risk in New Orleans.\n  By this amendment, we are not saying do not do this. We are saying, \nlet's add some priorities. Let's fix what is wrong in a major levee \nsystem first. Let's have, in this bill, that we are going to choose a \npriority rather than to send all this to the Corps, which is 27 years \nbehind right now on their projects--will be another 7\\1/2\\ to 8 years \nafter this bill passes--and say, on the way of priorities, the priority \nthat ought to go first is fixing the levee system in Sacramento. It is \nnot to degrade that this is not needed. I am not saying it is not \nneeded. I am saying, with limited funds, we ought to have a priority.\n  Many people will argue they will make that decision at the \nAppropriations Committee. The authorizing bill right now is on the \nfloor. I support many of the projects in this bill. But I think a case \ncan be made, and the American people would demand, we cannot quit \nducking priorities. It is easy to say to do everything, as the Senator \nfrom California said yesterday. The only problem with that is, we \ncannot do everything. We cannot do everything, so we have to make a \nchoice. We ought to do those things that will protect the most people, \nsolve the biggest problems first, and then work to the smaller \nproblems.\n  In 1988 was the last time we ever had any storm damage at Imperial \nBeach, CA. It was in the midst of storm damage that was less than \n$500,000. We are going to be talking about in excess of $20 million for \nthis beach at the same time we have levees that need to be reworked and \nreaffirmed in Sacramento.\n  This amendment is common sense. Let's do what is most important \nfirst, and when we have done that, then go do this. Let's do not do \nthem both at the same time, quite frankly, because it will never happen \nat the same time, because we only have $2 billion a year for the Corps \nnow and there are hundreds of projects in this country that should be \ndone before this project.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there has been some misinformation. The \nlast flooding and very bad winter storm was in 2004, and we have all \nthat documented--in the hundreds of thousands of dollars--in this area. \nI understand Senator Coburn wants to substitute his opinion for the \nopinion of the Corps, but I want to go through, with my colleagues who \nmight be listening to this debate, how many steps this project has \nalready been through, as have all the projects we have agreed to fund.\n  So the WRDA bill is 7 years in the making.\n  Mr. President, will you tell me when I have 1 minute remaining \nbecause I want to yield that minute to Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are at 1:10 now.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, 1:10 remaining? I thought I had 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Inhofe used a minute of that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be given \nan additional 3 minutes, and the same for Senator Coburn, if he wishes \nto respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6089]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am going to take 2 minutes, and then we will see if \nSenator Coburn wants to respond, and then we will give the last minute \nto Senator Inhofe.\n  There is a lot of misinformation about the flooding here. There is \nalso the implication that this is not an important project, when I have \nalready pointed out how many businesses are at risk, how many \nresidences.\n\n  This project has gone through so many steps. First, the local people \nsaid: We want to step forward and pay toward solving this problem. \nThen, the Corps said: You are right. Let's do a cost-benefit study and \nsee if it makes sense for Federal dollars to go into the mix. Well, it \ncame back: Absolutely. Then they said: What is the best type of \nproject? Should we build walls? What should we do? No. They said: The \nbest type of project is to utilize the sand as a natural barrier to \nthese floods.\n  What we are desperately trying to do is complete this project because \nwe are very concerned we could have even a worse problem than we had in \n2004.\n  As much as I respect my colleague, I feel his judgment is not \nsomething I can accept. I cannot look in the eyes of the people who \nhave been fighting for this project since 2003 and say to them they do \nnot deserve to get any attention paid to their problem until Sacramento \nis taken care of.\n  I have to say to my friend, in going after this project the way he \nis, it seems to me he is picking one project out of a hat, which is \nextremely disturbing.\n  Mr. President, I know there are those who need to go over to the \nWhite House, so I will stop my discussion. I think I have enough \ninformation in the Record to have colleagues join with me.\n  I say, if Senator Coburn has anything to add at this time, I will \nreserve the minute for Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am not going after the project. The \nproject stays. I think the Senator from California misses the point. \nThis beach had restoration done by the city last year. It washed away. \nThe sand they put up there will wash away. It is a temporary fix to a \nlong-term program. That is why they have a 50-year authorization for \nrestoring this beach, because it is going to continue to wash away \nbecause they are not fixing it in the way the Corps originally \nrecommended it be fixed.\n  It is not about picking on this project. It is about, again, \nshouldn't we have priorities? Isn't it more important to fix Sacramento \nand the levee system there than this particular project, which has been \nrepaired of late by the city with their own funds? I am not saying we \nshould eliminate it; I am saying we should not do this until we have \ndone the other things that are higher priority on the Corps' list, \nwhich No. 1 in my mind, besides what we need to do in Louisiana, is to \nrestore the levee system in Sacramento.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, is the Senator yielding back time?\n  All right. In deference to some other things that are going on right \nnow, I will go ahead and yield back my time at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1090.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the \nSenator from Ohio, (Mr. Brown), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama), and the Senator from \nWest Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller), are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint), the Senator from North Carolina (Mrs. Dole), the Senator South \nCarolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson), and the \nSenator from Arizona, (Mr. McCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from North Carolina \n(Mrs. Dole) would have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 12, nays 77, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 163 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--12\n\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Gregg\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Sessions\n     Smith\n     Sununu\n\n                                NAYS--77\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--11\n\n     Biden\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Graham\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     McCain\n     Obama\n     Rockefeller\n  The amendment (No. 1090) was rejected.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Let's not tinker with this bill unless there is pretty \nquick agreement on both sides that it is the right kind of amendment. \nThis wasn't the right kind of amendment. We appreciate this vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 p.m. today, \nSenator Cardin be recognized to call up amendment No. 1072; that once \nthe amendment is reported by number, there be 5 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Cardin, and that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the amendment be withdrawn; that the Senate then resume \nconsideration of the Coburn amendment No. 1089, and there be 2 minutes \nof debate prior to a vote in relation to the amendment; that upon \ndisposition of the Coburn amendment No. 1089, the Senate consider the \nFeingold amendment No. 1086, and there be 5 minutes of debate prior to \na vote in relation to the amendment, with all debate time equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form; that prior to a vote in \nrelation to the amendments covered in this agreement, no intervening \namendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nMembers be recognized to speak as in morning business: Senators Dodd, \nInouye, Alexander, and Levin and that after that the Senate stand in \nrecess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am speaking today, as I have for the past \n26 years, at the desk my father used during his 12 years as a Member of \nthe Senate, from 1959 to 1971. I would like to think that this surface \nstill bears some of the marks he might have made in an idle moment. As \nhe did almost 50 years ago, I too have etched my name in this desk \ndrawer.\n\n[[Page S6090]]\n\n  Today I rise to speak of my father, for it was on this day, May 15, \n1907, 100 years ago, that my father was born. I have two young \ndaughters, Grace and Christina. They never knew their grandfather. For \nmy girls, he is a painting that hangs in my office, photos in our home, \nor stories over dinner.\n  I try to explain, as parents and grandparents do, what their \ngrandfather meant to me, who he was, what he did. I must say, it is \nhard to find the words. Some of my father's 12 grandchildren were lucky \nenough to know him. Even so, memory fades; but on this day, his 100th \nbirthday, I wish to call up his memory as a gift to you, his \ngrandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren.\n  Like so many of his generation, born in the early years of the last \ncentury, my father, Thomas Dodd, had to overcome hardships--the death \nof his mother at an early age, the collapse of his father's business, \nthe Depression years. Yet so much like his generation, hard jolts and \ntrying experiences transformed and molded a man who would make a \nsignificant contribution to his country and our world.\n  As the Connecticut State director of the National Youth \nAdministration in the early days of the New Deal at the height of the \nGreat Depression, he helped young men and women find work--any work. As \nan FBI agent and then lawyer in the Justice Department, your \ngrandfather and great-grandfather pursued notorious gangsters and \nprosecuted those who denied others their civil rights. He helped create \nthe Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department and brought to \njustice those who committed fraud and espionage. All those experiences \nwere valuable contributions to helping those in need and bringing to \njustice those who did harm.\n  But none of those experiences compared to what he called the most \nimportant work of his life: his role as executive counsel under Justice \nRobert Jackson at the Nuremberg trials. By his own admission, this was \nthe most important work of his career. It also was his most important, \nmost life-changing event.\n  For almost 18 months, from the summer of 1945 to the fall of 1946, he \nconfronted those who were the authors of the worst evil of the 20th \ncentury, maybe ever. As one of the leading prosecutors in the most \nimportant trial of the 20th century, your grandfather and great-\ngrandfather demonstrated the supremacy of the rule of law over \nvengeance. Or, as Justice Robert Jackson said at the opening of those \ntrials:\n\n       That four great nations, flushed with victory and stung \n     with injury, stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily \n     submit their captive enemies to the judgment of law is one of \n     the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to \n     reason.\n\n  From the Nuremberg years, your grandfather and great-grandfather \nemerged as one of the sharpest defenders of human rights in his day and \nan outspoken crusader against tyranny in all its forms. To those who \nsuffered under the domination of the Soviet Union, there was no more \nvaliant voice. To this day, he is remembered warmly by those who \nsuffered under dictatorial regimes.\n  During his 16 years in Congress, first in the House of \nRepresentatives and 12 years in the Senate at this very desk, Thomas \nDodd worked hard to make a difference in the lives of people everywhere \nwho needed a champion.\n  Your grandfather's and great-grandfather's career did not end as he \nwanted it. He did not leave this desk as he would have liked. In 1970, \nhe ran for another term and lost. ``Those who fight the times,'' it was \nsaid of him, ``do not always have an easy end.''\n\n  He returned to his home in Connecticut, and shortly after he died, 30 \nyears before you were born, Grace and Christina. At the end of his \nlife, his obituary was headlined ``A Lonely Fighter.'' It struck me as \nsuch an odd word for my father, who was such a wonderful storyteller, \nsurrounded cradle to grave by a great big Irish Catholic family. I \ndon't recall my father being alone a day of his life. And yet in his \npublic life he had the politician's rarest virtue: he wasn't afraid to \nbe alone.\n  However important and interesting your grandfather and great \ngrandfather's life was, it is a terrible injustice to merely recite the \nchronology of his experiences. Even more important than what he did was \nthe kind of person he was. Thomas Dodd was principled and courageous, \nfearless in the face of injustice, and outspoken in his defense of \nthose in need. He was ahead of his time in so many ways--as an advocate \nfor national health care, a proponent of sensible gun safety laws, an \nearly voice warning of the effect of violence on television and the \ndangers of drug addiction, and a defender of those whose human rights \nwere being denied.\n  Your grandfather and great-grandfather loved your grandmother and \ngreat-grandmother so much. He loved his children very much, as well. \nBut the deep love for my mother was special to behold.\n  He was loyal to his hometown of Norwich, CT, and he cared deeply \nabout the people of our home State. Thomas Dodd was a person of deep \nfaith and a lifelong friend to many. He was proud of his family, and \nhow proud he would be of his grandchildren and what they have \naccomplished and of the contribution you and his great grandchildren \nwill make to your world.\n  Sixty-one years ago next month my father wrote the following words to \nmy mother about his experience at Nuremberg. He was proud of what he \nhad done at Nuremberg. While the words were addressed to his children, \nthey also speak to his grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n\n       I feel badly about you being alone with the children, but \n     I'm doing the right thing and I feel sure we will not regret \n     it. I will never do anything as worthwhile. Some day the boys \n     will point to it, I hope, and be proud and inspired by it.\n\n  Only a few weeks before his death, in May of 1971, my father did an \ninterview with a local Connecticut reporter. I was sitting in the room \nthat day when the reporter asked if my father had known at the outset \nof his public life, when it began in 1932, how it would end, would he \ndo it over again? I shall never forget his unhesitating answer:\n\n       I would do it again in a minute, for there is no other \n     calling where you can do as much for as many people as you \n     can in a public life.\n\n  My father's answer has been the source of inspiration for me over \nthese past 32 years in public service. So on this, your 100th birthday, \nfrom all of us--your six children, your son and daughters-in-law, your \n12 grandchildren and 17 great grandchildren--we say thank you, we love \nyou, and happy birthday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I didn't know Senator Thomas Dodd, but I \nknow Senator Christopher Dodd, and I am sure Senator Thomas Dodd is \nsmiling today.\n  This wonderful family that Senator Chris Dodd has includes a \nwonderful wife, Jackie, whom we know, she worked in the Senate and was \npart of the Senate family before she married Chris Dodd: and these two \nbeautiful children, whom we in the Senate feel are part of us, \nChristina and Grace, we have watched them from the day they were born \nto now in the Senate gallery, and we really do feel they are partly \nours.\n  It is a rare person we find in Senator Chris Dodd, who now is \nchairman of the Banking Committee and doing a wonderful job, that \ncommittee working with the ranking member, the Senator from Alabama, \nMr. Shelby; and then also running for the Presidency of the United \nStates.\n  So I say to Senator Christopher Dodd, I didn't have the opportunity \nto serve with Senator Thomas Dodd, but in this audience today, here in \nthe Senate, are men--and I look and see two--who served with Senator \nThomas Dodd: Senator Dan Inouye and Senator Robert Byrd. I have spoken \nto them about Senators in the past and, of course, they have always \nmentioned Senator Thomas Dodd because he certainly is a man who made a \ndifference in the Senate, as his son is doing.\n  One of the things that goes without saying is the ability of Senator \nChristopher Dodd to express himself. What an eloquent speaker he is. \nThis is one of the rare times, because of the emotion involved with the \nwords that he spoke, in which he spoke from written text. He usually \nspeaks off the cuff, and he is very good. I understand how difficult \nthis was for him. I could tell, from the tears in his eyes and the lump \nin his throat, how much he loved his father, his family, and how much \nhe loves his family today.\n\n[[Page S6091]]\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my leader to honor \nthe distinguished Senator from the State of Connecticut, and one who I \nwas proud to call friend: Senator Thomas Dodd.\n  Senator Tom Dodd, the father of Connecticut's senior Senator, \nChristopher Dodd, would have been 100 years old today. I would like to \ntake a moment to reflect upon his remarkable career.\n  Tom Dodd was, in many ways, the picture of a Senator. In a tribute \nshortly after his death in 1971, a colleague said:\n\n       His ability was outstanding and his appearance was \n     striking. With the dignity of his bearing and the gray of his \n     hair and his booming resonant voice, he made an impressive \n     figure on the Senate Floor.\n\n  But there was much more to Tom Dodd than style. Through a lifetime of \nservice, he brought a dedication of fighting evil in all its forms: in \nracism, in greed, in sabotage, genocide, and tyranny. Few have piled up \nsuch an impressive record.\n  Tom Dodd began his career as an FBI agent tracking down some of our \nNation's worst criminals. In a way, he had something of the FBI agent \nabout him for the rest of his life. He was determined to give \nwrongdoers no quarter, in word or in action.\n  During the Great Depression, he led the National Youth Administration \nof Connecticut, putting thousands of his fellow citizens to work, and \nthen he joined the Department of Justice as a prosecutor. He fought the \nKu Klux Klan, long before any Americans saw its true nature.\n  In later years, he prosecuted union busters who kept workers from \nbargaining together for fair conditions. And when the Second World War \ncame, he served with devotion on the home front, bringing prosecutions \nagainst German American Bundists, Nazi sympathizers who tried to \nsabotage the war effort.\n\n  When the Nazis had been defeated, his country called Tom Dodd to \nNuremberg, Germany, to help lead the historic prosecution of Nazi war \ncriminals. And Tom Dodd said yes because he knew that Nuremberg was \nAmerica's chance to prove its commitment to the rule of law. If we \nsimply gave in to vengeance, we would be walking in the footsteps of \nthose we despised, and Tom knew intuitively that America stood for \nsomething more.\n  He was quickly promoted to executive trial counsel, second only to \nthe lead prosecutor, Robert Jackson. Laying before the world \nindisputable proof of the Nazis' crimes, Tom and his colleagues \nsucceeded. They had sacrificed the certainty of an execution for the \nuncertainty of a trial. The test was one of principle over power--and \nAmerica passed.\n  Tom's lifetime of service was crowned with two terms in the House and \nthen election to the Senate. He served in this Chamber--at the desk now \noccupied by his son Chris--for 12 years. In the face of enormous \nopposition, he passed America's first comprehensive gun control law. He \nfought drug abuse and juvenile crime and violence on television. He \nprotected the homeland on the Internal Security Subcommittee and was \none of our most eloquent voices in support of the International \nGenocide Convention. Tom Dodd said had it been in force in the 1930s, \nthe crimes of Hitler might have been deterred.\n  For the rest of his life, Tom remembered what he had seen at \nNuremberg. He had seen tyranny face to face; he had seen, as he put it, \nan ``autopsy of history's most horrible crime.'' And he remained an \nenemy of tyranny for the rest of his life. He knew, as one author put \nit, that the Nazis' ``corruption of spirit, the irresistible human \naddiction to power, were like first drafts of a terrible future.'' So \nhe spoke out against that corruption wherever it showed itself, and \nagainst Communist tyranny above all.\n  One colleague remembered that Tom Dodd's many foreign policy speeches \n``were memorable in the annals of the Senate for their scope and their \nscholarship, their philosophical consistency, and their nonpartisan \nnature.''\n  True, Tom's career did not end as he would have wanted it. In 1970, \nhe ran for another term as an Independent and lost. He returned to his \nhome in Connecticut, and shortly after passed away. But through those \nlast, difficult months--and I remember it well even today--he held his \nhead high.\n  Tom's steadfast example and his eloquent words remain with me still. \nIn 1950, Tom Dodd said the following:\n\n       At Nuremberg, we laid down the doctrine that individuals \n     are responsible for some offenses. It always seemed to me \n     that it is the people who make up the government. Individual \n     people.\n\n  What holds true for the worst surely holds for the best. Behind all \nof Tom's achievements there was an indelible individual--passionate, \nstrong, wise, and brave. I was privileged to call him among my friends. \nI have no doubt that he would be so proud of his children today.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I think I am next in order, but I see \nsome of Senator Dodd's colleagues, and if they want to speak to Senator \nDodd, I would be happy to defer.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would be happy to defer to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, if he wishes to speak.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I knew Tom Dodd. I served with Tom Dodd. He \nreminded me of a Roman Senator. God bless him. It has been quite some \ntime since Senators talked about the case for censure against Senator \nTom Dodd. These remarks on the floor today bring back to mind those \ndifficult days.\n  I have grown quite close to Tom Dodd's son, Senator Chris Dodd. We \nhave sat next to each other in the Senate for ten years. He is a fine \nSenator and a fine man.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I had not planned to speak until I heard \nSenator Chris Dodd with his tribute to his father. It brought back, \nquickly, an early memory, my own memory of his father. It goes back to \nan earlier time when I was a college intern in the office of Senator \nPaul Douglas, whose office was next-door to Senator Dodd's office. I \ncan recall, as a college student, watching as Senator Dodd would come \nand go.\n  Of course, we all knew his name. We all knew what a great \ncontribution he had made to the Senate. It was not until later that I \nread about what a great contribution he had made to the world.\n  I recall, when Senator Chris Dodd, his son, came to the floor when we \nwere in the midst of debating how we would conduct ourselves on this \nwar on terror and gave one of the most memorable speeches in the \nhistory of the Senate, talking about the standards that a nation should \nlive by even in the midst of a war. He recalled the inspiration of his \nfather, an inspiration that has been mentioned several times this \nmorning--the service his father gave to America and to the world at the \nNuremberg trials.\n  Senator Chris Dodd said on the floor:\n\n       To watch the U.S. Senate, on the anniversary of the \n     Nuremberg trials, step away from the great principles \n     enshrined at that time is one of the saddest days I've ever \n     seen in . . . my almost 30 years in serving in this body.\n\n  I remembered that speech, and I wanted to enter this quote in the \nRecord for one simple reason. We all wonder what our legacy will be, \nthose of us who are fortunate enough to serve in the Senate. In the \nhistory of this country, 1,895 men and women have had this high honor \nto serve here. Some have faded into obscurity. Their names can hardly \nbe recalled. Others left great legacies. Certainly, Senator Thomas Dodd \ndid, in his public service, both before the Senate and the House, and \nafter and during.\n  But he also left another piece of legacy which we in the Senate \nappreciate today. He left a son dedicated to public service, a son who \nhas not only carried on in his tradition of public service but has \nhonored his father's memory with that service. When Chris Dodd came to \nthe floor and recalled his father's contribution in the Nuremberg \ntrials, in a war-torn world trying to find some peace and some \ndirection, he remembered his father's work and brought it with him to \nwork that day in the Senate. His voice on the issue of habeas corpus \nand the treatment of prisoners has been an inspiration to all of us.\n  As I listened to him pay tribute to his father, a tribute which his \nfather richly deserved, I wanted to join paying tribute to his father \nand to his father's son who carried on in such a great tradition of \npublic service.\n\n[[Page S6092]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will be very brief, I say to the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. I was in the Chamber when Senator Dodd was paying \ntribute to his father on what would have been his 100th birthday. I \ndidn't want to let this moment slip by without telling Senator Dodd, \nwhen I was a young boy, I was up in this gallery. I don't know if it \nwas this gallery or this one, but I was looking down and I remember \nseeing your father.\n  I asked the people who were sitting with me: Who is that Senator?\n  They said that was Senator Tom Dodd.\n  I said: That man looks like a Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. He had that booming voice, and he had an air about him, \nan air of authority. It was very interesting to see others' reaction to \nhim. You could see they had respect for him in the way he was \naddressed.\n  I later, then, read a book about him. I don't think I have ever told \nSenator Dodd this, but I read a book about your father, about the life \nhe had led. I remember distinctly about his being an FBI agent and the \nNuremberg trials. That made a great impression on me.\n  Then, when I came to the Senate and had the opportunity to serve with \nSenator Chris Dodd, I thought: You know, you couldn't be more proud. \nYour father, looking down on all of this--he could not be more proud \nthan to have his son in his seat in the Senate, somebody who also looks \nlike a Senator--but much more than that, someone who, similar to his \nfather, commands respect from other Senators because of the quality and \nthe character of his work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am glad I have had an opportunity to \nhear this and will only say, to make certain the same sentiment is \nexpressed from this side of the aisle--I knew Senator Dodd's father. I \ndidn't know him well or personally, but I knew him because I was \nSenator Howard Baker's legislative assistant at a time when Senator \nDodd served here. I admired him. I respected him. More importantly, I \nremember the respect Senator Baker and others had for him and for his \nlong and distinguished career.\n  My own father would be 100 years old this year, so I understand the \nenormous pride this Senator Dodd has for his father, Senator Dodd. \nSenator Durbin and Senator Conrad and others said this as well: The \nfather would be proud of the son.\n  I had the privilege of serving as sometimes the chairman, sometimes \nthe ranking member, of committees with Senator Chris Dodd. It is a \ntremendous pleasure to see how he cares, especially for children and \nfamilies in the workplace and contributions he has made here.\n  This is a day for a tribute to the father and a day that we are sure \nhis father would have great pride in his own son.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If there are no other comments regarding Senator Dodd, \nI would like to talk about immigration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1393 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous \norder be modified to provide that the amendment I intend to call up is \namendment No. 1071.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside, and I call up amendment No. 1071.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin], for himself, and \n     Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 1071 to \n     amendment No. 1065.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the siting, construction, expansion, and \n             operation of liquefied natural gas terminals)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5___.

I ask unanimous consent that Senators Lieberman and Dodd \nbe added as cosponsors of amendment No. 1071.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this amendment would restore the authority \nof State and local governments to protect the environment and public \nsafety of the sitings of liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals within \ntheir own State. The amendment is drafted to be an amendment to the \nRivers and Harbors Act of 1899, which gives the Army Corps authority on \nsection 10 permits. The current law on the siting of LNG plants \nbasically allows the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to site \nwithout the consultation or approval of State or local governments. \nThis amendment is an effort to restore federalism to the process of \nsiting LNG plants.\n  There are now dozens of proposals to site new LNG plants in the \nUnited States. Some are being suggested to be sited near population \ncenters, which raises serious concern about public safety.\n  Let me point out that LNG plants and the tankers that bring in the \nnatural gas are very much targets of terrorism. Richard Clarke, a \nformer Bush administration counterterrorism official, said LNG plants \nand tankers are ``especially attractive targets'' to terrorists. The \nrisks are great. We know LNG plants can spark pool fires, which are \nhigh-intensity fires, extremely difficult to extinguish. CRS has \nreported in the last six decades there have been 13 serious accidents \ninvolving LNG plants, including one in the State of Maryland in 1979 \nthat had a fatality associated with it.\n  Maryland has one of the six LNG plants in our country, and there is a \nproposal to add another LNG plant in Maryland. AES Sparrows Point LNG \nand Mid-Atlantic Express intend to site a new LNG plant at Sparrows \nPoint in the Baltimore metropolitan area. This is right in the middle \nof a population center. It is opposed by the congressional delegation. \nIt is opposed by the Governor. It is opposed by the county executive in \nthe jurisdiction in which the LNG plant is to be sited. It is \nunacceptable public safety, an economic and environmental risk. Yet \nthere has been no consideration given by the individuals who want to \nsite this plant to\n\n[[Page S6093]]\n\nthe concerns of local government. It is totally up to FERC to make the \ndecision, and that is wrong. State and local governments should have a \nmeaningful opportunity to participate in decisions of siting LNG \nterminals. That is exactly what this amendment would do.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee on the Senate floor. I respect her judgment as to the \nimportance of moving forward on this bill. This amendment, because it \nhasn't been cleared, could add some difficulty to that process. It is \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee \non which I serve, and I hope our committee would hold hearings on this \nissue and consider another vehicle which may be more appropriate than \nthe bill currently before us to deal with the appropriate input of \nState and local governments on the siting of LNG plants. We have a \nresponsibility to do that. We have a responsibility to our communities. \nWe have a responsibility for public safety. We have a responsibility to \nmake sure it is done right. Allowing FERC to do that without the input \nof State and local government is wrong.\n  I hope there will be another opportunity that I will be able to \neither have a public hearing or an opportunity to discuss this \namendment further.\n  I am pleased several of my colleagues have expressed interest in the \namendment. This certainly will not be the last time I will have an \nopportunity to talk about it.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1071 Withdrawn\n\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1089 to Amendment No. 1065\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided on amendment No. 1089 offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the amendment is very simple. There are \nthree visitor centers now within 77 miles of the proposed site of this \nvisitors center. Thousands of people, tens of thousands of people in \nLouisiana still live in trailers. We are going to add a fourth visitors \ncenter, and that duplicates exactly the same thing in the area.\n  It may be a good idea. I am not against it. But how dare we spend \nmoney and authorize a project when we haven't taken care of the folks \nof Louisiana. All this says is, we set priorities. We make sure the \npeople of Louisiana are out of their temporary housing and into \npermanent housing before we go about spending millions of dollars on a \nvisitor center. It has been stated that there would be no cost, as the \ncenter has already been built.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an e-mail I received \ntoday from the Corps of Engineers saying this center has not been built \nand will, in fact, expend a great deal of Federal taxpayer money when \nit is.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From: Greer, Jennifer A HQ02\n     Sent: Monday, May 07, 2007 12:05 PM\n     To: Treat, Brian (Coburn)\n     Subject: Info\n       Brian, wanted to check in.

Jennifer\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope we will do what we did on the last \namendment, which is to say no to it because, as we learned from the \nSenators from Louisiana, this particular amendment is directed at the \nlocal people who are willing to pay 100 percent for this center. The \nfact is, Louisiana is never going to get on its feet if it does not \nrevive tourism. Let's face it. It isn't that we can say: Let's just \nbuild the flood protection and worry about the visitor centers later. \nThere is a certain amount of linear thinking going on behind this \namendment and the one before.\n  This is the United States. We have to do everything; we can't just do \none thing. We have to build the flood protection, and we have to revive \nLouisiana's economy. This is a rather mean-spirited amendment in the \nsense that not even a penny of Federal money is involved in the \nbuilding of this particular center. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1089.

Under the previous order, there will now be 5 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 1086 offered by the \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last week I spoke at length on my \nprioritization amendment. I urge all my colleagues to support the \nFeingold-McCain-Coburn-Carper-Gregg-Sununu- DeMint amendment.\n  This important amendment would help jump-start a process for ensuring\n\n[[Page S6094]]\n\nthat limited taxpayer dollars go to the most worthy water resources \nprojects.\n  Right now, Congress does not have any information about the relative \npriority of the nearly $60 billion authorized but unbuilt corps \nprojects. What we do have is individual Members arguing for projects in \ntheir States or districts, but no information about which projects are \nmost important to the country's economic development or transportation \nsystems, or our ability to protect citizens and property from natural \ndisasters.\n  This amendment would create a temporary group of water resources \nexperts to do two things: (1) make recommendations on a process for \nprioritizing corps projects; and (2) analyze projects authorized in the \nlast 10 years or that are under construction, and put similar types of \nprojects into tiers that reflect their importance. This would be done \nwith clear direction to seek balance between the needs of all States.\n  This information will be provided to Congress and the public in a \nnobinding report. That is--Congress and the public get information to \nhelp them make decisions involving millions, even billions, of dollars. \nWe need to get ideas on the table, and I think my colleagues will agree \nthat a report with recommendations to Congress is a good, commonsense \nfirst step.\n  The New Orleans Times Picayune certainly does. Just yesterday, the \npaper editorialized in favor of my amendment and stated:\n\n       Using objective criteria rather than political clout to \n     decide what should be done is a smart, reform-minded step.\n\n  This amendment also has the support of a number of taxpayer and \nconservation groups.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for their efforts to retain \nkey reforms in the underlying bill; however, this is a critical reform \ncomponent and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nFeingold, along with Senators Coburn, Carper, Gregg, Sununu, and \nDeMint, in offering this important amendment. It is designed to help \nCongress make informed decisions on which Army Corps projects should be \nfunded based on our national priorities.\n  In August 2005, our Nation witnessed a devastating natural disaster. \nWhen Hurricane Katrina hit the shores of the gulf coast, it brought \ndestruction and tragedy beyond compare; more so than we have seen in \ndecades. Almost 2 years later, the gulf coast is still trying to \nrebuild and our Nation continues to dedicate significant resources to \nthe reconstruction effort. One of the many lessons we learned from \nKatrina is that we must ensure that our Army Corps resources are being \nused in the most productive and efficient manner possible. It is time \nthat this Congress took a hard look at how we are spending our scarce \nArmy Corps dollars and whether or not they are actually reaching our \nmost critical projects.\n  Our current system for funding Corps projects is not working. Under \ntoday's practice, Members of Congress commonly submit requests for pet \nprojects important to their constituency, and those requests are \nessentially horse-traded by committee and party leaders. Too often a \nMember's seniority and party position dictates which projects will be \nfunded. Instead of relying on political muscle, we should fund projects \nbased on national priority. But under the current regime, requests are \nmade and filled without having a clear picture of how a project affects \nthe overall infrastructure of our Nation's waterways or where it fits \nwithin our national waterway priorities. That shouldn't be acceptable \nto anyone in this Chamber, and it isn't acceptable to the American \npublic.\n  Now, many of my colleagues are thinking, ``there he goes again, \nrailing against earmarks.'' But earmarks aren't the full story here. \nThere is a $58 billion backlog of Corp projects today, and the bill \nbefore us proposes to add another $15 billion, according to the Office \nof Management and Budget. Unfortunately, the Corps receives $2 billion \nannually on average, so there is no way to fund most of these projects. \nWhat is more troubling is that there is no way to know which projects \nwarrant these limited resources because the Corps refuses to tell \nCongress what it views as national priorities. In fact, every time \nCongress specifically requests a list of the Corps' top priorities, the \nCorps claims it's unable to provide an answer. This is clearly \nunacceptable and cannot result in the best interests of public safety.\n  The sponsors of this amendment are not the only ones who are \nconcerned. Let me quote Representative Hobson, former chairman of the \nHouse Energy and Water Appropriations Committee, from his statement on \nthe floor on May 24, 2006:\n\n       Last fall, we asked the Corps to provide Congress with a \n     ``top 10'' list of the flood control and navigation \n     infrastructure needs in the country. The Corps was \n     surprisingly unable or not allowed to respond to this simple \n     request, and that tells me the Corps has lost sight of its \n     national mission and has no clear vision for projects it \n     ought to be doing in the future . . . frankly, what is still \n     lacking is a long-term vision of what the Nation's water \n     resources infrastructure should look like in the future. \n     ``More of the same'' is not a thoughtful answer, nor is it a \n     responsible answer in times of constrained budgets.\n\n  In February of this year, the National Academy of Public \nAdministration, NAPA, issued its report, ``Prioritizing America's Water \nResources Investments, Budget Reform for Civil Works Construction \nProjects at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.'' The Report included the \nfollowing findings:\n\n       The present project-by-project approach, with lagging \n     project completions, on-again-off-again construction \n     schedules, and disappointed cost-share sponsors that do not \n     know what they can count on, is not the best path to \n     continued national prosperity.\n       The prioritization process is not transparent. At several \n     points, within both the executive and legislative branches, \n     the decision process is not sufficiently open or documented \n     so that the public can readily understand the reasons for \n     funding or not funding projects.\n       Larger questions emerged that bear on the future \n     sustainability of the nation's water resources . . . The \n     answer to these questions should begin with a fundamental \n     reassessment of national water resources needs, goals, and \n     strategies. It should end with a substantially reshaped \n     planning and budgeting process . . .\n\n  Our amendment is designed to address these problems and shed light on \nthe funding process. It would allow both Congress and the American \npeople to have a clearer understanding of where our funding should be \ndirected to meet the most pressing water infrastructure needs of the \ncountry.\n  Last year, we proposed a related amendment during debate on the Water \nResources Development Act. While that amendment was intended to help \nCongress make clear and educated decisions on which Army Corps projects \nshould be funded based on our nation's priorities, concerns were raised \nabout specific provisions of the amendment and it eventually was \nrejected. Therefore, we have revised our amendment to address the \nconcerns we heard on the floor last July.\n  For example, there was concern that our previous amendment gave too \nmuch power to the administration by placing the power of prioritization \nin the hands of a multi-agency committee. The amendment before us \nresponds to those concerns by establishing an independent commission \nthat would review Corps projects that are currently under construction \nor have been authorized during the last 10 years. These projects would \nbe evaluated by several commonsense, transparent criteria. They would \nalso be divided and judged within their own project category such as \nnavigation, flood and storm damage reduction, and environmental \nrestoration. Each project category would be broken into broad, roughly \nequal-sized tiers with the highest tiers including the highest priority \nprojects and on down the line. The commission would prepare an advisory \nreport detailing its findings that would be sent to Congress and be \nmade available to the public. Similar to our prior proposal, the \nprioritization report required under our amendment is an effort to \ninform Congress, but it does not dictate spending decisions.\n\n  To more fully understand the need for a prioritization system, let's \nconsider funding for Louisiana in the fiscal year 2006 budget. The \nadministration's budget request included 41 line items or projects \nsolely for Louisiana that totaled $268 million. That works out to $6.5 \nmillion per project on average. The House Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill included for Louisiana 39 line items or projects \ntotaling $254 million--again in the neighborhood of $6.5\n\n[[Page S6095]]\n\nmillion per project. The Senate bill included 71 line items or projects \nto the tune of $375 million--averaging out to $5.3 million per project. \nSo, while even more money was proposed for Louisiana under the Senate \nversion, individual projects would receive less money and, inevitably, \nthis would result in delays in completing larger projects. This all \ncomes down to the real-world consequences of earmarking. Communities \nactually lose under the earmarking practice.\n  Can we really afford long, drawn out delays on flood control projects \nthat people's lives depend on simply because too many members are \nfighting to earmark projects important to them, but without the benefit \nof how such projects fit into the country's most pressing needs? We \nlack the information we need to offer us guidance in funding Corps \nprojects. Without such guidance, we will only further the risks to \npublic safety and continue to delay the timely completion of critical \nprojects. Now, some may believe that under our amendment smaller \nprojects will lose out. However, the size of the project has no impact \non the prioritization system. In fact, this objective system will help \nfind the hidden gems in the Corps project list and highlight their \nimportance.\n  It is time that we end this process of blind spending, throwing money \nat projects that may or may not benefit the larger good. It is time for \nus to take a post-Katrina look at how we fund our water resources \nprojects. Shouldn't we be doing all that we can to reform the Corps and \nensure that most urgent projects are being funded and constructed? Or, \nare we going to be content with business as usual? As stated in a \nletter signed by the heads of Tax Payers for Common Sense Action, the \nNational Taxpayers Union, and the Council for Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste in support of our amendment:\n\n       Enough is enough . . . we need a systematic method for \n     ensuring the most vital projects move to the front of the \n     line so limited taxpayer funds are spent more prudently.\n\n  I commend Senator Feingold for his efforts to build on and improve \nupon the Corps reforms that we've worked to advance during the \nreauthorization debate. Corps modernization has been a priority that \nSenator Feingold and I have shared for years, but never before has \nthere been such an appropriate atmosphere and urgent need to move \nforward on these overdue reforms.\n  This important prioritization amendment has been endorsed by many \noutside groups, including Taxpayers for Common Sense Action, National \nTaxpayers Union, Citizens Against Government Waste, American Rivers, \nNational Wildlife Federation, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense, \nRepublicans for Environmental Protection, Sierra Club, and Friends of \nthe Earth.\n  The Corps procedures for planning and approving projects, as well as \nthe Congressional system for funding projects, are broken, but they can \nbe fixed. This amendment is a step toward a more informed public and a \nmore informed Congress. We owe the American public accountability in \nhow their tax dollars are spent. Literally, lives depend on it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute 20 seconds, and I \nwill yield the rest of the time to Senator Inhofe.\n  I thank Senator Feingold for being a leader on Corps reform. I don't \nview this amendment as reform. My colleague says we have to take the \npolitics out of the decisionmaking process. Well, the fact is, his \ncommission is a political commission appointed by the President, \nappointed by the Speaker, the minority leader, and so on. So he is \ntaking the decisions, in many ways, away from us. Therefore, I call \nthis the ``we have met the enemy, and it is we'' amendment--taking the \npower away from us to decide what is important in priorities and adding \nanother layer of bureaucracy in political appointees, who are now going \nto slow things down.\n  We do have problems. It has taken 7 years to get to this point with \nWRDA. There are checks and balances every step of the way. We have very \ntough criteria in this bill. I know the occupant of the chair knows \nthat because he is on the committee.\n  Senator Inhofe and I have said the locals have to pay their share. \nThe cost/benefit ratio has to be in place. Everything has to be thought \nthrough. The Corps has to make their report. They come to the \ncommittees, and they go through authorization and appropriation.\n  I hope we will vote no on this amendment.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I agree with what the \nSenator just said. We have plowed this field before. The votes were 88 \nvotes against last time. Nothing has changed. I know the intentions of \nthe Senator proposing this are right, but the amendment assumes there \nis one, and only one, correct rank list of projects, and we need to \nhave somebody else write it down. We already have the Corps of \nEngineers going through and determining, as Senator Boxer said, what \nthe criteria is and why these things should be considered, and normally \nit would then come to us. I think that is what we are supposed to be \ndoing; it is why we are elected. So now we would have, if we pass this \namendment, one more bureaucracy between the Corps and us. If there is \nanybody on the conservative side who thinks it inures to anyone's \nbenefit to have one more layer of bureaucracy, then this is your chance \nto vote for it.\n  I ask that you oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Brown), the \nSenator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson), and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint), the Senator from North Carolina (Mrs. Dole), the Senator New \nMexico (Mr. Domenici), and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 22, nays 69, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 165 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--22\n\n     Allard\n     Bingaman\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Dodd\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Gregg\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     McCaskill\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Sanders\n     Sununu\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n\n                                NAYS--69\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bunning\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--9\n\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Johnson\n     McCain\n     Rockefeller\n  The amendment (No. 1086) was rejected.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I would say it would be Senator Hagel \nfirst, followed by Senator Dodd.\n\n[[Page S6096]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise today to address the issue of \nIraq. The debate on Iraq over the last few weeks in our country and the \nCongress has been centered on conditions for America's continued \ninvolvement in Iraq. Unfortunately, it has been defined by many in the \ncontext of political winners and losers. Either President Bush wins or \nCongress wins. That is not responsible legislation. That is not a \nresponsible approach to a serious issue such as a war, when today we \nhave crossed over to 3,400 Americans killed in Iraq.\n  The troops will get their money. They need to get their money. We \nwill find a center of gravity that will accommodate the President and \nthe Congress with the appropriate language or conditions for America's \ncontinued involvement in Iraq. The question we need to focus on now is: \nWhere is Iraq headed? The answer will require an honest and clear \nanalysis of the facts, as the facts are on the ground in Iraq today.\n  I returned 3 weeks ago from my fifth trip to Iraq, and there is not \nmuch good news in Iraq. There is no point unraveling the last 4 or 5 \nyears of mistakes and bad decisions or assigning blame. We are where we \nare. We are where we are, and we must get beyond the immediacy of today \nand the debate over the conditions of our continued involvement. We \nneed to ask the question: What happens next? What happens in September \nand October? What comes after, hopefully, a reduction in violence? \nWhere are we going in Iraq? How do we get there? Do we need a new \nstrategy in Iraq, new thinking?\n  As Secretary of Defense Gates has said, America's continued support \nis not open-ended, and the American people have registered that fact \nvery clearly. Iraq is caught in a vicious complicated cycle of \nviolence, despair, and no solutions. This cycle must be broken. \nAmerican military power alone will not be the solution in Iraq. General \nPetraeus and all of our military leaders have stated this.\n  Iraq's political system and leaders seem incapable of finding a \npolitical accommodation to move Iraq toward a political reconciliation. \nOur civilian and military leaders all agree there is no military \nresolution. That is only a temporary holding pattern for the Iraqis to \nfind that new consensus of governance, and only a political resolution \nin Iraq will sustain that new center of gravity and that new consensus.\n  Some strategic new thinking must be found in Iraq for our policies, \nnot unlike what Ambassador Carlos Pasqual, Larry Diamond, and many \nothers, have been thinking and writing about and putting forward over \nthe last few weeks. First we must take the American face off of Iraq. \nGet America out of the middle of the Iraqi political process. We are \nexacerbating, we are complicating the problem; not because we are not \nwell-intentioned and have not made tremendous sacrifices but because \nthe people of Iraq and the people of the Middle East believe we are \nstill an occupying power after 4 years in Iraq.\n  We must engage, as the Baker-Hamilton report recommended, Iran and \nSyria. The Bush administration deserves credit in beginning the \nengagement; however, it needs to be done in a regional framework, not a \nseries of bilateral talks with unclear or disjointed purposes and \nobjectives. The time has come to consider an international mediator for \nIraq--probably under the auspices of the United Nations--to begin a new \nprocess for achieving some form of political accommodation in Iraq. The \nIraqis are obviously incapable of bringing that consensus, that \naccommodation together. Only a credible and trusted outside influence \ncan bring this political reconciliation about in Iraq. If it can be \ndone, it will be up to the Iraqis to support it and to sustain it. \nAmerica cannot do that for them.\n  There are significant political, cultural, historical, religious, and \nregional differences between Iraq and other countries that have had UN \nmediators, such as Afghanistan, Kosovo, East Timor, and Northern \nIreland. But they have been tailored to work, and they have worked.\n  We have to understand we have no options in Iraq today. There is \nchaos today in Iraq. We must change direction, strategy, and policy. \nAmerica can continue to support this process and help ensure the \nsuccess of this mediation, but we can't, and we won't, continue to be \nthe occupying power in Iraq.\n  America has an important strategic, geopolitical, energy, and \neconomic interest in the Middle East. It would be irresponsible to \nabandon Iraq and other interests in the region. But if we don't find a \nnew direction soon, and a responsible and workable policy to help the \nIraqis find some core stability, bringing some political consensus, \nAmerica will leave and the Middle East could then erupt into a very \ndangerous regional conflagration. Reality and clear new strategic \nthinking being incorporated in a new direction and policy in Iraq is \nnow required. These are the essential dynamics the Congress must now \nengage in--the Congress, with the President--and we must put aside the \npartisan dynamics, the partisan difficulties and differences. War \nshould never be held captive to partisanship. It should never be a \nwedge issue for either political party. This is too serious. It is very \nserious.\n  As we enter our fifth year, with the kind of money and casualties we \nhave invested in Iraq, we must ask ourselves: Where do we go next? How \ndo we get there? I think that will depend on some bold new strategic \nthinking, incorporating a new UN mediator we can support and frame and \nbe a part of, and taking the American face off of the political process \nin Iraq. These are the issues we must debate and find consensus on.\n  I would hope as we work our way through the differences on the $100 \nbillion in additional spending for Iraq and Afghanistan that we will \nmove to that next series of significant consequences and seriously find \na new strategy and policy for Iraq and America's interests in Iraq and \nthe Middle East.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before he leaves the floor, let me commend \nmy colleague from Nebraska. He and I have worked on a number of issues \nover the years. In fact, in my remarks--and I had no knowledge when I \nprepared these remarks that I would be following my colleague from \nNebraska--I quote some of the statements he has made about the \nsituation in Iraq.\n  I commend him for his candor and his directness. He brings a lot of \nexperience and knowledge to these issues, and is as deeply committed as \nanyone here to the well-being of our men and women in uniform, \nregardless of where they serve. He has clearly pointed out what is \nnecessary here, not only the resolution of our military presence in \nIraq but, just as importantly, what comes afterward: How do we then \nmove beyond the military question to the political, diplomatic, and \neconomic issues that offer some hope to the Iraqi people and ourselves \nfor reemerging in peace and stability in that part of the world. I \ncommend him for his comments.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the Feingold-Reid-Dodd \namendment, which will come up at some point on this water bill under \narrangements that the leader has provided, along with others. I would \nhave preferred a freestanding proposal by my colleague from Wisconsin, \nwhom I am pleased to join today, but under the circumstances, I \nrecognize this may be the best opportunity we will have to actually \ndebate his amendment, and I urge my colleagues to be supportive of his \nproposal. I realize it is a proposal that has some critics, but I \nbelieve it is the most honest, straightforward answer to the present \nsituation in Iraq, one that is deteriorating by the hour, I would point \nout.\n  We need to reverse 4 years of a failed policy by safely redeploying \nour troops out of harm's way, out of the middle of Iraq's civil war. \nDespite our best wishes, and our military's best efforts, we are unable \nto solve Iraq's problems and their civil war. That has become clear. We \ncannot do that with military force. That was the conclusion of our \nmilitary leaders 4 years ago, and they have never wavered in that \nconclusion. There is not a military solution to Iraq's civil war.\n  After invading over 4 years ago, we still lack a coherent strategy, \nand our\n\n[[Page S6097]]\n\nmilitary presence has not improved the security situation in Iraq. The \nvalor, the determination, the courage of our service men and women has \nbeen remarkable, and all of us in this Chamber, I believe, share that \nview. Yet the situation in Iraq grows worse, literally by the hour. \nThis is simply unacceptable.\n  The President of our country contends now, as he contended for the \nlast 4 years, and I quote him:\n\n       Absolutely we're winning. Things are getting better. We do \n     have a strategy, but it just needs more time.\n\n  Those statements are false, unfortunately. We have no strategy in \nIraq, in my view, just a surge tactic in search of a strategy. We had a \nsurge in late 2005, and the result was the worst year of violence in \nIraq since the war began. We also had two additional surges in \nOperation Together Forward I and II, and both of those surges failed as \nwell.\n  My colleague, Senator Hagel from Nebraska, recently argued, and I \nquote him here:\n\n       The President's strategy is taking America deeper and \n     deeper into quagmire, with no exit strategy. The strategy to \n     deepen America's military involvement in Iraq will not bring \n     about a resolution in Iraq.\n\n  I wholeheartedly agree with that conclusion. As the Baker-Hamilton \nreport rightly concluded, there will be no military victory in Iraq. \nIraq's civil war cannot be solved with military force alone. Only \nIraqis can solve the quagmire now facing their country. Only Iraqis can \nchose to reconcile, to reach power-sharing agreements, to govern and \npolice collectively, and to share the country's oil wealth.\n\n  But despite our best hopes that is not happening, and our military is \nunable to make that happen. This is why the surge tactic is \nfundamentally flawed. We cannot implement a military solution to what \nis fundamentally a political conflict in that country.\n  I believe we have a moral obligation to protect Iraqis and to help \nthem reach these compromises, but we are not succeeding in doing that. \nIn fact, for 4 years now we have not succeeded in doing that as well. \nAn objective look at key indicators since our invasion will demonstrate \nthat the situation has steadily deteriorated each year under the Bush \nadministration. Whether you examine the number of civilian deaths, the \nnumber of internally displaced refugees, the number of Iraqis who fled \ntheir country, now in excess of 2 million, or in the amount of power \nand water flowing into Iraqi homes, all of these indicators demonstrate \nthe overall situation in Iraq has not improved. In fact, it has \ndeteriorated during the last 4 years. That is why I believe we must \nbegin redeploying our forces out of Iraq within the next 120 days and \ncomplete the redeployment within the next year.\n  That is why I also believe that simultaneous to redeployment, and \nafter the redeployment has been completed, we must conduct targeted \ncounterterrorism activities to protect the Iraqi population from \nterrorists, to expunge al-Qaida from Iraq, and help ensure Iraq does \nnot become a terrorist safe haven. I note that while I agree with \nSenator Levin that military readiness is currently lacking, I am \nconcerned by the waiver provisions included in the amendment of my \ncolleague from Michigan. It is true that due to the administration's \ndefense policies many U.S. combat forces are not mission ready, are not \nadequately trained, and have not been given appropriate resting periods \nbetween deployments.\n  I recently visited some soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital who had been \ninjured in Iraq. I asked them how much cooperation they were getting \nfrom the Iraqi people and what their observations were.\n  Without quoting them directly, let me paraphrase their comments. They \nsaid while the Iraqi people seem to be pleasant people and many seem to \nbe interested in doing what they could to be helpful, in too many \ninstances they pointed out that the civilian population knew where \nthese IEDs were, these roadside devices. They knew where the ``ammo \ndumps,'' or the ammunition stockpiles were. Yet they never ever shared \nthis information with our military in the communities where we were \ntrying to provide security.\n  One soldier pointed out that we would spend a month and a half \ncleaning out an area with problems, and an hour and a half after they \nhad left, things were right back where they were a month and a half \nbefore. Those are their words, not mine.\n  We know hear that these missions, despite the Herculean efforts of \nour military, are not getting this job done because of the raging civil \nwar in that country. But providing a waiver to the President under the \nLevin amendment is tantamount, in my view, to re-authorizing the war. \nIt doesn't hold the administration or the Iraqi Government accountable. \nIt doesn't force a change in mission, and it doesn't begin to redeploy \nour forces. Instead it allows the administration to stay the course, \nfull speed ahead, to use the words of Vice President Richard Cheney. \nThe Feingold-Reid-Dodd amendment provides the best means, in my view, \nfor changing our mission in Iraq.\n  As much as I wish we were able to secure Iraq ourselves, that the \nsurge would work, or that our military presence in Iraq would bring \nabout the compromises necessary, I think the evidence is clear it is \nnot happening, and it will not happen. The American people know this, \nour troops who have served and sacrificed in Iraq know it, and I \nbelieve the Iraqi people know it as well. Only when Iraqis themselves \ndecide they will no longer tolerate violence and destruction, only when \ntheir leaders come together will this violence be reduced. That is what \nneeds to happen across that plagued country. The United States should \nhelp where it can, by training and equipping reliable and accountable \nIraqi security forces that will serve the greater Iraqi nation, not \ntheir own tribe or their own sect.\n  According to a recent CBS poll, 70 percent of Shiites and nearly all \nof the Sunnis think the presence of U.S. forces in Iraq is making \nsecurity worse. The vast majority of Iraqis, regardless of their sect, \nbelieve American troop presence in Iraq is making Iraq less safe.\n  Madam President, 78 percent of Iraqis oppose the presence of U.S. \nforces on their soil, and 51 percent of Iraqis support attacks on \ncoalition forces. Slightly more than half of the population we are \ntrying to protect approve of the attacks on U.S. soldiers. That is just \nnot acceptable.\n  But it is not just the Iraqi public who want American forces out of \ntheir nation. The Iraqi Government does as well. A majority of the \nIraqi Parliament recently signed a petition for a timetable governing a \nwithdrawal of American forces, and in a recent high-level meeting, Iraq \nand its neighbors signed what they called the Marmara Declaration, \nreaffirming this sentiment. They declared in this declaration that ``a \ntimetable should be established for the Government of Iraq to take full \nauthority and responsibility, including for security throughout the \ncountry.''\n  The declaration went on to say:\n\n       The United States should commit to a comprehensive strategy \n     for responsible withdrawal, consistent with Iraq's security \n     and stability based on milestones and a general time horizon.\n\n  It also says:\n\n       Iraq's Armed Forces need to be nationally representative, \n     Iraq's police should be credible to its citizens, and \n     representative to the communities they serve.\n\n  The Feingold-Reid-Dodd amendment does just that. It does what the \nIraqi people and the American people want, and it does it in a \nresponsible way. This legislation mandates that the redeployment of \nU.S. forces should begin, as I mentioned, within a 120-day period and \nbe completed within a year. Simultaneous to this redeployment, the \nlegislation calls for continued counterterrorism operations, and the \ntraining and equipping of reliable and accountable Iraqi security \nforces to take over the responsibility of safeguarding the Iraqi \npopulation.\n  It is up to us to change the President's failed course in Iraq and to \nhold our President and the Iraqi Government accountable. It is up to us \nto mandate a change in direction, to begin to responsibly bring our \ntroops home, to continue to help the Iraqis battle terrorists, and to \ntrain and equip reliable Iraqi security forces ,so Iraqis can police \ntheir own country and decide their own future.\n  We cannot afford another day of escalation, $2 billion a week, $8 \nbillion a month, lives lost, lives completely ruined in many cases. But \nalso what is happening in Iraq itself, with the dislocation of the \nIraqi people, the 60,000\n\n[[Page S6098]]\n\nwho have lost their lives--the situation is not improving. A true \nchange in direction is needed. The price our Nation is paying, the \nprice our men and women in uniform are paying, is too high for a failed \npolicy, a policy that has not succeeded because it cannot succeed.\n  I urge my colleagues at an appropriate time when Senator Feingold \nwill offer his amendment to support this amendment. None of us can \nguarantee it is going to produce the desired result of convincing the \nIraqi people what they should have been doing all along, instead of \nproposing a 2-month vacation, but rather sitting down and trying to \ncome up with the political reconciliation for their country.\n  Our hope is by beginning a clear redeployment and setting a \ntermination date--this must or this may convince the Iraqi people and \ntheir leaders that they should come to terms with their own political \nfuture. For those reasons I urge the adoption of the Feingold \namendment.\n  I urge, as well, consideration of what Senator Hagel has suggested: \ntalking about moving beyond the military issue, to utilize the tools \navailable to us, the political, economic, diplomatic tools that are the \nmeans by which we should try to achieve reconciliation. But a \ncontinuation of our military presence under its present structure is \nnot working. It should come to an end. This is the best effort to \nachieve that goal.\n  Again, I urge the adoption of the Feingold amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think the Senator from Massachusetts has a unanimous \nconsent request. I ask he be recognized for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nhours of debate. I don't think this is correct, the way I have been \ngiven it. I think we had a unanimous request that we have 2 hours of \ndebate, initially equally divided, with 10 minutes to begin--the \nSenator from Oklahoma will speak in response to the Senator from \nConnecticut on Iraq. That will count against the time for the debate on \nmy amendment. Then after those first 2 hours, we would again equally \ndivide----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding we \nstarted out at 45 and 45. We are down now to 2 hours where you are \nincreased from 45 minutes to an hour. That would be equally divided. I \nprobably will yield back some of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I may also. But this is an important \nsubject, and I do not want to get squeezed on the time.\n  I had originally requested 1 hour, initially, and then 15 minutes at \nthe back end, a half hour equally divided. I would like to stay with \nthat.\n  What we are really talking about is the difference of 15 minutes, \nwhich I may or may not use. But I say to my friend from Oklahoma, I \nthink it is not asking too much of the Senate to have that protection \nof the extra 15 minutes. If we don't use it, we can both----\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me ask for clarification. What you are saying is, \ninstead of 2 hours equally divided, it would be 2\\1/2\\ hours equally \ndivided? I have no objection, with the understanding that I can count \nagainst my time and talk for up to 10 minutes on the subject of Iraq.\n  Mr. KERRY. I have no objection to that. I propound that request: 2 \nhours of debate initially equally divided and a subsequent half hour \nequally divided, and with the first 10 minutes to be taken by the \nSenator counted against him to speak on Iraq. Then I add, if I may, \nthat no second-degree amendment be in order prior to the vote and, upon \nthe use or yielding back of time but not before 5:35 p.m, the Senate \nwould then proceed to vote in relation to the amendment; that the \namendment by agreement must receive 60 affirmative votes to be agreed \nto; if it does not it would be withdrawn without further intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? No objection.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts for working out this unanimous consent agreement. These \nthings are sometimes complicated. I know he has just as strong beliefs \nabout his amendment as I do in opposition. I think this will \naccommodate it. Let me go ahead, if I might, and take a few minutes.\n  It would be disrespectful for me to walk in here and ask the last two \nSenators who were talking what they have been smoking recently. I do \nnot understand how someone can say they came back a few weeks ago from \nIraq and then have a report like this. It is just incredible.\n  I have to say, I know I have been in the Iraqi AOR more than any \nother Member of the House, any other Member of the Senate, anybody \nelse. I take this very seriously. I am on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. I spend time studying this issue, the most critical issue \nfacing Americans today, and that is this war on terrorism. It is one \nthat we are winning and we can win.\n  I have to tell you, I spent this last weekend with--it was my 14th \ntrip there. I was there. I was walking around, rolling around in the \nsand in Anbar Province. I was shocked at what I saw. Maybe someone, \ngiving them the benefit of the doubt, if they have been there and it \nhas been a few weeks--maybe this really hasn't worked. But lets keep in \nmind the surge policy came in in February. So we need to look and see \nwhat it is that has happened since February that is working.\n  I have to say this also: General Petraeus is the guy in charge. Here \nwe are sitting down talking about micromanaging a war with 435 Members \nof the House and 100 Members of the Senate, when we have a President \nwho is doing the job that the Constitution tells him to do. Yet we are \ntrying to interfere with that process.\n  Going back to some of the previous trips, I watched as time went by \nover the last 5 years, each time I go back, a greater level of \ncooperation that we are finding from the Iraqis. This last time--I \nthink I have to give credit to some of the people who are talking \nabout--the-cut-and-run crowd. The surrender crowd, has got the Iraqi's \nattention. I see that they are, in fact, becoming a lot more aggressive \nin what they are doing right now. But I am going to share with you--\nthis is new stuff, this just happened 2 days ago. This isn't something \nthat might have happened 5 years ago or longer than that.\n  I remember a couple of weeks ago when General Petraeus came to \nCongress. He gave a report. It was a classified briefing on the fourth \nfloor and then he had some news conferences. He gave some positive \ncomments. I carry those around with me.\n  He said:\n\n       Anbar has gone from being assessed as being lost to a \n     situation that is now quite heartening.\n\n  He said:\n\n       We have, in Ramadi, reclaimed that city.\n\n  He said:\n\n       We are ahead with respect to reduction of sectarian \n     violence and murders in Baghdad by about a third, about 33 \n     percent.\n\n  These are the things that were happening at that time. I thought, you \nknow, a lot of the people who really just do not think we need a \nmilitary to start with and aren't concerned about what is happening to \nus over there might say General Petraeus was overly optimistic; he was \nnot being conservative; and he is telling us things that flat aren't \ntrue. So I thought I would go over and find out.\n  I went over. I was there this weekend. I spent most of my time, not \nin Baghdad, not in places where people go, but in Anbar Province. I \nspent my time in Taqaddum--an area nobody else goes to, to my \nknowledge, nobody has been to--and Ramadi and Fallujah. That is what we \nare talking about when we talk about Anbar Province.\n  The reason that is important is that is where most of the violence \nhas taken place. That is where we have watched, as time went by--where \nwe lost the most lives. We remember so well hearing the stories about \nour marines in Fallujah going door to door, very similar to what was \nhappening in World War II. And that is a fact, they were.\n  And that is a fact. They were. But then along came the surge and \nalong came General Petraeus. I have to tell you, General Petraeus was \nbeing very conservative when he was here 10 days ago or 2 weeks ago, \nwhatever it was.\n  I am going to tell you exactly what is happening there now. And these \npeople\n\n[[Page S6099]]\n\nwho are the prophets of doom, I hope they are listening.\n  First of all, let's just take Ramadi. That is the area which was \nsupposed to be the toughest area. You might remember a year ago al-\nQaida controlled that city. They held a parade a year ago, and they \ndeclared--after that parade, they said now Ramadi is their capital, the \ncapital of terrorism, the capital of al-Qaida.\n  Well, that is what happened a year ago. A year ago, we had a total of \n2,000 Iraqi security forces. You know the whole idea here is to get \nIraqi security forces trained, equipped, and let them take care of \ntheir own problems and their own terrorism that is coming in. Keep in \nmind that these terrorists are not after Americans; they are after \nIraqis. They do not want freedom in that country. Back then, at that \ntime, when they bragged, when al-Qaida bragged that Ramadi was their \ncapital, we only had 2,000 Iraqi security forces. That is all. Do you \nknow how many we have now? We have 12,200 trained and equipped Iraqi \nsecurity forces in Ramadi.\n  Things are happening there. They had 1,200 people volunteer from \nRamadi for the Iraqi security forces, more than they could train and \nhandle--in 1 day, 1 day. Well, they have things that are going on, \nshowing them support for the Iraqi people.\n  We all know that in our own hometowns, we have this thing called \nNeighborhood Watch Programs where we are going to try to stop crime. \nThey have one there too; it is called the neighborhood security watch. \nThis is where civilians--not military, not armed--these people put on \nlittle orange jackets and go out, and they try to find where IEDs are \nhidden, where explosive devices are hidden. They have spray paint, \norange spray paint, and they will put a circle around where they are. \nThen our troops will go in there and detonate them, and then everyone \nis fine. Before that, we were losing American lives by walking into \nthese situations. That is not happening now. This is because of the \nneighborhoods. These are the Iraqi people.\n  The troops have reclaimed Ramadi, very clearly. If you just look at \nRamadi--one city--since February, overall attacks are down 74 percent. \nThat is since February. That is when the surge was announced. The IED \nattacks are down 81 percent--not 10 percent, not 15 percent, 81 \npercent. It is a huge success story.\n  In Fallujah, you know, I can remember going to Fallujah years ago--\nMadam President, I ask unanimous consent that if I go over my 10 \nminutes, I have a few extra minutes and it will be deducted from my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, in Fallujah right now, one Iraqi brigade \nowns the battlespace. This is the term which we use in the Armed \nServices Committee, ``owns the battlespace.'' It means they are \nproviding their own security. Now, this was not true a few years ago \nwhen I first went there. No one could get anywhere near anything in \ntown. You would not take the risk of going in.\n  I was there during both of the elections, and I saw the Iraqi \nsecurity forces go to vote the day before the public would vote. When \nthey did this, they found themselves in a situation that was very \ndangerous. They voted the day before so they could provide the security \nfor the populous of Fallujah. Well, several of them were killed, as you \nrecall. But I talked to them each night after they went to vote, and \nthey were overjoyed in doing it. They said: The day is coming when we \nare going to be able to take care of the security in Fallujah.\n  All right, that was 4 years ago and 3 years ago and 5 years ago on \ndifferent trips I made there. This weekend, just 2 days ago, we have \nnow officially turned over the security of Fallujah to the Iraqis. They \nare providing the security.\n  If you look in the whole province of Anbar, you see another thing \nthat is happening. A lot of people think--we hear a lot from the Prime \nMinister, Maliki; we hear about the Minister of Defense, Jasim; we \nheard about Dr. Rubaie--all of these people who were appointed or \nelected to be the leadership of Iraq. They are not the ones who are \nreally making the decisions as far as the people are concerned. It is a \ndifferent culture. It is the clerics and the imams in the mosques.\n  Now, we measure what goes on in the mosques. It is just like we would \nhear a sermon in the United States in a church--we go there and find \nout what they are talking about. Prior to February, 80 percent of the \nmosques had messages that were delivered by the clerics there or the \nimams there that were anti-American, getting everyone stirred up \nevery Saturday or whenever they get together. In April, it was zero. \nThere wasn't one mosque, of the hundreds of mosques, that had an anti-\nAmerican message. For that reason, you have all of the populous coming \nin and saying: We want in on this thing. We are going to actually get \nsomething done here. We are tired.\n\n  They are the ones who have been the targets for the terrorists. They \nknow that. Certainly the clerics know that. That is why we are getting \nthis surge of cooperation.\n  In March of 2006, there were only 4,000 what they call Iraqi security \nforces. Today, there are 27,500 trained and equipped Iraqi security \nforces. The Sunni tribal coalition is fighting al-Qaida. That is \nsomething new. That wasn't happening 3 weeks ago. It certainly was not \nhappening in February.\n  I did stop in Baghdad. I spent most of the time in Anbar Province. \nBut in Baghdad, I was heartened to see something new--and I did not \nknow how it worked--is being put in place. It is called a joint \nsecurity station. Now, in Baghdad, there are 27 of them. So the night \nbefore last, late at night, I went out there and I saw how they worked. \nInstead of our troops going out on raids during the day and then coming \nback to the Green Zone where they will be safe, our troops are now \nstaying out there in those areas in these joint security stations. They \nare there with the Iraqis. They are sleeping there with them, they are \neating with them, and they are developing close relationships. That is \nthe key to this thing. This all came from General Petraeus, that we \nhave relationships in these areas. If you talk to our troops--you don't \ntalk to the guys on the Senate floor here; talk to the troops, find \npeople who are coming back. You ask them what their relationship is now \nwith the Iraqi security forces.\n  I have to say this also--even though we heard this before, we did \nverify it is actually more than this--the sectarian murders in Baghdad \nare down by 30 percent. Now, that is not quite as good as it is in \nAnbar Province. One of the reasons is Anbar Province is where all of \nthe problems were, and we are concentrating more and the Iraqis are \nconcentrating more there. I went to the marketplace there. I did not \nhave any helicopters over the top. I went through, I took an \ninterpreter, I stopped and talked to people on the street, and they are \nso appreciative of what we are doing there, and it is no wonder that \nthey are.\n  I just have to say that these relationships have formed. The term \nthey are using is the ``brotherhood of the close fight.'' I give \nGeneral Petraeus credit for engineering a lot of these things.\n  Lastly, I would say--you may not believe me because you know I have a \nstrong feeling about defending America, and you might say I am \nprejudiced. Yes, I was on the House Armed Services Committee for years \nand then on the Senate Armed Services Committee for the last 12 years, \nand so I watch and see what is happening. I recognize we need to \nrebuild America's military now to be able to meet future challenges \nlike this.\n  I would only say this: Everything that I have now said, if you don't \nbelieve it--and I thought I would never recommend to my conservative \nfriends that they ever watch CNN, but I am going ask them to go ahead \nand watch CNN this time, and there is someone named Nick Robertson who \nasked to go along to some of these stations I went to two nights ago, \nthe joint security stations. They are giving a report, and you will be \nshocked to find out that even CNN, which has been no friend of our \nPresident and no friend of our efforts in Iraq, is now coming out with \nreports that are saying exactly what I am saying right here.\n  So have your good time. Stand up and take your bows and criticize the \nPresident and criticize the effort in Iraq and criticize our soldiers. \nLet me tell you, they are doing a good job, we are winning there, and \nthis information I share with you is just 1 day old.\n\n[[Page S6100]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Let me ask how much time I used off of my amendment time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 13\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1094 to Amendment No. 1065\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the Republican manager, the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  I call up amendment No. 1094.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], Mr. Feingold, \n     Ms. Collins, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Carper, Mr. Reed, Mr. Biden, \n     Mr. Whitehouse, and Ms. Cantwell proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1094 to amendment No. 1065.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the consideration of certain factors relating to \n                         global climate change)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2___. GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Planning Considerations.--To account for the potential \n     long- and short-term effects of global climate change, the \n     Secretary shall ensure that each feasibility study or general \n     reevaluation report prepared by the Corps of Engineers--\n       (1) takes into consideration, and accounts for, the impacts \n     of global climate change on flood, storm, and drought risks \n     in the United States;\n       (2) takes into consideration, and accounts for, potential \n     future impacts of global climate change-related weather \n     events, such as increased hurricane activity, intensity, \n     storm surge, sea level rise, and associated flooding;\n       (3) uses the best-available climate science in assessing \n     flood and storm risks;\n       (4) employs, to the maximum extent practicable, \n     nonstructural approaches and design modifications to avoid or \n     prevent impacts to streams, wetlands, and floodplains that \n     provide natural flood and storm buffers, improve water \n     quality, serve as recharge areas for aquifers, reduce floods \n     and erosion, and provide valuable plant, fish, and wildlife \n     habitat;\n       (5) in projecting the benefits and costs of any water \n     resources project that requires a benefit-cost analysis, \n     quantifies and, to the maximum extent practicable, accounts \n     for--\n       (A) the costs associated with damage or loss to wetlands, \n     floodplains, and other natural systems (including the \n     habitat, water quality, flood protection, and recreational \n     values associated with the systems); and\n       (B) the benefits associated with protection of those \n     systems; and\n       (6) takes into consideration, as applicable, the impacts of \n     global climate change on emergency preparedness projects for \n     ports.\n       (b) Additional Considerations for Flood Damage Reduction \n     Projects.--For purposes of planning and implementing flood \n     damage reduction projects in accordance with this section and \n     section 73 of the Water Resources Development Act of 1974 (33 \n     U.S.C. 701b-11), the term ``nonstructural approaches and \n     design modifications'' includes measures to manage flooding \n     through--\n       (1) wetland, stream, and river restoration;\n       (2) avoiding development or increased development in \n     frequently-flooded areas;\n       (3) adopting flood-tolerant land uses in frequently-flooded \n     areas; or\n       (4) acquiring from willing sellers floodplain land for use \n     for--\n       (A) flood protection uses;\n       (B) recreational uses;\n       (C) fish and wildlife uses; or\n       (D) other public benefits.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this be \nconsidered as an amendment to the Boxer substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, this amendment is a bipartisan amendment \nintroduced with Senator Collins, Senator Feingold, Senator Carper, \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island, Senator Biden, Senator Whitehouse, and \nSenator Cantwell.\n  This is an amendment regarding the impact of global climate change \nand the need for the Congress, as we consider spending money and \nrequiring the Corps of Engineers to undertake certain projects across \nthe country--it just seems logical as a matter of protecting the \ntaxpayers' dollars as well as thinking about the future that we ask the \nCorps to include in their analysis of these projects judgments about \nthe potential impact or the real impact of global climate change on \nthat particular project.\n  Now, I am going to speak more about the common sense of doing that, \nwhy it is important, but I will just say very quickly, if you look at \nNew Orleans where we had a breach of the levees as a consequence of the \nhurricanes and the rise of the seas, it is clear that much of the \ninfrastructure of America is designed without reference at all to what \nis now happening to climates, to water bodies, to the various \nchallenges we face with respect to global climate change. So you need \nto sort of lay out the parameters within which we ought to be making a \njudgment about this particular issue. That begins by sort of setting \nforth the facts. We ought to deal with facts with respect to the \nsituation on global climate change.\n  This will be the first time Senators in the 110th Congress have been \nasked to vote on the floor in some way with respect to this issue of \nclimate change. But it is an important opportunity for Senators to \nstand up and be counted with respect to this issue.\n  All this amendment seeks to do, as a matter of common sense, is to \nask the Army Corps of Engineers to factor climate change into their \nfuture plans. By doing that, we are taking a small corrective measure \nto a process that is currently flawed because it does not do that. \nSecondly, we are making a statement here in the Senate about the need \nto finally, once and for all, recognize the reality of what is \nhappening with respect to climate change.\n  The guiding principle behind this amendment is obvious: It is that \nclimate change is real and it must be factored into our public policy \nin almost everything we do. If we are going to build buildings, those \nbuildings have to be designed to a whole new set of specifications in \nterms of carbon emissions, in terms of energy use, because all \ndownstream energy use will have an impact on how much coal and how much \noil, alternative fuels, and other resources we need to consume.\n  The fact is that other countries are moving much more rapidly than we \nare as a Federal Government. In fact, the States in the United States \nand cities in the United States are already moving with greater \nauthority and determination than the Federal Government. So this is a \nchance finally for Senators to put themselves on record.\n  Now, you can disagree on what--for instance, former Speaker Newt \nGingrich and I held a debate a couple of weeks ago in which the former \nSpeaker changed his position and agreed that climate change is taking \nplace and that human beings are having an impact on that climate \nchange. He agreed that we need to act, and urgently. Where we differed \nis in what actions to take, how those actions might be implemented, but \nthere was no disagreement about the need to factor this into the \npolicies in our country.\n  As we contemplate these steps we need to take, we really need to \nunderstand that everything we do here is to inform our decisions as we \ngo down the road. That is really the message this amendment ought to \nsend, that when it comes to public policy, we understand the warnings \nof our scientists, the warnings of the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change, and we are going to respond effectively at the national \nlevel.\n  The fact is, for too long this has been the subject of paid-for \nstudies by industries that wanted to resist, but we know that in \nAmerica, many of those industries have changed.\n  USCAP is a partnership of some of the major corporations in America \nthat have come together responsibly to take action with respect to \nclimate change. Companies such as General Electric and Florida Power & \nLight, American Electric Power, DuPont, Wal-Mart, many others are now \nresponding to the needs of this issue. It would be stunning indeed if \nthe Senate somehow stood apart from what the private sector and these \nStates and local communities are now engaged in.\n  Let me summarize quickly some of the findings of the IPCC, the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The most recent report was \nwritten by about 600 scientists. It was reviewed by 600 experts. It was \nedited by officials from 154 governments. So you have Prime Ministers, \nForeign Ministers, Economic Ministers, Trade Ministers, Environment \nMinisters, Presidents of countries all across the globe, who are \nengaged in moving forward. Only the United States has remained \nsignificantly on the sidelines.\n\n[[Page S6101]]\n\n  The basic facts are these: At both poles and in nearly all points in \nbetween, the temperature of the Earth's surface is heating up. It is \nheating up at a frightening and potentially catastrophic rate. The \ntemperature we know has already increased about .8 degrees centigrade, \n1.4 or so degrees Fahrenheit, and the warnings of the scientists I \nalluded to are that because of the carbon dioxide already in the \natmosphere, about which we have the ability to do nothing, there will \nbe an additional warming as a consequence of the damage that that does. \nSo we are locked in, whether we like it, to a warming of somewhere \nbetween 1.4 and 1.6 degrees centigrade. These same scientists have \nreported to us through some 928 or so peer-reviewed studies. A lot of \npeople are not sure what a peer-reviewed study is. After scientists \nhave done their study and they have put it out to the public, that \nstudy is reviewed anonymously by another group of scientists with \nsimilar backgrounds and discipline. They then anonymously make an \nanalysis of the methodology of those studies and of the conclusions \nthat were drawn. What is interesting is that all 928 studies have \ndetermined that human beings, through our greenhouse gas emissions, are \ncausing some of the increase of this temperature, and they have \nconcluded similarly that there is a tipping point--nobody can predict \nprecisely where it is--at which we get a catastrophic series of \nconsequences which will then be too late to change.\n  Scientists are inherently conservative people. They are people who \nmake judgments based on facts, as they discern them, through their \nanalysis, research, and experiments. They don't make wild \npronouncements that can't be substantiated. Where there is doubt, they \nhave expressed doubt every step of the way. Where something is not \nconclusive, they have said it is not conclusive.\n  But now in this most recent report, they have reported to the world \nthat there is a 90-percent likelihood that emissions of heat-trapping \ngases from human activities have caused ``most of the observed increase \nin global average temperature since the mid 20th century. Evidence that \nhuman activities are the major cause of recent climate change is even \nstronger than in prior assessments.''\n  In addition, they have said that the warming is unequivocal. The \nreport concludes that it is ``unequivocal that earth's climate is \nwarming as it is now evident from the observations of increases in \nglobal averages of air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of \nsnows and ice, and rising global mean sea level.''\n  The report also confirms that the current atmospheric concentration \nof carbon dioxide and methane, two important heat-trapping gases, \n``exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650,000 years.'' Since \nthe dawn of the industrial era, concentrations of both gases have \nincreased at a rate that is ``very likely to have been unprecedented in \nmore than 10,000 years.''\n  These are some of the facts. I will relate more, if necessary, later. \nThe bottom-line point to be made is, the opponents, those who say that \nit isn't happening, those who say that somehow we can't be certain that \nthis is a contributing activity, have yet to produce one peer review \nstudy--not one--that conclusively shows why what is happening is \nhappening and what is causing it, if it isn't the human activity that \nhas been alluded to by these 154 countries and thousands of scientists. \nThey certainly have an obligation to do that.\n  Here is what is most alarming. I have been listening to and working \nwith these same scientists since then-Senator Al Gore and I and a few \nothers held the first hearings on global climate change in the Senate \nin 1987. In 1990, we went to Rio to take part in the Earth summit which \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush participated in as then President of the \nUnited States and signed a voluntary agreement to deal with the \nframework for global climate change. In the 17 years since we attended \nthat conference, I have attended other conferences in Buenos Aires, in \nThe Hague, and in Kyoto. I have watched while we have learned more and \nmore with greater certainty about the impact of this science. \nThroughout that journey of 17 years, I have never heard the scientists \nas alarmed as they are today. The reason they are alarmed today is that \nwhat they have predicted for those 17 years is happening at a faster \nrate and in a greater quantity than they had predicted.\n  What is our responsibility as public people? If the scientists, 928 \nstudies strong, are saying to us, Senators, Presidents, Congressmen, \nhere is what is happening, and they say it with conclusive evidence of \nexactly what is contributing to it, I believe we, as public people, \nhave a responsibility to listen on behalf of the citizens. It is \nprudent to think about those things that we can do and ought to do in \norder to respond to this evidence.\n  Here is what those scientists tell us. Jim Hansen is the leading \nclimatologist of our country at NASA. He started warning about this in \n1988. Since 1988, those warnings have become more urgent. He now says \nwe have a 10-year window within which to get this right. If we want to \navoid the potential of a tipping point, we have 10 years to act. We \nalso know the scientists have revised their own estimates of what the \ntolerable range is with respect to global warming. A year and a half, 2 \nyears ago, they were telling us we could tolerate 550 parts per million \nof greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and that translated to a 3 \ndegrees centigrade warming that could be allowed before you reached \nthis catastrophic potential tipping point. They have changed that now. \nThose same scientists have now revised their estimate based on the \nevidence they are getting as a consequence of what is already happening \nall over the planet. All over the planet you can see the sea drying up. \nYou can see the southern portion of the Sahara Desert getting dryer. \nYou can see ocean currents shifting, species migrating. In South \nCarolina, they wouldn't have any duck hunting today if they didn't have \nfarmed ducks because the patterns have changed. The same thing in \nArkansas, where it has significantly altered. Hunters across the Nation \nare noticing changes in the migratory patterns of the prey they used to \nhunt. We are seeing 20 percent of the ice sheet in the Arctic has \nalready melted and predictions are the entire ice sheet will disappear \nwithin the next 30 years. The Greenland ice sheet, go up there and \nvisit, see the torrents of water rushing through the ice itself. The \ndanger of that is, this is on rock. This is not floating on sea ice, \nwhere the displacement is already recognized in the ocean because it is \nfloating in the ocean. This is ice on rock. As it melts, if it melts \nrapidly, it does spill into the ocean and it alters the levels.\n\n  In addition, the warming of the ocean itself alters the levels. The \nwarming expands the water, and as the water expands, the sea level \nrises and we are already seeing a measured level of increase of sea \nlevel according to all of our scientists. They don't doubt that. That \nis a stated fact. Sea level is rising.\n  Are we going to have the Corps of Engineers go out and build a \nproject that has to do with rising sea level and not take into account \nhow much it may rise, over what period of time it may rise? What the \nconsequences might be of a storm that is more intense, coupled with an \nincrease of sea level? It is common sense that we ought to be taking \nthose kinds of things into account.\n  The scientists now tell us we can tolerate not 550 parts per million \nbut 450 parts per million, and we can tolerate not 3 degrees centigrade \nincrease but a 2 degrees centigrade increase. Why is that important? \nThat is important because we can trace from before the industrial \nrevolution the levels of carbon dioxide and temperatures of the Earth. \nPreindustrial revolution, the levels of greenhouse gases were at about \n270 parts per million. It was about 500 or so billion tons of carbon \ndioxide in the atmosphere. It is measured by taking ice cores which we \ndrill. You bore into the ice. You can go back tens of thousands of \nyears, bore the ice and measure the levels of carbon dioxide, which \nalso gives you an indicator of the temperature of the Earth. We see a \ncomplete parallel between the rise of the Earth's temperature, the rise \nof carbon dioxide and the industrial revolution itself over those 100 \nyears.\n  We have now changed the level of greenhouse gases from 270 parts per \nmillion to 380 parts per million. That is what we are living with \ntoday. So if we are living with 380 parts per million\n\n[[Page S6102]]\n\ntoday and over 100 years plus we saw it go from 270 to 380, we only \nhave a cushion of up to 450. If we have already increased the Earth's \ntemperature .8 degrees and it is going to go up automatically another \n.8 degrees, that is 1.6, we only have a cushion of .4 to .5 degrees \nbefore we get to a tipping point.\n  I can't tell you with 100 percent certainty that is what is going to \nhappen. But the scientists, the best we have in this country, have told \nus it is a 90-percent likelihood this is happening as a consequence of \nthe things we are doing.\n  If you went to the airport today and got on an airplane and the pilot \ngot on and said: Folks, we are about to leave and there is a 10-percent \nchance we are going to get where we are going, are you going to stay on \nthe plane? This is a 90-percent certainty what scientists are telling \nus.\n\n  We went to war in Iraq on a 1-percent doctrine. As Vice President \nCheney said, if there is a 1-percent chance that harm could be done to \nour Nation, then we have to be willing to go to war and take the steps. \nWell, here you have a 90-percent chance that harm could be done to our \nNation, and we are doing next to nothing at the Federal level. That is \nthe cushion.\n  So when the scientists say to us we need to have a response, when the \nCEO of DuPont, the CEO of Wal-Mart, the CEO of 3M, the CEO of General \nElectric, and a host of other companies across our country are already \ntaking steps because they recognize this has to happen, and we have to \nrespond, we ought to be listening and responding ourselves.\n  Let me comment that, obviously, in California we already see a State \ntaking action. California passed a landmark bill that establishes a \nfirst-in-the-world comprehensive program of regulatory and market \nmechanisms to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases.\n  The mayor of New York is working on a congestion pricing scheme to \nlower emissions and pollution. Today, as we stand in the Senate, he is \nhosting a meeting of the mayors of the world's largest cities, from \nCopenhagen to Calcutta, on how to achieve the same ends.\n  Recently, my home State of Massachusetts, under the leadership of \nGovernor Deval Patrick, has rejoined the Regional Greenhouse Gas \nInitiative. Now you have eight States that have come together \nspecifically to try to reduce global warming pollution from \npowerplants. Across the Nation, 500 mayors from 50 States have signed \non to the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, which is an \ninitiative to advance the goals of the Kyoto Protocol. Even President \nBush finally saw fit to mention in his State of the Union Address ``the \nserious challenge of global climate change.''\n  We know specifically that climate change will challenge the way we \nmanage water resources in the United States. It threatens our coastal \ncommunities and habitats with rising sea levels, more intense storms, \nstorm surges, and flooding, especially along the gulf and Atlantic \ncoasts. In many places, climate change is going to put added pressure \non our water resources, increasing competition among agricultural, \nmunicipal, industrial, and ecological uses.\n  That is why this bill is an appropriate place for us to have an \namendment that merely asks for the Corps of Engineers--which is \nfederally chartered, and we spend Federal dollars on--to make certain \nwhat they choose to do is thoughtful about what the impacts may be that \nare predictable or ascertainable.\n  We know, obviously, what it looks like when we do not prepare for \nemergencies. We had it seared into our memories with the horrifying \nimages of Hurricane Katrina. We saw the anguish of everybody who lived \nthere and people across America.\n  The fact is, we are especially vulnerable to changes of weather and \nclimate extremes because of severe storms, hurricanes, floods, and \ndroughts. Now we need to begin planning for those emergencies that \nglobal climate change is likely to produce.\n  Over the last 100 years, we have seen an increase in heavy \nprecipitation that has strained the infrastructure we have in place to \ndeal with flooding. All across America, combined sewer overflows wind \nup putting raw sewage out into our rivers and lakes, which wind up \npoisoning and polluting those water bodies.\n  Thirty-nine percent of the rivers in the United States of America are \ncontaminated. Forty-five percent of the lakes in the United States are \ncontaminated. Forty-nine percent of the estuaries in America are \ncontaminated.\n  In 19 States in our country parents and children are warned: Don't \neat the fish because of the levels of toxins, chemicals that are in the \nwater--19 States. In 44 States there are warnings about specific \nlocations where you are not allowed to eat the fish.\n  So these are the kinds of consequences we see up and down the line. \nThe number of days each year now with more than 2 inches of \nprecipitation has risen by 20 percent. If we know the precipitation \nlevels have risen by 20 percent in the last 100 years, doesn't it make \nsense, as we conjure up levees or other projects to prevent flooding, \nto understand what the likelihood is of the size of that flooding, the \nextent of it, and the intensity, as it grows?\n  The Southwestern United States is in the midst of a drought that is \nprojected to continue well into the 21st century and may cause the area \nto transition to a more arid climate.\n  The Corps of Engineers stands on the front lines of all of these \nthreats to our water resources. They are our first responders in the \nfight against global warming. Hurricane and flood protection for New \nOrleans, levees along the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, levees in \nSacramento, CA, and port projects up and down our coasts, east and \nwest--these are just a few of the sites that are in danger. All of \nthese Corps projects and many hundreds more will feel the strain, \nimpact, and consequences of global climate change.\n  We also recognized, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the inadequacy \nof some of the projects in New Orleans that simply did not stand up. \nJust the other day, in the New York Times--Madam President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the article of May 7, entitled ``Critic of Corps \nof Engineers Says Levee Repairs for New Orleans Show Signs of Flaws'' \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 7, 2007]\n\n Critic of corps of Engineers Says Levee Repairs for New Orleans Show \n                             Signs of Flaws\n\n                           (By John Schwartz)\n\n       Some of the most celebrated levee repairs by the Army Corps \n     of Engineers after Hurricane Katrina are already showing \n     signs of serious flaws, a leading critic of the corps says.\n       The critic, Robert G. Bea, a professor of engineering at \n     the University of California, Berkeley, said he encountered \n     several areas of concern on a tour in March.\n       The most troubling, Dr. Bea said, was erosion on a levee by \n     the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a navigation canal that \n     helped channel water into New Orleans during the storm.\n       Breaches in that 13-mile levee devastated communities in \n     St. Bernard Parish, just east of New Orleans, and the rapid \n     reconstruction of the barrier was hailed as one of the corps' \n     most significant rebuilding achievements in the months after \n     the storm.\n       But Dr. Bea, an author of a blistering 2006 report on the \n     levee failures paid for by the National Science Foundation, \n     said erosion furrows, or rills, suggest that ``the risks are \n     still high.'' Heavy storms, he said, may cause ``tear-on-the-\n     dotted-line levees.''\n       Dr. Bea examined the hurricane protection system at the \n     request of National Geographic magazine, which is publishing \n     photographs of the levee and an article on his concerns about \n     the levee and other spots on its Web site at ngm.com/levees.\n       Corps officials argue that Dr. Bea is overstating the risk \n     and say that they will reinspect elements of the levee system \n     he has identified and fix problems they find. The \n     disagreement underscores the difficulty of evaluating risk in \n     hurricane protection here, where even dirt is a contentious \n     issue. And discussing safety in a region still struggling \n     with a 2005 disaster requires delicacy.\n       Hurricane season begins again next month.\n       The most revealing of the photographs, taken from a \n     helicopter, looks out from the levee across the navigation \n     canal and a skinny strip of land to the expanses of Lake \n     Borgne. From the grassy crown of the levee, small, wormy \n     patterns of rills carved by rain make their way down the \n     landward side, widening at the base into broad fissures that \n     extend beyond the border of the grass.\n       Dr. Bea, who was recently appointed to an expert committee \n     for plaintiffs' lawyers in federal suits against the \n     government and private contractors over Hurricane Katrina \n     losses, said that he could not be certain the situation was \n     dangerous without further inspection and that he wanted to \n     avoid what he called ``cry wolf syndrome.'' But, he\n\n[[Page S6103]]\n\n     added, he does not want to ignore ``potentially important \n     early warning signs.''\n       He praised the corps for much of the work it had done since \n     the storm, but he added that the levee should be armored with \n     rock or concrete against overtopping, a move the corps has \n     rejected in the short term.\n       Another expert who has viewed the photographs, J. David \n     Rogers, called the images ``troubling.'' Dr. Rogers, who \n     holds the Karl F. Hasselmann chair in geological engineering \n     at the University of Missouri-Rolla, said it would take more \n     work, including an analysis of the levee soils, to determine \n     whether there was a possibility of catastrophic failure.\n       But he said his first thought upon viewing the images was, \n     ``That won't survive another Katrina.'' Dr. Rogers worked on \n     the 2006 report on levee failures with Dr. Bea.\n       John M. Barry, a member of the Southeast Louisiana Flood \n     Protection Authority-East who has also seen the photographs, \n     also expressed worry. ``If Bea and Rogers are concerned, then \n     I'm concerned,'' he said.\n       Mr. Barry, the author of ``Rising Tide: The Great \n     Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America,'' said \n     it was important to seek balance when discussing the levees \n     in the passionately charged environment of New Orleans since \n     the storm.\n       ``I don't want anybody to have any false confidence'' in \n     the system, he said. ``On the other hand, if things are \n     improving, people need to know that, too. And things have \n     been improving.''\n       After being informed of the safety questions, Senator Mary \n     L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, prepared a letter to send \n     today to the corps commander, Lt. Gen. Carl A. Strock, asking \n     whether the work by the corps was sufficient to protect the \n     levee system.\n       At the corps, Richard J. Varuso, the assistant chief of the \n     geotechnical branch of the district's engineering division, \n     said that some erosion could be expected after a levee was \n     constructed. ``If it rains, we get some rutting,'' Mr. Varuso \n     said, adding that as vegetation grows in, the levee ``heals \n     itself.''\n       Walter O. Baumy Jr., the chief of the engineering division \n     for the New Orleans district of the corps, said the new \n     levees were made with dense, clay-rich soil that would resist \n     erosion. Although the stretches of the St. Bernard levee that \n     were still standing after the storm are composed of more \n     porous soils dredged from the nearby canal, Mr. Baumy said a \n     reinforcing clay layer on top some 10 feet thick would keep \n     the fissures from reaching the weaker soils.\n       Still, he said that ``we will take a look at this'' and \n     that the corps would make repairs where necessary.\n       Dr. Bea, who wrangled with the corps last year about \n     construction standards on the same levee, countered that \n     recent work in the Netherlands suggested that clay-capped \n     levees with a porous core, which are common, were prone to \n     failure in high water.\n       Another official who viewed the photographs, Robert A. \n     Turner Jr., the executive director of the Lake Borgne basin \n     levee district, east of New Orleans, said he was concerned, \n     but not necessarily alarmed, about the rills toward the crown \n     of the St. Bernard levee, calling them a common sight on new \n     levees in the area.\n       Mr. Turner said he was more concerned by the images of \n     larger ruts toward the base of the levee, and said of the \n     corps, ``We're just going to keep on them.''\n\n  Mr. KERRY. There is evidence in some of those levees they are not \ngoing to be able to withstand the intensity of the storms we now \nproject. The current guidelines for Corps project planning were written \nin 1983, long before scientists were focusing on the existence as well \nas the threat and impacts of climate change. So I believe it is \ncritical for the Corps to begin to account for that.\n  This amendment directs them to simply take climate change into \naccount when conducting project feasibility studies or general \nevaluation reports. It ensures that Corps projects, particularly those \nthat provide the first line of defense against climate impacts, are \ndesigned with global warming in mind.\n  This amendment is supported by dozens of groups that represent \ncoastal communities and resources, from the National Wildlife \nFederation and American Rivers, to the Association of State Floodplain \nManagers, regional groups that represent coastal interests, including \nthe Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, and the Great Lakes States \nCoalition. They all strongly support this amendment. They support it \nbecause it protects our wetlands. They support it because it advances \nour policy response on a subject where the politics has often struggled \nto keep pace with the science.\n  On a weekly basis, we see mounting evidence and mounting alarm bells \ngoing off highlighting our need to act. This is our opportunity to do \nso for the first time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, for clarification on the time, it is my \nunderstanding that we each started off with 30 minutes, and then we \neach get 15 minutes after that time has expired, and that I used 13 \nminutes of my time on my Iraq discussion.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, it is my understanding we asked for 2\\1/\n2\\ hours equally divided.\n  Mr. INHOFE. OK. So it would be an hour and 15 minutes for each side.\n  Mr. KERRY. An hour and 15 minutes, but we may well wind up yielding \nmuch of that back.\n  Mr. INHOFE. OK. So in this period now, I would have an hour, less 13 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct. The Senator would have 1 hour minus \nthe approximately 13, 14 minutes the Senator has already used.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. That is fine. I do not think I will use all of \nthis time right now. But in the event I get close to it, if the Chair \nwould let me know when I have 3 minutes left, I would appreciate that.\n  I don't know where to start. I really don't. I don't have all my \nstuff I normally would have in talking about this subject right now \nbecause I did not know this was going to come up.\n  Certainly, everyone has a right to bring up amendments. This \namendment is totally out of place for this bill. There is no \njustification for having it.\n  Let me make one comment about it. If the idea is--and apparently it \nis--this amendment is going to instruct the Corps of Engineers to come \nout with a report as to how anthropogenic gases would be affected by \neach project that is constructed around the country, let me suggest we \nhave a $14 billion bill we are going to be voting on at about 5:30, 6 \no'clock tonight. It is one that we desperately need. We have been \ndebating this issue.\n  But I can assure you, if for some reason the Kerry amendment was \nadopted, it would kill the bill. There is no question about it. But it \nis not going to be adopted. It is a good forum to stand out here and \ntalk about how everyone should be hysterical and should be worried.\n  It is interesting to me that the same people today who are saying the \nworld is coming to an end, we are all going to die, just back in the \nmiddle 1970s were saying another ice age is coming and we are all going \nto die. Which way do you want it?\n  On this one, he is asserting, I guess, that somehow the climate is \nchanging. Let me suggest, in 2006 the World Meteorological Organization \nissued statements refuting claims about a consensus that global warming \nis and will cause more frequent and intense storms, saying no such \nconsensus exists. Even Al Gore has now backed away from claiming that \nglobal warming will cause more frequent storms.\n  I have a chart in the Chamber, a plot of the hurricanes going back to \n1851. As you can see, this is constant. This has been going on for a \nlong period of time. Now, if a surge of anthropogenic gases--this \nCO2, methane, or whatever it is--were causing a warming \nperiod, then you would think right during the period around 1945 we \nwould have a warming period because in the middle 1940s, after the \nSecond World War, we had the greatest increase in greenhouse gases, \nwith an increase of about 85 percent during that time.\n  But what happened? It did not precipitate a warming period. It \nprecipitated a cooling period so bad that by the middle 1970s everyone \nthought we were going to die from another ice age coming.\n  Now, as far as this bill is concerned--I will probably repeat this in \na little more detail in the final remarks, but I have to say this: We \nhave $14 billion of projects. These are Corps of Engineers projects \nthat are desperately needed. We have not had a Water Resources \nDevelopment Act reauthorization bill for 7 years. We finally have the \nopportunity to have it.\n  Now, if this amendment should be adopted, it would delay all these \nprojects by at least a year because the Corps would have to go back and \nrestudy all these projects. So I think we should keep that in mind in \nterms of how it affects the bill we have.\n  Now, the junior Senator from Massachusetts talked about this great \ncoalition called the U.S. Climate Action Group. Well, I can tell you \nabout this great coalition. I do not know how many there are. There are \nabout maybe\n\n[[Page S6104]]\n\nseven or eight companies, corporations that have joined this saying: \nYes, we want to have some kind of a cap and trade on CO2. We \nwant to do something, maybe have a tax on them because we are good \ncitizens. We are concerned about the environment.\n  Well, we had a hearing about that, only to find out every last one of \nthem that we could research would end up making not just millions but \nin some cases billions of dollars if something like Kyoto would go \nthrough. I will be specific. DuPont would make $500 million a year in \ncredits. DuPont, no wonder they are for it. If I were a member of the \nboard of directors of DuPont, I would also do the same thing they are \ndoing.\n  These are being paid for reductions in greenhouse gases as a result \nof things they have already done, so they do not have to do anything \nmore. I am saying the $500 million a year--this came from an internal \nstudy, so this is not someone making an accusation--is based on $10 a \nton. If it goes up to $20 a ton, then it is going to be $1 billion a \nyear. So DuPont is for that. GE and BP, they are doing the solar panels \nand the wind tunnels. Well, sure, they would make a lot of money.\n  We can quantify all this. There is not time to go through all of \nthat.\n  The other assertion that was made by the distinguished junior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts was that the sea level is going to come up. There \nare so many people who have watched the Gore movie, and a lot of the \nteachers have gotten into this, and it makes teaching real easy. There \nis one school in Maryland, and a parent came by to see me after we had \nour confrontation with Senator Gore about 3 weeks ago and said: Do you \nrealize in my child's elementary class, his teacher makes them watch \nthis movie once a month? They said the scary part is--for little kids \nwho do not know any better, they think it is true, when it is not true. \nThey said the scary part is the sea level rise.\n  This is what the Senator is saying: The sea level rises. I would \nsuggest the IPCC, that is behind all of this--that is where it all \nstarted, like a lot of things in this country; it started with the \nUnited Nations--they came out in 2007, this year, and they have \ndowngraded the sea level rise from 39 inches to 23 inches. They have \ncut it in half. They said further, in a report this year, the release \nof anthropogenic gases by livestock is greater than our entire \ntransportation segment.\n  So we watch these things. Jim Hansen--I am going to talk a little \nabout the scientists. I hear this thing, and the reason we are seeing \nso many people now in a panic is they realize the science has been \nchanging on a regular basis for the last 3 years.\n  In fact, I have to tell you, when I became chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee in January, 4 years ago, I \nassumed that manmade gases were causing climate change. That is all you \nread in the media and all you heard about on radio and TV. I assumed it \nwas right, until they showed us how much this would cost to the average \nAmerican taxpayer. Then we said: Let's look at the science, only to \nfind out that the science has been reversed.\n  Scientists always talk about Jim Hansen. I have been on several \nshows, and there is Jim Hansen. He has been more exposed on this than \nany other scientist.\n  I remind you that Jim Hansen was given a grant from the Heinz \nFoundation of $250,000. I cannot say there is no relationship between \nthat and his opinion. I think there is and I will tell you why. I am \ngoing to talk about scientists.\n  Let's start off in Canada, which was one of the early signers of the \nKyoto Treaty. Canada was taking the advice of a famous group called the \n60 scientists in Canada. These are the 60 scientists who, at that time, \nrecommended to the then-Prime Minister of Canada that they sign onto \nand ratify the Kyoto Treaty. Well, since that time, the scientists--\nthat same group of people--have reevaluated the science. I will read \nsome of these things they come up with. The one I know by heart is the \nmost revealing. It says:\n\n       Observational evidence does not support today's computer \n     climate models, so there is little reason to trust model \n     predictions of the future.\n\n  Significant scientific advances have been made since the Kyoto \nProtocol was created, many of which are taking us away from the concern \nabout increasing greenhouse gases. Listen to this. These are the 60 \nscientists in Canada who were the ones responsible for advising the \nPrime Minister 15 years ago to sign the Kyoto Treaty. They say:\n\n       If back in the 1990s we knew what we know today about \n     climate, Kyoto most certainly would not exist, because we \n     would have concluded it wasn't necessary.\n\n  They are now petitioning Prime Minister Harper to change their \nposition on climate change. We have scientist after scientist. This is \na good one. I used this the other day. Of the three strongest \nsupporters of the alarmists--I am talking about the environmental \nalarmists who want to scare people--representing countries in a \nformidable fashion, one was Claude Allegre, a French Socialist, a \ngeophysicist, a member of both the French and American Academies of \nScience. He was one who marched in the aisles with Al Gore 10 or 15 \nyears ago, saying global warming is happening and it is caused by human \ndischarges. Now he is saying that it was wrong. He has completely gone \nover to the other side. He says that the cause of climate change is \nunknown. He has accused the proponents of manmade catastrophic global \nwarming of being motivated by money. I will talk about that in a \nminute.\n  Let's go from France to Israel. Astrophysicist Nir Shaviv was one of \nthose real believers, an alarmist. He thought the world was coming to \nan end and that we are going to be warming up and that we have to do \nsomething about it. But he now points to growing peer-reviewed evidence \nthat--the Senator from Massachusetts said there is no peer review \nevidence. Yes, there is. Shaviv refers to it here:\n\n       Peer reviewed evidence shows that the sun has actually been \n     driving the temperature change.\n\n  That is a shocker. You don't have to be a scientist to know that the \nSun can have something to do with climate change. He has now come to \nthe other side and is a skeptic. That was Nir Shaviv from Israel, who \nwas on the other side. They are all shifting.\n  David Bellamy from the United Kingdom was another environmental \ncampaigner at one time. He recently converted into a skeptic after \nreviewing the new science. Keep in mind that he is a Brit. He now calls \nglobal warming theories ``poppycock.''\n  These are actually, I would say, a few months old. Let me tell you \nwhat is happening recently. This is all in the last few days and weeks, \nand this is why all these people who want to scare people with global \nwarming are in such a panic. They see that the science is slipping \naway. Think about this fact: Many people think their ticket to the \nWhite House is to scare people with global warming. Talk to anybody \nrunning for President. Watch it on the debates tonight. If they can \nscare you good enough, you may vote for them because they say they are \ngoing to do something about this.\n  Here is a brandnew one. Dr. Chris de Freitas of the University of \nAuckland, New Zealand, said:\n\n       At first, I accepted that increases in human-caused \n     additions of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere \n     would trigger changes in water vapor, et cetera, and lead to \n     dangerous ``global warming''. But with time, and with the \n     results of research, I have formed the view that although it \n     makes for a good story, it is unlikely that manmade changes \n     are drivers of significant climate variation.\n\n  He wrote that in August of 2006. He was one who was on the other side \nof this issue.\n  Here is another one. Dr. Jan Veizer, professor emeritus of the \nUniversity of Ottawa, converted from being a believer to a skeptic \nafter conducting scientific studies of climate history. He said:\n\n       I simply accepted the global warming theory as given.\n\n  He said that in April 2007. He said:\n\n       The final conversion [to a skeptic] came when I realized \n     that the solar/cosmic ray connection gave far more consistent \n     picture of climate, over many time scales, than it did the \n     CO2 scenario.\n\n  Here is another recent one. This is a paleo climatologist, Ian D. \nClark, professor of the Department of Earth Sciences at the University \nof Ottawa, who said:\n\n       I used to agree with these dramatic warnings of climate \n     disaster. However, a few\n\n[[Page S6105]]\n\n     years ago, I decided to look more closely at the science and \n     it astonished me. In fact, there is no evidence of humans \n     being the cause. There is, however, overwhelming evidence of \n     natural causes, such as changes in the output of the sun.\n\n  Here is another new one, Bruno Wiskel, from the University of \nAlberta. He once was a believer in manmade global warming. He set out \nto build a ``Kyoto house'' in his own yard in honor of the U.N.-\nsanctioned Kyoto Protocol. That is how much of a believer he was. This \nwas said about him:\n\n       After further examining the science behind Kyoto, Wiskel \n     reversed his scientific views completely and became such a \n     strong skeptic that he wrote a book entitled ``The Emperors \n     New Clay Markets,'' debunking the myth of global warming.\n\n  I could go on. I could spend 3 hours talking about scientists who \nwere on the other side of the issue. I don't know where these guys came \nup with this idea. This is one that gets personal with Senator Gore. \nKeep in mind the source of this. This is MIT, Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology, and the Senator from Massachusetts is making these \nstatements. MIT climatologist Richard Lindzen, in June of 2006, said:\n\n       A general characteristic of Mr. Gore's approach is to \n     assiduously ignore the fact that the earth and its climate \n     are dynamic. They are always changing, even without any \n     external forces. To treat all change as something to fear is \n     bad enough. To do so in order to exploit that fear is much \n     worse.\n\n  We can go on and on and on. I have found one thing to be probably \neasier to discuss with people than the science. I think at least people \nknow that the science is not established, and there is no question that \nthe trend now is that those scientists who were alarmists are now \nskeptics.\n  While you could debate the idea of how accurate the science is on \nthis thing, there are things that you cannot debate. This is from the \nWharton School of Economics. When I was chairman of the committee and I \nwas a believer that this was true, this caused me to start looking into \nit. This is the Wharton Econometrics Forecasting Associates:\n\n       Implementing Kyoto would reduce the average annual \n     household income nearly $2,700, at a time when the cost of \n     all goods, particularly food and basic necessities, would \n     rise sharply.\n\n  That is bad enough, that it would be $2,700. I don't know, in this \nparticular amendment, what it would be. This amendment is clearly aimed \nat causing us in this country to somehow get into this mode of having \neither a tax on carbon or a cap on the trade program. Keep in mind, \nthis is old stuff here, which has been around a while. More recently, \nwe have had studies that were done by others.\n  Here is the MIT study that was released last month. This study \nanalyzed the economic impact of some of the carbon cap on trade \nproposals. We have looked at this. The study found that the Boxer-\nSanders bill, which is the one to be taken up by Senator Boxer and \nSenator Sanders, would impose a tax equivalent of $4,560 on every \nAmerican family of four. The Lieberman-McCain proposal, which is more \nmodest, would cost the same American family more than $3,500 in 2015 \nand almost $5,000 a year by the year 2050. This is huge.\n  I can remember, in 1993, the largest tax increase in modern history \nwas proposed and passed by the Clinton-Gore administration. It \nincreased the marginal rates on all Americans by huge amounts. I could \ndescribe it, but it was a huge tax increase. It would cost $32 billion \na year. Now, while that would cost $32 billion a year, the Kyoto \nelements that came out of the survey would cost over $300 billion a \nyear. In other words, what I am saying is that the cost of cap on trade \nsystems, or these reductions they are talking about, is far greater \nthan 10 times the largest tax increase of 1993 in modern history. You \ncan argue the science. One thing you cannot argue is the money. It will \ncost that amount of money.\n  I am going to go and cover a couple of things that I think are of \ninterest. We will put up the EU chart. When Kyoto was passed, and prior \nto being ratified by a number of different countries, of the 15 Western \nEuropean countries, only 13--all signed on, I say to the Chair, and \nratified the Kyoto Treaty--all 15 countries of Western Europe. Out of \nthose 15 countries, only 2 actually have met their emission \nrequirements. Everybody can pat themselves on the back and say I am \ngoing to pass this thing, but only 2 out of 15 met the requirements. \nThese are the countries, and the United Kingdom and Sweden were the \nonly two out of all those countries that reduced the amount of \nemissions and tried to reach a target. The rest of them had increases \nin emissions. There it is right there on the chart.\n  So let me suggest to you something else that is significant. During \nthe Clinton-Gore administration, when they had the various meetings \nwith people trying to sign onto the Kyoto Treaty, we talked about how \nmuch money this was going to cost. Thomas Wigley was the scientist \nchosen by Al Gore during the Clinton-Gore administration. He was \ncharged with the responsibility. He said if all developed nations--not \nsome but all--signed on to the Kyoto treaty and lived by its emissions \nrequirements ratified by the treaty, how much would it reduce the \ntemperature in 50 years. I finished saying of the 15 western European \ncountries, only 2 have made the targets. It is not going to happen, but \nif it did happen in never-never land, let's assume all the developed \nnations, all of us sign on to it and live by the emissions \nrequirements, how much would it reduce the temperature in 50 years? The \nresult at the end of 50 years was seven one-hundredths of 1 degree \nCelsius. It is not even measurable. So we have had the largest tax \nincrease for 50 years and yet nothing has come from it.\n\n  I am going to go over something we did a few weeks ago. A few weeks \nago the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--the committee I used to chair--decided she would have a \nhearing and have Al Gore come in and give his pitch, talk about his \naccomplishments, and so forth. I felt it wasn't going to go too well, \nso all I could do was use the opening statement I had. I had 10 minutes \nfor an opening statement. This is what I did.\n  I said: I am going to state seven positions and, Mr. Gore, I would \nlike to have you, since you are going to have all the time in the world \nto respond and I won't have nearly as much time, I want you to refute, \nif you can, any one or two or seven of these seven. He could not do it \nand did not do it. So we accept as fact those issues which I stated and \nhe didn't refute. Let me go over them quickly.\n  No. 1, this is somewhere between a $300 billion and $380 billion tax \nincrease on the American people annually. That is there. No one is \ngoing to deny that. That has already been verified. He did not refute \nthat point.\n  No. 2, if all these things happen, it would be like the chart we saw: \nIt would only reduce the temperature by seven one-hundredths of 1 \ndegree Celsius in a period of 50 years, and everybody understands that \nis true. He didn't refute that.\n  No. 3, there is no link between hurricane intensity and global \nwarming. I don't think anybody wants to get into that debate. I can and \nI will, perhaps--I won't get around to it until the second go round--\nvery carefully and succinctly talk about the fact that scientists are \nnow saying the linkage doesn't exist, and even Senator Gore is not \ntalking about that anymore. That is No. 3.\n  No. 4, the sea level rise scenario is bogus. That movie a lot of kids \nare required to watch--kids are impressionable. They don't understand. \nThey don't know it is science fiction. They think this is something \nthat is going to happen, and those kids have nightmares. I have parents \ntell me--similar to the lady from Maryland whose daughter had to watch \nthat movie once a month--we are all going to drown. It is a horrible \nthing, but they believe that.\n  Now we know the sea level rise scenario is bogus, and we have the \ndocumentation that says it is. He didn't refute that.\n  No. 5, it is all about money. You could put this in a lot of \ndifferent categories. Yes, there are huge amounts of money involved. We \nalready talked about the corporations supposedly joining in this \ncoalition to reduce greenhouse gases because they are good citizens, \nonly to find out they are making millions and, in some cases, billions \nof dollars by doing it. Every time I say this, I say I don't criticize \nthem because if I were chairman of a board of any of those companies, I \nwould do the same thing.\n\n[[Page S6106]]\n\n  I already said how much money we are talking about. There are huge \namounts of money to be made. Al Gore--and this is a small thing--after \nhis little award the other day, his speaker's fee went up to $200,000 a \nspeech. That is money. Obviously, there are a lot of people who would \nlike to get in on that deal.\n  There is also George Soros, the Michael Moores, and these various \nfoundations such as the Heinz Foundation that put in thousands and \nthousands and thousands of dollars, contribute to campaigns, buy off \nscientists. That group is very busy. That is No. 5. That wasn't \nrefuted.\n  No. 6, the believers are converting. That is what I started off this \npresentation with, that the believers who are out there, who were \nstrong believers 12 years ago, are now saying the science isn't there. \nI have given the documentation, I have given the quotes, I have given \ntheir names and titles. They are all distinguished scientists from all \nover, and they are coming the other way. That is why I say panic is \nsetting in because all of a sudden people realize people are catching \non.\n  Then the last point, No. 7. If you look at the movie--I confess, I \nhave not seen it--the last frame of the movie says--I believe this is \ngoing to be accurate because I have it pretty well memorized: Are you \nready to change the way you live?\n  The whole idea of the movie was to get people to start not using \ntoilet paper and all this stuff the elitists in Hollywood want \neverybody else to do except for them. Then we find out Senator Gore's \nhouse in Tennessee emits 20 times the greenhouse gases of the average \nhome in America--20 times. I said: You are asking everyone else are you \nready to change the way you live. So I asked him to take a pledge, \ngiving him a full year to comply, saying at the end of a year I will \nhave my house emissions down so it will be the same as average America. \nThis is day 51, by the way, and he hasn't signed that pledge.\n\n  I say these not in a light vein, because this isn't light. This is \nserious stuff. The science is there. The money is there. The taxes are \nthere, the cost to the American people. Fortunately, the American \npeople are catching on.\n  A lot of people have said: All right, Inhofe, so you got into this \nthing after you were once a believer in the fact that manmade gases \nwere causing climate change, and you changed when you found out what it \nwas going to cost. If the science isn't there and it is going to cost \nthe American people 10 times the largest tax increase in history, then \nwhy would people be for it?\n  I suggest there are a lot of people outside who are very vocal. One \nstatement is from France, from Jacques Chirac. Jacques Chirac said \nKyoto is not about climate change. He says:\n\n       Kyoto represents the first component of an authentic global \n     governance.\n\n  That is not Inhofe, that is Jacques Chirac.\n  Another is Margot Wallstrom. She was the environmental minister for \nthe European Union. Margot Wallstrom said:\n\n       We are not talking about climate change, we are talking \n     about--\n\n  Listen to this, Margot Wallstrom--\n\n       Kyoto is about the economy, about leveling the playing \n     field for big business worldwide.\n\n  There you have it, Madam President. My wife and I have been married \nfor 48 years. We have 20 kids and grandkids. I am doing this today for \nthem. I don't want them to have to pay huge tax increases the rest of \ntheir lives for something where most of the science has already been \nrefuted.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask the Chair if she will share with me what the time is \nnow at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 47 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Oklahoma has 31 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, let me try to find a place to begin. That is a \npretty extraordinary set of statements that has been set forth here. I \nsuppose the first place to begin is by setting the record clear that \nthe amendment has been completely and totally mischaracterized. This \namendment does not affect the projects that are in the WRDA bill. The \nSenator has said this would kill the WRDA bill and every project in the \nbill would have to go back and be redone. That is specifically not true \nbecause this is targeted toward future projects, and it specifically \nleaves out those projects currently approved and in the process. So it \ndoesn't touch anything in this bill. That is No. 1. That is the first \nmischaracterization.\n  Secondly, the Senator from Oklahoma spent a lot of time talking about \nKyoto and how Kyoto would be terrible, Kyoto would require people to do \nthis. We are not doing Kyoto. Kyoto is sort of out of the picture, in a \nsense, for us because we are well beyond the ability to ever meet \nKyoto.\n  More importantly, when he cites the European community not living up \nto Kyoto, Kyoto doesn't go into effect until next year. They don't have \nto meet it until next year and they have until 2012 to meet it. To be \nthrowing around comparisons to Kyoto today and saying, well, they \nhaven't met it; of 15, 2 actually made the target--that is pretty good, \nthat 2 have made the target before it even goes into effect.\n  Moreover, over the years, since 1990 when we began this process in \nRio--and I might add, President George Herbert Walker Bush and \nRepublican EPA Administrator Reilly and Republican Chief of Staff and \nformer Gov. John Sununu all signed on and agreed we needed to take this \nseriously and respond. That is not George Soros, that is not some \nHollywood crew. That is a Republican President of the United States who \nsigned us on to a voluntary framework over the years. And since then, \nEurope has reduced their emissions by .8 percent. Guess what. The \nUnited States has increased its emissions by 15.8 percent. So Europe is \nreducing; the United States is not.\n  The Senator mentioned a certain number of ``scientists,'' et cetera. \nFirst, we have done some research on a number of those folks \npreviously. Some don't even qualify as legitimate scientists, No. 1. \nBut No. 2, not one of them has ever produced a legitimate, scientific, \npeer-reviewed study that has met with scientifically peer-reviewed \nanalysis that signs off on their conclusions. Not one of them, not one, \ncompared to 928 peer-reviewed studies that have been put forward all \nover the globe by scientists from all kinds of countries.\n  He says scientists are changing their minds and moving in a different \ndirection. I don't know what scientists the Senator listens to or who \nhe is talking about because the most recent analysis of scientists is \nseveral thousand scientists who make up the intergovernmental panel on \nglobal climate change.\n  I know I heard the Senator talk about how this represents some kind \nof global conspiracy and global government and all of this, but it is \nsomething called the United Nations which Republican Presidents have \nused, conservative Republican Presidents, such as Ronald Reagan, often \nwent to and found the ability to work cooperatively to achieve things. \nWhether it was President Jerry Ford, President Richard Nixon, or \nothers, they respected the United Nations and have tried to enhance its \nability to do some things on an international basis.\n  These several thousand scientists have put out four reports. Each \nreport has been stronger than the next, and those scientists who are \npart of that process have not been leaving, departing, changing their \nminds, recanting, or asking to rescind their opinions. In fact, they \nhave strengthened those opinions.\n  The most recent statement is pretty clear. It is unequivocal that the \nEarth's climate is warming. Evidence from observations of increased \nglobal air and ocean temperatures--and I quoted earlier the 90-percent \nlikelihood they quote that it is human beings who are causing that.\n  You can choose to ignore evidence or not. All through history there \nwere people who argued man could never fly, and we did. There were \npeople who argued we couldn't have a vaccine for a disease. There were \npeople who argued putting fluoride in the water was going to kill you. \nThere were people who argued all kinds of things. There were people who \nargued the Earth is flat. But the fact is there were always bodies of \nevidence based on real science that found a consensus, and that \nconsensus has never been more powerful\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\nthan it is today that what is happening is happening. Eleven of the \nlast 12 years rank among the 12 hottest years on record since 1850, \nwhen sufficient worldwide temperature measurements began. Quoting from \nthe IPCC:\n\n       Over the last 50 years, cold days, cold nights, and frost \n     have become less frequent, while hot days, hot nights and \n     heat waves have become more frequent.\n\n  The Senator said people are saying there is doubt about the increased \nintensity of storms, so let me quote what 2,000 scientists from over \n154 nations, I think is the number, have concluded.\n\n       The intensity of tropical cyclones, hurricanes in the North \n     Atlantic, has increased over the past 30 years, which \n     correlates with the increase in tropical sea surface \n     temperatures. Storms with heavy precipitation have increased \n     in frequency over most land areas. Between 1900 and 2005, \n     long-term trends show significantly increased precipitation \n     in eastern parts of north and South America, northern Europe, \n     and north and Central Asia. Between 1900 and 2000, the \n     Sahell--that is the boundary between the Sahara Desert and \n     some of the fertile regions of Africa to the south--the \n     Mediterranean, Southern Africa and parts of southern Asia \n     have become dryer, adding stress to water resources in those \n     regions. Droughts have become longer and more intense and \n     have affected larger areas since the 1970s, especially in the \n     tropics and subtropics.\n\n  The Senator mentioned the scientists had revamped or revised their \nconclusion about ice melting from 39 inches to 23 inches. What they did \nwas take out of that assessment the ice melting and looked simply at \ntemperature--at the sea level rise that was occurring as a consequence \nof expansion and the other phenomena we are witnessing, and they found \nthat is between 7 and 23 inches. Maybe people think 7 and 23 inches \ndoesn't make a difference, but if you are in southern Florida, if you \nare on the islands, if you are in a port city, there are 100 million \npeople who live within 3 feet of sea level. So you are looking at a \npotential threat of great significance. Those scientists have not \nwalked away from that prediction. If you include the melting of the \nice, which our best scientists are now telling us may well happen, it \nis even worse. It has the potential of 16 to 23 feet.\n  When a doctor tells you that you have indications you have a cancer, \nyou usually go and try to find treatment. Well, the doctors are telling \nus something is going on and we ought to be concerned about it, and \nthey are pointing to what it is.\n  I want to speak about the greenhouse gas concept for a minute, \nbecause it allows us to use our minds, the minds God gave us. It allows \nus to think about consequences. Why do we call it greenhouse gas? Where \ndoes the word greenhouse gas come from? It came long before we talked \nabout climate change. The word greenhouse gas has been applied to these \ngases because they have the impact of creating a greenhouse effect on \nthe earth, and the science is absolutely unequivocal. I defy any \nscientist to come in here, who is legitimate and bona fide, and tell us \nthere is no greenhouse effect. Scientists agree there is a greenhouse \neffect.\n  In fact, life on Earth would not exist without the greenhouse effect. \nIt is this thin layer of gases in our atmosphere that in fact preserves \nthe ability for all of us to live on Earth, and those greenhouse gases \ncontain heat within the Earth that keeps the average temperature of the \nEarth at 57 degrees Fahrenheit. If you didn't have a greenhouse effect, \nthe Earth would be 60 degrees cooler. The greenhouse effect got its \nname because it behaves like a greenhouse at a nursery or in a garden, \nwhere the light can come in through the glass, and it comes through \ntransparently, the light hits the pots of earth and things that are in \nthere, reflects, and creates its own energy.\n  That energy then goes back out, reverberates the light, and comes \nback in a shortwave emission from the sun--and it is transparent--and \nit goes back in a longwave emission, which is less powerful. It is \nopaque. The veneer of the atmosphere, the greenhouse gas veneer is \nopaque to that energy trying to be released, which means it can't break \nthrough. It blocks it. A certain amount of that gas is trapped, and \nthat is what creates the greenhouse effect, and it warms over a period \nof time.\n  That warming is now absolutely conclusive. It is incontrovertible. As \nProfessor John Holden, who is a professor of government and earth \nscience at Harvard, and also affiliated with Woods Hole Marine, states \nvery clearly, the folks on the other side of this argument have two \nmajor obligations, neither of which they have ever met. Obligation No. \n1: They have to show the warming that is taking place is caused by \nother than the greenhouse gases. In other words, they have to show what \nis causing it if the greenhouse gases aren't. And No. 2, they have to \nprove the greenhouse gases that are going up and behaving in the way I \njust described are not what is creating the warming. And they have \nnever, ever, ever, ever met that standard. They have never provided a \nstudy that meets either of those tests. They can't show you what is \ndoing it and they can't show you why the gases we create aren't doing \nit. We do have, however, a group of scientists who are warning us about \nwhat we ought to do.\n  The Senator dismisses very quickly the companies that are involved in \nthis. Well, I have never met a company that goes off to do something \nand creates a storm about science based on complete fraud with respect \nto what they are doing. None of them came to the table willingly, may I \nadd. They have come to the table because they understand the science. \nThey have come to the table because they understand companies all over \nthe world are exerting responsibility.\n  The former Treasury Secretary, Paul O'Neill, was president and CEO of \nAlcoa, and for some 15 years now he has been taking steps as a CEO with \na sense of civic responsibility to try to respond to this science.\n  The fact is all of these scientists, and I might add the presidents \nof these other countries, are speaking, obviously, out of concern for \ntheir own countries, out of concern for their own constituencies, and \nfor the threats they face in those nations. Prime Minister Blair, who \nis leaving office shortly, has made this one of his major issues, one \nof his major crusades, and obviously has done so at some risk. But the \nfact is he and many other leaders of countries accept the science and \nunderstand their responsibility to try to meet it and to do so in a \nresponsible way.\n  I have spoken to the sea level rise and to the United Nations, but \nthere is one thing I might clarify very quickly. Mr. Hansen did not get \na grant from the Heinz Foundation. Mr. Hansen was presented a Heinz \naward in honor of former Republican Senator John Heinz, who was a \ngreat leader on this issue. Senator Heinz knew global climate change \nwas happening, he knew we needed to respond to these things, and Mr. \nHansen received an award, with no strings attached, no communication \nwhatsoever, as a recognition of his work. He has received awards from \nmany other organizations and entities over the course of his lifetime, \nand I would put his credentials and his experience up against any of \nthe other so-called scientists we sometimes hear referred to.\n\n  I might also add we have heard a lot about the implementation of \nKyoto. I led the floor effort on Kyoto when the so-called Byrd-Hagel \namendment was brought to the floor, so I know something about that \nparticular process. The fact is those who have always opposed doing \nsomething about global climate change have tried to use that vote and \nKyoto itself as an excuse to sow fear in their own party, saying how \nmuch it is going to cost Americans and how terrible it is going to be, \nhow it will ruin our economy and take us backwards. These are exactly \nthe same arguments we heard in 1990 when we did the Clean Air Act.\n  I sat in the room right back here, which is now the majority leader's \nroom. It was then Senator Mitchell's office. We sat with EPA \nAdministrator Reilly, with John Sununu, and with others. Republicans \nand Democrats alike sat at that table and we negotiated out the Clean \nAir Act. I remember all the ``Chicken Little'' cries we heard as people \ncame and said, well, you know, if you make us do this, it is going to \ncost $8 billion to the industry and it is going to destroy the \nindustry, and it will reduce American jobs, and we are going to be \nnoncompetitive. The environmental community came in and said, no, no, \nno, those guys are wrong, it is not going to cost $8 billion, it is \ngoing to cost $4 billion. And it won't take 8 years, we can do it in 4 \nyears. Guess what. It cost about $2 billion and\n\n[[Page S6108]]\n\ntook half the time. They were wrong, too.\n  All the statements about how it was going to ruin America's economy? \nWe wound up growing our economy by 123, or whatever, percent over those \nyears. More jobs were created and Americans did better. We did it and \nwe breathed cleaner air at the same time.\n  The fact is, nobody has the ability to predict what is going to \nhappen when you start down this road. Once you begin to kick these \ntechnologies into gear, then the entire basis of the judgments you are \nmaking begins to change, because the technology moves far more rapidly \nthan anybody can surmise, and some things are going to appear that we \ndon't even know about today.\n  Let us assume the Senator from Oklahoma is correct and I am wrong, \nand the scientists are all wrong, and Al Gore is wrong, and everybody \nwho has spoken out on this all through the years is wrong, and that we \nwent down this road in order to deal with some of these issues. What is \nthe worst that could happen?\n  Given past experience with the Clean Air Act, and given experiences \nwith where the world is moving on this issue, we are going to create a \nwhole bunch of new technologies, create a bunch of new jobs, where we \nwill have cleaner air to breathe, a population that is less impacted by \nasthma and emphysema and by other airborne particulate diseases, there \nwill be less cancer, and we will wind up more energy independent, with \ncleaner fuels, and the United States will have greater security. We \nwill lead the world in these technologies, because these other \ncountries are committed to buying them.\n  If they are wrong, what is the worst? Global catastrophe, according \nto every prediction. That is the ledger here. You can take your choice. \nYou can be prudent and take the steps we need to take, or you can \ncontinue to keep your head in the sand and ignore the work of these \nthousands of scientists and these leaders around the world and these \ncorporate citizens and others who have come to the table.\n  All we are asking for here is that our Corps of Engineers makes a \njudgment. I mean, are we saying they shouldn't make a judgment; that \nthey shouldn't make an analysis? Maybe the judgment they will make is \nthey will agree the science is wrong. But shouldn't they be asked to \nmake that judgment? Shouldn't they be asked to measure what in fact is \npossible, as a consequence of the evidence on the table? Wouldn't it be \nhelpful to all of us to have them making those kinds of judgments?\n  I think when we look behind the curtain of the sort of red herrings \nthat get thrown out here, there isn't one that stands up; not one peer-\nreviewed scientific analysis, not one legitimate, cogent statement to \nthe contrary to explain why what is happening is happening and what the \nimpact is.\n  Let's say it wasn't just the greenhouse gases, because we are not \ndoing anything in this amendment to deal with greenhouse gases. Let's \nsay it isn't the greenhouse gases but that the Earth is warming. Isn't \nit smart to have the Corps of Engineers at least make a judgment about \nwhat the effect of the warming may be with respect to water, since they \nare going to be dealing with water resources? This is, after all, the \nbill that deals with water resources for our country. It would be smart \nfor the Corps of Engineers to be able to make some judgment with \nrespect to that.\n  The Chair of the committee has come to the floor and has some \ninformation with respect to the Corps of Engineers' willingness to do \nthat, so I yield such time as the Chair might use, and I reserve the \nremainder of the time after that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains for Senator Kerry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator has 26 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the President could just tell me when I have used 4 \nminutes, I will yield the rest of the time back to Senator Kerry.\n  I think, again, this gives us the sense of some of the debate that \nhas been going on inside the environment committee and across the \nvarious committees. I certainly believe these kinds of debates are \nhelpful because we get the charges, if you will, out in the open. \nPeople on one side or the other can have this free debate.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. When I learned he was going \nto offer this amendment, I wrote to the Corps and I asked them whether \nthey are considering the impact of global warming already as they do \ntheir work. I will ask consent to have printed in the Record their \nanswer to me. It is dated May 10. I will just read a little bit of it.\n\n       The Corps planning process has been considering the \n     physical impacts of global climate change for over 20 years, \n     initially through the consideration of sea level rise in \n     project planning. As part of the evolution in our approach to \n     incorporating the impacts of global climate change, we are \n     including more risk and uncertainty analyses in our planning \n     process. We continue to collaborate with Federal agencies to \n     ensure that we are up to date on the current interpretations \n     of climate change scenarios and to refine our processes as \n     more aspects of global climate change are understood. This is \n     imperative because the water resources public works projects \n     being planned and designed today must protect against and be \n     resilient to future extreme events, which could be \n     exacerbated by global climate change.\n\n  They are basically saying:\n\n       We believe the [Corps] is a leader in developing an \n     innovative, yet practical, cost-effective approach to \n     addressing climate change impacts in our planning and \n     management of our key water-based infrastructure. We are well \n     positioned to respond to the Nation's needs now and in the \n     future.\n\n  I want to have this letter printed in the Record because I want to \nsay to my friend from Massachusetts that as a result of his offering \nthis amendment, we were able to get the Corps to focus on everything \nthey have been doing to address climate change. I think the Senator \nwill be pleased to see some of the steps they are already taking. I \nthink his amendment is really consistent with what the Corps has \nalready begun to do.\n  I thank Senator Kerry. I thank Senator Inhofe for engaging in this \ndebate with him. It is a little more pleasant for me to see the debate \nbetween Senator Kerry and Senator Inhofe rather than Senator Boxer and \nSenator Inhofe. It is a little bit of a rest for me. I thank both of \nthem for their intelligent approach to this debate.\n  I send this letter to the desk and ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Department of the Army,\n\n\n                                 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 2007.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: This is in response to your letter of \n     May 8, 2007, to Lieutenant General Strock requesting \n     information on how the Corps addresses the potential impacts \n     of global warming in our planning process.\n       There are many avenues through which the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers (USACE) Civil Works program addresses the difficult \n     scientific, technical and operational issues raised by the \n     uncertainty associated with climate change and its potential \n     impacts on planning and management of water resources \n     infrastructure. Attached please find a discussion of some \n     actions we are taking to address climate change in all of our \n     activities.\n       The Corps planning process has been considering the \n     physical impacts of global climate change for over twenty \n     years, initially through the consideration of sea level rise \n     in project planning. As part of the evolution in our approach \n     to incorporating the impacts of global climate change, we are \n     including more risk and uncertainty analyses in our planning \n     process. We continue to collaborate with Federal agencies to \n     ensure that we are up to date on the current interpretations \n     of climate change scenarios and to refine our processes as \n     more aspects of global climate change are understood. This is \n     imperative because the water resources public works projects \n     being planned and designed today must protect against and be \n     resilient to future extreme events, which could be \n     exacerbated by global climate change.\n       In conclusion, we believe the USACE is a leader in \n     developing an innovative, yet practical, cost-effective \n     approach to addressing climate change impacts in our planning \n     and management of our key water-based infrastructure. We are \n     well positioned to respond to the Nation's needs now and in \n     the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Steven L. Stockton, P.E.,\n                                   Deputy Director of Civil Works.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the remainder of the time to Senator Kerry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, since we are having so much fun here, let \nme go\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\nback and respond to the Senator's response. After this, I have a very \nsignificant meeting I am going to have to attend. I am going to have to \nreserve the remainder of my time, go attend that, and come right back \nhere. I have to leave temporarily. Let me go ahead and cover these last \n12 things the Senator from Massachusetts has said.\n  First of all, I think he is right on this--I found out he was right. \nI had said the cost of this and the effect of this would be to delay \nprojects. I found out, after he said it and I found out it is true, \nthat his bill starts from this point forward. The reason I didn't know \nthat is because his amendment was not filed until last night, and I was \non my way back from Iraq last night, so I was not aware of this. It \ndoesn't change my argument, though. The argument is this is another \nstep which has to be taken any time we have to go through any kind of a \nprocess.\n  I am sure, when we have the next Transportation reauthorization bill, \nhe will have an amendment saying we have to know for each project how \nthis could affect climate change. It really doesn't make that much \ndifference.\n  The second thing, he said Kyoto is not really on the table. I am glad \nto know that because whether you call it Kyoto or something else is not \nimportant. It is still going to have to be some kind of restriction, \nsome kind of carbon tax, some kind of cap-and-trade policy. When you \ndo, it is going to cost money. So, yes, I used the Wharton Econometric \nSurvey to demonstrate clearly that this is a tax increase of $2,700 on \neach family of four. However, the more recent bills--I grant to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, we are talking about this. We are talking \nabout the ones that are more recent than this. The more recent ones, \ndone by MIT, the Massachusetts--I stress that--Institute of Technology, \nshow that the Sanders-Boxer bill's cost is about $4,500 for each family \nof four. McCain-Lieberman would be $3,500. So if you would rather not \nuse Kyoto, that is fine. We will use some of the more recent ones. \nNonetheless, it will be something equal to 10 times the largest tax \nincrease in contemporary history.\n  He said also that there is not one peer-reviewed scientist--or study \nthat substantiates what we are talking about. So let me just read them \nagain here to make sure we understand what this is.\n  Two weeks ago, the top hurricane scientist in the U.S. Government--\nindeed, one of the top hurricane scientists in the world--published a \npeer-reviewed study in the scientific Journal EOS that concluded from \nthe evidence that ``hurricanes in the Atlantic have not increased for \nmore than a century.'' Peer reviewed. There it is.\n  Another one is a peer-reviewed study published in the April 18, 2007, \nissue of the science journal Geophysical Research Letters which found:\n\n       If the world continues to warm, vertical wind sheer, which \n     literally tears apart storms, would also rise. These winds \n     would decrease the number and severity of storms we would \n     otherwise have.\n\n  In other words, it would actually have a decreasing effect. Again, it \nis peer reviewed.\n  We had a third one, too. We have several of those which are peer \nreviewed. So that statement is not correct.\n  Let's see, the fourth point is Inhofe said this is some kind of a \nglobal conspiracy. No, Inhofe didn't say that; Jacques Chirac said \nthat, and I quoted him. I have quoted him, so there would be no reason \nto repeat it; it would be redundant, although it might be worth \nredundancy here. Jacques Chirac said--and he wasn't talking about Kyoto \nhaving anything to do with climate change.\n\n       Kyoto represents the first component of an authentic global \n     governance.\n\n  That is not Senator Jim Inhofe saying that; that is Jacques Chirac.\n  I quoted other people--Margot Wallstrom, who is the Environmental \nMinister from the EU, or was at that time. She said it is about \nleveling the playing field worldwide. Again, the Senator from \nMassachusetts is wrong. It wasn't Senator Inhofe; it was Jacques \nChirac.\n  No. 5--I always enjoy this one--they use the consensus that the \nworld--you know, the Flat Earth Society. They have it backward. In \nfact, this is what we are faced with, the same thing science was faced \nwith back when they thought the world was flat. They thought the Earth \nwas flat, and that was the consensus. All the experts agreed on that at \nthat time. Then we found out with new science that it was not. That is \nexactly, precisely what is happening in this case.\n\n  They all thought at that time that manmade gases were causing climate \nchange. Now they readily admit and say--and I will be glad to read them \nagain. I plan on yielding back a bunch of time because we do want to \nget to voting before too long. But I read all the scientists who are \nvery strong in their consensus, and these were the scientists who were \nthe strongest pro-global-warming extremists around 10 years ago, but \nthey have changed their minds. It is in the record. I already read it \nabout an hour ago.\n  Then, No. 6, the statement the Senator from Massachusetts said, the \nIPCC survey--that is the United Nations--was talking about 2,000 \nscientists agree to it. It is not 2,000 scientists. What he is quoting \nfrom is the summary for policymakers. Every time they have an IPCC \nmeeting--they have had five now, I believe--they start out with a \npolicy summary for policymakers. These are the politicians, not the \nscientists. They are the ones who believe it. Yet, even though they are \nstrongly on the other side, they have to defend their position. It was \nthe United Nations that started this whole thing. The IPCC was the \ngroup that did it.\n  It is going to be very difficult for them to change their position, \nso gradually they are coming over to our side.\n  The next thing the Senator from Massachusetts was criticizing me for \nwas talking about minimizing the sea level rise. I am not. That is the \nIPCC. That is the United Nations. They said prior to this year's report \nthat it was going to rise 39 inches over the next 100 years--until this \nyear. They came out and they said: We will reduce that. Instead of 39 \ninches, it will be somewhere between 7 and 23 inches. Every time they \ncome out with a new report, they reduce that sea level rise. Again, it \nis not Inhofe saying it; it is the IPCC talking about it.\n  No. 8, the greenhouse gas effect. I agree with this. The greenhouse \ngas effect gives life. We need to have that. The question is, What are \nthe manmade gases? We call them anthropogenic gases, CO2, \nmethane, some others. These are primarily what they are talking about. \nDo these have a result of increasing temperatures? Is it increasing \nfrom natural causes or is it increasing from manmade causes?\n  Keep in mind, we have charts that show throughout the beginning of \nrecorded history it has been like this. You know, people don't \nunderstand. God is still up there. We have natural things that are \ntaking place. It gets warmer, gets cooler, gets warmer, gets cooler. \nEvery time it does, I have an interesting presentation where we talk \nabout the hysteria we see in the press, only to find out this was \nsomething in the New York Times in 1895, the same thing as they are \ntalking about today.\n  This happens, natural causes are out there, and, yes, you need to \nhave the greenhouse effect. It gives life. The question is, What do \nmanmade gases--how do they increase it?\n  Put that Wiggly chart up one more time, the Tom Wiggly chart. This is \nthe scientist who was commissioned by Al Gore during the Clinton-Gore \nadministration. He said that if all developed nations signed the Kyoto \ntreaty and lived by its emission requirements, it would reduce the \ntemperature only by seven one-hundredths of 1 degree in 50 years. It is \nnot even measurable. This is not me talking. Again, these are the \nscientists. They are scientists I didn't commission. That was done by \nAl Gore.\n  I am glad for the correction on Jim Hanson. He said Jim Hanson was \nnot given a grant by the Heinz Foundation. Instead of that, he was just \ngiven a check. I recant what I said. He was not given a grant for \n$250,000; he was given a check for $250,000.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts talked about the Byrd-Hagel amendment. \nLet's remember what that amendment was. The amendment said--and this \npassed by 95 to nothing in this Senate. I was standing here. I voted. I \ndon't know whether the Senator from Massachusetts was here. I assume he \nwas.\n  Anyway, what it was, after they signed this protocol, they wanted to\n\n[[Page S6110]]\n\nsubmit it to the Senate for ratification. That is the process you have \nto go through. The President and administration can sign it, but it has \nto be ratified. Thank God it has to be ratified, and all these other \ntreaties do, so we at least read them. So the Byrd-Hagel amendment was \npassed by 95 to 0--that is unanimous from everyone who was here--that \nsaid we will not ratify the Kyoto treaty if either of the two following \nis true: No. 1, that we are not requiring the developing nations to do \nthe same thing the developed nations do, and No. 2, that it would be \neconomically devastating for our country.\n  We know what it is going to cost in terms of how it relates to the \nlargest tax increase in history, and we know also that China and the \ndeveloping nations have no interest. China will become the largest \nemitter of CO2 this year, way ahead of schedule. They are \ngoing to be the largest emitter, and they are sitting back laughing at \nus. I think we have only put on line one coal-fired generating plant to \ngive this country the energy to run this country in the last 15 years--\nlet me correct that. In the 15 years between 1990 and 2005, we didn't \nput on line any new coal-fired generating plants. At the same time we \nare not doing anything, China is cranking out one every 3 days.\n  Now, of the people standing on the floor of the Senate, I know \nSenator Dorgan is concerned about jobs, life in this country and other \ncountries as well when we run out of electricity. Right now we are \ndependent upon coal for 53 percent of the energy it takes to run this \ngreat machine we call America.\n  Now, if you pull 53 percent out, this is where the corporations make \nmoney, those who are competing with coal. They make a fortune. Who \npays? The poor pay. There was a very interesting study done not too \nlong ago. It is not just a matter of the tax increase, CBO, 2 weeks \nago, came out with a report that said, yes, it is going to cost this \namount of money. But the worst part of it is it is going to cost the \npoor, people on fixed incomes. Those are the people who have to spend a \nlarger percentage of their income on energy, on heating their homes and \nthose things that are a necessity.\n  So, anyway, the Senator from Massachusetts talked about the Byrd-\nHagel amendment. It is still out there. It still has 95 Senators who \nsaid: We don't want to ratify any program that is not going to apply \nequally to Mexico and India and China and other developing nations.\n  Then, I guess, No. 11, the point he made when he was talking about \nthe economy, saying, oh, this is not true, well, I have a great deal of \nrespect for the junior Senator from Massachusetts, but would you rather \nbelieve him or would you rather believe the Wharton Econometric Survey \nin conjunction with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology?\n  Look, I know I am not as smart as most of you guys around here. So I \ngo to the areas where they are smart. I know where the scientists are. \nI would rather quote scientists who do know rather than stand here and \ntell you how smart I am because I am not. But I know how to read these \npapers. I do know for a fact the scientists have come over to our side.\n  I would suggest anyone who wants to really get into this thing, I \nhave got a Web site, which is www.epw.senate.gov. Now, go to that. We \nhave literally thousands, not hundreds but thousands of scientists who \nare now saying the science is not there. You cannot say there is a \nconsensus.\n  Lastly, Senator Boxer, we are getting along real fine on this bill. \nShe does not want to kill it; I do not want to kill it. This amendment \nis not going to pass. So I think the bill will pass.\n  But they say the Corps of Engineers is already doing this. If the \nCorps of Engineers is already making this evaluation on projects as to \nwhat effect they are going to have, then why do we need this amendment? \nI would suggest we do not need this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. How much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes 45 seconds. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has 22 minutes 41 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I am \ngoing to go to an appointment that I have right now and try to return \nin a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me respond, if I can, to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. I regret that he has to leave.\n  Almost every single one of the statements he just made does not apply \nto the question of global warming itself.\n  Let me give you an example. The Senator just cited two peer-reviewed \nstudies. One of the peer-reviewed studies he talked about talks about \nhurricanes and the scientists who found that hurricanes have not \nincreased.\n  We never asserted they have increased. I didn't come here and say \nthey have increased. Maybe some people have talked about the increase \nin the number of hurricanes, but he has a peer-reviewed study, \nsupposedly, that talks about hurricanes have not increased. He does not \nhave a peer-reviewed study that says global climate change is not \nhappening because of human-induced greenhouse gases. Not one.\n  The second study he cited as a peer-reviewed study was vertical wind \nshear, decreasing the effect of wind. Well, I am not here to debate \nvertical wind shear. Yes, there are certain indicators within the \nframework of models that cannot predict accurately exactly what is \ngoing to happen as a consequence of climate change. We have admitted \nthat for 17 years.\n  The Senator, obviously, missed the fact that I said--I led the effort \non our side on the Kyoto agreement with respect to Byrd-Hagel. I \nadvised my colleagues to vote for it. I voted for it. And we voted for \nit because there was a simple principle at stake, which is whether we \nwere going to treat this on a global basis, whether we were going to, \nall of us, join in. If the United States was going to be part of the \nsolution, we could not be a solution by ourselves. We needed to have \nthe less developed countries and others join in.\n  That has been a fight we have been involved in now for a number of \nyears. But, please, I ask the Senator, do not misinterpret what we were \ndoing in that. We were not suggesting that it was the cost factor or \nbecause we did not need to do it. It is because we needed to do it in \nthe most sensible way, and we needed to do it within a global \nframework. We still need to do that.\n  Now, each of the statements the Senator just made is flat incorrect--\nmost of them, 90 percent. I will be very specific. He talked about how \nit was politicians who wrote this, not scientists. Well, in fact, that \nis not true. This report was created by scientists. And the EPW \nCommittee itself had a briefing in which those scientists, including \nthe cochair, Susan Solomon of NOAA, presented the results.\n  The first page of the summary for policymakers lists the lead \nauthors, every single one of whom are scientists. So let's get our \nfacts straight. Moreover, the Bush administration made the following \nstatement in support of the IPCC. They said that they continue to \nsupport and embrace the work of the IPCC and the science behind their \nmost recent report.\n  So the Senator is at odds even with an administration that has been \nreluctant to deal with this issue. Let me also point out that--he \npointed out this question of the discrepancy of the 7 and 23 inches in \nthe change in sea level. Incidentally, these little sort of twists of \nfact are not so little in the summary because they are being used in \nthe conglomerate, one after the other, to try to confuse people and \npretend that somehow this issue is not real.\n\n  Each one of them gets blown away by the real facts, but they still \nkeep coming back, something I learned a lot about a few years ago, \nwhere the facts don't matter. You just repeat something enough even if \nit is not true. Well, the fact is, with respect to the sea level rise, \nthey try to make a big deal and say: Well, they have reversed the \nscience; the scientists are going backwards. No, they are not. The sea \nlevel rise is still predicted to go up between 7 and 23 inches by 2100. \nThat is what the IPCC report still says. The upper limit is lower than \nthe previous report because they took out the contributions from \nGreenland and the Antarctic ice sheet. The reason they took them out is \nbecause the scientists believed, in keeping with their notion of \naccuracy and of trying to not be alarmists, that there was a lack of a \nreliable\n\n[[Page S6111]]\n\nmodel to accurately estimate the melting rate.\n  Now, you do not have a reliable model to accurately reflect the \nmelting rate. But, guess what. To your eye, you can go up and see the \nmelting. You can look at a satellite photo of 1979 and a satellite \nphoto today, and your eye will tell you 20 percent of the ice is gone. \nIt is not getting colder, it is getting warmer. The ocean is getting \nwarmer.\n  So what is the logical conclusion? The logical conclusion is more ice \nis going to melt. And what happens when more ice melts? What was a \nreflectent to the rays of the sun--the ice--no longer is there to \nreflect. The sunlight goes into the water. Guess what it does in the \nwater. It is absorbed, it warms up the water, and then guess what \nhappens. The ice melts faster. You do not need to be a scientist to do \nthis. Any kid in school can figure that out, which is why young people \nget this.\n  The Senator should not distort these facts. One after another he lays \nout something that suggests something that is happening that is not.\n  Take Jacques Chirac's comment. First of all, he is the only person I \nknow of who ever suggested that Jacques Chirac speaks for America. But \nhaving said what he said about Jack Chirac and global governance, \nglobal governance is something that Presidents have dealt with in the \ncontext of the U.N. without ever considering giving up the sovereignty \nof the United States.\n  You can have global governance. Anytime you have a treaty, it is \nglobal governance. When you had the World War II treaty on the \nbattleship Missouri, with Japan, that was governance.\n  When the United States went over and Douglas MacArthur helped to \ncreate a constitution and create a democracy, that was global \ngovernance. It turned out it was a pretty darn good result as we \nrebuilt Europe and a lot of other places.\n  Global governance does not have to be this bugaboo word that is used \nto scare people that somehow we are giving up the sovereignty of the \nUnited States. Every one of these arguments just kind of melts away \nlike the ice itself. I think we ought to have a real debate about what \nis happening.\n  Let's go to the economy. That is the big one that they love to pick \non and say to Americans: Oh, this is going to cost you so much money if \nyou do this, and it is going to wind up being terrible. Well, that is \nnot what the best economists in the world say. That is not what the \nbest business leaders in the world say.\n  In fact, they have concluded if you do not do something, it is going \nto cost a lot of money. You want to pay a lot more money for insurance? \nYou want to pay a lot more money for dams that are bigger, pay a lot \nmore money for hospitalizations, more cancer, for more asthma, for more \nproblems of the particulates in the air? Then you can go ahead and burn \ndirty coal and not be smart about the future.\n  The fact is, Sir Nicholas Stearn, who is one of the leading \neconomists in Britain, former head of the Bank of England and one of \nthe people whom Prime Minister Blair tapped to give them an analysis, \nwrote this in a report last fall:\n\n       The scientific evidence is now overwhelming.\n\n  This an economist.\n\n       Climate change is a serious global threat, and it demands \n     an urgent global response. The review has assessed the wide \n     range of evidence on the impacts of climate change and on the \n     economic costs, and has used a number of different techniques \n     to assess cost and risks. From all of those perspectives, the \n     evidence gathered by the review leads to a simple conclusion. \n     The benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the \n     economic costs of not acting. Climate change will affect the \n     basic elements of life for people around the world, access to \n     water, food production, health, and the environment. Hundreds \n     of millions of people could suffer hunger, water shortages, \n     coastal flooding as the world warms. Using the results from \n     formal economic models, the review estimates that if we don't \n     act, the overall costs and risks of climate change will be \n     equivalent to losing at least 5 percent of global GDP each \n     year now and forever.\n\n  Losing 5 percent of GDP now and forever, that is the economic \nprediction of not acting. And they say if a wider risk of impacts is \ntaken into account, the estimates of damage could rise to 20 percent of \nGDP or more. In contrast, the cost of action, reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions to avoid the worst impacts of climate change can be limited \nto around 1 percent of global GDP each year.\n  That is an economic standard that, in fact, MIT economists have also \nconfirmed, not quite the same figures but very similar. The bottom line \nis there is a consensus that the cost of not acting is far more \nexpensive to the American people than the cost of acting.\n  I go back to the experience we had on the Clean Air Act in 1990. I \ndon't remember Senator Inhofe being part of that discussion. But the \nfact is, in 1990, when we did that act, the same arguments were put \nforward about not proceeding forward, and every one of those arguments \nwas blown away by the reality of what happened as well as by the \njudgments of Republicans and Democrats alike that it was important to \nact.\n  Back then, incidentally, DuPont, which has already been castigated by \nthe Senator as somehow being in this for the money--DuPont was the \nprincipal producer of the chlorofluorocarbons that were part of the \nMontreal Protocol. DuPont was unwilling to move until they knew that \nthe marketplace was going to be the same for everybody, which is what \nhappened when the protocol went into effect. Once they knew what the \nmarketplace was going to do, then they proceeded forward with an \nalternative to the CFCs.\n  So they proved that, No. 1, you can do it, but, No. 2, you have to do \nit where the marketplace is, in fact, working. That is why people \nbelieve--incidentally, this amendment has nothing to do with cap and \ntrade. I happen to support it. We will have that debate down the road. \nBut this amendment has nothing to do with it. This merely suggests if \nwe are going to spend Federal dollars on water projects in America and \nlevees and other kinds of projects, that we ought to know for certain \nevery one of those projects is being judged specifically as to the \nimpact of global climate change.\n  With respect to the cap and trade issue, the fact is, those companies \ndon't want to proceed ahead until they have the same kind of certainty \nthat the marketplace will give them when there is a uniform standard \nthroughout the marketplace. That is far from a bottom-line, profit-\nseeking motive.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, time will be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am sorry I had to leave at a very \ncontentious time. Notes were given to me of what the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts said, that 90 percent of everything that \nInhofe said is wrong. I didn't say anything. I am quoting scientists. I \nam quoting groups that are making analyses, and three of the quotes I \nmade were from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He can say \nwhat I said is wrong, but he is saying that the scientists were wrong, \nand they never asserted that hurricanes have increased. It is a little \nconfusing to me because maybe in the last few days he hasn't asserted \nthat, but look at the movie. It talks about hurricanes. Those \nstatements are made with regularity. In fact, they made the prediction \nthat this past year was going to have more and more severe hurricanes. \nAs it turned out, we had less and less severe hurricanes. I agree the \nmodels aren't perfect.\n  I don't know what he said about the Byrd-Hagel amendment but, again, \nyou can't find any of these studies on any of the plans----\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, I will not. You can't find any of the studies that \nare out there that haven't somehow talked about the fact that it is \ngoing to do economic damage. We know it is. No one can possibly say \nthat there is a way to approach this where it is not\n\n[[Page S6112]]\n\ngoing to cause the economy to be damaged. So that was in the Byrd-Hagel \namendment. The Byrd-Hagel amendment also said we don't want to ratify \nanything. We are not going to ratify anything. Every Senator said: We \nare not going to ratify anything that does not require that the \ndeveloping nations do the same thing that the developed nations do. \nObviously, we have not seen one plan that has come along that addresses \nthe cap and trade and greenhouse gas, anthropogenic gas emissions, that \ndoesn't inflict damage that the developing nations are willing to do.\n  IPCC was not written by politicians. I never said the report was. I \nsaid the summary for policymakers was written by politicians.\n  Sea level rise is not going backward. All I can say is, if you are \ngoing to hang all your hopes on the IPCC, look at the report. This was \nthis year, 2007. I have said this several times. I don't know why I \nhave to keep repeating it. Yes, it has been cut in half, their estimate \nas to how much sea level rise was going to take place. This isn't the \nfirst time that has happened. This happens almost every time they have \nit in one of the reports. So the sea level rise, no sense repeating \nthat.\n  Inhofe shouldn't distort. He is the only one I know of who says \nChirac speaks for America. Chirac speaks for America--ye gods. Since he \naccused me of saying that this is some kind of a global conspiracy, I \nwas quoting the person who said that, who I am sure is a much better \nfriend of the Senator from Massachusetts than he is of mine, and that \nwas Jacques Chirac. Jacques Chirac said:\n\n       Kyoto represents the first component of an authentic global \n     governance.\n\n  That is not me. That is Jack Chirac. It answers the question why are \nthese countries over in Europe so interested that we do something in \nthis country that is going to hurt our economy. The answer came from \nMargot Wallstrom, Minister of the Environment for the European Union. \nShe said:\n\n       Kyoto is about the economy, about leveling the playing \n     field for big business worldwide.\n\n  Yes, there are other countries that would love to have America be \novertaxed and have all these economic problems that we don't have right \nnow. It could inure to their benefit; there is no question about that. \nNo one would deny that.\n  Best economists don't say controlling carbon will be costly. How many \neconomists and how many scientists do I have to quote? I could use the \nrest of my time and not repeat one of the scientists, read another \nwhole list, but I have done it so many times. Here are some I haven't \ntalked about. This is the cost.\n  Going back, if you want to catch 60 at one time, let's take the 60 \nscientists in Canada, the ones I said earlier were the ones who \nrecommended to the Prime Minister, 15 years ago, that they sign onto, \nratify the Kyoto treaty. Now they say:\n\n       If back in the mid-1990s we knew what we know today about \n     climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not exist because we \n     would have to conclude that it was not necessary.\n\n  That is 60 scientists there. You can try to discredit all 60 of them \nat one time and maybe you can do it. I don't know. But there are \nothers. You can't look at these guys with the qualifications they have. \nRead what they have said. The fact that they have reversed their \npositions and say the scientists are not, there is some consensus \nbecause there is no consensus.\n  Senator Kerry quoted the Stern report, which has been discredited by \neven the economists who are climate change believers. I guess he was \nsaying that I said there is a group of industries and we had a hearing \non this. I wish the Senator from Massachusetts had attended the \nhearing. Yes, it is true there are several large corporations in \nAmerica that are now embracing any kind of reduction, cap and trade or \na tax or anything else because it inures to their benefit. I was \nspecific as to how many millions and how many billions of dollars each \none of these corporations would have. How dare me say that.\n\n  Again, if I were on the board of directors of any of these, I would \nsay: Let's do the same thing. The whole idea is to make money. The \nproblem is, it is as if no one is paying for all this fun we are \nhaving. Yes, it would have to be more money. But if we did that, \nsomebody has to pay for it. Again, even the CBO says that all this \nmoney it is going to cost, the tax increase on the American people, \nwhichever of these schemes we decide on, is going to be \ndisproportionately on the poor and those who are on fixed incomes.\n  By the way, one of the statements on here was that no one has said we \nwere going to have a worse hurricane season. I will quote one person I \nthink the junior Senator from Massachusetts would know. It is Teresa \nHeinz-Kerry. Teresa Heinz-Kerry, the chair of the Heinz Foundation, has \nhelped financially bankroll the Environment2004 campaign coalition, \nwhich is placing billboards throughout Florida claiming ``President \nBush's environmental policies could result in stronger and more \nfrequent hurricanes.'' That is a quote.\n  I don't know how much time we have left. We are now repeating each \nother. Nothing new has come out. I will have maybe a short final \nstatement. I am willing to yield back the balance of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent at this point, while we are both resting, \nthat Senator Warner be recognized for up to 4 minutes to make a \nstatement as in morning business and that those 4 minutes be equally \ncharged to both sides.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, I respect the Senator. I \nwould like to give him the time to speak but outside of my time. I \nwould be happy to yield at this point in the day if he wants to speak \nas in morning business but not to be charged against our time. If he \nwants to take it off the Senator's time, he can.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All right. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nVirginia be recognized for up to 4 minutes to speak as in morning \nbusiness and his 4 minutes not be charged against either Senator Kerry \nor myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The senior Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/15/senate-section/article/S6112-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6112-S6115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REVEREND JERRY FALWELL\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to say a few brief words about the \nReverend Jerry Falwell, who passed away earlier today at the age of 73.\n  I have personally known Reverend Falwell since I first ran for \nelection to the U.S. Senate in 1978. And, since that time, I have come \nto befriend a man who in many ways became a pillar of strength and \ninspiration not only to his community of Lynchburg, VA, where he was \nborn but indeed to people around the world.\n  Throughout the 28-plus years that I have had the good fortune of \nrepresenting the citizens of the Commonwealth of Virginia in the U.S. \nSenate, Reverend Falwell was always a constituent of mine, and he would \noften offer his counsel to me about pressing matters of the day. He \nwould always do so in a polite, yet firm manner.\n  While I might not have always agreed with him, I have always admired \nReverend Falwell, particularly for his unwavering commitment to what he \nthought was right. Jerry Falwell never ran from controversy, and he \nalways stuck to his beliefs.\n  Indeed, I believe it was the firmness of his convictions that, in \npart, allowed Jerry Falwell to achieve so much success in whatever he \nundertook in life. He was an intensely driven man.\n  At the age of 22 he started a Baptist church in Lynchburg, VA, with \n35 members. Reportedly, on the first Sunday his congregation met in \n1956, the first offering totaled $135. Today, that same church has \nupwards of 24,000 members and annual revenues of all of his ministries \ntotal over $200 million.\n  In 1971, Jerry Falwell founded Liberty University--a liberal arts, \nChristian institution of higher education. Today, Liberty University \nemploys more than 1,000 Virginians and educates more than 20,000 \nstudents a year either on its campus or through distance learning \nprograms.\n  In my view, the thousands and thousands of students who Liberty has \neducated these many years will undoubtedly be one part of Reverend \nFalwell's strong legacy that will last for generations.\n  My thoughts and prayers today go out to the Falwell family, including \nhis beloved wife of nearly 50 years, and his three children.\n  While I am up, I wonder if I could indicate to the managers that I \nintend to\n\n[[Page S6113]]\n\nfile an amendment tonight along the lines established by the \ndistinguished majority leader regarding amendments to be considered on \nthis bill which relate to the appropriations bill now being formulated \nto provide for the funds for the troops. I think it is the wisdom of \nthe two leaders jointly that on this bill those Senators who wish to \nhave language attached to any appropriations bill would make known \ntheir desires through adding an amendment on this bill. Cloture will be \nfiled on such amendments for tomorrow. If my amendment is selected by \nthe Republican leader, then I understand it would be subject to a \ncloture vote tomorrow. But it would at least give me and my principal \ncosponsor, Senator Collins, the opportunity to express our two views \nand others who have been associated with us to likewise join in \nexpressing their views. I will do that following the vote tonight.\n  I yield the floor and thank the managers.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues \nto support Senator Kerry's amendment to the Water Resources Development \nAct. This amendment is quite simple, and if enacted, would contribute \nto the modernization of the Army Corps of Engineers, something I have \nbeen fighting for for many years.\n  The Kerry-Feingold amendment would require the Corps to account for \nthe potential long and short term effects of global climate change when \nplanning projects. This commonsense amendment is vital for safeguarding \ncommunities and the environment since virtually every water resource \nproject designed and built by the Corps sits on the front lines of \nglobal warming.\n  All Corps projects are going to feel the strain, the impact, and the \nconsequences of global warming. This is true whether we are talking \nabout ensuring that flood damage reduction projects will in fact \nprovide communities with the promised levels of protection; ensuring \nthat port projects take climate change into account for emergency \npreparedness purposes; or ensuring that ecosystem restoration projects \nare properly designed.\n  Along with many of my colleagues, I believe it is essential to take \nbold steps to address global climate change. Senators Sanders and Boxer \nare leading the most comprehensive, scientifically based global warming \npollutant bill to address the emission of carbon dioxide. I am proud to \ncosponsor that bill.\n  The Kerry-Feingold amendment does not address the emissions of global \nwarming, but rather simply makes sure that future water resources \nprojects take into account the effects of global warming. There are a \nlot of necessary policy changes needed to respond to global warming and \nwe need to move forward on all fronts. This proposed amendment should \ngain broad bipartisan support, even from those who remain unsure of the \nbest approach for curbing greenhouse gas emissions and even from those \nwho remain skeptical about the causes of global climate change.\n  Our amendment ensures that Corps of Engineers projects will take into \naccount the impacts of climate change, regardless of its cause. It also \nensures that the Corps will take more aggressive steps to protect \nnatural systems that can help buffer the impacts of climate change and \nthat provide a host of other vital benefits.\n  Scientists clearly agree that the climate is changing. They also \nagree that, as a result of that change, we can expect an increase in \nextreme weather events. A recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change expresses this consensus. Climate scientists agree \nthat global warming will cause stronger storms, more frequent floods, \nincreased sea level, and extended droughts. This report concludes, \namong other things, that: Climate change will lead to more intense \nstorms and increasing sea levels, particularly along the gulf and \nAtlantic coasts, which will pose significant risks to coastal \ncommunities from storm surges and flooding; climate change will lead to \nmore flooding in the winter and early spring due to earlier snowmelt \nand increased rainfall, followed by more water shortages during the \nsummer, particularly in the Western States; and climate change will \nlead to lower water levels in major river systems and the Great Lakes \nthat will exacerbate existing water resources challenges.\n  The Scientific Expert Group on Climate Change to the United Nations \nalso recently concluded that human health ``will be threatened'' by the \nglobal climate change-induced increases in the intensity and frequency \nof storms, floods, droughts, and heat-related mortality. These changes \nwill clearly complicate water resource planning for the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  But we also know that there are ways to buffer the effects of these \nchanges. Healthy rivers, streams, floodplains, and wetlands reduce the \nimpacts of flooding by acting as natural sponges and basins, absorbing \nflood waters, and releasing them slowly over time. Coastal wetlands \nprovide vital barriers between storm surges and communities. When these \nwetlands are lost, coastal communities are far more vulnerable to \ndisaster, as we saw so tragically during Hurricane Katrina. Healthy \nstreams and wetlands also help minimize the impacts of drought by \nrecharging groundwater supplies and filtering pollutants from drinking \nwater. And all of these resources provide critical habitat for fish and \nwildlife, and important recreational opportunities.\n  Even without global climate change, it is imperative that we take a \nmore aggressive approach to accounting for and protecting these \nresources that are so essential for the Nation's health, safety, \neconomic prosperity, and well-being.\n  We do not have to peer into a crystal ball to see the dangers of \nallowing the Corps to continue to plan projects without accounting for \nthe changes that will be wrought by climate change. The Nation bore \nwitness to those dangers when Hurricane Katrina slammed into the gulf \ncoast. The devastation of New Orleans is a horrific example of the \ntragic consequences of an intense storm hitting a region where Corps \nprojects have destroyed vital natural wetland buffers and have not \nproperly accounted for the risk of severe storms.\n  Our amendment requires the Corps to immediately begin to address \nthese types of issues.\n  Our amendment would require the Corps to utilize the best available \nclimate science in assessing flood and storm risks. This seems like \nplain common sense to me, but as we have sadly witnessed again and \nagain, common sense does not always guide the Corps and its \ndecisionmaking processes.\n  Our amendment would require the Corps to more fully account for the \nvalue of the services provided by healthy rivers, streams, wetlands, \nand floodplains.\n  Of special importance to me, our amendment also builds on existing \nlaw and policy to require the Corps to use nonstructural approaches, \nwhere appropriate, in project planning. This is critical for ensuring \nthe best possible protection for those natural systems that are so \nimportant for our current and future health, safety, and welfare. While \nthe Corps is currently required to consider nonstructural approaches, \nit rarely recommends them. This is true even when nonstructural \napproaches would provide the same or better project benefits while \navoiding damages to these vital resources.\n  This provision would not--let me say this again, it would not--\nprevent the Corps from using structural approaches like levees and \nfloodwalls where they are needed. But it would require the Corps to be \nmore aggressive in its efforts to utilize natural systems that on their \nown provide vital flood protection and water quality benefits. And it \nwould also help the Corps overcome what the Department of the Army \ninspector general concluded was an ``institutional bias'' for \nconstructing costly, large scale structural projects.\n  We can no longer rely on the status quo to protect our future. We can \nno longer rely solely on the Corps' traditional approaches to water \nprojects. These approaches have too often severed critical connections \nbetween rivers and their wetlands and floodplains, and produced \nunanticipated wetland and floodplain losses. These approaches have left \ncoastal communities, like New Orleans, far more vulnerable. These \napproaches have exacerbated flood damages by inducing development in \nhigh risk, flood prone areas and by increasing downstream flooding.\n  This amendment will change the status quo by removing blinders that \nhave\n\n[[Page S6114]]\n\nplagued water resources planning for too long. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport our amendment and the commonsense changes it would bring about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, what is the time allocation at this point? \nHow much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls 9 \nminutes 9 seconds. The Senator from Oklahoma controls 5 minutes 58 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. Well, Mr. President, I will try to speed up and use such \ntime as I may use quickly.\n  Again, let me respond very quickly to some of the assertions that \nhave been made. I want to try to get back to the bigger picture, but I \nwill be very specific about a couple things.\n  First of all, I never have suggested, nor have I heard anybody who \nhas argued in favor of actions suggesting, there would be no cost, \nwhich is the term the Senator from Oklahoma used. We are not talking \nabout no cost. We are talking about relative costs. It is clear from \nall the best analyses of every economic model that the costs of not \nacting are much greater than the costs of acting.\n  That has become true, we have seen, in what has happened with respect \nto damages, migrations of species, other things that are already \noccurring and being observed as a result of the warming that is taking \nplace.\n  In addition to that, I still say to my colleague from Oklahoma, \ndespite the scientists he quotes, he still cannot produce one peer-\nreviewed study that says global climate change is not happening as a \nconsequence of human activity. He cannot produce one peer-reviewed \nreport that does not say it is happening, period--not one.\n  So he can come in with a report that says some little thing here, \nsome little thing there, but that does not go to the fundamental \nquestion of who is causing what.\n  As I said earlier in this debate, they have a fundamental \nresponsibility, if they are going to stand up and say to Americans we \ndo not need to do anything; and that responsibility is to answer what \nis causing the warming if it is not the human-induced activity; and, \nsecondly, how can the human activity that is being created not be doing \nwhat the scientists allege it is doing. On both counts, they have \nnever, ever had a sufficient scientific explanation.\n  Moreover, again, I would point out--I did earlier; the Senator was \nnot here--as to the so-called SPM, as it is called, the policymaker's \nsummary, there is a list on the first page of that summary, and all the \npeople who wrote it are scientists. They are the ones who put that \nreport together.\n  So there is a point where you can sort of be debating all the red \nherrings here, which is not what is important. What is important in the \nend is that the consensus, globally, of leaders, of scientists, is \nclear about what is happening and why it is happening, No. 1. No. 2, \nwhat we are trying to do is not even respond to that, even though I \nbelieve we ought to be; we are simply trying to guarantee there is an \nadequate level of congressionally mandated--not voluntary but \ncongressionally mandated--review with respect to this in the activities \nof the Corps of Engineers.\n  The fact is that climate change, obviously, relates to risk-based \nanalysis. There are many climate change events that are taking place, \nall of which could affect the reliability of Corps projects. In this \nbill there is a program for ecosystem restoration in the Louisiana \ncoastal area. Key is going to be ultimately developing a strategy for \nrestoration that understands what happens with respect to coastal \nerosion and sea level rise. The Mississippi River Gulf Outlet in \nLouisiana, right along the coast, is dependent on storm surge \ninformation, hurricane prediction, sea level rise. Virtually every \nsingle beach replenishment project--what good is it going to do to \nreplenish beaches in certain ways if the sea level is going to be \nrising and the intensity of those storms may increase?\n  With respect to that, I would say to my friend from Oklahoma, the \nprediction was there would be more named storms, more hurricanes, and \nindeed there were more named storms. The level of predictions of storms \nwas met, they just did not hit the United States. We lucked out. But \nthe total numbers, in fact, were high.\n  So you can play with these possibilities. You can ignore science, if \nyou choose to. But I think responsible legislation at this point, given \nthe scientists and the level of information we have, requires us to \nact, and this is one very small way to act responsibly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Well, here we go again. This is exactly the same thing. \nIf I responded to everything he said then, I have already done it \nbefore. I have read and I have talked about this. I have more \nscientists, if anyone wants to hear from more scientists. Also, as far \nas peer-reviewed studies, I have documented it, I have said where they \nare. So I can just say that so many times.\n  But here is what I would suggest: What we are talking about is an \namendment to this bill, an amendment to the bill which addresses the \nCorps of Engineers and asks them to report to us on every project, from \nthis point forward, certain types of things, and it describes what they \nare.\n  We had a hearing the other day, I say to my good friend from \nMassachusetts. It was May 11, 2007. That was, what, last week. We have \nhad John Paul Woodley, who is the Assistant Secretary of the Army for \nCivil Works.\n  This is a quote from his testimony. He said:\n\n       The United States Army Corps of Engineers has the capacity \n     and necessary authorities to comprehensively examine the \n     uncertainties, threats and vulnerabilities on water \n     infrastructure and to implement the necessary adjustments as \n     part of a proactive adaptive management program.\n\n  They can do it now. They can do it. This is the head of the Corps of \nEngineers. So they do not need this amendment.\n  Now, I wish to say this. We were supposed to have this vote at 5:30. \nIt is now 10 after 6. I am prepared not to say anything else and to \nyield back the remainder of my time, if the Senator from Massachusetts \nwill do the same thing.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator a question, \nif I may.\n  Mr. INHOFE. On your time, go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. On my time.\n  The Senator said he had a whole lot of peer-reviewed studies. I would \nask the Senator a simple question: Does he have one peer-reviewed study \nthat says conclusively global climate change is not happening as a \nconsequence of human activity, and, No. 2, that it is not happening. \nDoes he have a peer-reviewed study that says that?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me respond to that question. Of course I do not have \nthat.\n  Mr. KERRY. That is what I said.\n  Mr. INHOFE. But I do have peer-reviewed studies that say specifically \nthe amount of change that is attributable to human activity is so small \nit is not measurable, like .07 of 1 degree in 50 years. Now, that is \nsignificant. I have several peer-reviewed studies. I would be glad to \nrespond to your question by reading those.\n  I have a peer-reviewed study published in the April 18, 2007, issue \nof the science journal Geophysical Research Letters, which found that \nif the world continues to warm, vertical wind shear--which literally \ntears apart storms--will also rise. These winds will decrease the \nnumber and severity of storms we would otherwise have.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, may I interrupt my friend from Oklahoma and \nreclaim my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We have approximately 20 peer-reviewed studies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls the \ntime at this point.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, again, the Senator is making my point. I \nconceded there are studies that will assert there is some change of a \nvariation of what may or may not be happening but none that suggests it \nis not happening as a result of our activity or that it is not \nhappening.\n  The Senator talks about this .07-of-a-degree change. What he says is \na reduction. But what we are looking at is an automatic increase in \nrate of increase that is going to occur no matter what. So somebody can \ndoubt whether you are going to have a reduction. That is not the point. \nThe point is, there is\n\n[[Page S6115]]\n\ngoing to be a level of increase that goes up to a percentage which \nvaries from about 2 degrees centigrade to 3 degrees centigrade, up to \n7.7 degrees Fahrenheit. And .07 of a degree from that is not going to \nmake a difference with respect to the fundamental issue of the Earth \nwarming.\n  So again, let's debate apples and apples, not something else. I think \nthat is important in this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, at this time, if the Senator wants, we can \nyield back our time.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield my time, except for 1 minute for \nthe chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to talk about something else for a \nmoment to let Senators know where we are. We have been working staff to \nstaff. We are so close to completing this WRDA bill. Once we vote on \nthis 60-vote issue, we are down to a few amendments. There is a \nmanagers' package that has been signed off on by the leaders of the \ncommittee. We would like to get that done.\n  What we want to say to colleagues on both sides is, if you want to \nparticipate in this bill, tonight would be the night to do it because \nwe are wrapping this thing up tomorrow. Our hope is we can complete it. \nWe have this managers' package. If you have something you need to say \nabout this bill, if you have a last-minute amendment you want to show \nus, this would be the time, this would be the moment.\n  I would be happy to yield some time to my colleague if he wishes to \nmake some comments.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee \nand the manager of this bill. Let me say I agree with everything the \nSenator said. I thought we were going to finish it tonight, but if it \nis tomorrow, it is tomorrow. It is too significant not to finish it.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Massachusetts joining me in yielding \nback the remainder of our time. We are going to be ready to take a vote \nhere shortly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1094.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Brown), the \nSenator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me for my side of the aisle \ndescribe what we have just done. Senator Reid and I have entered into \nan agreement, which I previously described to my conference, under \nwhich we will be able to smooth the passage of the supplemental \nappropriations bill into conference. The majority leader, with my \nconcurrence, has filled up the tree and filed cloture. This should give \nus an opportunity Thursday afternoon on a broad bipartisan basis to \nmove this troop funding bill into conference where we will continue our \ndiscussions.\n  The majority leader and I have had several meetings with the \nPresident's designee, Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and we will have \nadditional meetings--as well as with House Democrats and Republicans--\nand hopefully achieve what I think we all want to achieve at this \npoint, which is a signed troop funding bill before Memorial Day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Republican leader and I have worked very \nclosely in the past week or two on the process we are following this \nevening. We both agree it is imperative that we get to conference with \nthe House as quickly as possible, and adoption of the Murray amendment, \nwhich is the amendment which was offered here, will allow us to do just \nthat. This is a procedural step.\n  We are anxious to get to conference to work with the President's \nChief of Staff Josh Bolten. He has been available any time we have \nasked for his presence. He realizes there is going to have to be some \nserious negotiations. We also understand that it is not just the \nSenate. The House has to be involved in these negotiations, and we\n\n[[Page S6118]]\n\ncertainly understand that and Mr. Bolton understands that.\n  We have a long way to go, but this was a tremendous step forward. We \nmay disagree on a lot of issues dealing with the policy in Iraq, but \nthe one point on which we agree--both Democrats and Republicans--is \nthat the troops must have everything they need and more, and we are \ngoing to make sure that is the case.\n  The Republican leader and I agree, and I have spoken with the Speaker \nof the House at 5 o'clock today, and she agrees with me, that we are \ngoing to finish this bill and this conference report prior to our \nleaving for the Memorial Day recess. Everyone should rest assured we \nare going to do that. I hope we can do that without causing a lot of \ndiscomfort to Senators and Members of the House if we finish this bill \nat a reasonable time a week from Thursday or Friday, but if we can't, \nwe are going no place until we finish this legislation and it gets to \nthe President's desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take less than a minute to tell \ncolleagues where we are. I thank the majority leader for his assistance \non the WRDA bill. Our understanding is that we have a managers' package \nwith several amendments. There may be only one or two that are \ncontentious. Our goal for tomorrow, once we complete the Iraq votes, is \nto go to the managers' package without the contentious one or two \namendments in it. By the way, I don't think any of them are \ncontentious, but one Senator is saying they are.\n  We will adopt that managers' package hopefully by a voice vote, and \nthen if it is necessary to have a recorded vote on these one or two \nadditional amendments, we will do that and then move to final passage \nof WRDA, something we can be very proud of after 7 long years of not \nhaving a bill.\n  I thank my colleagues in advance for their cooperation.\n  To the Senator who may have a problem with one or two of these \namendments, please take another hard look because they are \nnoncontroversial, and I hope that Senator can join with us. We can \nfinish this bill tomorrow in the very early afternoon or the late \nmorning, and both sides can be very proud.\n  Again, this is a bill that is endorsed by just about everyone in the \ncountry.\n  I say to my colleagues, our intention is to conclude this bill \ntomorrow. Senator Inhofe and I are very strongly interested in \nconcluding it tomorrow. The bipartisan members of the committee are \nvery strongly interested.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think we have just seen an extraordinary \nchapter of how two leaders can come together and structure a procedure \nby which this Senate can go forward and achieve its objectives. I am \ntotally supportive of the procedure enunciated by our two distinguished \nleaders because I strongly support the need for getting this \nappropriations legislation through and on to the President's desk so \nthat we can fund adequately our Armed Forces, particularly those \nengaged in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The leadership further decided that those Senators who wish to \naddress the conferees could do so by adding amendments to this bill. My \nunderstanding is that there are two amendments that have been filed on \nthe other side of the aisle: one by Mr. Feingold and another by Mr. \nLevin. And in consultation with the distinguished Republican leader, I \nnow file an amendment on this side of the aisle, although I am hopeful \nmy amendment would not be viewed purely as a Republican amendment but \nthat it could be a vehicle by which we can reach some level, hopefully \na significant level, of bipartisan consensus on the several principles \nI have enunciated in this amendment.\n  Throughout the course of this debate on Iraq, since the President's \nannouncement of a new strategy on January 10 of this year, there have \nbeen groups of Republicans and Democrats that have voiced our concerns \nabout the strategies being employed in Iraq, and we continue to do so \nby virtue of this process now decided upon by the leadership whereby \namendments to this bill can be brought up, which amendments reflect the \nsentiments of those who are sponsoring them.\n  At the present time, my amendment is sponsored by my principal \ncosponsor, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, although I have been in \nconsultation with a number of other Senators on this side of the aisle, \nas well as Senators on the other side of the aisle.\n  Given the brevity of the time today, since Senators have returned \nfrom their constituencies largely this morning, and the fact that we \nhave been trying to work out the procedure just adopted by the Senate \nby the two leaders, it has not been possible for me to isolate a fixed \nset of cosponsors. Nevertheless, I do know of a number, certainly on \nthis side, and I am hopeful on the other side, and now that this \namendment is filed tonight, it is my expectation and hope that Senators \nwill be adding their names as cosponsors. I urge that be done at the \nearliest opportunity because, as I understand it, and the leadership \nwill subsequently address, I think, the Senate tonight respecting the \nlegislative program tomorrow as to when my amendment, with such \ncosponsors that are able to add their names, and the two amendments \npending from the other side--and I believe a fourth that is to be \nbrought up by our distinguished Republican leader sometime this \nevening--will be debated, voted upon, and subject to a cloture motion.\n  Let me now turn to addressing the specifics of this amendment at this \ntime. This amendment, in its preamble, has the following: We entitle it \nthe ``President's Strategy In Iraq.'' Section 1. Findings regarding \nprogress in Iraq, the establishment of benchmarks to measure that \nprogress, and reports to the Congress.\n  The recitation in the first section of this amendment is a series of \nstatements factually describing the situation as we, the sponsors of \nthis amendment, feel have taken place, largely since January 10 of this \nyear. Foremost among those obligations is, of course, our recognition \nof the enormity of the sacrifice of the men and women of the Armed \nForces and their families and others who have taken an active role in \ncarrying out our strategies in Iraq, not just since January 10 of this \nyear but prior thereto, in the regrettably long period of time that \nthis conflict in Iraq has persisted.\n  Following those statements, we then go to section 2, which is \nentitled, ``Conditioning of Future United States Strategy in Iraq on \nthe Iraqi Government's Record of Performance on its Benchmarks.''\n\n       In General. The United States strategy in Iraq, hereafter, \n     shall be conditioned on the Iraqi government meeting \n     benchmarks as told to Members of Congress by the President, \n     the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reflected in the \n     Iraqi Government's commitments to the United States, and to \n     the international community, including . . .\n\n  For example, benchmarks--and I shall read but several. First and \nforemost:\n\n       Forming a Constitutional Review Committee and then \n     completing the Constitutional review;\n       Enacting and implementing legislation on de-baathification;\n       Enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the \n     equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the \n     people of Iraq without regard to the sect or ethnicity of \n     recipients, and enacting and implementing legislation to \n     ensure that the energy resources of\n\n[[Page S6119]]\n\n     Iraq benefit Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other \n     Iraqi citizens in an equitable manner.\n       Enacting and implementing legislation on procedures to form \n     semi-autonomous regions;\n       Enacting and implementing legislation establishing an \n     Independent High Electoral Commission; provincial elections \n     law; provincial council authorities; and a date for \n     provincial elections.\n\n  I shall not read further from this document. It will be a matter of \nrecord. But these benchmarks were ones put forth by the Iraqi \nGovernment, in large measure. What we are doing now is requiring the \nfollowing:\n\n       The President shall submit reports to the Congress on how \n     the sovereign government of Iraq is, or is not, achieving \n     progress towards accomplishing the aforementioned benchmarks, \n     and shall advise the Congress on how that assessment \n     requires, or does not require, changes to the strategy \n     announced on January 10, 2007.\n       Reports Required.\n       (1) The President shall submit an initial report, in \n     classified and unclassified format, to the Congress, not \n     later than July 15, 2007, assessing the status of each of the \n     specific benchmarks established above, and declaring, in his \n     judgment, whether satisfactory progress towards meeting these \n     benchmarks is, or is not, being achieved.\n       (2) The President, having consulted with the Secretary of \n     State, the Secretary of Defense, the Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces-Iraq, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, \n     and the Commander of U.S. Central Command, will prepare the \n     report and submit the report to Congress.\n       (3) If the President's assessment of any of the specific \n     benchmarks established above is unsatisfactory, the President \n     shall include in that report a description of such revisions \n     to the political, economic, regional, and military components \n     of the strategy, as announced by the President on January 10, \n     2007. In addition, the President shall include in the report, \n     the advisability of implementing such aspects of the \n     bipartisan Iraq Study Group, as he deems appropriate.\n\n  And, as is well documented in the Senate, and well-respected, if I \nmay say, by the Senate--the work of the Iraq Study Group.\n\n       (4) The President shall submit a second report to the \n     Congress, not later than September 15, 2007, following the \n     same procedures and criteria outlined above.\n       (5) The reporting requirement detailed in section 1227 of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 \n     is hereby waived from the date of the enactment of this Act \n     through the period ending September 15, 2007.\n\n  That is put in there for the reason that we believe these reports by \nthe President will supplant whatever reports had been required by that \nact. The force and effect of the requirement for those reports will \npick up and continue after September of this year.\n\n       (c) Testimony before Congress.\n       (1) Prior to the submission of the President's second \n     report on September 15, 2007, and at a time to be agreed upon \n     by the leadership of the Congress and the Administration, the \n     United States Ambassador to Iraq and the Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces Iraq--\n\n  That is General Petraeus--\n\n     will be made available to testify in open and closed sessions \n     before the relevant committees of the Congress.\n\n  I will now refer to the section titled ``Limitations on Availability \nof Funds'' in this appropriations bill.\n\n       Limitation. No funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available for the ``Economic Support Fund'' and available for \n     Iraq may be obligated or expended unless and until the \n     President of the United States certifies in the report \n     outlined in subsection (2)(b)(1) above and makes a further \n     certification in the report outlined in subsection (2)(b)(4) \n     above that Iraq is making progress in each of the benchmarks \n     set forth in section 2 above.\n\n  To give the President a certain amount of flexibility--and this is \nthe provision I am particularly indebted to our distinguished \ncolleague, Ms. Collins of Maine, who has worked with me on it, as well \nas Senator Coleman and others who have been working with me--we provide \nthe following:\n\n       The President may waive the requirements of this section if \n     he submits to Congress a written certification setting forth \n     the detailed justification for the waiver, which shall \n     include a detailed report describing the actions being taken \n     by the United States to bring the Iraqi government into \n     compliance with the benchmarks set forth in section 2 above. \n     The certification shall be submitted in unclassified form, \n     but may include a classified annex.\n\n  We proceed to a section entitled ``Redeployment of U.S. Forces from \nIraq.'' There has been considerable publicity attached to certain \nactions having been taken by the Council of Representatives in Iraq--\nthat is their basic name for their parliament--and to clarify that we \nhave put in the following requirement:\n\n       The President of the United States, in respecting the \n     sovereign rights of the nation of Iraq, shall direct the \n     orderly redeployment of elements of U.S. forces from Iraq, if \n     the components of the Iraqi government, acting in strict \n     accordance with their respective powers given by the Iraqi \n     Constitution, reach a consensus as recited in a resolution, \n     directing a redeployment of U.S. forces.\n\n  Now, proceeding to another section, ``Independent Assessments.''\n\n       Assessment by the Comptroller General.\n       Not later than September 1, 2007, the Comptroller general \n     of the United States shall submit to Congress an independent \n     report setting forth--\n       (A) the status of the achievement of the benchmarks \n     specified in section 2 above; and\n       (B) the Comptroller General's assessment whether or not \n     each such benchmark has [or has not] been met.\n       (b) Assessment of the capabilities of Iraq Security forces.\n\n  This is a section which I worked on, now, for over 2 months, laying a \nfoundation, with consultations with the White House senior staff, the \nSecretary of Defense, and indeed a private organization here, a well-\nrespected organization, independent of any affiliation with the \nGovernment, to participate in performing this report, as well as a very \nsenior and highly respected retired military officer who, hopefully, \nwill be designated to head up this report.\n  I believed it was imperative that the Congress needed to have an \nindependent report, and by ``independent,'' I mean a report performed \nby a private sector entity with the advice and participation of at \nleast one senior retired military officer, and maybe others, so that we \ncan have a report to put side by side with the periodic evaluations of \nthe Department of Defense as to the military--professional ability, \ncapability, training, and equipment of the Iraqi security forces. That \nis essential. So that is the essence of this provision which I now \nread.\n\n       (1) In General.--There is hereby authorized to be \n     appropriated for the Department of Defense, $750,000, that \n     the Department, in turn, will commission an independent \n     private sector entity which operates as a 501(c)(3) with \n     recognized credentials and expertise in militarily affairs, \n     to prepare an independent report assessing the following:\n       (A) The readiness of the Iraqi security forces--ISF \n     [referred to] to assume responsibility for maintaining the \n     territorial integrity of Iraq, denying international \n     terrorists a safe haven, and bringing greater security to \n     Iraq's 18 provinces in the next 12-18 months, and bringing an \n     end to sectarian violence to achieve national reconciliation.\n       (B) The training, equipping, command, control and \n     intelligence capabilities and logistics capacity of the ISF \n     [Iraqi Security Forces].\n       (C) The likelihood that given the ISF's record of \n     preparedness to date, following years of training and \n     equipping by U.S. forces, the continued supports of U.S. \n     troops will contribute to the readiness of the ISF to fulfill \n     the missions outlined in subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the enactment of \n     this Act, the designated private sector entity shall provide \n     an unclassified report, with a classified annex, containing \n     its findings, to the House and Senate Committees on Armed \n     Services, Appropriations, Foreign Relations/International \n     Relations, and Intelligence.\n\n  Having worked on this report some 2 months now, I submitted it to \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives. I am pleased to say that \nthose colleagues saw fit to include that basic language on reporting \nand establishing this independent entity and individuals to study the \nIraqi security forces. This provision which I have just read was \ncontained in the House appropriations bill. It is my hope and \nexpectation that it will be included by this Senate, the appropriators, \nin their bill such that it will emerge as part of the final conference \nreport of the House and the Senate.\n  I once again thank many individuals who have worked with me and their \nrespective staffs, who worked beginning last week on the final draft. \nThey worked over the weekend, worked on Monday, worked today to create \nthis document. I am hopeful a good number of our colleagues will see \nfit to cosponsor this document, which document and amendment will be \ndiscussed tomorrow in such brief period as outlined by the leadership. \nThey will define it tonight, and then it will be voted upon.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself and Ms. \n     Collins, proposes an\n\n[[Page S6120]]\n\n     amendment No. 1134 to the language proposed to be stricken by \n     amendment No. 1065.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: Relating to the President's strategy in Iraq)\n\n                  TITLE--PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY IN IRAQ\n\n     SEC. 1. FINDINGS REGARDING PROGRESS IN IRAQ, THE \n                   ESTABLISHMENT OF BENCHMARKS TO MEASURE THAT \n                   PROGRESS, AND REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 145,000 American military personnel are currently \n     serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since March 2003, \n     with the bravery and professionalism consistent with the \n     finest traditions of the United States armed forces, and are \n     deserving of the strong support of all Americans;\n       (2) Many American service personnel have lost their lives, \n     and many more have been wounded in Iraq; the American people \n     will always honor their sacrifice and honor their families;\n       (3) The United States Army and Marine Corps, including \n     their Reserve components and National Guard organizations, \n     together with components of the other branches of the \n     military, are performing their missions while under enormous \n     strain from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. These deployments, and those that will follow, \n     will have a lasting impact on future recruiting, retention, \n     and readiness of our Nation's all volunteer force;\n       (4) Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating problem of \n     sectarian and intrasectarian violence based upon political \n     distrust and cultural differences among factions of the Sunni \n     and Shia populations;\n       (5) Iraqis must reach political and economic settlements in \n     order to achieve reconciliation, for there is no military \n     solution. The failure of the Iraqis to reach such settlements \n     to support a truly unified government greatly contributes to \n     the increasing violence in Iraq;\n       (6) The responsibility for Iraq's internal security and \n     halting sectarian violence rests with the sovereign \n     Government of Iraq;\n       (7) In December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group \n     issued a valuable report, suggesting a comprehensive strategy \n     that includes new and enhanced diplomatic and political \n     efforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary \n     mission of U.S. forces in Iraq, that will enable the United \n     States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq \n     responsibly;\n       (8) The President said on January 10, 2007, that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists;\n       (9) It is essential that the sovereign Government of Iraq \n     set out measurable and achievable benchmarks and President \n     Bush said, on January 10, 2007, that ``America will change \n     our approach to help the Iraqi government as it works to meet \n     these benchmarks'';\n       (10) As reported by Secretary of State Rice, Iraq's Policy \n     Committee on National Security agreed upon a set of \n     political, security, and economic benchmarks and an \n     associated timeline in September 2006 that were (a) \n     reaffirmed by Iraq's Presidency Council on October 6, 2006; \n     (b) referenced by the Iraq Study Group; and (c) posted on the \n     President of Iraq's Web site;\n       (11) On April 21, 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \n     stated that ``our [American] commitment to Iraq is long-term, \n     but it is not a commitment to have our young men and women \n     patrolling Iraq's streets open-endedly'' and that ``progress \n     in reconciliation will be an important element of our \n     evaluation'';\n       (12) The President's January 10, 2007 address had three \n     components: political, military, and economic. Given that \n     significant time has passed since his statement, and \n     recognizing the overall situation is ever changing, Congress \n     must have timely reports to evaluate and execute its \n     Constitutional oversight responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONDITIONING OF FUTURE UNITED STATES STRATEGY IN IRAQ \n                   ON THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT'S RECORD OF PERFORMANCE \n                   ON ITS BENCHMARKS.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) The United States strategy in Iraq, \n     hereafter, shall be conditioned on the Iraqi government \n     meeting benchmarks, as told to members of Congress by the \n     President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, \n     and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reflected \n     in the Iraqi Government's commitments to the United States, \n     and to the international community, including:\n       (A) Forming a Constitutional Review Committee and then \n     completing the Constitutional review;\n       (B) Enacting and implementing legislation on de-\n     Baathification;\n       (C) Enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the \n     equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the people \n     of Iraq without regard to the sect or ethnicity of \n     recipients, and enacting and implementing legislation to \n     ensure that the energy resources of Iraq benefit Sunni Arabs, \n     Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in an equitable \n     manner;\n       (D) Enacting and implementing legislation on procedures to \n     form semi-autonomous regions;\n       (E) Enacting and implementing legislation establishing an \n     Independent High Electoral Commission; provincial elections \n     law; provincial council authorities; and a date for \n     provincial elections;\n       (F) Enacting and implementing legislation addressing \n     amnesty;\n       (G) Enacting and implementing legislation establishing a \n     strong militia disarmament program to ensure that such \n     security forces are accountable only to the central \n     government and loyal to the Constitution of Iraq;\n       (H) Establishing supporting political, media, economic, and \n     services committees in support of the Baghdad Security Plan;\n       (I) Providing three trained and ready Iraqi brigades to \n     support Baghdad operations;\n       (J) Providing Iraqi commanders with all authorities to \n     execute this plan and to make tactical and operational \n     decisions, in consultation with U.S commanders, without \n     political intervention, to include the authority to pursue \n     all extremists, including Sunni insurgents and Shiite \n     militias;\n       (K) Ensuring that the Iraqi Security Forces are providing \n     even handed enforcement of the law;\n       (L) Ensuring that, according to President Bush, Prime \n     Minister Maliki said ``the Baghdad security plan will not \n     provide a safe haven for any outlaws, regardless of [their] \n     sectarian or political affiliation'';\n       (M) Reducing the level of sectarian violence in Iraq and \n     eliminating militia control of local security;\n       (N) Establishing all of the planned joint security stations \n     in neighborhoods across Baghdad;\n       (O) Increasing the number of Iraqi security forces units \n     capable of operating independently;\n       (P) Ensuring that the rights of minority political parties \n     in the Iraqi legislature are protected;\n       (Q) Allocating and spending $10 billion in Iraqi revenues \n     for reconstruction projects, including delivery of essential \n     services, on an equitable basis; and\n       (R) Ensuring that Iraq's political authorities are not \n     undermining or making false accusations against members of \n     the ISF.\n       (2) The President shall submit reports to Congress on how \n     the sovereign Government of Iraq is, or is not, achieving \n     progress towards accomplishing the aforementioned benchmarks, \n     and shall advise the Congress on how that assessment \n     requires, or does not require, changes to the strategy \n     announced on January 10, 2007.\n       (b) Reports Required.--\n       (1) The President shall submit an initial report, in \n     classified and unclassified format, to the Congress, not \n     later than July 15, 2007, assessing the status of each of the \n     specific benchmarks established above, and declaring, in his \n     judgment, whether satisfactory progress toward meeting these \n     benchmarks is, or is not, being achieved.\n       (2) The President, having consulted with the Secretary of \n     State, The Secretary of Defense, The Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces-Iraq, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, \n     and the Commander of U.S. Central Command, will prepare the \n     report and submit the report to Congress.\n       (3) If the President's assessment of any of the specific \n     benchmarks established above is unsatisfactory, the President \n     shall include in that report a description of such revisions \n     to the political, economic, regional, and military components \n     of the strategy, as announced by the President on January 10, \n     2007. In addition, the President shall include in the report, \n     the advisability of implementing such aspects of the \n     bipartisan Iraq Study Group, as he deems appropriate.\n       (4) The President shall submit a second report to the \n     Congress, not later than September 15, 2007, following the \n     same procedures and criteria, outlined above.\n       (5) The reporting requirement detailed in Section 1227 of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 \n     is waived from the date of the enactment of this Act through \n     the period ending 15 September, 2007.\n       (c) Testimony Before Congress.--\n       (1) Prior to the submission of the President's second \n     report on September 15, 2007, and at a time to be agreed upon \n     by the leadership of the Congress and the Administration, the \n     United States Ambassador to Iraq and the Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces Iraq will be made available to testify in \n     open and closed sessions before the relevant committees of \n     the Congress.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman from California and the distinguished majority leader in a \ncolloquy with respect to the provisions in section 2006, 2007, and 2008 \n(c) and (e) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, S.1248.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be happy to respond to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. REID. I, too, am happy to engage in a colloquy with the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I appreciate the efforts and success of the chairman \nand the Environment and Public Works Committee in reporting a Water \nResources Development Act that includes many important Corps of \nEngineers reforms. I would simply like to clarify that it is the intent \nof the committee and of the majority leader that these provisions be \nretained through conference and enacted into law. These provisions \nshould be the minimum reforms coming out of conference.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I concur that this is the committee's intent.\n  Mr. REID. I support the understanding reached by the chairman and the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would like to point out some of the critical elements \nto ensuring meaningful independent review of Corps of Engineers water \nresources projects that are contained in section 2007 of S.1248. \nSection 2007 is the same language that was adopted on the Senate floor \nduring last summer's consideration of the Water Resources Development \nAct of 2006. Though the House of Representatives has an independent \nreview provision in their bill, there are several important \ndistinctions between the House and the Senate provisions.\n  The Senate provision houses responsibility for independent review in \nthe Office of the Secretary of the Army and makes independent review \nmandatory for any project meeting the review triggers. The mandatory \nreview triggers and placement of responsibility for carrying out \nindependent reviews outside the Office of the Chief of Engineers are \nessential for ensuring full independence of the review process. The \nSenate provision gives the independent review panels the ability to \nreview those issues deemed significant by the panel. This is essential \nfor ensuring that all relevant study issues are examined by the panel. \nThe House of Representatives provision gives the Chief of Engineers \nessentially unlimited authority to restrict the scope of a panel's \nreview. The Senate provision places limits on the Corps' ability to \nignore panel recommendations by requiring the Secretary of the Army to \nprovide a written explanation regarding the rejection of any panel \nrecommendations and by requiring the Corps to prove why it is \nappropriate to reject a panel's recommendation in any lawsuit that \nmight be brought to challenge the project. The Senate bill does not \ncreate a new cause of action. This is essential for ensuring that the \nfindings of an independent review panel are given appropriate \nconsideration by the Corps of Engineers. In addition, the Senate \nprovision establishes a critical safety assurance review of the \ndetailed technical design of vital flood control projects. The House \nlanguage does not include this essential provision.\n  Importantly, the Senate provision ensures that the independent review \npanel will review the draft study released for public comment and will \nhave the benefit of public comment to help guide their review. The \nHouse bill in general requires that independent review be complete \nbefore there is a draft study for review. That would limit a \nfundamental purpose of independent review, which is to ensure review of \ndraft studies and limit public participation in the independent review \nprocess.\n  I ask my colleagues to concur with the importance of retaining these \ncritical elements of independent review contained in Section 2007.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I concur that these are fundamental elements of \nmeaningful independent review and concur that it is the committee's \nintent to retain these elements and that we will strenuously support \nthem in the conference.\n  Mr. REID. I support the understanding reached by the chairman and the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mitigation for Corps of Engineers civil works projects \nis another important area that must be improved. Despite the clear \nmitigation requirements established for water resources projects in the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1986, the Government Accountability \nOffice reported in 2002 that the Corps of Engineers does not mitigate \nat all for almost 70 percent of its projects. To help address this \nproblem, the Senate provision requires the Secretary to ensure that \nmitigation for water resources projects complies fully with the \nmitigation standards and policies established pursuant to section 404 \nof the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344. This will \nhelp protect the environment and is consistent with the fundamental \nprincipal that we will hold the Federal Government to the same \nenvironmental criteria as private enterprise.\n  In addition, in order to ensure that mitigation produces the same or \ngreater ecosystem values as those lost to a water resources project, \nthe Senate provision requires that the Corps of Engineers implement not \nless than in-kind mitigation. To ensure that mitigation will be \neffective, the Senate bill requires the preparation of detailed \nmitigation plans, requires that mitigation be monitored until \necological success criteria are met, and requires the Corps of \nEngineers to consult yearly with applicable Federal and State agencies \non the status of individual mitigation efforts. The Senate provision \napplies the new mitigation standards to projects that the Corps of \nEngineers has determined must be reevaluated for other reasons. The \nSenate provision also requires the Corps to establish a publicly \naccessible mitigation tracking system.\n  The language of sections 2008(c) and (e) obtained bipartisan support \nfrom the Environment and Public Works Committee last Congress and was \nincluded in the Senate Water Resources Development Act of 2006.\n  I ask my colleagues to concur with the importance of retaining these \nkey elements of mitigation reform contained in section 2008(c) and (e).\n  Mrs. BOXER. I concur that these are fundamental elements of \nmeaningful mitigation reform and concur that it is the committee's \nintent to retain these elements and that we will strenuously support \nthem in the conference.\n  Mr. REID. I support the understanding reached by the chairman and the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Lastly, section 2006 of S. 1248 would update the Corps' \nwoefully out-of-date Principles and Guidelines, P, and related \nplanning documents by establishing a Cabinet-level interagency working \ngroup to revise the guidelines and regulations and circulars, which \nhave not been revised since their inception in 1983. Numerous\n\n[[Page S6123]]\n\nstudies have called for updating the Corps' planning guidelines to \nprovide an increased focus on protecting and restoring the environment \nand to modernize and incorporate new methods and more cost-effective \napproaches to solving water problems. More than a decade of reports \nfrom the National Academy of Sciences, Government Accountability \nOffice, Army inspector general, U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, and \nindependent experts have revealed a pattern of stunning flaws in U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers project planning and implementation and urged \nsubstantial changes to the Corps' project planning process. The most \nrecent call for revising the Corps' planning guidelines came just 2 \nmonths ago from the National Academy of Public Administration.\n  These flaws have increased taxpayer costs and environmental \ndegradation with antiquated economic analysis of projects and in some \ncases overly structural projects. It is vital that these planning \nguidelines be modernized so that they no longer promote projects that \ndestroy healthy natural ecosystems and lure development in high risk \nareas. It is also essential that the provision to require the Corps to \nadopt those revisions, subject to public comment, be retained.\n  The language of section 2006 obtained bipartisan support from the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee last Congress and was included \nin the Senate Water Resources Development Act of 2006.\n  I ask my colleagues to concur with the importance of retaining these \nelements.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I concur that these are fundamental elements of \nmeaningful reform of the Corps of Engineers planning guidelines and \nconcur that it is the committee's intent to retain these elements and \nthat we will strenuously support them in the conference.\n  Mr. REID. I support the understanding reached by the chairman and the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the chairman and the majority leader for \nengaging in this colloquy. Instituting meaningful reforms to the Corps \nof Engineers' planning process is essential for protecting public \nsafety, the environment, and the taxpayers. I remain committed to \nensuring that meaningful reforms are included in the next Water \nResources Development Act that is enacted into law. I thank the \nchairman and the majority leader for their commitment as well.\n\n\n                          middle creek project\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Boxer and the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works for their hard work on S. 1248, the Water \nResources Development Act of 2007 and the bill currently being \nconsidered by the Senate, H.R. 1495. The bill represents years of \nnegotiations by her, members of the committee, and staff, and I \nappreciate her leadership in bringing a bill forward for this body's \nconsideration.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his comments. I \nappreciate the leader's continued support for this reauthorizing \nlegislation and the authorization of the new projects for navigation, \nflood and coastal storm damage reduction, ecosystem restoration and \nenvironmental remediation, and water storage and water quality.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I generally support this bill and understand \nthat many of the projects are necessary to improve and maintain safe \ncommunities. But I am concerned about the effects of one project on \nIndian lands.\n  Both S. 1248 and H.R. 1495 include authorizing language for a flood \ndamage reduction and environmental restoration project on Middle Creek, \nlocated in Lake County, CA. I certainly defer to the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers and the California congressional delegation as to the \nproject's importance and the most appropriate plan to implement it, but \nwould my friend from California describe the impact of the project on \nIndian lands in the area?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. Leader, the Middle Creek Project will restore lands \nwithin the Middle Creek floodplain and study area. I believe the \nproject will reconnect the floodplain of Middle Creek to the historic \nRobinson Lake wetland area by breaching the existing levee system and \ncreating inlets that direct flows into the study area. The restoration \nwill provide flood damage reduction by relocating residents of the \nRobinson Rancheria from the floodplain.\n  Mr. REID. Madam Chairman, I understand the Rancheria's current casino \nwill not be affected by this project if implemented--that the Rancheria \ncould continue, if it chooses, to operate this casino once the project \nis completed. Is this correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. Leader, that is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Madam Chairman, I understand that neither the Senate nor \nthe House bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to take land \ninto trust for purposes of gaming on behalf of the Rancheria?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. Leader, the bill under consideration would authorize \nthe Middle Creek Project. The bill does not expressly authorize the \nUnited States to take land into trust for the Rancheria.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you for that clarification. Madam Chairman, in Senate \nReport 110-58, the committee recommends that, in exchange for the \nexisting reservation lands that would be included in the floodplain, \nthe Secretary of the Interior accept three parcels of land into trust \nfor the benefit of the Rancheria. Would you describe these parcels and \ntheir location in relation to the Rancheria's current reservation \nboundaries?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the interest of the Senator \nfrom Nevada in the effect of this project on the Rancheria. Since 1981, \nthe Secretary of the Interior has held 37 acres in trust on behalf of \nthe Rancheria. The parcels discussed in the committee report are \ncurrently owned by the Rancheria and are very close to their current \nreservation boundary. Two of the three parcels are along the Clear Lake \nshoreline. The committee believed it was appropriate to compensate the \nRancheria by allowing them to add to their reservation lands that are \napproximately 1 mile away from their current reservation boundary and \nwhich the tribe already owns.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank my friend from California for \ndescribing the lands. While neither the House nor Senate bills would \nauthorize the Secretary to take the transferred lands into trust as \n``restored lands'' for the purpose of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, \nthe report recommends the Secretary do so.\n  I understand the Rancheria can continue to operate its on-reservation \ncasino should this project be implemented, and I do not oppose the \nRancheria's right to do so because these lands are located within its \ntraditional reservation boundary and were taken into trust before the \nenactment of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, thus the casino \nwas opened consistent with the requirements of IGRA. But as you know, I \nhave long opposed off-reservation gaming, and while I understand that \nneither bill would authorize gaming on the transferred parcels, I do \nnot support the committee's recommendation that the Secretary declare \nthese parcels ``restored lands.'' As we know, should the Secretary \ndeclare the parcels as ``restored lands,'' the Rancheria would be \nallowed to conduct gaming on lands deemed outside of its reservation \nboundary and on lands acquired after enactment of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act. I note that report language does not have the same \nlegal status as legislative language.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the California delegation strongly \nsupports the projects included in S. 1248. I hear the majority leader's \nconcerns. Being chair of the committee, I, of course, support the \nlanguage in the committee's recommendation with respect to the land \ntransfer for the Robinson Rancheria, should the bill be enacted. While \nI may disagree with the leader's position as it concerns this \nparticular project, I appreciate his comments and support for the \nlegislation as a whole.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the clarifications and \nexplanations that my friend from California has provided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6124]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/15/senate-section/article/S6118-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6118-S6124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT--Continued\n\n\n                       Warner Amendment No. 1134\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nreturn to consideration of H.R. 1495.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think we have just seen an extraordinary \nchapter of how two leaders can come together and structure a procedure \nby which this Senate can go forward and achieve its objectives. I am \ntotally supportive of the procedure enunciated by our two distinguished \nleaders because I strongly support the need for getting this \nappropriations legislation through and on to the President's desk so \nthat we can fund adequately our Armed Forces, particularly those \nengaged in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The leadership further decided that those Senators who wish to \naddress the conferees could do so by adding amendments to this bill. My \nunderstanding is that there are two amendments that have been filed on \nthe other side of the aisle: one by Mr. Feingold and another by Mr. \nLevin. And in consultation with the distinguished Republican leader, I \nnow file an amendment on this side of the aisle, although I am hopeful \nmy amendment would not be viewed purely as a Republican amendment but \nthat it could be a vehicle by which we can reach some level, hopefully \na significant level, of bipartisan consensus on the several principles \nI have enunciated in this amendment.\n  Throughout the course of this debate on Iraq, since the President's \nannouncement of a new strategy on January 10 of this year, there have \nbeen groups of Republicans and Democrats that have voiced our concerns \nabout the strategies being employed in Iraq, and we continue to do so \nby virtue of this process now decided upon by the leadership whereby \namendments to this bill can be brought up, which amendments reflect the \nsentiments of those who are sponsoring them.\n  At the present time, my amendment is sponsored by my principal \ncosponsor, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, although I have been in \nconsultation with a number of other Senators on this side of the aisle, \nas well as Senators on the other side of the aisle.\n  Given the brevity of the time today, since Senators have returned \nfrom their constituencies largely this morning, and the fact that we \nhave been trying to work out the procedure just adopted by the Senate \nby the two leaders, it has not been possible for me to isolate a fixed \nset of cosponsors. Nevertheless, I do know of a number, certainly on \nthis side, and I am hopeful on the other side, and now that this \namendment is filed tonight, it is my expectation and hope that Senators \nwill be adding their names as cosponsors. I urge that be done at the \nearliest opportunity because, as I understand it, and the leadership \nwill subsequently address, I think, the Senate tonight respecting the \nlegislative program tomorrow as to when my amendment, with such \ncosponsors that are able to add their names, and the two amendments \npending from the other side--and I believe a fourth that is to be \nbrought up by our distinguished Republican leader sometime this \nevening--will be debated, voted upon, and subject to a cloture motion.\n  Let me now turn to addressing the specifics of this amendment at this \ntime. This amendment, in its preamble, has the following: We entitle it \nthe ``President's Strategy In Iraq.'' Section 1. Findings regarding \nprogress in Iraq, the establishment of benchmarks to measure that \nprogress, and reports to the Congress.\n  The recitation in the first section of this amendment is a series of \nstatements factually describing the situation as we, the sponsors of \nthis amendment, feel have taken place, largely since January 10 of this \nyear. Foremost among those obligations is, of course, our recognition \nof the enormity of the sacrifice of the men and women of the Armed \nForces and their families and others who have taken an active role in \ncarrying out our strategies in Iraq, not just since January 10 of this \nyear but prior thereto, in the regrettably long period of time that \nthis conflict in Iraq has persisted.\n  Following those statements, we then go to section 2, which is \nentitled, ``Conditioning of Future United States Strategy in Iraq on \nthe Iraqi Government's Record of Performance on its Benchmarks.''\n\n       In General. The United States strategy in Iraq, hereafter, \n     shall be conditioned on the Iraqi government meeting \n     benchmarks as told to Members of Congress by the President, \n     the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reflected in the \n     Iraqi Government's commitments to the United States, and to \n     the international community, including . . .\n\n  For example, benchmarks--and I shall read but several. First and \nforemost:\n\n       Forming a Constitutional Review Committee and then \n     completing the Constitutional review;\n       Enacting and implementing legislation on de-baathification;\n       Enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the \n     equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the \n     people of Iraq without regard to the sect or ethnicity of \n     recipients, and enacting and implementing legislation to \n     ensure that the energy resources of\n\n[[Page S6119]]\n\n     Iraq benefit Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other \n     Iraqi citizens in an equitable manner.\n       Enacting and implementing legislation on procedures to form \n     semi-autonomous regions;\n       Enacting and implementing legislation establishing an \n     Independent High Electoral Commission; provincial elections \n     law; provincial council authorities; and a date for \n     provincial elections.\n\n  I shall not read further from this document. It will be a matter of \nrecord. But these benchmarks were ones put forth by the Iraqi \nGovernment, in large measure. What we are doing now is requiring the \nfollowing:\n\n       The President shall submit reports to the Congress on how \n     the sovereign government of Iraq is, or is not, achieving \n     progress towards accomplishing the aforementioned benchmarks, \n     and shall advise the Congress on how that assessment \n     requires, or does not require, changes to the strategy \n     announced on January 10, 2007.\n       Reports Required.\n       (1) The President shall submit an initial report, in \n     classified and unclassified format, to the Congress, not \n     later than July 15, 2007, assessing the status of each of the \n     specific benchmarks established above, and declaring, in his \n     judgment, whether satisfactory progress towards meeting these \n     benchmarks is, or is not, being achieved.\n       (2) The President, having consulted with the Secretary of \n     State, the Secretary of Defense, the Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces-Iraq, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, \n     and the Commander of U.S. Central Command, will prepare the \n     report and submit the report to Congress.\n       (3) If the President's assessment of any of the specific \n     benchmarks established above is unsatisfactory, the President \n     shall include in that report a description of such revisions \n     to the political, economic, regional, and military components \n     of the strategy, as announced by the President on January 10, \n     2007. In addition, the President shall include in the report, \n     the advisability of implementing such aspects of the \n     bipartisan Iraq Study Group, as he deems appropriate.\n\n  And, as is well documented in the Senate, and well-respected, if I \nmay say, by the Senate--the work of the Iraq Study Group.\n\n       (4) The President shall submit a second report to the \n     Congress, not later than September 15, 2007, following the \n     same procedures and criteria outlined above.\n       (5) The reporting requirement detailed in section 1227 of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 \n     is hereby waived from the date of the enactment of this Act \n     through the period ending September 15, 2007.\n\n  That is put in there for the reason that we believe these reports by \nthe President will supplant whatever reports had been required by that \nact. The force and effect of the requirement for those reports will \npick up and continue after September of this year.\n\n       (c) Testimony before Congress.\n       (1) Prior to the submission of the President's second \n     report on September 15, 2007, and at a time to be agreed upon \n     by the leadership of the Congress and the Administration, the \n     United States Ambassador to Iraq and the Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces Iraq--\n\n  That is General Petraeus--\n\n     will be made available to testify in open and closed sessions \n     before the relevant committees of the Congress.\n\n  I will now refer to the section titled ``Limitations on Availability \nof Funds'' in this appropriations bill.\n\n       Limitation. No funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available for the ``Economic Support Fund'' and available for \n     Iraq may be obligated or expended unless and until the \n     President of the United States certifies in the report \n     outlined in subsection (2)(b)(1) above and makes a further \n     certification in the report outlined in subsection (2)(b)(4) \n     above that Iraq is making progress in each of the benchmarks \n     set forth in section 2 above.\n\n  To give the President a certain amount of flexibility--and this is \nthe provision I am particularly indebted to our distinguished \ncolleague, Ms. Collins of Maine, who has worked with me on it, as well \nas Senator Coleman and others who have been working with me--we provide \nthe following:\n\n       The President may waive the requirements of this section if \n     he submits to Congress a written certification setting forth \n     the detailed justification for the waiver, which shall \n     include a detailed report describing the actions being taken \n     by the United States to bring the Iraqi government into \n     compliance with the benchmarks set forth in section 2 above. \n     The certification shall be submitted in unclassified form, \n     but may include a classified annex.\n\n  We proceed to a section entitled ``Redeployment of U.S. Forces from \nIraq.'' There has been considerable publicity attached to certain \nactions having been taken by the Council of Representatives in Iraq--\nthat is their basic name for their parliament--and to clarify that we \nhave put in the following requirement:\n\n       The President of the United States, in respecting the \n     sovereign rights of the nation of Iraq, shall direct the \n     orderly redeployment of elements of U.S. forces from Iraq, if \n     the components of the Iraqi government, acting in strict \n     accordance with their respective powers given by the Iraqi \n     Constitution, reach a consensus as recited in a resolution, \n     directing a redeployment of U.S. forces.\n\n  Now, proceeding to another section, ``Independent Assessments.''\n\n       Assessment by the Comptroller General.\n       Not later than September 1, 2007, the Comptroller general \n     of the United States shall submit to Congress an independent \n     report setting forth--\n       (A) the status of the achievement of the benchmarks \n     specified in section 2 above; and\n       (B) the Comptroller General's assessment whether or not \n     each such benchmark has [or has not] been met.\n       (b) Assessment of the capabilities of Iraq Security forces.\n\n  This is a section which I worked on, now, for over 2 months, laying a \nfoundation, with consultations with the White House senior staff, the \nSecretary of Defense, and indeed a private organization here, a well-\nrespected organization, independent of any affiliation with the \nGovernment, to participate in performing this report, as well as a very \nsenior and highly respected retired military officer who, hopefully, \nwill be designated to head up this report.\n  I believed it was imperative that the Congress needed to have an \nindependent report, and by ``independent,'' I mean a report performed \nby a private sector entity with the advice and participation of at \nleast one senior retired military officer, and maybe others, so that we \ncan have a report to put side by side with the periodic evaluations of \nthe Department of Defense as to the military--professional ability, \ncapability, training, and equipment of the Iraqi security forces. That \nis essential. So that is the essence of this provision which I now \nread.\n\n       (1) In General.--There is hereby authorized to be \n     appropriated for the Department of Defense, $750,000, that \n     the Department, in turn, will commission an independent \n     private sector entity which operates as a 501(c)(3) with \n     recognized credentials and expertise in militarily affairs, \n     to prepare an independent report assessing the following:\n       (A) The readiness of the Iraqi security forces--ISF \n     [referred to] to assume responsibility for maintaining the \n     territorial integrity of Iraq, denying international \n     terrorists a safe haven, and bringing greater security to \n     Iraq's 18 provinces in the next 12-18 months, and bringing an \n     end to sectarian violence to achieve national reconciliation.\n       (B) The training, equipping, command, control and \n     intelligence capabilities and logistics capacity of the ISF \n     [Iraqi Security Forces].\n       (C) The likelihood that given the ISF's record of \n     preparedness to date, following years of training and \n     equipping by U.S. forces, the continued supports of U.S. \n     troops will contribute to the readiness of the ISF to fulfill \n     the missions outlined in subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the enactment of \n     this Act, the designated private sector entity shall provide \n     an unclassified report, with a classified annex, containing \n     its findings, to the House and Senate Committees on Armed \n     Services, Appropriations, Foreign Relations/International \n     Relations, and Intelligence.\n\n  Having worked on this report some 2 months now, I submitted it to \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives. I am pleased to say that \nthose colleagues saw fit to include that basic language on reporting \nand establishing this independent entity and individuals to study the \nIraqi security forces. This provision which I have just read was \ncontained in the House appropriations bill. It is my hope and \nexpectation that it will be included by this Senate, the appropriators, \nin their bill such that it will emerge as part of the final conference \nreport of the House and the Senate.\n  I once again thank many individuals who have worked with me and their \nrespective staffs, who worked beginning last week on the final draft. \nThey worked over the weekend, worked on Monday, worked today to create \nthis document. I am hopeful a good number of our colleagues will see \nfit to cosponsor this document, which document and amendment will be \ndiscussed tomorrow in such brief period as outlined by the leadership. \nThey will define it tonight, and then it will be voted upon.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself and Ms. \n     Collins, proposes an\n\n[[Page S6120]]\n\n     amendment No. 1134 to the language proposed to be stricken by \n     amendment No. 1065.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n        (Purpose: Relating to the President's strategy in Iraq)\n\n                  TITLE--PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY IN IRAQ\n\n     SEC. 1. FINDINGS REGARDING PROGRESS IN IRAQ, THE \n                   ESTABLISHMENT OF BENCHMARKS TO MEASURE THAT \n                   PROGRESS, AND REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 145,000 American military personnel are currently \n     serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since March 2003, \n     with the bravery and professionalism consistent with the \n     finest traditions of the United States armed forces, and are \n     deserving of the strong support of all Americans;\n       (2) Many American service personnel have lost their lives, \n     and many more have been wounded in Iraq; the American people \n     will always honor their sacrifice and honor their families;\n       (3) The United States Army and Marine Corps, including \n     their Reserve components and National Guard organizations, \n     together with components of the other branches of the \n     military, are performing their missions while under enormous \n     strain from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. These deployments, and those that will follow, \n     will have a lasting impact on future recruiting, retention, \n     and readiness of our Nation's all volunteer force;\n       (4) Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating problem of \n     sectarian and intrasectarian violence based upon political \n     distrust and cultural differences among factions of the Sunni \n     and Shia populations;\n       (5) Iraqis must reach political and economic settlements in \n     order to achieve reconciliation, for there is no military \n     solution. The failure of the Iraqis to reach such settlements \n     to support a truly unified government greatly contributes to \n     the increasing violence in Iraq;\n       (6) The responsibility for Iraq's internal security and \n     halting sectarian violence rests with the sovereign \n     Government of Iraq;\n       (7) In December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group \n     issued a valuable report, suggesting a comprehensive strategy \n     that includes new and enhanced diplomatic and political \n     efforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary \n     mission of U.S. forces in Iraq, that will enable the United \n     States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq \n     responsibly;\n       (8) The President said on January 10, 2007, that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not open-ended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists;\n       (9) It is essential that the sovereign Government of Iraq \n     set out measurable and achievable benchmarks and President \n     Bush said, on January 10, 2007, that ``America will change \n     our approach to help the Iraqi government as it works to meet \n     these benchmarks'';\n       (10) As reported by Secretary of State Rice, Iraq's Policy \n     Committee on National Security agreed upon a set of \n     political, security, and economic benchmarks and an \n     associated timeline in September 2006 that were (a) \n     reaffirmed by Iraq's Presidency Council on October 6, 2006; \n     (b) referenced by the Iraq Study Group; and (c) posted on the \n     President of Iraq's Web site;\n       (11) On April 21, 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \n     stated that ``our [American] commitment to Iraq is long-term, \n     but it is not a commitment to have our young men and women \n     patrolling Iraq's streets open-endedly'' and that ``progress \n     in reconciliation will be an important element of our \n     evaluation'';\n       (12) The President's January 10, 2007 address had three \n     components: political, military, and economic. Given that \n     significant time has passed since his statement, and \n     recognizing the overall situation is ever changing, Congress \n     must have timely reports to evaluate and execute its \n     Constitutional oversight responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONDITIONING OF FUTURE UNITED STATES STRATEGY IN IRAQ \n                   ON THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT'S RECORD OF PERFORMANCE \n                   ON ITS BENCHMARKS.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) The United States strategy in Iraq, \n     hereafter, shall be conditioned on the Iraqi government \n     meeting benchmarks, as told to members of Congress by the \n     President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, \n     and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reflected \n     in the Iraqi Government's commitments to the United States, \n     and to the international community, including:\n       (A) Forming a Constitutional Review Committee and then \n     completing the Constitutional review;\n       (B) Enacting and implementing legislation on de-\n     Baathification;\n       (C) Enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the \n     equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the people \n     of Iraq without regard to the sect or ethnicity of \n     recipients, and enacting and implementing legislation to \n     ensure that the energy resources of Iraq benefit Sunni Arabs, \n     Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in an equitable \n     manner;\n       (D) Enacting and implementing legislation on procedures to \n     form semi-autonomous regions;\n       (E) Enacting and implementing legislation establishing an \n     Independent High Electoral Commission; provincial elections \n     law; provincial council authorities; and a date for \n     provincial elections;\n       (F) Enacting and implementing legislation addressing \n     amnesty;\n       (G) Enacting and implementing legislation establishing a \n     strong militia disarmament program to ensure that such \n     security forces are accountable only to the central \n     government and loyal to the Constitution of Iraq;\n       (H) Establishing supporting political, media, economic, and \n     services committees in support of the Baghdad Security Plan;\n       (I) Providing three trained and ready Iraqi brigades to \n     support Baghdad operations;\n       (J) Providing Iraqi commanders with all authorities to \n     execute this plan and to make tactical and operational \n     decisions, in consultation with U.S commanders, without \n     political intervention, to include the authority to pursue \n     all extremists, including Sunni insurgents and Shiite \n     militias;\n       (K) Ensuring that the Iraqi Security Forces are providing \n     even handed enforcement of the law;\n       (L) Ensuring that, according to President Bush, Prime \n     Minister Maliki said ``the Baghdad security plan will not \n     provide a safe haven for any outlaws, regardless of [their] \n     sectarian or political affiliation'';\n       (M) Reducing the level of sectarian violence in Iraq and \n     eliminating militia control of local security;\n       (N) Establishing all of the planned joint security stations \n     in neighborhoods across Baghdad;\n       (O) Increasing the number of Iraqi security forces units \n     capable of operating independently;\n       (P) Ensuring that the rights of minority political parties \n     in the Iraqi legislature are protected;\n       (Q) Allocating and spending $10 billion in Iraqi revenues \n     for reconstruction projects, including delivery of essential \n     services, on an equitable basis; and\n       (R) Ensuring that Iraq's political authorities are not \n     undermining or making false accusations against members of \n     the ISF.\n       (2) The President shall submit reports to Congress on how \n     the sovereign Government of Iraq is, or is not, achieving \n     progress towards accomplishing the aforementioned benchmarks, \n     and shall advise the Congress on how that assessment \n     requires, or does not require, changes to the strategy \n     announced on January 10, 2007.\n       (b) Reports Required.--\n       (1) The President shall submit an initial report, in \n     classified and unclassified format, to the Congress, not \n     later than July 15, 2007, assessing the status of each of the \n     specific benchmarks established above, and declaring, in his \n     judgment, whether satisfactory progress toward meeting these \n     benchmarks is, or is not, being achieved.\n       (2) The President, having consulted with the Secretary of \n     State, The Secretary of Defense, The Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces-Iraq, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, \n     and the Commander of U.S. Central Command, will prepare the \n     report and submit the report to Congress.\n       (3) If the President's assessment of any of the specific \n     benchmarks established above is unsatisfactory, the President \n     shall include in that report a description of such revisions \n     to the political, economic, regional, and military components \n     of the strategy, as announced by the President on January 10, \n     2007. In addition, the President shall include in the report, \n     the advisability of implementing such aspects of the \n     bipartisan Iraq Study Group, as he deems appropriate.\n       (4) The President shall submit a second report to the \n     Congress, not later than September 15, 2007, following the \n     same procedures and criteria, outlined above.\n       (5) The reporting requirement detailed in Section 1227 of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 \n     is waived from the date of the enactment of this Act through \n     the period ending 15 September, 2007.\n       (c) Testimony Before Congress.--\n       (1) Prior to the submission of the President's second \n     report on September 15, 2007, and at a time to be agreed upon \n     by the leadership of the Congress and the Administration, the \n     United States Ambassador to Iraq and the Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces Iraq will be made available to testify in \n     open and closed sessions before the relevant committees of \n     the Congress.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman from California and the distinguished majority leader in a \ncolloquy with respect to the provisions in section 2006, 2007, and 2008 \n(c) and (e) of the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, S.1248.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be happy to respond to the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. REID. I, too, am happy to engage in a colloquy with the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I appreciate the efforts and success of the chairman \nand the Environment and Public Works Committee in reporting a Water \nResources Development Act that includes many important Corps of \nEngineers reforms. I would simply like to clarify that it is the intent \nof the committee and of the majority leader that these provisions be \nretained through conference and enacted into law. These provisions \nshould be the minimum reforms coming out of conference.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I concur that this is the committee's intent.\n  Mr. REID. I support the understanding reached by the chairman and the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I would like to point out some of the critical elements \nto ensuring meaningful independent review of Corps of Engineers water \nresources projects that are contained in section 2007 of S.1248. \nSection 2007 is the same language that was adopted on the Senate floor \nduring last summer's consideration of the Water Resources Development \nAct of 2006. Though the House of Representatives has an independent \nreview provision in their bill, there are several important \ndistinctions between the House and the Senate provisions.\n  The Senate provision houses responsibility for independent review in \nthe Office of the Secretary of the Army and makes independent review \nmandatory for any project meeting the review triggers. The mandatory \nreview triggers and placement of responsibility for carrying out \nindependent reviews outside the Office of the Chief of Engineers are \nessential for ensuring full independence of the review process. The \nSenate provision gives the independent review panels the ability to \nreview those issues deemed significant by the panel. This is essential \nfor ensuring that all relevant study issues are examined by the panel. \nThe House of Representatives provision gives the Chief of Engineers \nessentially unlimited authority to restrict the scope of a panel's \nreview. The Senate provision places limits on the Corps' ability to \nignore panel recommendations by requiring the Secretary of the Army to \nprovide a written explanation regarding the rejection of any panel \nrecommendations and by requiring the Corps to prove why it is \nappropriate to reject a panel's recommendation in any lawsuit that \nmight be brought to challenge the project. The Senate bill does not \ncreate a new cause of action. This is essential for ensuring that the \nfindings of an independent review panel are given appropriate \nconsideration by the Corps of Engineers. In addition, the Senate \nprovision establishes a critical safety assurance review of the \ndetailed technical design of vital flood control projects. The House \nlanguage does not include this essential provision.\n  Importantly, the Senate provision ensures that the independent review \npanel will review the draft study released for public comment and will \nhave the benefit of public comment to help guide their review. The \nHouse bill in general requires that independent review be complete \nbefore there is a draft study for review. That would limit a \nfundamental purpose of independent review, which is to ensure review of \ndraft studies and limit public participation in the independent review \nprocess.\n  I ask my colleagues to concur with the importance of retaining these \ncritical elements of independent review contained in Section 2007.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I concur that these are fundamental elements of \nmeaningful independent review and concur that it is the committee's \nintent to retain these elements and that we will strenuously support \nthem in the conference.\n  Mr. REID. I support the understanding reached by the chairman and the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mitigation for Corps of Engineers civil works projects \nis another important area that must be improved. Despite the clear \nmitigation requirements established for water resources projects in the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1986, the Government Accountability \nOffice reported in 2002 that the Corps of Engineers does not mitigate \nat all for almost 70 percent of its projects. To help address this \nproblem, the Senate provision requires the Secretary to ensure that \nmitigation for water resources projects complies fully with the \nmitigation standards and policies established pursuant to section 404 \nof the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344. This will \nhelp protect the environment and is consistent with the fundamental \nprincipal that we will hold the Federal Government to the same \nenvironmental criteria as private enterprise.\n  In addition, in order to ensure that mitigation produces the same or \ngreater ecosystem values as those lost to a water resources project, \nthe Senate provision requires that the Corps of Engineers implement not \nless than in-kind mitigation. To ensure that mitigation will be \neffective, the Senate bill requires the preparation of detailed \nmitigation plans, requires that mitigation be monitored until \necological success criteria are met, and requires the Corps of \nEngineers to consult yearly with applicable Federal and State agencies \non the status of individual mitigation efforts. The Senate provision \napplies the new mitigation standards to projects that the Corps of \nEngineers has determined must be reevaluated for other reasons. The \nSenate provision also requires the Corps to establish a publicly \naccessible mitigation tracking system.\n  The language of sections 2008(c) and (e) obtained bipartisan support \nfrom the Environment and Public Works Committee last Congress and was \nincluded in the Senate Water Resources Development Act of 2006.\n  I ask my colleagues to concur with the importance of retaining these \nkey elements of mitigation reform contained in section 2008(c) and (e).\n  Mrs. BOXER. I concur that these are fundamental elements of \nmeaningful mitigation reform and concur that it is the committee's \nintent to retain these elements and that we will strenuously support \nthem in the conference.\n  Mr. REID. I support the understanding reached by the chairman and the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Lastly, section 2006 of S. 1248 would update the Corps' \nwoefully out-of-date Principles and Guidelines, P, and related \nplanning documents by establishing a Cabinet-level interagency working \ngroup to revise the guidelines and regulations and circulars, which \nhave not been revised since their inception in 1983. Numerous\n\n[[Page S6123]]\n\nstudies have called for updating the Corps' planning guidelines to \nprovide an increased focus on protecting and restoring the environment \nand to modernize and incorporate new methods and more cost-effective \napproaches to solving water problems. More than a decade of reports \nfrom the National Academy of Sciences, Government Accountability \nOffice, Army inspector general, U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, and \nindependent experts have revealed a pattern of stunning flaws in U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers project planning and implementation and urged \nsubstantial changes to the Corps' project planning process. The most \nrecent call for revising the Corps' planning guidelines came just 2 \nmonths ago from the National Academy of Public Administration.\n  These flaws have increased taxpayer costs and environmental \ndegradation with antiquated economic analysis of projects and in some \ncases overly structural projects. It is vital that these planning \nguidelines be modernized so that they no longer promote projects that \ndestroy healthy natural ecosystems and lure development in high risk \nareas. It is also essential that the provision to require the Corps to \nadopt those revisions, subject to public comment, be retained.\n  The language of section 2006 obtained bipartisan support from the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee last Congress and was included \nin the Senate Water Resources Development Act of 2006.\n  I ask my colleagues to concur with the importance of retaining these \nelements.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I concur that these are fundamental elements of \nmeaningful reform of the Corps of Engineers planning guidelines and \nconcur that it is the committee's intent to retain these elements and \nthat we will strenuously support them in the conference.\n  Mr. REID. I support the understanding reached by the chairman and the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the chairman and the majority leader for \nengaging in this colloquy. Instituting meaningful reforms to the Corps \nof Engineers' planning process is essential for protecting public \nsafety, the environment, and the taxpayers. I remain committed to \nensuring that meaningful reforms are included in the next Water \nResources Development Act that is enacted into law. I thank the \nchairman and the majority leader for their commitment as well.\n\n\n                          middle creek project\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Boxer and the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works for their hard work on S. 1248, the Water \nResources Development Act of 2007 and the bill currently being \nconsidered by the Senate, H.R. 1495. The bill represents years of \nnegotiations by her, members of the committee, and staff, and I \nappreciate her leadership in bringing a bill forward for this body's \nconsideration.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his comments. I \nappreciate the leader's continued support for this reauthorizing \nlegislation and the authorization of the new projects for navigation, \nflood and coastal storm damage reduction, ecosystem restoration and \nenvironmental remediation, and water storage and water quality.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I generally support this bill and understand \nthat many of the projects are necessary to improve and maintain safe \ncommunities. But I am concerned about the effects of one project on \nIndian lands.\n  Both S. 1248 and H.R. 1495 include authorizing language for a flood \ndamage reduction and environmental restoration project on Middle Creek, \nlocated in Lake County, CA. I certainly defer to the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers and the California congressional delegation as to the \nproject's importance and the most appropriate plan to implement it, but \nwould my friend from California describe the impact of the project on \nIndian lands in the area?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. Leader, the Middle Creek Project will restore lands \nwithin the Middle Creek floodplain and study area. I believe the \nproject will reconnect the floodplain of Middle Creek to the historic \nRobinson Lake wetland area by breaching the existing levee system and \ncreating inlets that direct flows into the study area. The restoration \nwill provide flood damage reduction by relocating residents of the \nRobinson Rancheria from the floodplain.\n  Mr. REID. Madam Chairman, I understand the Rancheria's current casino \nwill not be affected by this project if implemented--that the Rancheria \ncould continue, if it chooses, to operate this casino once the project \nis completed. Is this correct?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. Leader, that is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Madam Chairman, I understand that neither the Senate nor \nthe House bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to take land \ninto trust for purposes of gaming on behalf of the Rancheria?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. Leader, the bill under consideration would authorize \nthe Middle Creek Project. The bill does not expressly authorize the \nUnited States to take land into trust for the Rancheria.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you for that clarification. Madam Chairman, in Senate \nReport 110-58, the committee recommends that, in exchange for the \nexisting reservation lands that would be included in the floodplain, \nthe Secretary of the Interior accept three parcels of land into trust \nfor the benefit of the Rancheria. Would you describe these parcels and \ntheir location in relation to the Rancheria's current reservation \nboundaries?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate the interest of the Senator \nfrom Nevada in the effect of this project on the Rancheria. Since 1981, \nthe Secretary of the Interior has held 37 acres in trust on behalf of \nthe Rancheria. The parcels discussed in the committee report are \ncurrently owned by the Rancheria and are very close to their current \nreservation boundary. Two of the three parcels are along the Clear Lake \nshoreline. The committee believed it was appropriate to compensate the \nRancheria by allowing them to add to their reservation lands that are \napproximately 1 mile away from their current reservation boundary and \nwhich the tribe already owns.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank my friend from California for \ndescribing the lands. While neither the House nor Senate bills would \nauthorize the Secretary to take the transferred lands into trust as \n``restored lands'' for the purpose of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, \nthe report recommends the Secretary do so.\n  I understand the Rancheria can continue to operate its on-reservation \ncasino should this project be implemented, and I do not oppose the \nRancheria's right to do so because these lands are located within its \ntraditional reservation boundary and were taken into trust before the \nenactment of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, thus the casino \nwas opened consistent with the requirements of IGRA. But as you know, I \nhave long opposed off-reservation gaming, and while I understand that \nneither bill would authorize gaming on the transferred parcels, I do \nnot support the committee's recommendation that the Secretary declare \nthese parcels ``restored lands.'' As we know, should the Secretary \ndeclare the parcels as ``restored lands,'' the Rancheria would be \nallowed to conduct gaming on lands deemed outside of its reservation \nboundary and on lands acquired after enactment of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act. I note that report language does not have the same \nlegal status as legislative language.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the California delegation strongly \nsupports the projects included in S. 1248. I hear the majority leader's \nconcerns. Being chair of the committee, I, of course, support the \nlanguage in the committee's recommendation with respect to the land \ntransfer for the Robinson Rancheria, should the bill be enacted. While \nI may disagree with the leader's position as it concerns this \nparticular project, I appreciate his comments and support for the \nlegislation as a whole.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the clarifications and \nexplanations that my friend from California has provided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6124]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/15/senate-section/article/S6124-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today marks the 26th year that peace \nofficers from around the country have gathered in the Nation's Capital \nto participate in the National Peace Officers Memorial Day Service. \nEvery year, Peace Officers Memorial Day offers the people of the United \nStates, in their communities, in their State capitals, and in the \nNation's Capital, the opportunity to honor and reflect on the \nextraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by our police \nforces. I welcome the visiting peace officers and their family members \nwho are gathered in Washington today as we honor their services and \nthose lost this past year.\n  Earlier this month, the Senate passed a resolution marking today \nNational Peace Officers Memorial Day. This is now the 11th year running \nthat I have sponsored this resolution to honor the sacrifice and \ncommitment of those law enforcement officers who give their lives \nserving their communities. Senator Specter, himself a former \nprosecutor, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and now our \nranking member, was the lead Republican sponsor of this bipartisan \nmeasure this year. I thank the majority leader, himself a former police \nofficer, and all Senators for their support in recognizing the \nsacrifices that law enforcement officers make each day for the American \npeople.\n  Currently, more than 900,000 men and women who guard our communities \ndo so at great risk. After the hijacked planes hit the World Trade \nCenter in New York City on September 11, 2001, 72 peace officers died \nwhile trying to ensure that their fellow citizens in those buildings \ngot to safety. That act of terrorism resulted in the highest number of \npeace officers ever killed in a single incident in the history of our \ncountry and is a tragic reminder of how important it is for the \nCongress to provide all of the resources necessary to protect officers \nin the line of duty.\n  Since the first recorded police death in 1792, there have been more \nthan 17,900 law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice. We are fortunate in Vermont that we rank as the State with \nthe fewest officer deaths. With 19 deaths, however, that is, of course, \n19 deaths too many.\n  In 2006, 145 law enforcement officers died while serving in the line \nof duty, below the decade-long average of 165 deaths annually and a \ndrop from 2005 when 156 officers were killed. That is still 145 \nofficers too many. We need to continue our support for better equipment \nand the increased use of bullet-resistant vests, improved training, and \nadvanced emergency medical care. I hope as the 110th Congress moves \nforward that all Senators can work together to ensure that all of our \nlaw enforcement officers and their families have the full support and \nthe resources they need from the Federal Government.\n  I have been working to help make it safer on the beat for our \nofficers. Back in 1998, Senator Campbell and I authored the Bulletproof \nVest Grant Partnership Act, in part a response to the tragic Carl Drega \nshootout on the Vermont-New Hampshire border in which two State \ntroopers who lacked bulletproof vests were killed. Since then, we have \nsuccessfully reauthorized this program three times: In the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, in the State Justice Institute \nReauthorization Act of 2004, and most recently as part of the Violence \nAgainst Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005. It \nis now authorized at $50 million per year through fiscal year 2009 to \nhelp State, tribal, and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests for \nuse by law enforcement officers. Senator Specter and I joined together \nto send a letter to other Senators last week to make sure that the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program is fully funded this year. \nBulletproof vests have saved the lives of thousands of officers and are \na fundamental line of defense that no officer should be without. It is \ncrucial that Congress provide the full funding authorized to the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Program. Hundreds of thousands of police \nofficers and local jurisdictions are counting on us.\n  I am disappointed that not all of Congress's actions to protect and \nhelp our law enforcement officers are implemented by this \nadministration. President Bush has repeatedly proposed drastic cuts to \nthe bulletproof vest initiative and other grant programs that directly \nassist State and local law enforcement. The Bush administration has \nspent more than $400 billion on a failed policy in Iraq, and yet the \nPresident continues to propose cuts in funding for programs here in the \nUnited States for first responders who protect our Nation's \ncommunities.\n  I will mention one other important example of a law I sponsored and \nhelped pass in 2003, the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act. This \nimportant, bipartisan legislation reflects the belief of Congress that \nthe families of firefighters, law enforcement officers, and other first \nresponders should be cared for when a public safety officer dies of a \nheart attack or stroke in the line of duty. To date, the Department of \nJustice has made only two positive determinations from the more than \n230 applications it has received. It is inexcusable that the Department \nof Justice appears to be interpreting this law as narrowly as possible \nand is denying and delaying so many of these claims. Congress and the \nAmerican people want to see fair and equitable treatment for the \nfamilies of the brave individuals who lose their lives in the line of \nduty, not foot-dragging and excuses from the Justice Department.\n  We can all agree that the men and women in law enforcement who have \nsacrificed for our safety deserve our deep gratitude and respect. \nNational Peace Officers Memorial Day recognizes real-life heroes. Our \nNation's law enforcement officers deserve our commitment to provide for \nthose who help keep us all safe.

Mr. Presdient, today, the U.S. Sentencing Commission took \nanother important step in addressing the wide disparity in our Federal \ncocaine sentencing laws.\n  The Commission released its fourth report to Congress in 12 years \nthat, once again, provides a comprehensive review of our cocaine \npolicies, and recommendations about how those policies can be improved. \nAlmost 3 weeks ago, the Commission recommended to Congress a change in \nthe Sentencing Guidelines that would lower the offense level for crack \noffenders across the board. Both of these actions are positive steps, \nbut real progress in this area requires congressional action.\n  Under current law, an offender apprehended with 5 grams of crack \ncocaine faces the same 5 year mandatory minimum sentence as an offender \nwith 500 grams of powder cocaine--that is the same sentence for 100 \ntimes more powder cocaine. In 2000, the average sentence for a crack \ncocaine defendant was nearly 4 years longer than the average sentence \nfor a powder cocaine defendant.\n  Last week, the Commission announced it will issue a guideline change \nthat lowers the offense level for crack offenders by 2 points across \nthe board. As a result, 75 percent of Federal crack offenders will have \ntheir sentences reduced by approximately 16 months. This change \nrepresents a step in the right direction.\n  For far too long, the Federal crack-powder sentencing laws have \ncreated an injustice in our Nation. Over 20 years now, Congress has \nsilently stood by as this policy swelled our prisons, \ndisproportionately impacted African Americans, and misdirected precious \nFederal resources on low-level street dealers rather than on the worst \noffenders--drug kingpins who bring crack into our neighborhoods. Twenty \nyears of irresponsible policy is enough.\n  I hope the Commission's report and recommendations will serve as a \nroadmap for the 110th Congress. Americans\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n\ndeserve a Congress that will make Federal drug laws fair and \nproportional. We can, and should, fix this injustice on a bipartisan \nbasis. It is time to act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/15/senate-section/article/S6125-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE LATE SENATOR THOMAS J. DODD\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Thomas J. Dodd, \nthe former Senator of the great State of Connecticut. As his son, my \nsenior Senator, Chris Dodd, said earlier, Thomas Dodd would have turned \n100 years old today. He was a public servant of the highest order, \nworking in an astounding number of capacities throughout his life. \nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, he became a special agent with \nthe FBI, and eventually became an assistant for five Attorney Generals \nof the United States. In this capacity, Thomas Dodd played a key role \nin establishing the first civil rights division of the Justice \nDepartment.\n  Upon leaving the Justice Department, Senator Dodd became the U.S. \nchief counsel to prosecute Axis crimes at Nuremberg and handled the \nday-to-day strategies for our Nation's prosecution team. In recognition \nof his work, Senator Dodd received a Presidential Citation, the U.S. \nMedal of Freedom, and the Czechoslovakian Order of the White Lion.\n  I admire Senator Dodd for his bravery at Nuremberg. It was not an \neasy job. He spent over a year away from his family, but he did it \nbecause he believed the United States had a responsibility to show the \nworld its resounding dedication to a fair legal process and the \ndelivery of justice to the Nazi war criminals.\n  Senator Dodd's political career began in 1952 when he was elected \nfrom the First District of Connecticut in the House of Representatives. \nHe won election to the Senate in 1958, serving as a leader on the \nForeign Relations Committee throughout his tenure. Senator Dodd \nwholeheartedly opposed Soviet communism, and often stood as a maverick \nwithin the Democratic Party on foreign policy.\n  Thomas Dodd was an inspiration to me. He was a brilliant orator, and \nI would often find my way to see him speak when he would visit the New \nHaven area. He was a man who stood by his principles, oftentimes in the \nface of fierce opposition. Partisanship and politics always took a \nbackseat to doing what was in the best interest of America.\n  Thomas Dodd never refrained from asking the tough questions, and I \napplaud him for his independence and the example he set as a \ndistinguished Senator from my home State of Connecticut, a proud legacy \nof public service, which his son Chris has carried on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/15/senate-section/article/S6125-2", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HONORING MURIEL GIBSON\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Muriel \nGibson for her 19 years of service to the U.S. Senate and the people of \nWashington State. Ms. Gibson has been a caseworker on my staff since I \nwas first elected to the Senate in 1993, and she is leaving at the end \nof this week to continue her public service in another capacity.\n  Ms. Gibson has spent the last 15 years on my staff and 4 years on \nSenator Brock Adams's staff serving Washington State's veterans and \nmembers of the armed services. She has been a tireless advocate for the \nmen and women of our State who served us through military service. As a \ncountry, we promise our servicemembers and their families support in \nexchange for their commitment to protect our Nation. Ms. Gibson has \nmade sure that these promises are kept to these brave men and women.\n  The needs of our veterans and soldiers can often be demanding, and \nMs. Gibson met those demands with compassion and understanding. As the \ndaughter of a career soldier, she knows the challenges facing our \nmilitary families firsthand. Whether assisting a World War II veteran \nto receive his long delayed Purple Heart or ensuring that a returning \nsoldier from Operation Iraqi Freedom gets the medical care needed, Ms. \nGibson saw to it that everyone who approached my office for assistance \nreceived the guidance and attention they deserved.\n  I am also pleased to say that her service to our Nation's veterans \nwill not end when she leaves my office. She will be working toward a \nmaster's degree in social work and hopes to work for the Department of \nVeterans Affairs upon completion of her degree. I am comforted by the \nknowledge that a new generation of veterans will gain from her \nexperience and dedication in the years to come.\n  I would like to thank Ms. Gibson for her years of distinguished \nservice to the Senate, and I wish her happiness in her future \npursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/15/senate-section/article/S6125-3", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/15/senate-section/article/S6125-4", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/15/senate-section/article/S6125-5", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  The following message from the President of the United States was \ntransmitted to the Senate by one of his secretaries:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/15/senate-section/article/S6125-6", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT CERTIFYING THAT THE EXPORT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA OF \n   CERTAIN MATERIALS, INCLUDING AN ISOSTATIC PRESS FOR MANUFACTURING \n  AUTOMOTIVE SPARE PARTS, IS NOT DETRIMENTAL TO THE U.S. SPACE LAUNCH \nINDUSTRY AND THAT THE MATERIAL WILL NOT MEASURABLY IMPROVE THE MISSILE \n OR SPACE LAUNCH CAPABILITIES OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA--PM 13\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the provisions of section 1512 of the Strom \nThurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 \n(Public Law 105-261), I hereby certify that the export to the People's \nRepublic of China of the following items is not detrimental to the U.S. \nspace launch industry, and that the material and equipment, including \nany indirect technical benefit that could be derived from such exports, \nwill not measurably improve the missile or space launch capabilities of \nthe People's Republic of China:\n  A four-axis filament winding machine for production of spare parts \nfor China's water purification and treatment industries;\n  A computer control system upgrade to a three-axis filament winding \nmachine for production of spare parts for China's water purification \nand treatment industries;\n  An isostatic press for manufacturing automotive spare parts; and\n  A four-axis filament winding machine to be used in production of \ngraphite or glass composite golf clubs.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to authorize the Secretary of Education to award grants for the \nsupport of full-service community schools, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I join House Majority \nLeader Steny Hoyer in introducing legislation seeking to strengthen our \nlocal communities through coordinated school-based efforts. The Full-\nService Community Schools Act establishes an important grant program \nsupporting a variety of community services, ranging from early \nchildhood education and family literacy efforts to job training and \nnutrition services. Our schools have long served as the bedrock of \nlocal communities; and in a time when Federal dollars have been used as \nan invasive hand, I believe additional resources should be allocated to \nlocal areas supporting enterprising instruction, public health, job \ntraining and overall community and parental engagement.\n  The Full-Service Community Schools Act will direct the Department of \nEducation to award grants to local educational agencies and one or more \ncommunity-based organizations, nonprofit organizations, or other \npublic/private entities. These full-service community school dollars \nwill improve the coordination, delivery, effectiveness, and efficiency \nof services provided to our children and families. Funds will be \nawarded to those grantees coordinating at least 3 services at a school \nsite, including early childhood programs; literacy and reading programs \nfor youth and families; parenting education activities; community \nservice; job training and career counseling services; nutrition \nservices; primary health and dental care; and preventive mental health \nand treatment services.\n  Priority will be given to grantees demonstrating a record of \neffectiveness and serving at least two schools in which at least 40 \npercent of the children are from low-income families. These targeted \nefforts will support a more efficient use of Federal, State, local, and \nprivate-sector dollars serving the needs of children and families. A \nsynergy of community engagement, parental enthusiasm, and local \nleadership is what America needs to address the growing challenges of \nour time; and I will continue working with my colleagues to ensure such \nefforts have the support of Congress. I encourage Senators to join me \nby cosponsoring the Full-Service Community Schools Act of 2007.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 1393. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nprescribe the binding oath or affirmation of renunciation and \nallegiance required to be naturalized as a citizen of the United \nStates, to encourage and support the efforts of prospective citizens of \nthe United States to become citizens, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senators from both parties are working \nvery hard these days to put together an immigration bill. The majority \nleader is working hard to create an environment in which that can \nhappen, and I appreciate his doing that. It is not easy to do. But it \nis absolutely essential that we have a comprehensive immigration bill.\n  This is not something Members of the Congress can blame on anybody \nelse. It is not the Governors' job, it is not the mayors' job, it is \nnot the county commissioners' job, it is not the Sheriff's job, it is \nour job to decide what our immigration policy should be. It is our job \nto secure the border. It is our job to make certain that those who come \nhere are legally here. It is also our job to make sure that those who \ncome here legally have an opportunity to become Americans, a chance to \nbecome part of our country.\n  We have a motto above our wall that says, ``One from many.'' It \ndoesn't say ``Many from one.'' We are very proud of our magnificent \ndiversity in this country. People come here from virtually every \ncountry in the world. Anyone who has gone to the naturalization \nceremonies can attest, where last year 650,000 new citizens stood in \ncourthouses all across America, raised their right hands and swore \ntheir allegiance to this country--nothing is more moving than that. But \nas much as we prize that diversity, what we prize even more is our \nability to turn all that diversity into one country.\n  Unity is harder than diversity. There are a lot of diverse countries \nin the world, and they are ripped apart by their differences. We have \nbeen fortunate. As other countries struggle with the idea of becoming \nFrench, becoming German, becoming Japanese--it is hard to do. But in \nthis country, if you become a citizen, you have to become an American.\n  How do you do that? You don't do it by your race. In fact, our \nConstitution says that race cannot be used.\n  You don't do it by any other form of ancestry. It doesn't matter \nwhere your grandparents came from. What does matter is that you \nsubscribe to a few principles and that you learn a common language. \nThose are the most basic elements of the unity, this fragile and \nimportant unity that makes us the United States of America instead of \njust another United Nations.\n  In anticipation of the immigration debate next week, I introduce \ntoday, along with Senators Cochran and Cornyn, what we call the \nStrengthening American Citizenship Act. It is an essential part of any \nimmigration bill because it addresses what happens after one lawfully \nbecomes a resident of this country and begins to think about lawfully \nbecoming a citizen.\n  This legislation will help legal immigrants who are prospective \nAmerican citizens learn our common language and learn about our ways of \ngovernment. I introduced this legislation last year, in the 109th \nCongress, when we considered an immigration bill. It had several \ncosponsors and it passed this body 91 to 1. It was an amendment to the \nSenate immigration bill, in April of 2006.\n  I hope the Senate will agree again to make it a part of the bill. It \nmight not make the most headlines, but it will make as much lasting \ndifference in immigration legislation as possible.\n\n[[Page S6130]]\n\n  Here, in brief, is what the legislation would do. First, it would \nhelp prospective citizens learn English and it would do that in two \nways. It would provide education grants of up to $500 for English \ncourses for immigrants who declare their intent to become American \ncitizens. They might use these grants of $500, for example, to go to \nany accredited agency such as ``Fuentes,'' in Los Angeles, a place I \nhappen to know about, which can do, for that amount of money, an \nexcellent job of helping, in that case mostly Spanish-speaking \ncitizens, learn also to speak English. So it is a $500 voucher, in \neffect, to help any lawful person learn English.\n  Second, it will change the citizenship rules to allow those who learn \nto speak English fluently to reduce from 5 to 4 years the amount of \ntime they have to wait to become a citizen. These are two ways we are \ntrying to help people learn English and by doing that value our common \nlanguage.\n  There are other ways to do that. Senator Kennedy and I have talked \nabout the fact that there are lines of people in Boston, his State, and \nNashville, in my State, of adults who want to learn English, but there \nis no room for them in the adult education programs we fund. Perhaps \nwhen we pass the Workforce Investment Act, or other appropriations \nbills, we can find other ways to help people who want to learn English, \nlearn English. But this legislation focuses specifically on prospective \ncitizens who want to learn English by giving them a grant to help them \ndo it and by giving them an incentive to learn the language fluently. \nThey can become a citizen then in 4 years instead of 5.\n  Also, it helps prospective citizens learn more about the American way \nof life. Albert Shanker, the late President of the American Federation \nof Teachers, said the common school was created in America, the public \nschool, to help largely immigrant children learn reading and writing \nand arithmetic and what it means to be an American, with the hope they \nwould go home and teach their parents.\n  The last time we had such a large percentage of foreign-born people \nin our country was in about 1900, the turn of that century. \nOrganizations all over America got busy helping new arrivals learn \nabout our country, learn about our Declaration of Independence, learn \nabout our Constitution and the ideas that were part of it because they \nknew that, since you do not become a citizen based upon your race or \nyour ancestry and you do it upon the idea of America, that someone \nneeded to help these people learn about the idea of America. Many were \nvery eager to do that.\n  The legislation I introduced today would establish a foundation to \nsupport the activities of the Office of Citizenship within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security so that organizations that want to \nsupport and cooperate in efforts to reach out to prospective citizens \ncan do so.\n  It would provide grants to organizations to provide classes in \nAmerican history and civics. We are talking about a lot of prospective \ncitizens--650,000 or so last year. After this immigration bill it may \nbe more, because if you become a citizen, you are going to have to be \nlegally here. So we want to make sure we have plenty of help for these \nwho want to do that.\n  Third, codify the oath of allegiance. One of the most remarkable \noaths, I suppose, in the American language, is the oath of allegiance \nthat the 650,000 new citizens take when they become Americans. It is an \noath that goes all the way back to George Washington's time and Valley \nForge. It was essentially the oath that Washington and his officers \ntook at the beginning of the American revolution. It says that I, \nGeorge Washington, or I, the new citizen, declare that we owe no \nallegiance or obedience--in that case, to King George;\n\n      . . . and that we renounce, refuse and abjure any allegiance \n     or obedience to him and do swear that I will, to the utmost \n     of my power, support, maintain and defend the said United \n     States.\n\n  Essentially, that same oath of allegiance is the oath new citizens \ntake. This elevates that oath of allegiance from a bureaucratic rule to \na part of the law and gives it the same dignity that the Pledge of \nAllegiance has and the national anthem has. Finally, this legislation \nwould celebrate new citizens by focusing on these hundreds of \nceremonies that we have, in which people from all over the world wear \ntheir best clothes, prove that they have good character, that they have \nwaited 5 years, that they have learned English, that they have passed a \ntest about citizenship, and they are ready to say: As proud as I am of \nwhere I came from, I now pledge my allegiance to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  We want to celebrate those events. This instructs the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to develop and implement a strategy to make those \nnaturalization ceremonies more important in the fabric of our everyday \nlife, and establish an award for citizens who have been naturalized in \nthe last 10 years who have made an outstanding contribution to the \nAmerican Nation. We all know in our own experiences that new Americans \nare sometimes the best Americans. They make the largest contribution. \nThey have the best understanding of our country. We want to celebrate \nwhat they have done.\n  This is legislation the Senate adopted before. Senator Cochran, \nSenator Cornyn, and I are introducing it to make sure we adopt it again \nwhen immigration comes up.\n  I also wish to mention that I intend on looking at a comprehensive \neffort toward the same goal, which I like to call the American \ncitizenship agenda; learning English and what it means to becoming an \nAmerican. I have identified several areas, and I may introduce \namendments in many of these areas to the immigration bill.\n  These were not introduced the last time, but they would include \nclarifying the mission of the Office of Citizenship within the U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Service, establishing State citizenship \nadvisory boards in a number of States, coordinating efforts toward \nhelping immigrants learning English, American history, and civics. It \nwould create an employer tax credit for businesses that help their \nemployees learn English. As I mentioned earlier, at the beginning of \nthe 20th century, there were a great many businesses hiring new \nAmericans who spent their money, their time, and their effort to make \nsure those new employees understood what it meant to become Americans.\n  One way to meet this need of a large percentage of foreign-born \npeople in our country is to provide tax incentives to businesses that \nhelp their employees learn English. Another proposal is to require a \ndemonstration of English language proficiency when an individual renews \nhis or her green card; establishing a Presidential award for companies \nthat go above and beyond in bringing their employees together as \nAmericans; finally, asking for a Government Accountability Office study \nto identify the need of lawful permanent residents not speaking English \nand the associated costs; in other words, how many people living in our \ncountry do not speak English and what would be the cost and the most \neffective programs of helping them learn English.\n  That is my purpose today, to introduce the Strengthening American \nCitizenship Act, legislation that passed when we considered the \nimmigration bill in 2006, and which Senators Cochran and Cornyn and I \nhope will be a part of this legislation; then to discuss what I call \nthe Strengthening American Citizenship Agenda, which will be looking \nfor a variety of other ways to help make sure we not only celebrate our \ndiversity but we find ways to celebrate our unity.\n  We can look across the ocean at Europe and see the struggle in Turkey \nright now for that nation's identity. We can see the difficulty France \nand Germany are having as Muslim workers have a hard time integrating \ninto their country. We do not want the United States of America to \nbecome a country where we have enclaves of people who have no loyalty \nto the idea of this Nation. We want to create an environment where \neveryone has an opportunity to think about loyalty to this country, \nwhere almost all have a chance to think about becoming a citizen one \nday, and where every single person who lives here has an opportunity to \nlearn to speak our common language, not just for their benefit but so \nwe do not become a tower of Babel or a United Nations, that we become a \nUnited States of America, as our Founders envisioned.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Levin, and Ms. Snowe):\n\n[[Page S6131]]\n\n  S. 1394. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to \nexclude from gross income of individual taxpayers discharges of \nindebtedness attributable to certain forgiven residential mortgage \nobligations; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, under current law, only two categories \nof individuals pay tax on the sale of their principle residence: the \ntruly fortunate who have realized a capital gain of more than $250,000, \n$500,000 on a joint return, or the truly unfortunate who lose equity in \ntheir home and are forced to pay tax if the lender forgives some \nportion of the mortgage debt. Surely this is an anomalous result.\n  Nevertheless, newspaper and television reports describe the burdens \nfamilies all over the country are facing as lenders foreclose on \nborrowers who cannot make their mortgage payments. In more and more \ncircumstances, these borrowers, often minorities and the elderly, are \nunable to make the escalating payments associated with subprime loans \nand some complex adjustable rate mortgage products.\n  Other media reports focus on the challenges sellers face if they live \nin areas with declining home values. There are instances where the \nvalue of housing in a whole market occasionally falls through no fault \nof the homeowner. A plant closes, environmental degradations are found \nnearby, a regional economic slump hits hard. This happened during the \n1980s in the oil patch and in southern California and New England at \nthe beginning of the 90s.\n  This is happening right now in Michigan with the depressed automotive \nindustry. The Detroit metropolitan area had the highest percentage of \nhouseholds in foreclosure in the 150 largest metropolitan areas, with \nan average of more than 10,000 foreclosures in each quarter. The \nforeclosures affected 1 out of every 21 households, nearly five times \nthe national average. Over the first quarter of 2007, Michigan had over \n29,000 foreclosures and Detroit was on pace to record 11,000 for that \nsame time period.\n  One thing these news reports do not mention is the tax problem that \nsellers or those in foreclosure will face if lenders forgive and do not \nrequire payment on some or all of a mortgage debt at the time of \ndisposition. What happens to these people who must sell their homes \nduring a downturn or who cannot make their payments and go into \nforeclosure? They must pay taxes on the amount forgiven; it is treated \nas income.\n  Below are two hypothetical scenarios where owners must have to pay \ntaxes on the amount forgiven and those estimated taxes. The first \nexample is a situation where there has been a downturn in the housing \nmarket. The second example is where a family, possibly because of loss \nof job, illness, or decrease in income or significant changes in the \nmortgage rate, can neither refinance the property nor sustain the \npayments and the lender forecloses on the property.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Decrease in home prices or ``short sale''\nMortgage...................................................     $100,000\nMarket Value at Purchase...................................      100,000\nMarket Value at Sale.......................................       90,000\nSale Price.................................................       90,000\nDebt Remaining After Sale..................................       10,000\nTaxes Due if forgiven by the lender @ 15 percent tax rate..        1,500\n                     Lender forecloses\nMortgage...................................................     $100,000\nForeclosure Amount.........................................       80,000\nDebt Remaining After Foreclosure...........................       20,000\nTaxes Due if forgiven by the lender @ 15 percent tax rate..        3,000\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  In the ``short sale'' transaction, if the lender forgives the $10,000 \nof outstanding debt, the family will have taxable income of $10,000 on \nthe transaction and owe $1,500, even though they have just sustained an \neconomic loss and no cash gain.\n  In a second scenario, if the foreclosure sale does not cover the \namount of outstanding debt on the property or $20,000, the lender might \nforgive remaining debt. Again, the borrower is treated as having \nreceived ``income'' when the debt is forgiven and in the example, would \nowe $3,000 in taxes on the $20,000 that was forgiven.\n  Clearly it is unfair to tax people on phantom income, particularly \nright at the time they have had a serious economic loss and have no \ncash with which to pay the tax. My bill, the Mortgage Relief Act, will \nrelieve families of a tax burden when their lender forgives part of the \nmortgage on a principal residence.\n  None of us wants to learn that families in our own districts will be \nforced to pay taxes when they have no money and have incurred a \nsubstantial loss on what, for most, is the most significant asset they \nown, and possibly the only asset they have. While my legislation will \nnot repair their credit or punish those who mislead them into \ninappropriate loans, it will prevent them from further financial harm.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is becoming more difficult for a middle \nclass family to purchase a home. Last week the Senate Finance Committee \nheld a hearing on middle class economic issues. We learned from the \nwitnesses that families are struggling because their fixed costs are \ngreater and one of these fixed costs is housing. Professor Elizabeth \nWarren testified that houses purchased now are only slightly larger \nthan those purchased in the 1970's, but the median mortgage payment is \n76 percent larger than a generation ago.\n  Today, there are serious problems in our mortgage lending market \nwhich need to be addressed. Too many families are unable to make the \nmonthly mortgage payments on their homes. Foreclosure rates are \nincreasing. Some homeowners who are facing foreclosure have received \nwhat are known as ``subprime'' loans which allow an adjustable rate of \nmortgage interest or a break on payments during the first years of the \nmortgage. The ``subprime'' lending market has been an important tool to \nallow people with poor credit histories to obtain access to credit \nincluding mortgages. However, in recent years some lenders have used \nthese ``subprime'' mortgage loans to put homeowners into mortgage \nproducts with high interest rates that increase after a short period of \ntime. Additionally, some homeowners have opted to buy homes they could \nnot afford by using the ``subprime'' loan market. In either case, too \nmany homeowners have been unable to keep up with the changes in their \nmortgage payments and have been forced into foreclosure.\n  Last year, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had a record 19,487 \nforeclosure filings. One of every 92 U.S. households faced foreclosure \nand there are expected to be more disclosures in 2007. Published \nreports show that Massachusetts has had approximately 10,000 \nforeclosures filings already this year. Monthly payments on millions of \nloans are expected to increase dramatically as low introductory \ninterest rates balloon as much as 50 percent. The Nonprofit Center for \nResponsible Lending predicts that one in five subprime mortgages done \nin the past 2 years will end up in foreclosure.\n  Today, Senators Stabenow, Voinovich and I are introducing the \nMortgage Relief Cancellation Act of 2007. This legislation will help \nfamilies who are faced with mortgages that they are unable to pay. \nFortunately, some lenders are willing to modify loans and forgive some \ndebt, but the borrower is required to pay income tax on the cancelled \ndebt.\n  Under present law, the discharged debt is treated as income. Some \nhomeowners are learning about this rule the hard way and find \nthemselves owing a large tax bill on debt that was forgiven. The \nMortgage Relief Cancellation Act of 2007 would exclude from income the \ndebt that is forgiven for certain mortgage loans.\n  An example of this is a situation in which a homeowner sells their \nhouse to prevent disclosure and the proceeds do not cover the full \nmortgage obligation. The lender agrees to forgive the difference. Under \nthe Mortgage Relief Cancellation Act of 2007, the amount forgiven would \nnot be included in taxable income. This legislation also addresses \nforgiveness of debt as part of a restructuring arrangement.\n  I urge you to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mrs. McCaskill):\n  S. 1395. A bill to prevent unfair practices in credit card accounts, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, along with Senator \nMcCaskill, the Stop Unfair Practices in Credit Cards Act.\n  Credit cards are a fixture of American family life today. People use \nthem to buy groceries, to rent a car, shop on the Internet, pay college \ntuition, and even pay their taxes. In 2005, the average family had five \ncredit cards. American households used nearly 700 million\n\n[[Page S6132]]\n\ncredit cards to buy goods and services worth $1.8 trillion. Credit \ncards fuel commerce, facilitate financial planning, help families deal \nwith emergencies. But credit cards have also contributed to record \namounts of household debt. Some credit card issuers have socked \nfamilies with sky-high interest rates of 25 and 30 percent and higher. \nThey have hit consumers with hefty fees for late payments, for \nexceeding a credit card limit, and other transactions. In too many \ncases, credit card issuers have made it all but impossible for working-\nclass families to climb out of debt.\n  That is why in 2005, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \nwhich I chaired, on which Senator McCaskill serves, initiated an in-\ndepth investigation into unfair and abusive credit card industry \npractices.\n  In the fall of 2006, the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, \nreleased a report which I had requested, which for the first time in \nyears provided a comprehensive examination of the interest rates and \nfees being charged by credit card companies. Following the release of \nthat report, and continuing through today, the subcommittee has been \ndeluged with calls and letters from Americans expressing anger and \nfrustration at the way they have been treated by their credit card \ncompanies, and sharing stories of unfair and often abusive practices. \nThe subcommittee has been examining those allegations of unfair \ntreatment and has identified many troubling credit card industry \npractices which should be banned or restricted.\n  Our first hearing in March focused on industry practices involving \ngrace periods, interest rates, and fees. It revealed a number of \nunfair, often little-known, and sometimes abusive credit card \npractices, which prey upon families experiencing financial hardships, \nand squeezed even consumers who pay their credit card bills on time.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is aimed at stopping abusive \ncredit card practices that trap too many hard-working families in a \ndownward spiral of debt. American families deserve to be treated \nhonestly and fairly by their credit card companies. Our bill would help \nensure that fair treatment. Here are a few things our bill would do. It \nwould stop credit card companies from charging interest on debt that is \npaid on time. It would crack down on abusive fees, including repeated \nlate fees and over-the-limit fees, and fees to pay your bill.\n  It would also prohibit the charging of interest on those fees. It \nwould establish guidelines on interest rate increases, including a cap \non penalty interest rate hikes at no more than 7 percent. It would \nrequire that increased interest rates apply only to future credit card \ndebt and not the debt already incurred.\n  Our bill will be referred to the Senate Banking Committee, which has \nprimary jurisdiction over credit card legislation, and which has been \nholding its own hearing on unfair credit card practices. Our friend, \nSenator Dodd, the committee chairman, has a long history of fighting \ncredit card abuses. Senator Shelby, the ranking Republican, as well as \nmany other members of the committee, has also expressed concern about a \nnumber of credit card problems.\n  It is my hope our bill and the legislative record being compiled by \nour Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will help the Banking \nCommittee in its deliberations and help build momentum to enact \nlegislation halting the unfair credit card practices that outrage \nAmerican consumers. Credit card abuse is too harmful to American \nfamilies, our economy, and our economic future to let these unfair \npractices continue.\n  Let me describe the key provisions of our bill in more detail. The \nfirst section of the bill would put an end to an indefensible practice \nthat imposes little known and unfair interest charges on many \nunsuspecting, responsible consumers. Most credit cards today offer what \nis called a grace period. Cardholders are told that, if they pay their \nmonthly credit card bill during this grace period, they will not be \ncharged interest on the debt for which they are being billed. What many \ncardholders do not realize, however, is that this grace period \ntypically provides protection against interest charges only if their \nmonthly credit card bill is paid in full. If the cardholder pays less \nthan 100 percent of the monthly bill--even if the cardholder pays on \ntime--he or she will be charged interest on the entire billed amount, \nincluding the portion that was paid by the specified due date.\n  An example shows why this billing practice is unfair and should be \nstopped. Suppose a consumer who usually pays his or her credit card \naccount in full and owes no money as of December 1 makes a lot of \npurchases in December. The consumer gets a credit card bill on January \n1 for $5,020, due January 15. Suppose the consumer pays that bill on \ntime, but pays $5,000 instead of the full amount owed.\n  Most people assume that the next bill would be for the $20 in unpaid \ndebt, plus interest on that $20. But that commonsense assumption is \nwrong. That is because current industry practice is to charge the \nconsumer interest not only on the $20 that wasn't paid on time, but \nalso on the $5,000 that was paid on time. Let me say that again. \nIndustry practice is to force the consumer to pay interest on the \nportion of the debt that was paid on time. In other words, the consumer \nwould pay interest on the entire $5,020 from the first day of the \nbilling month, January 1, until the day the $5,000 payment was made on \nJanuary 15, compounded daily. So much for a grace period. After that, \nthe consumer would be charged interest on the $20 past due, compounded \ndaily, from January 15 to the end of the month.\n  The end result would be a February 1 bill that more than doubles the \n$20 debt. Using an interest rate of 17.99 percent, for example, in just \none month, the $20 debt would rack up interest charges of more than \n$35.\n  Charging $35 of interest over one month on a $20 credit card debt is \nindefensible, especially when applied to a consumer who paid over 90 \npercent of their credit card debt on time during the grace period. Our \nlegislation would end this unfair billing practice by amending the \nTruth in Lending Act to prohibit the charging of interest on any \nportion of a credit card debt that is paid on time during a grace \nperiod. Using our example, this prohibition would bar the charging of \ninterest on the $5,000 that was paid on time, and result in a February \nbalance that reflects what a rational consumer would have expected: the \n$20 past due, plus interest on the $20 from January 1 to January 31.\n  The second section of our bill would address a related unfair billing \npractice, which I call ``trailing interest.'' Charging trailing \ninterest on credit card debt is another widespread, but little known \nindustry practice that squeezes responsible and largely unsuspecting \nconsumers for still more interest charges.\n  Going back to our example, you might think that once the consumer \ngets gouged in February by receiving a bill for $55 on a $20 debt, and \npays that bill on time and in full, without making any new purchase, \nthat would be the end of that credit card debt for the consumer. But \nyou would be wrong. It would not be the end.\n  Even if, on February 15, the consumer paid the February 1 bill in \nfull and on time--all $55--the next bill would likely have an \nadditional interest charge related to the $20 debt. In this case, the \ncharge would reflect interest that would have accumulated on the $55 \nfrom February 1 to 15, which is the time from when the bill was sent to \nthe day it was paid. The total interest charge in our example would be \nabout 38 cents. While some credit card issuers will waive trailing \ninterest if the next month's bill is less than $1, a common industry \npractice is to fold the 38 cents into the next bill if a consumer makes \na new purchase.\n  Now 38 cents isn't much in the grand scheme of things. That may be \nwhy many consumers don't notice this extra interest charge or bother to \nfight it. Even if someone had questions about the amount of interest on \na bill, most consumers would be hard pressed to understand how the \namount was calculated, much less whether it was correct. But by nickel \nand diming tens of millions of consumer accounts with trailing interest \ncharges, credit card issuers reap large profits.\n  This little known billing practice, which squeezes consumers for a \nfew more cents on the dollar, and targets responsible cardholders who \npay their bills on time and in full, goes too far.\n\n[[Page S6133]]\n\nIf a consumer pays a credit card bill on time and in full--paying 100 \npercent of the amount specified by the date specified in the billing \nstatement--it is unfair to charge that consumer still more interest on \nthe debt that was just paid. Our legislation would put an end to \ntrailing interest by prohibiting credit card issuers from adding \ninterest charges to a credit card debt which the consumer paid on time \nand in full in response to a billing statement.\n  A third problem examined by the subcommittee involves a widespread \nindustry practice in which credit card issuers claim the right to \nunilaterally change the terms of a credit card agreement at any time \nfor any reason with only a 15-day notice to the consumer under the \nTruth in Lending Act.\n  As the National Consumer Law Center testified at our hearing, this \npractice means that smart shoppers who choose a credit card after \ncomparing a variety of card options are continually vulnerable to a \nchange-in-terms notice that alters the favorable terms they selected, \nand provides them with only 15 days to accept the changes or find an \nalternative. By asserting the right to make unilateral changes to \ncredit card terms on short notice, credit card issuers undermine not \nonly the bargaining power of individual consumers, but also principles \nof fair market competition. Such unilateral changes are particularly \nunfair when they alter material terms in a credit card agreement such \nas the interest rate applicable to extensions of credit.\n  That is why our bill would impose two types of limits on credit card \ninterest rate hikes. First, for consumers who comply with the terms of \ntheir credit card agreements, the bill would prohibit a credit card \nissuer from unilaterally hiking an interest rate that was represented \nto, and included in the disclosures provided, to a consumer under the \nTruth in Lending Act, unless the consumer affirmatively agreed in \nwriting to the increase at the time it is proposed. This prohibition is \nintended to protect responsible consumers who play by the rules from a \nsudden hike in their interest rate for no apparent reason--a complaint \nthat the subcommittee has heard all too often. Under our bill, issuers \nwould no longer be able to unilaterally hike the interest rates of \ncardholders who play by the rules.\n\n  The bill's second limit would apply to consumers who, for whatever \nreason, failed to comply with the terms of their credit card agreement, \nperhaps by paying late or exceeding the credit limit. In that \ncircumstance, credit card issuers would be permitted to impose a \npenalty interest rate on the account, but the bill would place a cap on \nhow high that penalty interest rate could go.\n  Specifically, the bill would limit any such penalty rate hike to no \nmore than a 7 percent increase above the interest rate in effect before \nthe penalty rate was imposed. That means a 10 percent rate could rise \nno higher than 17 percent, and a 15 percent rate could not exceed 22 \npercent. This type of interest rate limit is comparable to the caps \nthat today operate in many adjustable mortgages. The effect of the \ncredit card cap would be to prohibit penalty interest rates from \ndramatically increasing the interest rate imposed on the cardholder, as \nhappened in cases examined by the subcommittee where credit card \ninterest rates jumped from 10 percent or 15 percent to as much as 32 \npercent. Penalty interest rate hikes that double or triple existing \ninterest rates are simply unreasonable and unfair.\n  If a credit card account were opened with a low introductory interest \nrate followed by a higher interest rate after a specified period of \ntime, it is intended that the penalty rate cap proposed in the bill \nwould apply to each of those disclosed rates individually. For example, \nsuppose the credit card account had a 0 percent introductory rate for 6 \nmonths and a 12 percent rate after that. Suppose further that, during \nthe 6-month introductory period, the cardholder exceeded the credit \nlimit. The bill would allow the card issuer to impose a penalty \ninterest rate of up to 7 percent for the rest of the 6 month period. \nOnce the 6-month period ended, it is intended that the 12 percent rate \nwould take effect. If the consumer were to again exceed the limit, it \nis intended that any penalty rate imposed upon the account be no \ngreater than 19 percent.\n  If a card issuer were to analyze an account and conclude that a \npenalty rate increase of up to 7 percent would be insufficient to \nprotect against the risk of default on the account, the issuer could \nchoose to reduce the credit limit on the account or cancel the account \naltogether. If the card issuer chose to cancel the account, it is \nintended that the consumer would retain the right to pay off any debt \non the account using the interest rate that was in effect when the debt \nwas incurred.\n  The point of the bill's penalty interest rate cap is to stop penalty \ninterest rate hikes which are disproportional; which too often stick \nfamilies with sky-high interest rates of 25 percent, 30 percent, and \neven 32 percent; and which too often make it virtually impossible for \nworking American families to climb out of debt.\n  Still another troubling practice involving credit card interest rate \nhikes is the problem of retroactive application. Industry practice \ntoday is to apply an increased interest rate not only to new debt \nincurred by the cardholder, but also to previously incurred debt.\n  Retroactive application of a higher interest rate means that pre-\nexisting credit card debt suddenly costs a consumer much more to repay. \nTake, for example, a $3,000 credit card debt that a consumer was paying \ndown each month with timely payments. Suddenly, the cardholder falls \nill, misses a payment or pays it late, and the card issuer increases \nthe interest rate from 15 percent to 22 percent. If applied to the \nexisting $3,000 debt, that higher rate would require the cardholder to \nmake a much steeper minimum monthly payment and pay much more interest \nthan originally planned. That is often enough to sink a working family \ninto a deepening spiral of debt from which they cannot recover.\n  By making it a common practice to institute after-the-fact interest \nrate hikes for existing credit card debt--in effect unilaterally \nchanging the terms of an existing loan--the credit card industry has \nunfairly positioned itself to reap greater profits at consumers' \nexpense. Our bill would fight back by limiting the retroactive \napplication of interest rate hikes to lessen the financial impact on \nAmerican households. Specifically, our bill would provide that interest \nrate hikes could be applied only to future credit card debt and not to \nany credit card debt incurred prior to the rate increase. Instead, any \nearlier debt would continue to accrue interest at the rate previously \nin effect.\n  The first set of provisions in our bill addresses unfair practices \nrelated to interest rates. The next set of provisions targets unfair \npractices related to fees imposed on cardholders by credit card \ncompanies.\n  The need for proconsumer fee protections is illustrated by the story \nof Wes Wannemacher of Ohio, a witness featured at the subcommittee's \nMarch hearing. In 2001 and 2002, Mr. Wannemacher charged about $3,200 \non a new Chase credit card to pay for expenses mostly related to his \nwedding. Over the next 6 years, he paid about $6,300 toward that debt, \nyet in February 2007, Chase said that he still owed them about $4,400.\n  How could Mr. Wannemacher pay nearly double his original credit card \ndebt and still owe $4,400? As he explained in his testimony, in \naddition to repaying the original debt of $3,200, Mr. Wannemacher was \nsocked with $4,900 in interest charges, $1,100 in late fees, and 47 \nover-limit fees totaling $1,500, despite going over his $3,000 credit \nlimit by a total of $200. These facts show that Mr. Wannemacher paid \n$2,600 in fees on a $3,200 debt. In addition, those fees were added to \nhis outstanding credit card balance, and he was charged interest on the \nfee amounts, increasing his debt by hundreds if not thousands of \nadditional dollars. There is something so wrong with this picture, that \nChase didn't even defend its treatment of the account at the \nsubcommittee hearing; instead, Chase forgave the $4,400 debt that it \nsaid was still owing on the Wannemacher credit card.\n  It is no secret that credit card companies are making a great deal of \nmoney off the fees they are imposing on consumers. According to GAO, \nfee income now produces about 10 percent of all income obtained by \ncredit card issuers. The GAO report which I commissioned on this \nsubject identified a\n\n[[Page S6134]]\n\nhost of different fees that have become common practice, including fees \nfor transferring balances, making a late payment, exceeding a credit \nlimit, paying a bill by telephone, and exchanging foreign currency. \nAccording to GAO, late fees now average $34 per month and over-limit \nfees average $31 per month, with some of these fees climbing as high as \n$39 per month. As Mr. Wannemacher discovered, these hefty fees are not \nonly added to the credit card's outstanding balance, they also incur \ninterest. The higher the fees climb, the higher the balances owed, and \nthe higher the interest charges on top of that.\n\n  Charging interest on money borrowed is certainly justified, but \nsqueezing additional dollars from consumers by charging interest on \ntransaction fees goes too far. Steep fees already deepen household debt \nfrom credit cards; those fees should not also generate interest income \nfor the credit card issuer. Our bill would ban this industrywide \npractice by prohibiting credit card issuers from charging or collecting \ninterest on the fees imposed on consumers.\n  Mr. Wannemacher exceeded the $3,000 limit on his credit card on three \noccasions in 2001 and 2002 for a total of $200. Over the following 6 \nyears, however, he was charged over-the-limit fees on 47 occasions \ntotaling about $1,500. In other words, Chase tried to collect over-the-\nlimit fees from Mr. Wannemacher that were seven times larger than the \namount he went over the limit.\n  At our March hearing, Chase did not attempt to defend the 47 over-\nthe-limit fees it imposed; instead, it announced that it was changing \nits policy and would join with others in the industry in imposing no \nmore than three over-the-limit fees in a row on a credit card account \nwith an outstanding balance that exceeded the credit limit. While \nChase's voluntary change in policy is welcome, it doesn't go far enough \nin curbing abusive practices related to over-the-limit fees.\n  First, if a credit card issuer approves the extension of credit that \nallows the cardholder to exceed the account's established credit limit, \nthe issuer should be allowed to impose only one over-the-limit fee for \nthat credit extension. One fee for one violation--especially when the \ncard issuer facilitated the violation by approving the excess credit \ncharge.\n  Second, the fee should be imposed only if the account balance is over \nthe credit limit at the end of the billing cycle. If a cardholder \nexceeds the limit in the middle of the billing cycle and then takes \nprompt action to reduce the balance below the limit, perhaps by making \na payment or obtaining a credit for returning a purchase, there is no \ninjury to the creditor and no justification for an over-the-limit fee.\n  Third, a credit card issuer should impose an over-the-limit fee only \nwhen an action taken by the cardholder causes the credit limit to be \nexceeded, and not when a penalty imposed by the card issuer causes the \nexcess charge. The card issuer should not be able to pile penalty upon \npenalty, such as by assessing a late fee on an account and then, if the \nlate fee pushes the credit card balance over the credit limit, also \nimposing an over-the-limit fee.\n  In addition, the bill would require credit card issuers to offer \nconsumers the option of establishing a true credit limit on their \naccount--a credit limit that could not be exceeded, because the account \nwould be programmed to refuse approval of any extension of credit over \nthe established limit. In too many cases, credit card issuers no longer \nprovide consumers with the option of having a fixed credit limit, \npreferring instead to enable all of their cardholders to exceed their \ncredit limits only to be penalized by a hefty fee, added interest, and, \npossibly, a penalty interest rate.\n  There is more. Another unfair but common fee is what I call the \n``pay-to-pay fee.'' It is the $5 to $15 fee that many issuers charge \nconsumers to pay their credit card bill on time by using the telephone. \nTo me, charging folks a fee to pay their bills is a travesty. My bill \nwould prohibit a credit card issuer from charging a separate fee to \nallow a credit cardholder to pay all or part of a credit card balance.\n  Another fee that has raised eyebrows is the one charged by credit \ncard issuers to exchange dollars into or from a foreign currency. A \nnumber of issuers today charge an amount equal to 2 percent of the \namount of currency being exchanged in addition to a 1-percent \n``conversion fee'' charged by Visa or Master Card, for a total of 3 \npercent Our bill responds by requiring foreign currency exchange fees \nto reasonably reflect the actual costs incurred by the creditor to \nperform the currency exchange, and requiring regulators to ensure \ncompliance with that standard.\n  In addition to unfair practices involving interest rates and fees, \nthe subcommittee investigation uncovered several unfair industry \npractices involving how credit cardholder payments are applied to \nsatisfy finance charges and other credit card debt. One such practice \nthat has caught the subcommittee's attention is the industrywide \npractice of applying consumer payments first to the balances with the \nlowest interest rates.\n  Right now, a single credit card account often carries balances \nsubject to multiple interest rates. Credit cards typically use one \ninterest rate for purchases, another for cash advances, and a third for \nbalance transfers. Many card issuers also offer new customers low \nintroductory interest rates, such as 0 or 1 percent, but limit these \n``come on'' rates to a short time period or to a balance transferred \nfrom another card. Moreover, many of these interest rates may vary over \ntime, since it is a common practice to offer variable interest rates \nthat rise and fall according to a specified rate or index.\n  When a consumer payment is made, credit card issuers currently have \ncomplete discretion on how to apply that payment to the various \nbalances bearing different interest rates. Consumers are typically \ngiven no option to direct where their payments are applied. Today, \nvirtually all credit card issuers apply a consumer payment first to the \nbalance with the lowest interest rate. After that balance is paid off, \ncard issuers apply the payment to the balance with the next lowest \ninterest rate, and so on.\n  This payment practice clearly favors creditors over consumers. It \nallows the card issuers to direct payments first to the balances that \nprovide them with the lowest returns, and minimize payments to the \nbalances bearing the highest interest rates so those balances can \naccumulate more interest for a longer period. Consumers who want to pay \noff a cash advance bearing a 20 percent interest rate, for example, are \ntold that they cannot make that payment until they first pay off all \nother balances with a lower interest rate.\n  Our bill would replace this unfair industrywide practice with a \nproconsumer approach. Reversing current industry practice, the bill \nwould require cardholder payments to be applied first to the balance \nbearing the highest interest rate, and then to each successive balance \nbearing the next highest rate, until the payment is used up. The bill \nwould also require credit card issuers to apply cardholder payments in \nthe most effective way to minimize the imposition of any fees or \ninterest charges to the account.\n  In addition, the bill would prohibit credit card issuers from \nimposing late fees on consumers if the issuer was itself responsible \nfor the delay in crediting the payment. For example, if a card issuer \nchanged the mailing address for payments, had to shut down its mail \nsorting equipment for repairs, or mistakenly routed a consumer payment \nto the wrong department, the issuer would not be allowed to assess a \nlate fee on the cardholder for the resulting late payment. Instead, if \nthe card issuer caused the late payment, it would be barred from \nassessing a late fee on the consumer.\n  In addition to provisions to improve practices related to interest \nrates, fees, and consumer payments, the bill would add two new \ndefinitions to the Truth in Lending Act, intended to further address \nconcerns related to unfair credit card practices.\n  The first definition involves use of the term, ``prime rate.'' Many \ncredit card issuers today use variable interest rates that are linked \nto the ``prime rate'' or ``prime interest rate'' and vary over time. \nFor example, a disclosure may indicate that a credit card will bear an \ninterest rate equal to the prime rate plus a specified number of \npercentage points. Since the 1950s, the term ``prime rate'' has been \ncommonly understood to mean the lowest interest rate offered by U.S. \nbanks to their\n\n[[Page S6135]]\n\nmost creditworthy borrowers. That is how the term is defined, for \nexample, in Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.\n  The problem, however, is that no current statute or regulation \ndefines the prime rate referenced in credit card disclosures under the \nTruth in Lending Act, and some card issuers have stated expressly that \nthe prime rate used in credit card agreements does not necessarily \nmatch the lowest interest rates they provide to their most creditworthy \nborrowers. Litigation has also arisen between cardholders and card \nissuers as to what is meant by the term and whether cardholders are \nbeing misled. A cite is Lum v. Bank of America, 361 F.3d 217 (3d Cir. \n2004).\n  To remedy this gap in the law, the bill would require credit card \ndisclosures under the Truth in Lending Act that reference the prime \nrate to use the bank prime loan rate published by the Federal Reserve \nBoard. This published rate is widely accepted in the financial \ncommunity as an accurate depiction of the lowest interest rate offered \nby U.S. banks to their most creditworthy borrowers, and the rate is \nreadily available to the public on the Federal Reserve Web site. By \nmandating use of this published rate, the bill will ensure that \nconsumers are not deceived by a credit card issuer using a misleading \ndefinition of the commonly used term ``prime rate.''\n  The second definition added by the bill to the Truth in Lending Act \ninvolves specifying the ``primary federal regulator'' of a credit card \nissuer. Today, many credit card issuers are federally chartered or \nregulated banks subject to one or more Federal bank regulators. The \nbill would make it clear that when a card issuer is a Federal bank, its \nprimary Federal regulator is the same primary regulator assigned to the \nbank under Federal banking law. The provision would also make it clear \nthat the primary Federal regulator is responsible for overseeing the \nbank's credit card operations, ensuring compliance with credit card \nstatutes and regulations, and enforcing the prohibition against unfair \nor deceptive acts or practices in the Federal Trade Commission Act. \nAnother provision in the bill would make it clear that Federal \nregulators are expected to conduct at least annual audits to ensure \ncard issuer compliance with the statutes and regulations seeking to \nensure fair and effective credit card operations.\n  The next section of the bill would improve current credit card data \ncollection efforts. Right now, credit card issuers file periodic \nreports with the Federal Reserve providing information about credit \ncard interest rates and profits. This data plays a critical role in \ncredit card oversight efforts, as well as financial and economic \nanalyses related to consumer spending and household debt. The bill \nwould strengthen current data collection efforts by requiring more \nspecific information on interest rates and fees. For example, current \ndata reports cannot be used to determine how many credit card accounts \nhave interest rates of 25 percent or greater, what types of fees are \nimposed on consumers, or how many cardholders are affected by such \ninterest rates and fees. The new bill would ensure that regulators, \ncredit card users, and the public have the information needed to answer \nthose basic questions.\n  The bill would also require the development of credit card \nindustrywide estimates of the approximate relative income derived from \ninterest rates, fees imposed on cardholders, fees imposed on merchants, \nand any other material source of income. GAO provided this information \nfor the first time in its 2006 report, estimating that the credit card \nindustry now derives about 70 percent of its income from interest \ncharges, 20 percent from interchange fees imposed on merchants, and 10 \npercent from fees imposed on consumers. This valuable information \nshould continue to be collected so that regulators, credit card users, \nand the public gain a more informed understanding of the credit card \nindustry.\n  The bill's data collection requirements are largely modeled upon and \nintended to replicate key interest rate, fee, and revenue data \npresented by GAO in its 2006 report, ``Credit Cards: Increased \nComplexity in Rates and Fees Heightens Need for More Effective \nDisclosures to Consumers.'' Credit card experts were also consulted to \ndetermine what information would be most helpful to strengthen credit \ncard oversight.\n  The final provision in the bill would provide a 6-month transition \nperiod for credit card issuers to implement the bill's provisions.\n  Credit card issuers like to say that they are engaged in a risky \nbusiness, lending unsecured debt to millions of consumers, and that's \nwhy they have to set interest rates so high and impose so many fees. \nBut the data shows that, typically, 95 to 97 percent of U.S. \ncardholders pay their bills. And it is clear that credit card \noperations are enormously profitable. For the last decade, credit card \nissuers have reported year after year of solid profits, maintained \ntheir position as the most profitable sector in the consumer lending \nfield, and reported consistently higher rates of return than commercial \nbanks. Credit card issuers make such a hefty profit that they sent out \n8 billion pieces of mail last year soliciting people to sign up.\n  With profits like those, credit card issuers can afford to stop \ntreating American families unfairly. They can give up charging interest \non debt that was paid on time, give up charging consumers a fee to pay \ntheir bills, give up hiking interest rates from 15 percent to 32 \npercent, and give up imposing repeated over-the-limit fees for a single \nover-the-limit purchase. As one Michigan businessman expressed it to \nthe subcommittee, ``I don't blame the credit card issuers for putting \nme into debt, but I do blame them for keeping me there.''\n  Some argue that Congress doesn't need to ban unfair credit card \npractices; they contend that improved disclosure alone will empower \nconsumers to seek out better deals. Sunlight can be a powerful \ndisinfectant, which is why I have strongly urged the Federal Reserve \nBoard to expedite its regulatory effort to strengthen credit card \ndisclosure and help consumers understand and compare how various credit \ncards work. But credit cards have become such complex financial \nproducts that even improved disclosure will frequently not be enough to \ncurb the abuses--first because some practices are so complex that \nconsumers can't easily understand them, and second because better \ndisclosure does not always lead to greater market competition, \nespecially when virtually an entire industry is using and benefiting \nfrom practices that disadvantage consumers.\n  So when we find credit card practices that are inherently unfair, \nconsumers are often best served, not by greater disclosure, but by \nstopping the unfair practices that take advantage of them. Among those \npractices identified in this bill are unfair interest charges that \nsqueeze consumers who pay their credit card debt on time; unilateral \nand retroactive interest rate hikes that deepen and prolong credit card \ndebt; unreasonable fees; and payment allocation practices that prevent \nconsumers from paying off the credit card debts bearing the highest \ninterest rates first.\n  Congress needs to enact proconsumer legislation that puts an end to \nunfair credit card practices. I am afraid that these practices are too \nentrenched, too profitable to the credit card companies, and too immune \nto consumer pressure for the companies to change them on their own. Our \nbill offers measures that would combat a host of unfair practices that \nplague consumers and unfairly deepen and prolong their debt. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to address these problems.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the research and prevention activities of \nthe National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, \nand the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with respect to \ninflammatory bowel disease; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nfocused on a devastating condition known as inflammatory bowel disease, \nIBD.\n  Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, collectively known as \ninflammatory bowel disease, IBD, are chronic disorders of the \ngastrointestinal tract which afflict approximately 1.4 million \nAmericans, 30 percent of whom are diagnosed in their childhood years. \nIBD can cause severe abdominal pain, fever, and intestinal bleeding. \nComplications related to the disease include; arthritis, osteoporosis, \nanemia, liver disease, growth and developmental challenges, and \ncolorectal cancer. Inflammatory bowel disease represents a major cause \nof morbidity from digestive illness and has a devastating impact on \npatients and families.\n  In the 108th Congress, I sponsored bipartisan legislation focused on \nIBD. Several important provisions of that bill were incorporated into \nlegislation known as the Research Review Act which was enacted in 2005.\n  The legislation I am introducing today builds on the progress made in \n2005 by calling for an increased Federal investment in biomedical \nresearch on IBD. The hope for a better quality of life for patients and \nfamilies depends on basic and clinical research sponsored by the \nNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, \nNIDDK, at the National Institutes of Health. The Inflammatory Bowel \nDisease Research Act calls for an expansion of NIDDK's research \nportfolio on Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in order to \ncapitalize on several exciting discoveries that have broadened our \nunderstanding of IBD in recent years. By increasing our investment in \nthis area, we will maximize the possibility that we will be able to \noffer hope to millions of Americans who suffer from this debilitating \ndisease. At the same time, progress in this area could also mean we \nwould save millions of dollars in net health care expenditures through \nreduced hospitalizations and surgeries.\n  In addition to biomedical research, this legislation also calls on \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand its IBD \nepidemiology program to include additional studies focused on pediatric \nIBD. As I mentioned earlier, 30 percent of individuals with IBD are \ndiagnosed in their childhood years. Children with IBD often miss school \nactivities for reasons related to IBD and run the risk of having \ndelayed puberty and impaired growth as a result of this illness. It is \ntherefore appropriate that we also dedicate resources to efforts that \nwill allow us to better understand pediatric IBD.\n  Mr. President, I urge all Senators to join me in this important cause \nby cosponsoring the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Research Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1398\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Inflammatory Bowel Disease \n     Research Enhancement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious \n     inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.\n       (2) Crohn's disease may occur in any section of the \n     gastrointestinal tract but is predominately found in the \n     lower part of the small intestine and the large intestine. \n     Ulcerative colitis is characterized by inflammation and \n     ulceration of the innermost lining of the colon. Complete \n     removal of the colon in patients with ulcerative colitis can \n     potentially alleviate and cure symptoms.\n       (3) Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis behave \n     similarly, they are collectively known as inflammatory bowel \n     disease. Both diseases present a variety of symptoms, \n     including severe diarrhea, abdominal pain with cramps, fever, \n     and rectal bleeding. There is no known cause of inflammatory \n     bowel disease, or medical cure.\n       (4) It is estimated that up to 1,400,000 people in the \n     United States suffer from inflammatory bowel disease, 30 \n     percent of whom are diagnosed during their childhood years.\n       (5) Children with inflammatory bowel disease miss school \n     activities because of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, and \n     many adults who had onset of inflammatory bowel disease as \n     children had delayed puberty and impaired growth and have \n     never reached their full genetic growth potential.\n       (6) Inflammatory bowel disease patients are at high risk \n     for developing colorectal cancer.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to combine \nthe Hope Scholarship Credit and the deduction for qualified tuition and \nrelated expenses into a refundable college affordability and creating \nchances for educational success for students (ACCESS) credit, to \nestablish an Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program, \nand to increase the maximum Federal Pell Grant Award; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the College \nAffordability and Creating Chances for Educational Success for Students \nAct of 2007, or College ACCESS Act. It will make a 2-year or 4-year \ncollege degree affordable for every student.\n  The United States is the largest economy in the world, and our \nskills, our brains, are the foundation of our economic strength. \nHowever, if we do not substantially expand access to higher education, \nwe will not be able to count on continued dominance. Consider the \nfacts: China and India both produce twice as many engineers a year as \nwe produce. One out of five U.S. scientists and engineers are foreign-\nborn. An Indian engineer costs only 20 percent of an American engineer. \nBy 2010, the U.S. will produce about 15 percent of the world's science \nand engineering doctorate degrees. This is down from 50 percent, half \nthe world total, in 1970. High-speed access to information has leveled \nthe playing field, radiologists in India are reading x-rays from \nAmerican hospitals.\n  This is a global economy. In a world where America's competitive \nadvantage gap is closing fast, we should be ensuring guaranteeing that \nevery student can pursue higher education. The importance of a college \ndegree has never been greater, but over the next decade 2 million \nstudents will forgo college because of cost. The price tag of a degree \nat a four year public college has risen 35 percent in the last 5 years, \nthe largest increase in tuition and fees in any 5-year period in the \nlast 30 years. We can not approach college as if it is a luxury, rather \nthan a necessity. And we should be worried about the rising costs that \nare putting college out of reach for more and more Americans. We aren't \ngiving students and their families enough financial support to obtain \ntheir educational goals, it is that simple.\n  We need to act, and we need to act now, and that is why I am \nintroducing the College ACCESS Act. This legislation addresses some of \nthe disparities in our current system with innovative new ways to help \nAmericans pay for college.\n  First, my College ACCESS Plan fully covers the average cost of \ntuition and fees at a 2-year public college and covers more than half \nof the average cost of tuition and fees at a public 4-year college.\n  Right now, students and their families can take advantage of either \nthe Hope Credit or the tuition and fees deduction, obtaining a maximum \nbenefit of $1,120 or $1,650, respectively. Although these incentives \nhelp to make college more affordable, they fall far short of providing \nthe level of relief needed to ensure that all students can afford \ncollege.\n  By replacing the Hope Credit and the tuition and fees deduction with \na single $3,000 credit, the equivalent of a $12,000 deduction, and \nmaking it refundable, middle class and low income families will get \nreal help with college costs. My College ACCESS tax credit simplifies \nthis process and is indexed annually for inflation. So, when the cost \nof college goes up, the amount of assistance goes up as well.\n  Second, my College ACCESS proposal increases Pell Grants. When this \nprogram was established, it covered most of the cost of tuition at a 4-\nyear public college. This is no longer the case. Currently, the maximum \nannual Pell Grant award is $4,310, and the average annual cost of \ntuition and fees at a 4-year public college is $5,800. Students are \nseeing their tuition costs rise every year while the levels of Federal \nfunding fail to keep up. This reality is one that more and more \nstudents are facing every day, a reality that says, you can go to \ncollege, but only if you can afford it, and you won't get much help \nfrom us.\n  My College ACCESS Act seeks to remedy this by raising the maximum \nPell Grant award to $5,100 for 2007-2008, followed by increases of $300 \nper year for the next 5 years, for a maximum Pell Grant in 2011-2012 of \n$6,300.\n  Finally, the College ACCESS Plan would provide funding for a \ndemonstration program in four states that would commit a maximum \nFederal Pell Grant award to eligible 8 grade students so they know \nthey're going to get this assistance when they graduate. By using the \nsame eligibility criteria as the National School Lunch Program, \nstudents would be identified based on need, and then provided with \ninformation on the Pell Grant program, the costs of college, and what \nFederal and State financial assistance is available to them.\n  Right now, students don't find out if they are eligible for Federal \naid until their senior year, much less how much they will receive. If \nyou've ever put kids through college, like I have, you know that this \ntime frame doesn't allow much leeway for planning ahead. An earlier \npromise of Federal aid will begin the conversation about college early \nand continue it through high school. That way, students and their \nfamilies can visualize college in their future, and this goal can \nsustain them through the moment they open that acceptance letter.\n  My mother has an expression that I think rings true in the larger \nscope of America: ``Children tend to become that which you expect of \nthem.'' I want a country where we expect much from America's children. \nOur future, and our economic security, depend on it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this bill be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     The College ACCESS Act of 2007\n\n\n                   Title I--College ACCESS Tax Credit\n\n       Consolidate two existing tax incentives--the Hope \n     Scholarship Credit and the tuition and fees deduction--and \n     replaces them with a single $3,000 refundable tax credit that \n     is the equivalent of a $12,000 deduction. The College ACCESS \n     Tax Credit would fully cover the average cost of tuition and \n     fees at a public two-year college, $2,300, and would cover \n     more than half of the average cost of tuition and fees at a \n     public four-year college, $5,800. Currently, the tuition and \n     fees deduction has a maximum value of $1,120, about 20 \n     percent of the average cost of tuition and fees at a public \n     four-year college. The Hope Scholarship Credit is more \n     valuable, with a maximum value of $1,650, about 28 percent of \n     the average cost of tuition and fees at a public four-year \n     college.\n       Expand eligibility for the tax credit to ease the burden of \n     paying for college for more families. Currently, the Hope \n     Scholarship Credit is phased out for married couples earning \n     $90,000 to $110,000, $45,000 to $55,000 for individuals. \n     Married couples earning $130,000 to $160,000, $65,000-$80,000 \n     for individuals, are eligible only for a reduced tuition and \n     fees deduction. The College ACCESS Tax Credit expands \n     eligibility, providing the full credit to married couples \n     whose adjusted gross income is less than $130,000, $65,000 \n     for individuals and phasing out the credit for married \n     couples with incomes between $130,000 and $166,000, $65,000 \n     and $83,000 for individuals. Broadening the income limits for \n     this credit would result in approximately 4 million more hard \n     working American families being eligible for this assistance \n     than under the current tax incentives and limits. Recognizing \n     that the cost of college rises each year, both the income \n     limits and phase-out range for the credit would be adjusted \n     annually for inflation. Furthermore, families could claim a \n     credit for more than one eligible dependent in a school year. \n     In pursuing their education, individuals will be eligible for \n     credits totaling up to $12,000 toward an undergraduate \n     degree, associate's degree, certificate, or continuing \n     education as well as credits totaling up to $6,000 toward a \n     graduate degree; as long as they are enrolled at least half-\n     time.\n       Make the tuition tax credit refundable. Making the College \n     ACCESS Tax Credit refundable would expand this incentive to \n     the very students and families that need it the most, low \n     income families. This credit would allow low income families \n     to qualify for up to $3,000 to cover tuition payments that \n     aren't covered by Pell Grants. Low income students who do \n     attend college often face prohibitive costs even after \n     receiving aid from the government and their institution.\n\n\n  Title II--Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program\n\n       Fund a demonstration program that would commit Pell Grants \n     to students in 8 grade. Currently, most students find out \n     whether or not they will receive a Pell Grant during their \n     senior year of high school. Starting the financial aid \n     process earlier would allow\n\n[[Page S6139]]\n\n     families and students to plan ahead for college and develop \n     an expectation that the future includes higher education. The \n     proposal provides funding for an Early Pell Grant Commitment \n     Demonstration Program in four States, each of which would \n     commit Pell Grants to two cohorts of up to 10,000 8 grade \n     students, one in school year 2007-2008, and one in school \n     year 2008-2009. Participation would be contingent on \n     students' 8 grade eligibility for free or reduced price meals \n     under the National School Lunch Program. Participants would \n     qualify for the Automatic Zero Expected Family Contribution \n     on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, FAFSA, \n     guaranteeing them a maximum Pell Grant, $4,310 for 2007-08. \n     Additionally, the act requires an independent evaluation to \n     be conducted to determine the impact and effectiveness of the \n     program.\n       Provide students with essential information regarding the \n     costs of college as well as available State and Federal \n     assistance. The Early Pell Grant Demonstration Project would \n     provide funding for States, in conjunction with the \n     participating local education agencies, to conduct targeted \n     information campaigns beginning in the 8 grade and continuing \n     through students' senior year. These campaigns would inform \n     students and their families of the program and provide \n     information about the cost of a college education, State and \n     Federal financial assistance, and the average amount of aid \n     awards. A targeted information campaign, along with a \n     guarantee of a maximum Pell Grant, would provide information \n     essential to the college-planning process and would help \n     break down the barriers that cost and information often form.\n\n\n          Title III--Increase Federal Pell Grant Maximum Award\n\n       Expand the maximum Pell Grant from $4,310 to $5,100. In \n     1975, the maximum Pell Grant covered 84 percent of the cost \n     of tuition, fees, room, and board at a four-year public \n     college (Pell Grants, unlike tax incentives, can be used to \n     pay for the cost of room and board). The maximum Pell Grant \n     this year covered 33 percent of the average cost of tuition, \n     fees, room, and board at a public four-year college, $12,115. \n     While Congress increased the maximum Pell Grant for 2007-2008 \n     to $4,310, a more substantial increase is long overdue, as \n     the cost of tuition has outpaced the growth in family income \n     for the last two decades. The College ACCESS Act would \n     increase the maximum Pell Grant to $5,100 for 2007-2008, \n     followed by increases of $300 per year for the next five \n     years, for a maximum Pell Grant in 2011-12 of $6,300.\n\n\n                       Estimated Five-Year Costs\n\n       Title I--$24.1 Billion\n       Title II--$35 billion\n       Title III--$36.5 million\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Burr, \n        Mr. Isakson, and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 1400. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to improve \nthe information and repayment options to student borrowers, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Student \nInformation Means a Positive Loan Experience Act, the SIMPLE Act, which \nI, along with Senators Alexander, Allard, Burr and Isakson, am \nintroducing today. With the increasing debt level of many students, it \nis important to make sure borrowers have good options for managing \ntheir debt and good information on the available options so they make \nwise, informed decisions.\n  We are calling this the SIMPLE Act for a reason. We have heard \ntestimony from experts and comments from borrowers and other \nstakeholders about the information borrowers receive currently. On the \none hand, borrowers receive so much information that they have \n``information overload,'' which leads to confusion. On the other hand, \nmany borrowers do not receive good information about the full range of \ntools available to help them repay their loans. What has come through \nloud and clear is that we need to simplify the information and spell \nout the impact of selecting various options. Borrowers need better, \nclearer information to help them make better decisions, not more \nrepayment plans and confusing choices.\n  There are already four repayment plans in the Federal Family \nEducation Loan program and four in Direct Loans. From the data we have \nobtained, it is clear that the vast majority of borrowers with Stafford \nloans have a standard repayment plan. Many borrowers are not taking \nadvantage of the graduated, extended or income sensitive/income \ncontingent repayment plans currently available.\n  Rather than adding another repayment plan, this bill makes the \nexisting repayment plans more flexible, by providing borrowers with the \noption to pay only the interest on their loans for the first 2 years \nthey are in repayment, regardless of their repayment plan. The bill \nalso expands access to the extended repayment plan to borrowers with \n$20,000 of student loan debt, instead of the $30,000 currently needed \nto qualify for extended repayment plans.\n  The bill also revises the definition of economic hardship, raising \nthe eligibility cut-off point to 150 percent of the poverty line and \ntaking family size into account when making the determination of \neligibility.\n  To make sure borrowers understand the availability of the various \noptions, and the impact different repayment plans would have on their \npayments, the bill expands and clarifies the information to be provided \nto borrowers during their exit interview. Information on repayment \nplans available will include a discussion of the different features of \neach plan, average anticipated monthly payment amounts, and the ability \nof the borrower to prepay their loans or to change repayment plans.\n  The bill requires borrowers to be provided with clear information on \nthe availability of deferment and forbearance. These are two excellent \ndebt management tools, but borrowers must understand the potential \nimpact on their loan principal and total interest paid on their loans \nwhen they choose these options.\n  During exit counseling, borrowers must also be provided with \ninformation on the effect of consolidating student loans on the \nborrower's underlying loan benefits, including grace periods, loan \nforgiveness and cancellation. Borrowers must be informed that different \nlenders offering consolidation loans may offer different borrower \nbenefits.\n  Last, but not least, borrowers must be given notice that information \non their student loans is housed in the National Student Loan Database \nand they must be told how to access their information. It will help \nthem keep track of the status of their loans and the outstanding \nprincipal.\n  All of this is designed to help borrowers ask questions first, then \nmake decisions that are right for them. The concept is simple, and \nrequires a few, but essential changes to the Higher Education Act to \nput them into effect.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1400\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the National Student Loan Data System; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Student Financial \nAid Data Privacy Protection Act, which I, along with Senators \nAlexander, Allard, Burr, Isakson and Roberts, am\n\n[[Page S6141]]\n\nintroducing today. In a climate where our personal financial \ninformation is at risk, it is now more important than ever to ensure \nthat the Department of Education is providing appropriate safeguards \naround one of the world's largest databases, National Student Loan Data \nSystem.\n  The Department of Education has not inspired confidence in its \nability to protect its data systems from those bad actors who would \nmisuse the financial information of students and parents. Indeed in \n2006 the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform gave the \nDepartment of Education a failing grade for its efforts to improve the \nsecurity of its data systems in compliance with the Federal Information \nSecurity Management Act.\n  More recently, on April 17 of this year the Department of Education \nsuspended the access of lenders, services and guaranty agencies to the \nNational Student Loan Data System. While I am pleased to see that the \nDepartment of Education is monitoring this database, it is clear from \nthe information provided by the Department of Education that this \nunprecedented restriction of access was done without having in place \nclear standard operating procedures for limiting and restoring access \nto the database.\n  The National Student Loan Data System is a vital tool for lenders, \nuniversities and students. It is a system that is absolutely essential \nto the efficient functioning of our country's higher education loan and \ngrant programs. When the operation of this system suffers, students \nsuffer.\n  Students and parents depend on this system to consolidate their \nloans. Lenders and guaranty agencies depend on this system to verify \nwhether students should be entering their repayment period. And our \ninstitutions of higher education depend on this system to determine \nwhether students are exceeding caps on how much they should be \nborrowing to attend college.\n  This bill sets out operating principles for the National Student Loan \nData System, to ensure that the Department of Education continues to \nmanage this database in manner that advances the best interests of \nstudents. The bill requires the Department of Education establish \nprotocols for limiting access to the database when there are suspicions \nthat the system is being used inappropriately, and the steps to be \ntaken in order to restore access.\n  This bill also requires the Department of Education, lenders and \nguaranty agencies to assist students and parents in better \nunderstanding how their sensitive, financial information is entered \ninto the National Student Loan Data System and then accessed by \nthousands of lenders, consolidators and guaranty agencies across the \ncountry.\n  Finally, the bill prohibits nongovernmental researchers and policy \nanalysts from accessing sensitive borrower-specific information, and \ndirects the Secretary of Education to explore ways to empower students \nand parents to control which lenders are accessing their sensitive, \nfinancial information.\n  We must help the 14.3 million students and their families who trust \nthe Department of Education to protect their personal financial \ninformation. Action is needed to restore confidence in the ability of \nthe Department of Education to manage the National Student Loan Data \nSystem. I want to thank Senators Alexander, Allard, Burr, Isakson and \nRoberts for joining me in this effort, and look forward to this bill \nbeing included in our efforts to reauthorize the Higher Education Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1401\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, with \nrespect\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\nto the exemption to registration requirements; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to introduce an important \npiece of legislation aimed at closing a loophole in our securities \nlaws. This bill, The Hedge Fund Registration Act, is pretty simple. \nIt's only two pages long. All it does is clarify that the Securities \nand Exchange Commission has the authority to require hedge funds to \nregister, so the government knows who they are and what they're doing.\n  Technically speaking, this bill would amend section 203(b)(3) of the \nInvestment Advisers Act of 1940. It would narrow the current exemption \nfrom registration for certain investment advisers. This exemption is \nused by large, private pooled investment vehicles, commonly referred to \nas ``hedge funds.'' Hedge funds are operated by advisers who manage \nbillions of dollars for groups of wealthy investors in total secrecy. \nThey should at least have to register with the SEC, like other \ninvestment advisors do.\n  Currently, the exemption applies to any investment adviser who had \nfewer than 15 clients in the preceding year and who does not hold \nhimself out to the public as an investment adviser. The Hedge Fund \nRegistration Act narrows this exemption and closes a loophole in the \nsecurities laws these hedge funds use to avoid registering with the SEC \nand operate in secret.\n  Much has been reported during the last few years regarding hedge \nfunds and the market power they yield because of the large amounts of \ncapital they invest. In fact, some estimates are that these pooled \ninvestment vehicles account for nearly 30 percent of the daily trades \nin U.S. financial markets. The power and influence of that amount of \nvolume is not some passing fad. It represents a new element in our \nfinancial markets. Congress needs to ensure that the SEC knows who is \ncontrolling these massive pools of money to ensure the integrity and \nsecurity of the markets.\n  The failure of Amaranth and the increasing interest in hedge funds as \ninvestment vehicles for public pension money means that this is not \njust a high stakes game for the super rich. Hedge funds affect regular \ninvestors. They affect the markets as a whole.\n  My recent oversight of the SEC has convinced me that the Commission \nand the Self-Regulatory Organizations, SROs, need much more information \nabout the activities of hedge funds in order to protect the markets \nfrom institutional insider trading and other potential abuses.\n  This legislation is one small, simple step toward greater \ntransparency. All it does is require that hedge funds register and tell \nthe regulators who they are. This is not a burden. It is just common \nsense. Organizations that wield hundreds of billions of dollars in \nmarket power every day need to register with the agency that Americans \nrely on to regulate the financial markets.\n  The SEC has already attempted to do this by regulation. Congress \nneeds to act because of a decision made last year by a Federal appeals \ncourt. In 2006, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals overturned an SEC \nadministrative rule that required registration of hedge funds. That \ndecision effectively ended all registration of hedge funds with the \nSEC, unless and until Congress takes action.\n  The Hedge Fund Registration Act would respond to that court decision \nby narrowing the current registration exemption and bring much needed \ntransparency to hedge funds.\n  Most people say the devil is in the details. Well here they are. This \nbill would authorize the SEC to require all investment advisers, \nincluding hedge fund managers, to register with the SEC. Only those \nthat meet all four of the following criteria would be exempt: 1. \nmanaged less than $50 million, 2. had fewer than 15 clients, 3. did not \nhold himself out to the public as an investment advisor, and 4. managed \nthe assets for fewer than 15 investors, regardless of whether \ninvestment is direct or through a pooled investment vehicle, such as a \nhedge fund.\n  The Hedge Fund Registration Act is a first step in ensuring that the \nSEC simply has clear authority to do what it already tried to do. \nCongress must act to ensure that our laws are kept up to date as new \ntypes of investments appear.\n  That said, this legislation didn't have many friends the last time I \nintroduced it as an amendment. These funds don't want people to know \nwhat they do and have fought hard to keep it that way. Well, I think \nthat is all the more reason to shed some sunlight on them to see what \nthey're up to.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this legislation, as we \nwork to protect all investors, large and small.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 1404. A bill to provide for Congressional authority with respect \nto certain acquisitions, mergers, and takeovers under the Defense \nProduction Act of 1950; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is an important issue, one I have \nraised many times over the years. I have testified before the Banking \nCommittee, and introduced numerous bills.\n  It is not a new issue. There have been at least four high-profile \ntimes in the last 12 years where proposed foreign acquisitions in the \nU.S. have threatened our security.\n  In 1998, President Clinton tried to turn over management of a 144-\nacre terminal at the former U.S. Naval Station in Long Beach to the \nChinese Ocean Shipping Company, COSCO--a subsidiary of the People's \nLiberation Army.\n  I am going to quote from an LA Times article from that time:\n\n       The embattled COSCO deal came to an end Thursday night, \n     when congressional conferees submitted to Congress the 1998-\n     99 Defense Authorization Bill . . . Leading the effort to \n     block COSCO from the facility were Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) \n     and Rep. Duncan Hunter [of the] San Diego area.\n\n  That was one battle that we won.\n  Since working in 1995 to prevent Los Angeles ports from being \ncontrolled by Chinese interests, I have continued my pressure on the \nissue. For example, I expressed my concern with the CFIUS process over \n2 years ago in the spring of 2005 when I delivered four speeches on \nChina. While examining this issue I came across a disturbing example of \nChina buying the U.S. company, Magnequench Inc., and moving it \npiecemeal back to mainland China.\n  Let me read from the floor speech I gave on April 4, 2005:\n\n       I believe that CFIUS does not have a broad enough \n     conception of U.S. security. One example of CFIUS falling \n     short is with Magnequench International Incorporated. In 1995 \n     Chinese corporations bought GM's Magnequench, a supplier of \n     rare earth metals used in the guidance systems of smart-\n     bombs. Over twelve years, the company has been moved \n     piecemeal to mainland China, leaving the U.S. with no \n     domestic supplier of a critical component of rare-earth \n     magnets. CFIUS approved this transfer.\n\n  The United States now has no domestic supplier of rare earth metals, \nwhich are essential for precision-guided munitions.\n  That was one we lost.\n  Following this series of four speeches that spring, on July 20, 2005, \nI introduced Senate amendment No. 1311 as an amendment to the annual \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006. My amendment \nprompted the very beginning of the legislative pursuit of this issue in \nrecent years. For example, my amendment prompted another, later, \nsecond-degree amendment, Senate amendment No. 1335, by Senator Shelby, \nthen the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.\n  I also testified before the U.S.-China Commission on July 21, 2005. \nThe U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission is a bipartisan \ncommittee created in 2000 to monitor, investigate, and submit to \nCongress an annual report on the national security implications of the \nbilateral trade and economic relationship between the United States and \nthe People's Republic of China.\n  The Commission is composed of 12 members, 3 of whom are selected by \neach of the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, and the \nSpeaker and the minority leader of the House. The Commissioners serve \n2-year terms.\n  Their recommendations are consistent with the amendment I introduced \nto the Defense authorization bill that would have made some of the \nnecessary changes to CFIUS.\n  On September 28, 2005, the Government Accountability Office issued a \nreport on CFIUS that is right in line with the recommendations of the \nUS-China Commission. So this has not just been me saying that CFIUS is \nin need of\n\n[[Page S6143]]\n\ncritical change--it's the U.S.-China Commission and the GAO as well.\n  When my amendment stalled over a committee jurisdictional point, on \nSeptember 29, 2005, I chose to introduce the changes as a stand-alone \nbill, the Foreign Investment Security Act of 2005, S. 1797, which was \nreferred to the Banking Committee. That bill was the first bill \nintroduced in recent years on this topic.\n  Later the Banking Committee held a hearing on the GAO report, and I \ntestified before them on October 20, 2005, at that hearing.\n  In all of these ways I have just mentioned, the Banking Committee was \nprompted by me to pursue this topic.\n  In the past couple of years, several high profile business deals have \nbeen approved by CFIUS that would allow foreign-owned companies, in \nparticular companies that are owned or controlled by foreign \ngovernments, to acquire other companies doing business in the United \nStates.\n  More recently I was concerned with China's state-owned CNOOC \nattempted to buyout Unocal, a US oil company. We won this one because \nof Congressional pressure, and CNOOC withdrew its bid. Over the past 2 \nyears, I have been pointing out that the CFIUS process has ignored some \nmajor issues which threaten our national security.\n  The most publicized deal was the state owned Dubai Ports World, DPW, \npurchase of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, P, that would \nhave allowed DPW to take over the operations at various east coast \nports in the United States. The public outcry against this deal lead \nDPW to abandon its plans to operate the U.S. ports and that portion of \nthe takeover was sold to U.S. based companies. However since the DPW-\nP deal was canceled, other transactions have been approved by CFIUS \nthat are just as questionable.\n  CFIUS has received over 1,600 notifications and investigated under \n40. Of those, only one acquisition has been stopped by the President.\n  This is a critical issue at a critical time. CFIUS seems to only get \nscrutiny when some major deal is in the papers. I have been paying \nattention to it all along. It needs reform, and I hope we can make some \nprogress.\n  I am glad that Congress is now taking a closer look at CIFIUS reform. \nRest assured that I continue to push for this badly needed reform and \nas Congress addresses this issue, I will keep your thoughts in mind.\n  Note too that I will ensure in particular that the national security \naspects of this work are appropriately attended to. I will not stand \nidly by and allow a bill that is weak on national defense to pass.\n  Let us all work together to ensure that the legislative process \nperforms appropriately to defend our Nation, and let this bill I am \nintroducing today be a new start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/05/15/senate-section/article/S6143-1", "month": "05", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 199--CALLING FOR THE IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL \n                    RELEASE OF DR.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the `Iraq War De-Escalation Act of \n     2007'.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress and the Nation honor the courage, sacrifices, \n     and efforts of the members of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States and their families.\n       (2) In his speech to the Nation on January 10, 2007, \n     President George W. Bush said that `I've made it clear to the \n     Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders that America's \n     commitment is not open-ended. If the Iraqi government does \n     not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support \n     of the American people . . . The Prime Minister understands \n     this'.\n       (3) In that speech, President George W. Bush also told the \n     Nation that `America will hold the Iraqi government to the \n     benchmarks it has announced . . . [T]o take responsibility \n     for security in all of Iraq's provinces by November. To give \n     every Iraqi citizen a stake in the country's economy, Iraq \n     will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis. \n     To show that it is committed to delivering a better life, the \n     Iraqi government will spend $10,000,000,000 of its own money \n     on reconstruction and infrastructure projects that will \n     create new jobs. To empower local leaders, Iraqis plan to \n     hold provincial elections later this year. And to allow more \n     Iraqis to re-enter their nation's political life, the \n     government will reform deBaathification laws, and establish a \n     fair process for considering amendments to Iraq's \n     constitution'.\n       (4) In that speech, President George W. Bush also told the \n     Nation that `only Iraqis can end the sectarian violence and \n     secure their people'.\n       (5) On December 18, 2006, former Secretary of State Colin \n     Powell stated: `[s]o we have tried this surge of troops over \n     the summer. I am not persuaded that another surge of troops \n     in Baghdad for the purpose of suppressing this communitarian \n     violence, this civil war, will work'.\n       (6) On November 15, 2006, General John Abizaid, Commander \n     of the United States Central Command, stated before the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that `I met with \n     every divisional commander, General Casey, the corps \n     commander, General Dempsey. We all talked together. And I \n     said, in your professional opinion, if we were to bring in \n     more American troops now, does it add considerably to our \n     ability to achieve success in Iraq? And they all said no. And \n     the reason is, because we want the Iraqis to do more. It's \n     easy for the Iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. I \n     believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future'.\n       (7) In testimony before the Committee on Foreign Relations \n     of the Senate on January 11, 2007, Secretary of State \n     Condoleezza Rice stated that unless the Government of Iraq \n     has met certain benchmarks and reestablishes the confidence \n     of the Iraqi people over the next several months, `this plan \n     is not going to work'.\n       (8) In a statement on January 11, 2007, Secretary of \n     Defense Robert Gates stated `[a]nd we will probably have a \n     better view a couple of months from now in terms of whether \n     we are making headway in terms of getting better control of \n     Baghdad, with the Iraqis in the lead and with the Iraqis \n     beginning to make better progress on the reconciliation \n     process'.\n       (9) The bipartisan Iraq Study Group headed by former \n     Secretary of State James Baker and former Representative Lee \n     Hamilton reached a bipartisan consensus on 79 separate \n     recommendations for a new approach in Iraq. Among those \n     recommendations were calling for a new diplomatic offensive \n     in the region and conditioning American economic assistance \n     to Iraq on specific benchmarks, with the expectation that `by \n     the first quarter of 2008, subject to unexpected developments \n     in the security situation on the ground, all combat brigades \n     not necessary for force protection could be out of Iraq'.\n       (10) In reaction to the speech of President George W. Bush \n     of January 10, 2007, former Secretary of State Baker and \n     former Representative Hamilton wrote that `[t]he President \n     did not suggest the possibility of a transition that could \n     enable U.S. combat forces to begin to leave Iraq. The \n     President did not state that political, military, or economic \n     support for Iraq would be conditional on the Iraq \n     government's ability to meet benchmarks. Within the region, \n     the President did\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\n     not announce an international support group for Iraq \n     including all of Iraq's neighbors.\n       (b) Purpose.--Ihe purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To formulate and provide for the implementation of an \n     effective United States policy towards Iraq and the Middle \n     East region that employs military, political, diplomatic, and \n     economic assets to promote and protect the national security \n     interests of the United States.\n       (2) To provide for the implementation of a responsible, \n     phased redeployment of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     from Iraq in a substantial and gradual manner that places the \n     highest priority on protecting the lives of members of the \n     Armed Forces and civilian personnel of the United States and \n     on promoting the national security interests of the United \n     States in the Middle East region.\n       (3) To urge the political parties and leaders of Iraq to \n     reach the political solution necessary to promote stability \n     in Iraq and enhance the safety of innocent Iraqi civilians.\n       (4) To condition future economic assistance to the \n     Government of Iraq on significant progress toward the \n     achievement of political and economic measures to be taken by \n     the Government of Iraq.\n       (5) To provide for the initiation of a wider and sustained \n     diplomatic strategy aimed at promoting a political settlement \n     in Iraq, thereby ending the civil war in Iraq, preventing a \n     humanitarian catastrophe in Iraq, and preventing a wider \n     regional conflict.\n       (6) To provide, through sections 4 through 7, for the \n     implementation of key recommendations of the Iraq Study \n     Group, a bipartisan panel of experts cochaired by former \n     Secretary of State James Baker and former Representative Lee \n     Hamilton.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. WARNER (for himself and Ms. Collins) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 1495, to \nprovide for the conservation and development of water and related \nresources, to authorize the Secretary of the Army to construct various \nprojects for improvements to rivers and harbors of the United States, \nand for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n                 TITLE __--PRESIDENT'S STRATEGY IN IRAQ\n\n     SEC. 1. FINDINGS REGARDING PROGRESS IN IRAQ, THE \n                   ESTABLISHMENT OF BENCHMARKS TO MEASURE THAT \n                   PROGRESS, AND REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 145,000 American military personnel are currently \n     serving in Iraq, like thousands of others since March 2003, \n     with the bravery and professionalism consistent with the \n     finest traditions of the United States armed forces, and are \n     deserving of the strong support of all Americans;\n       (2) Many American service personnel have lost their lives, \n     and many more have been wounded in Iraq; the American people \n     will always honor their sacrifice and honor their families;\n       (3) The United States Army and Marine Corps, including \n     their Reserve components and National Guard organizations, \n     together with components of the other branches of the \n     military, are performing their missions while under enormous \n     strain from multiple, extended deployments to Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. These deployments, and those that will follow, \n     will have a lasting impact on future recruiting, retention, \n     and readiness of our nation's all volunteer force;\n       (4) Iraq is experiencing a deteriorating problem of \n     sectarian and intrasectarian violence based upon political \n     distrust and cultural differences among factions of the Sunni \n     and Shia populations;\n       (5) Iraqis must reach political and economic settlements in \n     order to achieve reconciliation, for there is no military \n     solution. The failure of the Iraqis to reach such settlements \n     to support a truly unified government greatly contributes to \n     the increasing violence in Iraq;\n       (6) The responsibility for Iraq's internal security and \n     halting sectarian violence rests with the sovereign \n     Government of Iraq;\n       (7) In December 2006, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group \n     issued a valuable report, suggesting a comprehensive strategy \n     that includes new and enhanced diplomatic and political \n     efforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary \n     mission of U.S. forces in Iraq, that will enable the United \n     States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq \n     responsibly;\n       (8) The President said on January 10, 2007, that ``I've \n     made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders \n     that America's commitment is not openended'' so as to dispel \n     the contrary impression that exists;\n       (9) It is essential that the sovereign Government of Iraq \n     set out measurable and achievable benchmarks and President \n     Bush said, on January 10, 2007, that ``America will change \n     our approach to help the Iraqi government as it works to meet \n     these benchmarks'';\n       (10) As reported by Secretary of State Rice, Iraq's Policy \n     Committee on National Security agreed upon a set of \n     political, security, and economic benchmarks and an \n     associated timeline in September 2006 that were (a) \n     reaffirmed by Iraq's Presidency Council on October 6, 2006; \n     (b) referenced by the Iraq Study Group; and (c) posted on the \n     President of Iraq's website;\n       (11) On April 21, 2007, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates \n     stated that ``our [American] commitment to Iraq is long-term, \n     but it is not a commitment to have our young men and women \n     patrolling Iraq's streets open-endedly'' and that ``progress \n     in reconciliation will be an important element of our \n     evaluation'';\n       (12) The President's January 10, 2007 address had three \n     components: political, military, and economic. Given that \n     significant time has passed since his statement, and \n     recognizing the overall situation is ever changing, Congress \n     must have timely reports to evaluate and execute its \n     Constitutional oversight responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONDITIONING OF FUTURE UNITED STATES STRATEGY IN IRAQ \n                   ON THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT'S RECORD OF PERFORMANCE \n                   ON ITS BENCHMARKS.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) The United States strategy in Iraq, \n     hereafter, shall be conditioned on the Iraqi government \n     meeting benchmarks, as told to members of Congress by the \n     President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, \n     and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and reflected \n     in the Iraqi Government's commitments to the United States, \n     and to the international community, including:\n       (A) Forming a Constitutional Review Committee and then \n     completing the Constitutional review;\n       (B) Enacting and implementing legislation on de-\n     Baathification;\n       (C) Enacting and implementing legislation to ensure the \n     equitable distribution of hydrocarbon resources of the people \n     of Iraq without regard to the sect or ethnicity of \n     recipients, and enacting and implementing legislation to \n     ensure that the energy resources of Iraq benefit Sunni Arabs, \n     Shia Arabs, Kurds, and other Iraqi citizens in an equitable \n     manner;\n       (D) Enacting and implementing legislation on procedures to \n     form semi-autonomous regions;\n       (E) Enacting and implementing legislation establishing an \n     Independent High Electoral Commission;

and\n       (R) Ensuring that Iraq's political authorities are not \n     undermining or making false accusations against members of \n     the ISF.\n       (2) The President shall submit reports to Congress on how \n     the sovereign Government of Iraq is, or is not, achieving \n     progress towards accomplishing the aforementioned benchmarks, \n     and shall advise the Congress on how that assessment \n     requires, or does not require, changes to the strategy \n     announced on January 10, 2007.\n       (b) Reports Required.--\n       (1) The President shall submit an initial report, in \n     classified and unclassified format, to the Congress, not \n     later than July 15, 2007, assessing the status of each of the \n     specific benchmarks established above, and declaring, in his \n     judgment, whether satisfactory progress toward meeting these \n     benchmarks is, or is not, being achieved.\n       (2) The President, having consulted with the Secretary of \n     State, The Secretary of Defense, The Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces-Iraq, the United States Ambassador to Iraq, \n     and the Commander of U.S. Central Command, will prepare the \n     report and submit the report to Congress.\n       (3) If the President's assessment of any of the specific \n     benchmarks established above is unsatisfactory, the President \n     shall include in that report a description of such revisions \n     to the political, economic, regional, and military components \n     of the strategy, as announced by the President on January 10, \n     2007. In addition, the President shall include in the report, \n     the advisability of implementing such aspects of the \n     bipartisan Iraq Study Group, as he deems appropriate.\n       (4) The President shall submit a second report to the \n     Congress, not later than September 15, 2007, following the \n     same procedures and criteria, outlined above.\n       (5) The reporting requirement detailed in Section 1227 of \n     the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 \n     is waived from the date of the enactment of this Act through \n     the period ending 15 September, 2007.\n       (c) Testimony Before Congress.--\n       (1) Prior to the submission of the President's second \n     report on September 15, 2007, and at a time to be agreed upon \n     by the leadership of the Congress and the Administration, the \n     United States Ambassador to Iraq and the Commander, Multi-\n     National Forces Iraq will be made available to testify in \n     open and closed sessions before the relevant committees of \n     the Congress.\n\n     SEC. 3.
