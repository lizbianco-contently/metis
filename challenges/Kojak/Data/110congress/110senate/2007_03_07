Mr. President, I am sure it is difficult for people who \nlive outside the Washington, DC, area to understand why we are not \ngoing to be able to have a couple votes this morning. I have not had a \nchance to speak with the Republican leader. I apologize. There is \nnothing to apologize for, I just have not had the opportunity to do \nthat, or to talk to the two managers of the bill. But in Washington, it \nis different than a lot of places. We have several bridges that feed \ninto this area coming from Virginia. A lot of the staff and Senators \nlive in Virginia when they are here attending sessions of Congress.\n  To make a long story short, we have essential staff who are not here \nright now. We have Senators--at least one Senator stuck on a train \nbecause of the bad weather. As I say, it might be difficult for people \nwho see a lot of snow all the time to understand why an inch or two or \nthree of snow causes all these problems, but it does. It has been that \nway and will continue to be that way.\n  Because of that, I am going to ask consent that the votes scheduled \nto occur at 10 a.m. occur later this afternoon. We will try to do it at \nabout 1 o'clock. One reason we cannot back the votes up is because we \nhave a joint session of Congress with King Abdullah, the King of \nJordan, who has been such a good ally--he and his father--of our \ncountry, and a lot of us are looking forward to hearing that speech he \nis going to deliver.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes scheduled to \noccur at 10 a.m. occur later this afternoon. I will work with the \nRepublican leader to make sure it is a time that is convenient.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say the two votes we had lined up we \nhave been wanting to do for a while, the one offered by the manager of \nthe bill, Senator Collins, and the one offered by Senator McCaskill. We \nwill try to do those votes first and then move on to other matters.\n  Staffs are also working to see if we can come up with an agreement on \nthe nongermane amendments. We have a number of nongermane amendments on \nboth sides. We are going to try to set up votes on those. One of the \nthings we have to make sure is covered in any consent agreement is, if \nwe do vote on these nongermane amendments, it does not change what \nwould be germane postcloture because, in fact, if we did not do that, \nthere would be a lot of things that would be germane postcloture that \nshould not be attached to this bill. But we have very able staff who \ncan work on this along with the managers of the bill.\n  I again apologize to everyone, but those are the facts of life in the \nbitter winter of an inch of snow in Washington.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/07/senate-section/article/S2744-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2744]]\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 342\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, later today, the Senate will vote on the \namendment I have offered with a number of my colleagues--Senator \nStevens, Senator Warner, Senator Coleman, Senator Sununu, and Senator \nVoinovich--that would provide certain employment rights for the \nTransportation Security Administration's employees.\n  Throughout our committee's work on homeland security, it has become \nclear the ability to respond quickly and effectively to changing \nconditions, to emerging threats, to new intelligence, to impending \ncrises is essential. From the intelligence community to our first \nresponders, the key to an effective response is flexibility--putting \nassets and, more importantly, personnel where they are needed when they \nare needed with a minimum of bureaucracy.\n  My questions about giving TSA employees the right to collectively \nbargain center around whether this right would hamper flexibility at a \ncritical time. I have long been a supporter of Federal employees \nthroughout my time in the Senate. I have worked in the public sector \nvirtually my entire life, and I know how hard individuals at all levels \nof Government work to provide services to protect us and to serve us.\n  It is my hope we can forge a compromise that preserves the \nflexibility--we have learned in classified briefings from Kip Hawley, \nthe head of TSA--that is needed while at the same time recognizing that \nTSA employees deserve more employment rights. These employees are \nworking hard every day to protect us. We should protect them.\n  The TSA is charged with a great responsibility. In order to \naccomplish its critical national security mission, the Aviation \nTransportation Security Act provided the TSA Administrator with \nworkforce flexibilities. These flexibilities allow the TSA \nAdministrator to shift resources and to implement new procedures daily, \nin some cases hourly, in response to emergencies, canceled flights, and \nchanging circumstances. This authority enables TSA to make the best and \nfullest use of its highly trained and dedicated workforce.\n  This is not just theoretical. We have already seen the benefits of \nthis authority and this flexibility. In both the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina and the thwarted airline bombing plot in Great Britain last \nyear, TSA moved quickly to change the nature of its employees' work--\nand even the location of that work--in response.\n  Last December, when blizzards hit the Denver area and many local TSOs \nwere unable to get to the airport, TSA acted quickly, flying in \nvolunteer TSOs from Las Vegas to cover the shifts, and covering the Las \nVegas shifts with officers who were transferred temporarily from Salt \nLake City. Without this ability to deploy needed personnel where they \nwere needed, on a moment's notice, the Denver airport would have been \ncritically understaffed while hundreds, perhaps thousands, of travelers \nwere stranded. This flexibility is essential.\n  An even better example was the work that was done in the aftermath of \nthe thwarted airline bombing plot last summer, where TSA, overnight, \nhad to retrain its employees, had to deploy them differently, and was \nable to do so because of the flexibility that is in the current law.\n  The legislation before the Senate is designed to implement the \nunfulfilled recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Many of the \nrecommendations were enacted in 2004 as part of the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act Senator Lieberman and I authored and \nworked so hard on. But the language concerning TSA employees' \nbargaining rights is an issue that was not addressed in this report. \nYou can read this report, as I have, from cover to cover--I think it is \n567 pages--and you will not find a discussion of collective bargaining \nrights for TSA employees. So this is not a recommendation that was \nincluded in the 9/11 Commission's report.\n  Before we so drastically change the TSA personnel system, we must \nensure we do not interfere with TSA's ability to carry out its mission. \nI want to make clear that we should, however, make some changes in the \nsystem now. We have had enough experience with TSA over the past few \nyears that there are a number of things that are obvious.\n  First, we should bring TSA employees under the Whistleblower \nProtections Act which safeguards the rights of whistleblowers \nthroughout the Federal Government. There is no reason to deny TSA \nemployees that protection. My amendment would provide for that \ncoverage.\n  Second, we should make very clear that TSA members do have the right \nto join a union. That is a different issue from collective bargaining. \nIndeed, many TSA employees have chosen to join the union because then \nthey have the right to representation by the union if there is a \ndisciplinary action. So we should make that clear.\n  Third, we should give TSA employees the right to an independent \nappeal of disciplinary actions, of adverse employment actions such as \ndemotions or firings, and have that appeal heard by an independent \nagency, the Merit Systems Protection Board. It is this board that sits \nin judgment of appeals filed by other Federal employees, and I see no \nreason why the TSA employees should not have those same rights.\n  Fourth, the amendment includes a provision codifying the pay-for-\nperformance system that TSA has used very successfully to retain and \nrecruit good employees.\n  Finally, the amendment we are offering provides for TSA, in a year's \ntime, to come back to us with a report on whether other changes are \nneeded in the personnel system. We have also tasked GAO with performing \nthat duty. Now, that is important because we are still learning about \nTSA. As I said, I think we can make these significant changes now, but \nwe need more time and study and consideration before going further, and \nthat is why I have recommended that we have this report back.\n\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's \nsubcommittee which has jurisdiction over civil service issues just this \nweek held its first hearing to look at this issue. So there is a lot of \nwork that still needs to be done, but I think we can proceed now to \nprovide these important protections.\n  As we strive to protect our Nation and our people without diminishing \ncivil liberties, we must do all we can to build a strong homeland \nsecurity structure that upholds the rights of homeland security \npersonnel. I believe we can provide TSA employees with important \nprotections enjoyed by other Federal employees, such as the right to \nappeal adverse employment actions to\n\n[[Page S2746]]\n\nthe Merit Systems Protection Board and the statutory right to \nwhistleblower protections, without disrupting TSA's established and \nproven personnel system. That personnel system was described in great \ndetail to us in a classified briefing session as well as an open \nhearing as being necessary to accomplish the goals of the agency. So my \namendment would give these rights to TSA employees.\n  I have been working to try to achieve a middle ground between those \nwho believe there should be no employment rights for TSA employees and \nthose who believe we should allow them to engage in full collective \nbargaining. That is what my amendment attempts to do, is to chart that \nmiddle ground, to provide significant additional protections and rights \nto TSA employees without burdening a system that is working \neffectively.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment when we vote on it \nlater today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 316, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I have a great deal of respect for the \nSenator from Maine, and I am not just saying that, but I must rise to \nurge support of my amendment on this bill. Along with Senator \nLieberman, I offered an amendment to the 9/11 bill that would provide \nthese basic rights to our airport screening officers. This amendment \nwas in response to the incredibly high turnover rate they have at TSA \nand the realization that these officers are being treated differently \nthan just about everybody else we see in uniform in the United States \nof America.\n  After 9/11, there was an incredible demand around the country for \nhats and shirts that said ``New York Fire Department'' and ``NYPD'' \nbecause all of America realized the heroes these men were. When \neveryone else is running away from danger, the firefighters run into \ndanger. When everyone's instinct is to flee in fear, they face that \nfear and they go into the breach. Our police officers do it all the \ntime. In fact, this morning, the first people I saw when I came to the \nCapitol were Capitol police officers greeting me, checking my car, and \nstanding guard around the Capitol to make sure we are protected from \nsomeone who would want to do our country harm.\n  The irony of this debate is that all of those people I just talked \nabout have these basic worker protections. Those men who gave their \nlives on 9/11 trying to save lives all were operating under collective \nbargaining. The Capitol Police, who protect us every day, operate under \nthese same rules that my amendment is going to guarantee to the airport \nscreening officers.\n  Why in the world, if the sky is going to fall, if we give these \nworkers these basic protections, why hasn't it fallen? Border Patrol, \nCustoms agents, Coast Guard, FEMA, the Department of Defense civil \nemployees--they were all ordered to do things after 9/11, and they, of \ncourse, did them. No one thought twice about falling back on some kind \nof worker protection. Frankly, I think it is moderately insulting to \nthe men and women who are serving as screeners to act as if they would \nnot be directed and go in a time of emergency.\n  That is what my amendment does. It says that the head of TSA, the \ndirector of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Homeland Security, has \nthe ability, at any time when there is a threat or an emergency, to \ndirect these officers to do whatever is necessary to protect our \ncountry and the people who live here. It goes even further. It says \nthey can't even bargain for higher pay, and it provides some of the \nsame protections provided in the amendment of the Senator from Maine.\n  I can't figure out why the idea that they would have worker \nprotections through a collective bargaining agreement is so scary when \nyou realize that most of the men and women around our country who are \nfighting fires and performing work are operating under those \nagreements, and obviously most of the Federal employees who do similar \nwork in the Federal Government.\n  There are so many things that have been claimed about this which \nsimply aren't true. One of my favorites is that it is going to cost \n$160 million. Now, I can't quite figure out--and I know that somehow, \nsomething that costs a little ends up costing a lot sometimes in the \nFederal Government. First they said it was going to be $350 million. I \nthink that figure made even them blush, so then they brought the figure \ndown to $160 million. Maybe it is going to take 7 to 12 people across \nthe country. I can't imagine where they would get a number like that to \nthrow around. I have heard they will be required to negotiate every \nsecurity protocol. That is simply not true. Federal employees have no \nright to bargain over an agency's internal security practices.\n  There has been a lot of fiction that has been spread around the \nCapitol over the last few days about this amendment and what it will \nprovide. It is going to provide something very simple: It is going to \ntreat these officers who are screening men and women every day at our \nairports the same way the rest of the employees in FEMA are treated, \nthe rest of the employees in Homeland Security are treated, our Capitol \nPolice, our Coast Guard, our Border Patrol, and the men and women who \nwent into the burning buildings on 9/11, to lose their lives in order \nto try to save lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to talk about a couple of the \namendments that we have to the so-called 9/11 bill that is pending--an \namendment which I hope can be adopted, one of which I talked about \nyesterday, which deals with the support for terrorists.\n  Believe it or not, we don't have adequate criminal penalties for \npeople who support rewarding terrorists for their actions or their \nfamilies or those who support them. So one of the things we want to do \nis to ensure that we have a statute that can be enforced that says, if \nyou are aiding the family or associates of a terrorist with the intent \nto encourage terrorist acts, that will be a crime prosecutable in the \nUnited States.\n  I talked yesterday about an example that illustrates the need for \nthis statute. In August of 2001, a Palestinian suicide bomber attacked \nthe Sbarro pizza parlor in Jerusalem, and 15 people were killed. One of \nthem was an American citizen, Shoshana Greenbaum, who was a \nschoolteacher, and she was pregnant. She was killed. Right after the \nbombing took place, the family of the suicide bomber was told to go to \na particular Arab bank, and the bomber's family began receiving money \nfrom that bank. Eventually, a $6,000 lump sum payment was made.\n  According to press accounts, this is not uncommon. In fact, it is \nfrequently the way suicide bombers have been funded through this \nparticular Arab bank. Others are funded in other ways. There are plenty \nof news accounts of Saudi charities, the Palestinian Authority, and \neven Saddam Hussein was known to have rewarded suicide bombers for \ntheir acts. There is a BBC report that Saddam Hussein paid a total of \n$35 million to terrorist families during their time. Obviously, we \nwould like to discourage that.\n  It is at least possible that if we can criminalize this activity that \nhas a relationship to Americans, we would be able to make a difference, \nat least in some instances, in terms of whether a person would actually \ndecide to commit a suicide bombing, based upon the fact that that \nperson's family was going to be recompensed.\n  This amendment would make it a Federal crime, with extraterritorial \njurisdiction in cases linked to U.S. interests, to pay the families of \nsuicide bombers and terrorists with the intent to facilitate a \nterrorist act.\n  I hope this amendment can be adopted and that it will survive a \nconference committee. I see no reason that we could not have bipartisan \nsupport for it. The other thing that this amendment does is deal with \nthe real workhorse of our law enforcement with respect to going after \nterrorists, the so-\n\n[[Page S2747]]\n\ncalled material support statutes. It increases the maximum penalties \nfor various material support statutes. I emphasize it increases the \nmaximum, not the minimum, because there are certain situations in which \nsometimes you want to charge the minimum or plead down to the minimum. \nWe don't want to affect that; we want to increase the maximum in \ncertain instances.\n  The material support statutes have been the Justice Department's \nworkhorse in the war against terror, counting for a majority of the \nprosecutions that the Department has brought. It has been very \neffective, also, in starving terrorist groups of resources, which is \none of the critical ways to disrupt the cells, we believe.\n  The amendment increases the penalty in the following ways: Giving \nmaterial support for a designated terrorist organization would be a \nmaximum of 25 years, up from 15. Material support in the commission of \na particular terrorist act is increased from a maximum number of 15 to \na maximum of 40 years. That can obviously be a very severe act against \nU.S. interests. The maximum penalty for receiving military-type \ntraining from a foreign terrorist organization would be increased from \n10 to 15 years. The amendment also adds attempts and conspiracies to \nthe substantive offense of receiving military-type training and denies \nFederal benefits to persons convicted of terrorist offenses.\n\n  All of these are designed to add to the ability of our prosecutors to \ngo after people who are actually the ones who are enabling the \nterrorists to perform their heinous acts.\n  Finally, the amendment expands existing proscriptions on the murder \nor assault of U.S. nationals overseas for terrorist purposes, so that \nthe law punishes attempts and conspiracies to commit murder equally to \nthe substantive offense. The amendment adds a new offense of kidnapping \na U.S. national for terrorist purposes, regardless of whether a ransom \nis demanded. There are some limits in existing law that were put in the \nact before the new techniques and methodologies of terrorists in \ntoday's world began to be implemented; for example, requiring a ransom. \nWe know today that some of these terrorist kidnappings are not for the \npurpose of getting ransom, they are for the purpose of terrorizing. If \nthat is the case, then this statute would be usable by our law \nenforcement authorities.\n  Finally, the amendment adds sexual assault to the types of injury \nthat are punishable under the existing offense of assaults that result \nin serious bodily injury.\n  Once again, I hope this will be considered an appropriate addition to \nthe 9/11 legislation to make it easier for us to deny the funding to \nterrorist organizations and to deny funding to people who would be \nengaged in suicide attacks.\n  The other amendment is an amendment to a provision of the bill that \nwas added by Senator Feingold relating to data mining, which requires \nevery Federal agency to submit reports to Congress on any search of a \ndatabase that its employees perform in order, and I am quoting now, \n``to discover or locate a predictive pattern or anomaly indicative of \nterrorist or criminal activity.'' Among other things, the report is \nrequired to include a thorough description of the data-mining \ntechnology that is being used or will be used.\n  Obviously, that probably is going to be getting into very classified \ninformation, and there are two things we want to ensure are changed in \nthis provision. For one thing, the language in the bill does not \ninclude language that is included in other sections. It does not \nprevent disclosure of existing patents, trade secrets, proprietary \nbusiness processes or intelligence sources and methods.\n  I suspect that is an oversight. We need to include that because, in \nthe past, when Congress has required the Executive to make reports on \nsensitive technologies to Congress, it has been careful to prevent the \nexposure of this type of information about patents and trade secrets, \nand so on. I hope we can include that in the legislation, and my staff \nhas been talking to Senator Feingold's staff to see if they would be \nwilling to do so.\n  The other aspect is trying to protect the information that is \nclassified. Originally, there was a concern that we were too broad with \nour proscription in trying to prevent classified information from being \nreleased to the public. So what we did was to modify the amendment to \nsimply require that in the case of disclosure by Members of Congress or \nstaff, this would be impermissible for classified information. If we \nare going to ask for reports of classified information, clearly, we \nshould be willing to enforce the proscription on the release of that \ninformation. I am hoping we would be willing to do that as well.\n  That is the second amendment. I hope my colleagues will be willing to \nsupport both amendments. I think they will add to the benefits of this \nlegislation. With respect to at least one of these amendments, it is \ngermane postcloture, but I am hoping we can get them both resolved \nbefore cloture is invoked on the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for \namendment 342. I am proud to join my good friend, the Senator from \nMaine, the ranking member of the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs, in cosponsoring this amendment.\n  For the past several days, this body has been debating various \namendments regarding the workforce authorities for the Transportation \nSecurity Administration. I would ask my colleagues to stop for a moment \nand consider the situation before us. The establishment of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is one of the largest undertakings this \nGovernment has initiated since the creation of the Department of \nDefense in 1947. It includes a merger of 22 agencies and approximately \n180,000 employees. This merger is so complicated that the Government \nAccountability Office has identified the implementation and \ntransformation of the Department as one of the 27 areas designated as \nhigh risk, subject to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.\n  Many of my colleagues will recall the debate the Senate engaged in \nduring the creation of the TSA. The Senate debated basic questions such \nas whether the screening function should be federalized. There was a \nlot of debate that it ought not to be federalized; that we should let \nthe private sector do it. In the end, screeners were federalized, and \nTSA was charged with hiring approximately 55,000 screeners, or \ntransportation security officers, in 1 year.\n  I cannot think of a greater Government undertaking than creating an \nagency overnight to secure the safety and security of our airports and \nthe traveling public in order to guarantee we never have another 9/11. \nI am absolutely convinced that if Congress did not provide TSA with the \nworkforce flexibilities it did, TSA would never have met its statutory \nmandate to stand up in 1 year. Think about that. We got that done in 1 \nyear.\n  My colleagues know I have not been the biggest fan of the Department \nof Homeland Security. I am still upset that the only high-risk area \nidentified by GAO that does not have a strategic plan in place is DHS. \nThat is why I am so pleased the underlying bill contains an amendment I \noffered in committee to establish a chief management officer for the \nDepartment. This 5-year term appointment is crucial to leading the \ntransformation of the Department so it does not hobble along from one \nadministration to another, struggling to complete its merger and its \nmission.\n  I hope my colleagues have had the opportunity to meet with Assistant \nSecretary Kip Hawley, the TSA Administrator, who I think is one of the \nfinest public administrators whom I have met so far in this \nadministration. Mr. Hawley was confirmed in this position in July of \n2005. This is the second position at TSA he has held. In October 2001, \nMr. Hawley was the senior adviser for the project team that worked to \nstand up the Agency. While TSA is by no means perfect, it is one of the \nmore successful operating components of DHS. I wish others were as \ngood.\n  There is no question our enemies want to do harm to us through our \nairline and transportation systems. This threat is unrelenting, and TSA \nmust be flexible, nimble, and innovative in order to respond to the 24-\nhour, 7-day-a-week threat we have. The threat is out there constantly. \nIt is not akin to something that happens every so often. It is there 24 \nhours a day.\n  Granted, as in all organizations, human capital at TSA is not \nperfect,\n\n[[Page S2748]]\n\nbut I have not seen any evidence that we need to throw the baby out \nwith the bathwater; in other words, get rid of the system in place now \nand go to something else. There is no evidence to support this \ndismantling of TSA's personnel system and beginning anew, as the \nSenator from Connecticut has suggested.\n  To my knowledge, the Senate has had one hearing on the TSA workforce, \nand that hearing was held this Monday in the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs, of which I am the ranking member. \nThis hearing was conducted after the committee adopted the amendment by \nthe Senator from Connecticut. One can only conclude that the amendment \nwas offered in response to labor's unhappiness. Labor was unhappy \nseveral years ago that the title V provisions were waived for TSA. In \nother words, we gave them a separate personnel system because we wanted \nto see it get up and go and have the flexibility to get the job done.\n  On the other hand, based on the information presented at the hearing \non Monday, I believe some reforms to TSA's personnel authority are \nnecessary at this time. This is this compromise. That is why I am happy \nto join with my colleagues, including the Senator from Maine, the \nsenior Senator from Alaska, and the senior Senator from Virginia, in \noffering this amendment.\n  While TSA has moved and continues to move in the right direction in \nproviding safeguards for its employees, there is more we in Congress \ncan do. After hearing testimony during Monday's hearing, I think it \nappropriate for the TSOs to be included in some basic workforce \nprotections.\n  While the Office of Special Counsel did not have statutory authority \nto investigate whistleblower claims at TSA, TSA and the Office of \nSpecial Counsel worked together to develop and implement a memorandum \nof understanding allowing the OSC to investigate retaliation claims. In \nother words, they got involved through a memorandum. This was signed in \n2002, and since that time OSC has received 124 whistleblower \ncomplaints.\n  While I applaud TSA for taking this step and signing the MOU, I \nbelieve it is important for Congress to extend through statute the full \nauthority of OSC and the Federal courts to investigate and hear cases \nof whistleblower retaliation. Let's change the law. Let's give them \nthat right.\n  After Monday's hearing, I also believe it is important to extend to \nTSO the ability to file a complaint with the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard for an adverse action. This would include removal, suspension for \nmore than 14 days, demotion, reduction in pay, or furlough. While I \napplaud TSA for developing and implementing a robust internal process, \nincluding an Ombudsman Office, Disciplinary Review Board, and Peer \nReview Board--they put all that in place--I believe the value of \nindependent review of the MSPB that could follow the internal process \nis important to build further confidence in TSA's system and reassure \nthose being hired and on the job. So you are going to have that \navailable to you under the Collins amendment.\n  In the unfortunate circumstances when claims are filed with OSC, or \nshould the Collins amendment be adopted, with MSP, TSOs also have the \nright to union representation during these proceedings. A lot of people \nare not aware of this fact, that we have members of 13 unions of the \n42,000 TSOs. Some people got the idea that because we gave them the \nflexibility, they couldn't join a union. The fact is, they have joined. \nMany of them have joined a union, and the unions can represent them in \nthe various appeals they may have in terms of personnel matters. \nHowever, something I learned during Monday's hearing is that the \nprovision in the underlying bill would have a much broader implication \non the workforce than reforming the personnel system. Using the \nauthority in the Aviation Transportation and Security Act, TSA has been \nable to develop and implement the most extensive pay-for-performance \nsystem in the Federal Government. Did you hear that? Pay for \nperformance in the Federal Government. That is a big deal. That is \nsomething which some of us have been working on--I have--for the last 8 \nyears.\n  TSA has not developed this system in a vacuum. It received input from \napproximately 4,000 TSOs through 25 focus groups, and after the initial \ndesign, performance, accountability, and standards system--they call it \nPAF; that is their pay for performance--it was reviewed subsequently by \nfocus groups and online surveys for additional feedback from the \nworkforce.\n  Perhaps more than any Member of this Senate, I have devoted extensive \ntime, as chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee on the \noversight of Government and the Federal workforce, to understand and \ndevelop ways to recruit, retain, and reward people who work in the \nFederal Government. I have partnered successfully with my colleagues to \nenact legislation to provide agencies with even greater flexibility to \nmeet their workforce needs.\n  We know that in order to be successful, we must have the right people \nwith the right skills, with the right knowledge at the right place and \nat the right time. I do not believe it is appropriate for Congress to \nroll back any reform or flexibility without due consideration. Again, I \nremind my colleagues, the only hearing on this issue was held this \nweek.\n  As I mentioned, I am a strong supporter of pay for performance. Here \nin TSA, the Federal Government has the largest group of employees under \nthis system. The Government-wide Senior Executive Service covers only \n6,000 employees, and the Department of Defense has made decisions for \nonly 11,000 employees--in other words, 11,000 people in the Defense \nDepartment under pay for performance, 6,000 in the Senior Executive \nService, and we have almost 55,000 in the TSA who are in pay for \nperformance. Time and time again, Federal unions argue against pay for \nperformance. This is a big deal. My colleagues ought to understand what \nthis is about.\n  Monday, the president of the National Federation of Government \nEmployees reasserted his union's opposition to pay for performance. He \ndoesn't want pay for performance. If you ask the American people, they \nwill tell you they would like to see pay for performance. At a hearing \nof the Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management and the \nFederal Workforce that I chaired last year, unions testified against \nlegislation I introduced that would have required at least a three-\ntiered rating system and prevented an employee whose job performance \nwas unsatisfactory from receiving an annual pay increase.\n  I am concerned that changing the personnel system and potentially \nmaking it subject to collective bargaining would set back the progress \nTSA has made. My colleagues must remember that TSA has existed for just \nover 4 years and its performance and standards system is just a year \nold. GAO noted that it takes about 4 or 5 years to properly assess a \nperformance management system. We are not yet in a position to judge \nhow the TSA system is working.\n  The TSA's authority has allowed it to develop and implement \ninnovative approaches through its strategic human capital management. \nTSA would lose that authority if the underlying provision of S. 4 were \nto be enacted into law. For example--this is really something unique--\nTSA has initiated a pilot program to provide health care benefits to \npart-time screeners. They know they need full time and part time. But \nmost of the time, part-time people do not get health insurance. They \nare doing that right now. So if you look at some of the really neat \nthings they are doing over there, it just does not make sense for us to \npull the plug.\n  TSA recognizes the negative impact every screener who leaves TSA has \non its ability to secure our transportation system. They know it costs \n$12,000 to hire and train a new screener. TSA knows it is in their best \ninterests to retain every member of its dedicated workforce. They care \nabout their employees. They want to motivate them; they want to reward \nthem; they want to retain them, they want to reward them.\n\n  Another key provision of the Collins amendment is the reports \nproviding assessment of employee matters by GAO and TSA within a year. \nA year from now, let's look at what is going on over there.\n\n[[Page S2749]]\n\n  Congress must use this opportunity to fulfill its oversight objective \nand understand the strengths and shortfalls of the TSA system to make \nimprovements. It is not appropriate for Congress to summarily dismiss \nall the work TSA has invested in its workforce just because a large \nGovernment employees union doesn't like it.\n  The main consideration we should have as Members of the Senate is the \nsecurity of the people in the United States of America. Yes, we want to \nprotect the rights of the people who work in the Federal Government. \nBut if we have a system that is really working and making some real \nimprovement and making sure we are not going to have another 9/11 from \nan airborne attack, we ought to let them continue to do the job they \nare doing and should not just snap our fingers and say: These people \nare unhappy about what is going on there. They think we ought to get \nrid of that system. I don't think we should do that. I think every \nMember of this Senate should think about it. This is real serious \nbusiness.\n  I know people on the other side of the aisle are under a lot of \npressure. So am I. I know the president of both of the major unions \nhere, and I have worked with them and tried in all these changes we \nhave made in the human capital laws of the United States of America to \ntake their concerns into consideration. But on this one, I am really \nbegging my friends on the other side of the aisle to really look at \nwhere we are today and what this is all about and not throw the baby \nout with the bath water.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I may first ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate stand in recess at 10:40 subject to the call; and that \nat 1:30 p.m. today, there be 15 minutes of debate equally divided and \ncontrolled prior to a vote in relation to the McCaskill amendment No. \n316, as modified, followed by a vote in relation to the Collins \namendment No. 342; that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided \nbetween the votes and that no amendments be in order to either \namendment prior to the vote; that at 1:45 p.m., without further \nintervening action or debate, the Senate proceed to vote in the order \nspecified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to clarify the status of amendment No. 286, which I laid down \nyesterday, the habeas corpus amendment. I just discussed with the \nSenator from Connecticut a unanimous consent request that I would make \nto get recognition when we resume after King Abdullah's speech. Might I \ninquire of the Senator from Connecticut what the sequence would be as \nto a continuation of the debate on the habeas corpus amendment?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I may through the Chair, there are a \nnumber of Senators who said they wanted to come and discuss amendments \nafter the Senate reconvenes. How much time did the Senator from \nPennsylvania desire to discuss the habeas amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is hard to say because there are a number of Senators \nwho want to debate the issue. I am advised that there is not a \nwillingness to give a time agreement, so it is not possible to really \nanswer that question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Understood. Maybe I misled the Senator \nunintentionally. I am not looking for a time agreement on debate on the \namendment; I would just like to know how long he would like to speak \nwhen we reconvene so we set it down for a time limit because I know \nthere are other Senators from both parties who want to come over.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would like 1 hour.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would accept that amendment to my request, with the \nunderstanding that not interfere with the fact that by 1:30, we will go \nback to the Collins and McCaskill amendments. I don't think it would.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might be recognized at noon when we \nreturn after the Abdullah speech?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I just want to be clear that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania will not be changing the agreement the Senator from \nConnecticut just announced that will allow the 15 minutes of debate \nprior to the 1:45 votes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Not at all. Mr. President, I again ask unanimous \nconsent on the unanimous consent agreement that I proposed with regard \nto the votes on the Collins and McCaskill amendments, and then we will \ncome directly to Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized when the \nSenate reconvenes at 12:00 to speak for 1 hour.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Madam President, I have sought recognition to debate \namendment No. 286, which would reverse the provision in the Military \nTribunal Act which has limited the jurisdiction of the Federal courts \nin habeas corpus proceedings.\n  The essential question at issue is whether the combatant status \nreview tribunals are adequate and effective to test the legality of a \nperson's detention.\n  What we are dealing with here is an examination of the issue as to \nwhether the procedures are fundamentally fair. Congress should repeal \nthe provisions of the Military Commissions Act which limit Federal \ncourt jurisdiction on habeas corpus.\n  The decision by the court of appeals, I submit, will be overturned by \nthe Supreme Court of the United States because of Circuit Court's \nruling that the Rasul case dealt only with the statutory provisions on \nhabeas corpus. The Circuit Court ignored the binding language of Rasul, \nwhich said that the habeas corpus rights were grounded in common law in \neffect in 1789 and were, in fact, part of the Constitution. Where \nhabeas corpus is a right in the Constitution, and it is such a right \nbecause the Constitution expressly states that habeas corpus shall not \nbe suspended except in cases of invasion or rebellion--and no one \ncontends that there is either invasion or rebellion at issue--\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\nCongress cannot legislate a derogation of that constitutional right. \nAny act of Congress is obviously trumped by a constitutional provision. \nWhere you have habeas corpus in effect in 1789 and the constitutional \nprovision prohibiting its suspension, the legislation passed in the \nMilitary Commission Act I think ultimately will be determined by the \nSupreme Court to be unconstitutional, pretty clearly on the face of the \nopinion of the Court articulated by Justice Stevens.\n\n  The Congress ought to reverse the provision of the Military \nCommission Act which strikes or limits Federal court jurisdiction on \nhabeas corpus because the provisions--the way the detainees are being \ndealt with, simply stated, is not fundamentally fair. It does not \ncomport with due process of law, and due process is a right even \nwithout specific enumeration in the Constitution.\n  The order establishing the Combat Status Review Tribunal provides as \nfollows:\n\n       For purposes of this order, the term ``enemy combatant'' \n     shall mean an individual who was a part of or supported \n     Taliban or al-Qaida forces or associated forces that are \n     engaged in hostilities against the United States or its \n     coalition partners. This includes any person who has \n     committed a belligerent act or who has directly supported \n     hostilities in aid of enemy forces.\n\n  The fact is that people are detained as enemy combatants without any \nshowing of those basic requirements.\n  The next section of the order establishing the Combatant Status \nReview Tribunal provides:\n\n       All detainees shall be notified--\n\n  Skipping some language--\n\n       of the right to seek a writ of habeas corpus in the courts \n     of the United States.\n\n  I have not seen any reference to this provision in any of the \nadjudications, and I found this on the very extensive research which my \nstaff and I have undertaken to prepare for this debate. But there you \nhave it. The order itself setting up the Combat Status Review Tribunal \nsays that the detainees have the right to seek a writ of habeas corpus. \nThe Secretary of Defense has the authority to establish the rules, and \nhe has established the rule which gives the detainee the right to seek \na writ of habeas corpus. That ought to end the argument right there.\n  Let's proceed further to see, in fact, what happens when these \nmatters are taken before the Combat Status Review Tribunal. We have the \nopinion of U.S. District Judge Green in a case captioned, ``In Re: \nGuantanamo Detainee Cases,'' in which Judge Green writes as follows:\n\n       The inherent lack of fairness of the CSRT's consideration \n     of classified information not disclosed to the detainee is \n     perhaps most vividly illustrated in the following \n     unclassified colloquy which was taken from a case not \n     presently before this judge which exemplifies the practical \n     and severe disadvantages faced by all Guantanamo prisoners. \n     [I read] a list of allegations forming the basis for the \n     detention of Mustafa Ait Idir, a petitioner in Boumediene v. \n     Bush case--\n\n  And that parenthetically is the case decided by the Court of Appeals \nfor the third circuit.\n  This is what Judge Green goes on to point out in her opinion in the \nFederal Reporter:\n\n       While living in Bosnia, the detainee associated with a \n     known al-Qaida operative.\n       In response, the following exchange occurred:\n       Detainee: Give me his name.\n       Tribunal President: I do not know.\n       Detainee: How can I respond to this?\n\n  Skipping some irrelevant language, the detainee goes on to say:\n\n       I asked the interrogators to tell me who this person was. \n     Then I could tell you if I might have known this person, but \n     not if this person is a terrorist. Maybe I knew this person \n     as a friend. Maybe it was a person that worked with me. Maybe \n     it was a person that was on my team, but I do not know if \n     this person is Bosnian, Indian, or whatever. If you can tell \n     me the name, then I can respond and defend myself against \n     this accusation.\n       Tribunal President: We are asking you the questions and we \n     need you to respond to what is in the unclassified summary.\n\n  Skipping some irrelevant materials, the detainee then goes on to say:\n\n       But I was hoping you had evidence that you could give me. \n     If I was in your place--and I apologize in advance for these \n     words--but if a supervisor came to me and showed me \n     accusations like these, I would take these accusations and I \n     would hit him in the face with them. Sorry about that.\n\n  Then, parenthetically, Judge Green's opinion notes that ``Everyone in \nthe tribunal laughs.''\n\n       Tribunal President: Well, we had to laugh, but that is OK.\n\n  A little later in the opinion--\n\n       The detainee says: What should be done is you should give \n     me evidence regarding these accusations, because I am not \n     able to give you any evidence. I can just tell you no, and \n     that is it.\n\n  Then Judge Green goes on to say:\n\n       The laughter reflected in the transcript is understandable. \n     And this exchange might have been truly humorous had the \n     consequences of the detainee's enemy combatant status not \n     been so terribly serious, and the detainee's criticism of the \n     process had not been so piercingly accurate.\n\n  Well, this case illustrates the fact that the provisions in \nGuantanamo on the detainee status review tribunal is a laughing stock. \nIt hardly comports with what the Secretary of Defense said was \nrequired: that there has to be evidence that the individual supported \nTaliban or al-Qaida forces or committed a belligerent act.\n  The Judiciary Committee held a hearing and one of our witnesses was a \ndistinguished attorney, Thomas Sullivan, who made available a series of \ncases before the Combat Status Review Tribunal. This is one \nillustrative case involving a man named ``Abdul-Hadi al Siba.'' I take \nthis from the extract of what the witness provided:\n\n       The Combat Status Review Tribunal stated that al Siba was \n     charged with being captured in crossing the border into \n     Pakistan with having volunteered for a charity that was \n     funded by al-Qaida. That is all that is in the summary.\n\n  Again, this hardly comports with the standard by the Department of \nDefense itself that there is supposed to be evidence which would show \nthe detainee was engaged in hostilities against the United States or \ncommitted belligerent acts.\n  The provisions of the Department of Defense establishing the Combat \nStatus Review Tribunals is fundamentally unfair under the most basic \nprinciple of Anglo-Saxon American jurisprudence. The rules are:\n\n       Preponderance of evidence shall be the standard used in \n     reaching the determination, but there shall be a rebuttable \n     presumption in favor of the government's evidence.\n\n  That is the most extraordinary standard which I have ever seen, and \nit is bedrock Americana that people are presumed innocent. But instead, \nwhen a detainee faces a Combat Status Review Tribunal, the presumption \nis that he is guilty. That hardly comports with a standard of \nfundamental fairness or due process.\n  The rules promulgated by the Department of Defense call for a \npreponderance of evidence, so even if there is a presumption of guilt, \nthe standards do require some evidence. But that was not present in the \ncase cited by Judge Green, not present in the cases cited by Thomas \nSullivan at our Judiciary Committee hearing.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the summary of other \ncases provided by Mr. Sullivan be included in the Record at the \nconclusion of my presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The standards which have been established, which would, \nunder some circumstances, permit a substitute procedure for habeas \ncorpus were articulated by the Supreme Court of the United States in \nthe case of Swain v. Pressley. In that case, the Supreme Court said \nthere could be a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor \nineffective to test the legality of a person's contention.\n  But the collateral remedy which was present in Swain v. Pressley is a \nfar cry from the provisions of the Combat Status Review Tribunal.\n  What the Supreme Court was dealing with in the Swain case was habeas \ncorpus before a State court as opposed to habeas corpus before a \nFederal court. In Swain, the Supreme Court said that the ``relief \navailable in the Superior Court is neither ineffective nor inadequate \nsimply because the judges of that court do not have life tenure.''\n  So here we have a State court functioning under the rules of habeas \ncorpus and the Supreme Court says that is an equivalent of Federal \ncourt habeas corpus because State court judges can make that \ndetermination and the only difference is that the State court judges do \nnot have wide tenure.\n  In Swain, the Supreme Court went on to say:\n\n       It is a settled view that elected judges of our State \n     courts are fully competent to decide Federal constitutional \n     issues.\n\n\n[[Page S2751]]\n\n\n  So there you have the constitutional issue decided. But the only \ndifference is that it is a State court. Well, that has absolutely no \nresemblance to the combat status review tribune. It hardly qualifies as \nan adequate substitute.\n  I want to proceed now to the issues that were articulated by the \nSupreme Court of the United States in Rasul, where I believe it is very \nclear cut that there is the ignoring of the language of the Supreme \nCourt, and a constitutional right and a right that was in effect in \ncommon law in 1789 will certainly be utilized by the Supreme Court in \ndealing with the circuit court opinion, which is directly inconsistent \nwith the language of Justice Stevens. This is what Justice Stevens said \nin the Rasul case, speaking for the Court:\n\n       Application of the habeas corpus statute to persons \n     detained at the base [referring to the Guantanamo base] is \n     consistent with the historical reach of the writ of habeas \n     corpus. At common law courts exercise habeas corpus over the \n     claims of aliens detained within the sovereign territory of \n     the realm, as well as the claims of persons detained in the \n     so-called ``exempt jurisdictions'' where ordinary writs did \n     not run, and all other dominions under the sovereign's \n     control. As Lord Mansfield wrote in 1759, even if a territory \n     was ``no part of the realm'', there was ``no doubt'' as to \n     the Court's power to issue writs of habeas corpus if a \n     territory was under the subjection of the crown.\n\n  The Supreme Court had already held in the trilogy of cases in 2004 \nthat the United States Government controlled Guantanamo Bay, so it was \nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States.\n  Justice Stevens goes on to point out that:\n\n       Later cases confirmed the reach of the writ depended not on \n     formal notions of territorial sovereignty, but rather on the \n     practical question of ``the extent and nature of the \n     jurisdiction or dominion exercised in fact by the crown.''\n\n  There again is the reference to the undeniable fact that the United \nStates controls Guantanamo and it is under United States dominion. The \ncourt of appeals concluded that the language about the existence of the \nwrit when the Constitution was adopted and the constitutional right of \nhabeas corpus was not resolved by Rasul, because the specific holding \nin Rasul was on the statutory provisions of section 2241.\n  The Stevens opinion says:\n\n       We therefore hold that section 2241 confers on the district \n     court jurisdiction to hear petitioner's habeas corpus \n     challenges to the legality of their detention at Guantanamo \n     naval base.\n\n  Now, the circuit court said that, well, is a holding based upon the \nstatute, but its limitation does not apply to a constitutional right or \nthe reach of the writ in effect in common law in 1789. How can it be \nthat the Supreme Court would say Guantanamo Bay is under United States \njurisdiction for the statutory right but outside of the jurisdiction \nfor the constitutional right? It stands the English language on its \nhead.\n  There have been a number of situations where--especially in the fifth \ncircuit--on death penalty cases the circuit has, in effect, ignored \nwhat the Supreme Court has had to say. It has been a highly critical \nSupreme Court which has then come to review those decisions. I suggest \nthat that would be the response when the Supreme Court comes to review \nthe circuit court opinion which ignores the plain language of the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  In dissent, Justice Scalia recognized the fact that the case of \nJohnson v. Eisentrager had been overruled. The court of appeals relies \nupon Johnson v. Eisentrager to hold that there is no jurisdiction over \nGuantanamo Bay. But this is what Justice Scalia, in dissent, had to say \nabout the overruling of Johnson v. Eisentrager. He called it \n``overturning of settled law.''\n  But the court of appeals did not view it as such. So when this case \ncomes before the Supreme Court, I think it is patently obvious that the \nlanguage of the Court will require reversal of the circuit court \ndecision.\n  I have been asked if I will yield for a unanimous consent request by \nSenator Lieberman, and I will do so.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \ntime allocated to the Senator from Pennsylvania expires at 1, the \nSenator from Minnesota be recognized for 10 minutes and, after that, \nthe Senator from Delaware be recognized for whatever amount of time he \nneeds until 1:30, when Senators Collins and McCaskill have 15 minutes \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the failure of the Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia to recognize the settled principles was the \nsubject of an analysis by the distinguished constitutional scholar Adam \nLiptak in the New York Times yesterday. It is worth notice. The \nanalysis said that:\n\n     what the Supreme Court says goes. Usually. But in a defiant \n     decision 2 weeks ago, a Federal Court of Appeals in \n     Washington conceded that it was ignoring parts of the 2004 \n     Supreme Court decision on the rights of a man held at \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. That can make the Supreme Court testy \n     and it may help the detainees.\n\n  The analysis goes on to paraphrase the powerful dissent of Judge \nJudith Rogers, who said her colleagues were thumbing their noses at the \nSupreme Court. Liptak notes that:\n\n       [Rogers stated that her colleagues] ``were ignoring the \n     Supreme Court's well-considered and binding dictum'' \n     concerning the historical roots and geographical scope of the \n     prisoner's basic rights and she cited the case from her own \n     court that said that such statements ``generally must be \n     treated as authoritative.''\n\n  The analysis goes on to say that:\n\n     almost 3 years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in Rasul that the \n     detainees possessed an ancient and fundamental right, the \n     right to challenge the justice of their confinement in court \n     by filing petitions for writs of habeas corpus.\n       In a crucial aside, in Rasul, Justice John Paul Stevens, \n     writing for the majority, said this right was not just a \n     result of a law passed by Congress but was grounded in the \n     Constitution. ``Application of the habeas statute to persons \n     detained in the base,'' he wrote, ``is consistent with the \n     historical reach of habeas corpus.''\n\n  Well, that lays it out in a pretty conclusive way that when the Court \nrules on a statute but says that the same right is embodied in the \nConstitution, Congress cannot pass a law which trumps the \nconstitutional provision, as articulated by the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  The Liptak analysis goes on to note this:\n\n       If that is a right, a new law pushed by the Bush \n     administration's Military Commissions Act could not have cut \n     off detainees' rights to habeas corpus. In a footnote, the \n     appeals court basically acknowledges that. But it ruled that \n     the Supreme Court's historical analysis was wrong and that \n     Justice Stevens' dictum could be ignored.\n\n  In the analysis commenting on the Johnson v. Eisentrager case, Liptak \nnoted as follows:\n\n       All of the points which were relied upon by the circuit \n     court, as Justice Stevens wrote in Rasul, counted in favor of \n     the Guantanamo detainees. ``They were not nationals of \n     countries at war with the United States''--\n\n  Which was the case in Eisentrager--\n\n       They have not been engaged in plotted acts of aggression \n     against the United States. They have never been afforded \n     access to any tribunal, much less charged with and convicted \n     of wrongdoing, and for more than 2 years they have been in \n     prison in territory over which the United States exercises \n     exclusive jurisdiction and control.\n\n  Well, this is a fairly brief analysis in the time which I have. But \nthe essence of it boils down to this: The Supreme Court--Justice \nStevens speaking for a majority--has ruled that the Federal habeas \ncorpus statute covers Guantanamo, that the rights were violated, and \nthat the statute carries out the constitutional law and the scope of \nthe writ in 1789, when the Constitution was adopted. And the Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit, in order to uphold the act, says the \nholding by Justice Stevens was only to a statute--and it is true \nCongress can change the statute--but ignores the plain language of \nJustice Stevens speaking for a majority of the Court that it is a \nconstitutional right.\n  That cannot be changed by an act of Congress, and the Supreme Court \nwill tell the court of appeals that when they get the case. Aside from \nthe issue of constitutionality, which will be decided by the Court, as \nto the procedures that are in effect in these combat status review \ntribunals, they do not measure up to the requirements of fundamental \nfairness. They do not honor what the Department of Defense laid down as \nthe basic rule that detainees are entitled to ``the right to seek a \nwrit of habeas corpus in the courts of the United States.''\n  That ought to be the end of it because the Secretary of Defense was \ngiven the responsibility to decide what\n\n[[Page S2752]]\n\nthe rules were, and he said one of the rules is that these detainees \ncan go to court. That is what an act of Congress has taken away, and \nthat is what ought to be reversed.\n  Then if we take a look at what has to happen in these proceedings \nbefore the Combat Status Review Tribunal, the term ``enemy combatant,'' \nwhich would qualify for detention, means an individual who was part of \nor supporting the Taliban or al-Qaida forces or has committed a \nbelligerent act or has directly supported hostilities in aid of enemy \nforces.\n  The individual in the court of appeals case cited by Judge Green, \nwhich I read at length, was only supposed to have talked to somebody \nfrom al-Qaida, and they couldn't even produce the identity of the \nindividual, which hardly measures up to the Department of Defense's \nstandard. It is just absolutely ludicrous. Then for the Department of \nDefense provisions to say that there is a presumption of guilt just \nturns American justice on its head. Even with a presumption of guilt, \nthe requirements are that there be evidence, and there is none in the \ncase cited by Judge Green and by Mr. Sullivan.\n  This is just the beginning of the argument. We will have other \nSenators come to oppose.\n  Let me advise my colleagues that there will be a portion of the \ndebate conducted in Room S-407, which is the room where we can discuss \nclassified information, because Senator Leahy and I have been reviewing \nthe rendition in the Arar case, and we have found that there was a \ndetermination that Arar had a status--which I cannot discuss in this \nChamber but can discuss only in S-407--which would warrant sending him \nto Syria. Arar was a Canadian citizen who came to the United States and \nwas detained for questioning at an airport in New York City when he \nwanted simply to transit and go to Canada. He was questioned by the \nFBI.\n  It has been well noted that the FBI does not agree with the other \ninterrogation practices which have been undertaken by the Government.\n  After that questioning, which was reportedly extensive, Arar was then \nsent to Syria. He came back and has filed suit alleging that he was \ntortured and subjected to brutal treatment.\n  The Canadian officials have considered the issue at length and have \npublished a three-volume set. It is a good visual for people to see, if \nanybody is watching on C-SPAN2.\n  This is volume 1 of the report relating to Maher Arar, this is volume \n2 on the report relating to Maher Arar, and this is the analysis and \nrecommendation. After undertaking this kind of an analysis, the \nCanadian Government apologized to Arar and paid him about $10 million, \nbut the U.S. Government continues to say that it was justified in \nsending Arar to Syria, where he was beaten.\n  These matters relating to rendition, I submit, are directly relevant \nto our consideration of whether the Federal courts need to be involved \nin determining the legality of Guantanamo detainees because this \nGovernment, in the war on terrorism--and there is no doubt about the \nimportance of our war on terrorism and the necessity for effective law \nenforcement. I led the Judiciary Committee to the reauthorization of \nthe PATRIOT Act, which gives law enforcement extensive authority. But \nthere are laws against torture. There are international covenants \nagainst torture. The submission of rendition is something that is going \nto have to come under some judicial supervision.\n  I am considering now legislation which would require Federal \nauthorities to go to court to establish probable cause and a basis for \nrendition before any American citizen or before anyone ought to be sent \nto a foreign country.\n  We have the allegations of the plaintiff in a case decided last week \nby the Fourth Circuit who was sent to Egypt and alleged that he was \ntortured there. The Fourth Circuit has held that the case cannot be \npursued because of a state secrets doctrine. That is a matter which is \ngoing to be reviewed on oversight by the Judiciary Committee.\n  We have 25 CIA agents under indictment now in Italy, and we have 13 \nCIA agents now under indictment in Germany. The international response \nis that the United States is undertaking a rendition in a way which is \nunsatisfactory to basic standards of decency and fairness.\n  The Judiciary Committee has held hearings on Guantanamo. I visited \nGuantanamo. Not to have those detainees have the right of habeas corpus \nand Federal court review is totally at variance with the very basic \ntenets of Anglo-Saxon and American jurisprudence.\n  I cannot say anything more about Arar, but it can be discussed in S-\n407, which is the room we go to when we have matters to discuss which \nare classified. I believe it is a very compelling case that there needs \nto be judicial intervention or needs to be a lot more oversight than \nthere has been on these matters.\n  I might say, it is like pulling teeth to get the Department of \nJustice to make any information available. It takes a long time to have \naccess to the classified material, and then the material is \ninsufficient to come to a conclusion. In the Arar case, we have a \nrequest pending and don't know what the result will be. But we do know \nCanada made an exhaustive analysis of Arar and what he had done, and I \nthink I can say this: The materials in the classified documents relate \nto information substantially obtained from Canadian authorities, and \nCanada has made the inquiry and has apologized and paid some $10 \nmillion.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nSummaries of CSRT Examples Cited by Tom Sullivan at September 25, 2006 \n                              SJC Hearing\n\n\n                          Abdul-Hadi Al Siba'a\n\n       Al Siba'a is 34 year old Saudi Arabian who was taken into \n     custody in Pakistan in December 2001.

He has presented his passport and his airline \n     ticket. He has offered to have the Riyadh Police Department \n     verify his employment and the nature of his leave of absence. \n     Those requests were refused by the tribunal ``because an \n     employer has no knowledge of what their employees do when \n     they are on leave.''\n       After five years of detention, the government released Al \n     Sibai'i from Guantanamo Bay, and he returned to his home in \n     Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n                            Unnamed Detainee\n\n       One detainee, who is not named in the declassified \n     documents from the CSRT, is a Muslim man from Germany.

In order to understand the nature \n     of the charges against him, the detainee asked what evidence \n     the tribunal had to show that he was involved with a suicide \n     bomber.\n       The tribunal responded that they could not answer that \n     question and that ``anything remaining concerning [the \n     suicide bomber who the detainee was allegedly associated \n     with] is in the classified session.'' While the detainee \n     continued to be cooperative and answer the questions posed to \n     him by the CSRT, the Tribunal never provided him with an \n     explanation of the questions that it asked regarding his \n     associations with other individuals and organizations.\n\n\n                              ``Mustafa''\n\n       Arrested in Sarajevo, Bosnia, but originally of Algerian \n     descent.

Asked about his relationship to Abu Zubayda, whom \n     he denied knowing.\n       Mustafa was arrested and searched by ``international police \n     from the United Nations.'' Was told that if the Bosnians no \n     longer wanted him in their country, he would be welcome to \n     return to Algeria.\n       Asked his interrogator at GTMO, ``why, and if there were \n     any accusations or evidence against me. The interrogator said \n     to me that they would find something, meaning I could not be \n     released from Cuba without them finding some accusation \n     against me. I could not have been held in Cuba in prison for \n     three years, then all of a sudden be found innocent and \n     released.''\n\n[[Page S2753]]\n\n                           Abdur Sayed Rahman\n\n       Born in Pishin, Pakistan.

In the absence of any other Senator seeking recognition, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have a couple supplemental comments I \nwould like to make.\n  The requirement established by the Department of Defense that a \ndetainee shall be notified ``of their right to seek a writ of habeas \ncorpus in the courts of the United States'' was given to all the \ndetainees. So they have had it and relied upon it. I suggest that while \nnot legally the same, that any change in that policy is really in the \nnature of ex post facto, which is changing a rule and establishing \ncriminal liability after the fact, which is prohibited by the \nConstitution. It isn't quite that, but it has the same flavor, and it \nis the nature, also, of a bill of attainder, which is legislation that \nestablishes guilt as opposed to a judicial proceeding. What we have had \nhere, in effect, is legislation which has changed what the Department \nof Defense said the rights of the individuals would be.\n  I wish to cite, in addition, a quotation from Justice O'Connor in the \nHamdi v. Rumsfeld case, talking about combat status review boards, in \nwhich she said:\n\n       Any process in which the executive's factual assertions go \n     wholly unchallenged or simply presumed correct without any \n     opportunity for the alleged combatant to demonstrate \n     otherwise falls constitutionally short.\n\n  Justice O'Connor restates in shorthand the traditional presumption of \ninnocence which is turned on its head by the DOD regulations and says \nas a matter of Supreme Court ruling that without any opportunity to \ndefend, those presumed conclusions can't stand.\n  We saw the case of Judge Green, we saw the case cited by the witness \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, all of which shows the basic unfairness \nof what is going on in Guantanamo. The only way to correct it is \nthrough the traditional habeas corpus rights in Federal court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                          Veterans Health Care\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our \nbrave soldiers fighting overseas and in particular the nearly 3,000 \nMinnesota National Guard members who recently had their stays extended \nin Iraq. I wish to speak about our duty to these soldiers for their \nsacrifices on behalf of our Nation. It is an issue that must transcend \npartisanship.\n  Whether one supports the President's escalation or opposes it, as I \ndo, there is one point on which we can agree: We must support the \nsoldiers on the battlefield, and when they return home, we must give \nthem the support they need.\n  In the past 4 years, American military service personnel and their \nfamilies have endured challenges and stressful conditions that are \nunprecedented in recent history, including unrelenting operational \ndemands and recurring deployments in combat zones.\n  Mr. President, 1.5 million American service men and women have served \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. These wars are creating new generations of \nveterans who need their country to stand with them. Many of the \nsoldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan are doing it not only to \nserve their country but also to provide for their families.\n  One of these soldiers was Army SGT William ``B.J.'' Beardsley, who \nlived in Minnesota. Sergeant Beardsley joined the Army just after high \nschool and completed one term of service. But when his wife Stacy \nencountered medical ailments, Sergeant Beardsley decided to reenlist, \nin part so that his health insurance would cover the medical treatment \nhis wife required.\n  His personal sacrifice to family and country allowed his wife to \nsuccessfully undergo surgery. Tragically, the day Stacy left the \nhospital, Sergeant Beardsley was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq.\n  I have always believed that when we ask our young men and women to \nfight and die for this Nation, we make a promise that we will give them \nall the resources they need to do their job and when they return home, \nwe will take care of them and their families. Sergeant Beardsley will \nnot be coming home, but for too many of his fellow soldiers in Iraq and \nAfghanistan who do return, our promise to take care of them has \nrepeatedly been broken.\n  As a nation, we have an obligation to wrap our arms around the people \nwho serve us and who have sacrificed for us. Today, our veterans need \nus more than ever. While the President pushes ahead with his surge of \nadditional troops into Iraq's civil war, at home we are already \nexperiencing a vastly larger surge of returning soldiers, many of them \ncitizen soldiers from the National Guard and Reserves.\n  More than 3,000 have returned having made the ultimate sacrifice, \nleaving behind grieving families and communities. Tens of thousands \nhave come home physically wounded. Tens of thousands more return \nsuffering from post-traumatic stress, depression, and substance abuse \nas a result of their service. These are men and women who have served \nour country on the front lines, but on returning home too many have \nfound themselves shunted to the end of the line, left waiting to get \nthe health care they need, left waiting to receive the benefits they \nhave earned and, as the shocking revelations from Walter Reed show us, \nsome have been left waiting in the most squalid of conditions. We are \nnow learning this is not an isolated incident.\n  In Minnesota, one of those left waiting was Jonathan Schulze. \nJonathan, from Stewart, MN, was a 25-year-old marine who had fought in \nIraq and earned two Purple Hearts. He told his parents that 16 men in \nhis unit had died in 2 days of battle. When he returned home in 2005, \nthe war did not leave him. He suffered flashbacks and panic attacks. He \nstarted drinking heavily to stave off nightmares. According to VA \nSecretary Jim Nicholson, Jonathan was seen by the VA 46 times in \nMinneapolis and St. Cloud, MN, but this was not enough. In January, \nthis young war veteran hanged himself.\n  We now learn that the VA Medical Center in St. Cloud has 15 acute \ninpatient psychiatric beds, while a decade ago there were 198 beds. \nThat means the number of acute psychiatric beds available for veterans \nthere has declined by more than 90 percent in the past decade. It is as \nif nobody even realized that we have been at war for the past 4 years \nand that tens of thousands of Minnesotans have returned from combat, \nwith many more to come.\n  Our veterans didn't stand in long waiting lines when they were called \nup or volunteered to serve our Nation. So why are we asking them to \nstand in line now for medical care?\n  As a former prosecutor, there is a saying that ``justice delayed is \njustice denied.'' I would add that, for our veterans, ``health care \ndelayed is health care denied,'' and that, too, is an injustice. We \nneed to do better, much better, and we can.\n  In fact, we know what needs to be done. First, we need to stop \nshortchanging our veterans during the budget process. Just as this \nadministration sent our soldiers into battle without a plan for \nvictory, it also failed to develop a plan to address their needs once \nthey got home. The administration shockingly underestimated the number \nof veterans who would require medical care.\n  In its fiscal year 2005 budget request, the Department of Defense \nestimated\n\n[[Page S2754]]\n\nthat they would have to provide care for 23,500 veterans from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. In reality, more than four times that number required \nassistance. Last year, the Pentagon underestimated the number of \nveterans seeking care by 87,000.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the largest medical \nsystem in the Nation. It has a reputation for high-quality care, with \nmany talented, dedicated doctors, nurses, and other staff. The VA's \nresources, however, are now severely strained. The waiting list and \ndelays get longer. The shortages are especially severe in mental health \ncare. Last year, the VA underestimated the number of new post-traumatic \ncases by five times.\n  For the past several years, this administration has submitted a \nbudget request for the VA that significantly underfunded the needs of \nAmerica's 25 million veterans. This is from the same administration \nthat each year asks Congress to authorize tens of billions of dollars \nfor projects in Iraq. I was pleased that the continuing resolution, \npassed a few weeks ago, increased funding for the VA by $3.5 billion \nover fiscal year 2006 levels. However, this should only be the \nbeginning of a renewed commitment to our service men and women, both on \nthe front lines and on the home front.\n  When the President's budget comes to the Senate floor later this \nmonth, I will join my like-minded colleagues in pressing for a \nsubstantial increase in VA funding.\n  Second, we need to start treating our National Guard and Reserves \nlike the soldiers they are. Up to 40 percent of the troops fighting in \nIraq have been National Guard members and reservists. Minnesotans know \nall too well the burden being placed on our Guard forces. The National \nGuard was not built to serve as an Active-Duty force for prolonged \nperiods of time. Yet that is exactly what we are requiring them to do. \nGuard funding and benefits have not gone up correspondingly to match \nits increased duties.\n  Meanwhile, the Pentagon is stripping Guard units of their equipment \nin order to make up for shortages in supply. States rely on the \npresence of a strong and well-equipped Guard in order to respond to \ndomestic emergencies. Department of Defense policies have weakened the \nGuard to the point that a recent commission found that 88 percent of \nGuard units in the United States cannot meet preparedness levels.\n  It is time we recognize the elevated position and importance of the \nNational Guard to our national security. As a member of the National \nGuard Caucus, I support the National Guard Empowerment Act, which will \npromote the commander of the National Guard to a four-star general and \nmake him a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It will also grant the \nGuard more responsibility over coordinating Federal and local agencies \nduring emergencies.\n  We must also upgrade Guard members from their perceived status as \nsecond class veterans in other areas, including health care, pension \nplans, education, and reintegration programs. We need to do a better \njob of integrating our returning veterans back into our communities \nwhen they return. This is particularly hard for National Guard members \nwhen they do not have a base to go home to and have to go to literally \nthousands of communities and small towns across this country.\n\n  In Minnesota, we are proud to have created the Beyond the Yellow \nRibbon Program, which provides counseling and support to National Guard \nmembers and their families. Across my State right now, the National \nGuard is sponsoring a unique series of Family Reintegration Academies. \nSeveral weeks ago, I had the honor of attending one of these academies \nin Alexandria, MN. This pilot reintegration program has helped ease the \ntransition for soldiers and their families, and it has gotten fabulous \nreviews from the participating families.\n  What works in Minnesota can work in every State across the Nation. As \nwe enter this appropriations process, I will be working with my \ncolleagues to insist that the Federal budget include funding for \nreintegration programs for Guard members and reservists.\n  Third, we need to improve health care for all of our soldiers. The \nproblems found at Walter Reed are all too common at veterans hospitals \nand centers nationwide. I have joined my colleagues in legislation that \nwill begin to solve the personnel and building shortages at Walter Reed \nHospital and similar centers across the Nation. I also will join the \nDemocratic leadership in the Senate in their HEROES plan to provide \nmore oversight to veterans affairs and develop legislation to address \nthese problems.\n  One of the most glaring needs in veterans health care today is \nfunding for research and treatment of poly-\ntraumatic injuries. As Bob Woodruff of ABC News showed us so vividly \nlast week, with his own example and that of many other wounded \nsoldiers, brain trauma has become a signature injury of this war in \nIraq.\n  Minnesota is home to one of the VA's systems four polytrauma \nrehabilitation centers. The others are in Palo Alto, Richmond, and \nTampa. These centers were created in recognition of the large number of \nservice members sustaining multiple severe injuries as a result of \nexplosions and blasts. These centers provide a full array of inpatient \nand outpatient services, with specialized programs for traumatic brain \ninjuries, spinal cord injury, blind rehabilitation, and post-traumatic \nstress disorder.\n  I have visited the VA polytrauma brain center in Minneapolis. We need \nmore of these centers and more research into the permanent effects of \nbrain trauma caused by explosions on the battlefield. Our current VA \ninfrastructure is not equipped to deal with these injuries and to care \nfor brain-injured vets once they leave these specialized centers and \nreturn home. This must be a priority.\n  Another issue that is only beginning to receive sufficient attention \nis the proliferation of mental health disorders among veterans. \nAccording to a Veterans' Health Administration report, roughly one-\nthird of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who sought care through the VA \nwere diagnosed with potential symptoms of post-traumatic stress, drug \nabuse, or other mental disorders.\n  The Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act, introduced by my colleagues \nfrom Iowa, will help ensure 24-hour access to mental health care for \nveterans deemed at risk for suicide. It will create VA programs to help \nveterans cope with post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental \nillnesses that too often lead them to take their own lives. Nearly \n1,000 veterans who receive care from the VA commit suicide each year. \nIt is too late for Jonathan Schulze, but it is not too late for the \nmany other suffering soldiers who are at risk for suicide.\n  In the coming weeks and months, I hope to engage my colleagues to \ncooperate on new legislation that will increase the funding and \ncommitment to veterans mental health services. In past years, veterans, \nsuch as my father, could count on the fact that their Government would \nstand by them. After World War II, our Government did just that, \nadopting the GI bill to provide health, housing, and educational \nbenefits that gave returning veterans the help they needed to heal, to \nraise families, and to prosper.\n  At a time when we are spending billions on the reconstruction of \nIraq, funding for health care for veterans is far below what is needed. \nThose are the wrong priorities for our country. We cannot abandon the \nbrave soldiers who fought for us once they return.\n  In his Second Inaugural, President Lincoln reminded the American \npeople that in war we must strive to ``bind up the Nation's wounds, to \ncare for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his \norphan.'' Today, Americans are again called to bind up our Nation's \nwounds and to care for those who have borne the battle, as well as \ntheir families who have shouldered their own sacrifice.\n  Let us live up to this solemn obligation to bring our troops home \nsafely and to honor our returning soldiers and their families by giving \nthem the care and the benefits they have earned.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n       Amendments Nos. 383 and 384, En Bloc, to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send to the desk two amendments. I am \nonly going to speak to one, but I would like to send both to the desk \nso I have them offered.

Mr. President, with regard to the first amendment, No. \n383, which I am not going to take time to speak to today, is an \namendment that allows cities and States to reroute hazardous material \naround their cities. In a nutshell, and I know no one knows this better \nthan the Chair, and I mean that sincerely, these are 90-ton chlorine \ngas tank cars that go rolling through Newark on their way down through \nthe corridor into my State and across my State.\n  I once asked, not too long ago, the Naval Research Institute to give \nme an analysis of what would happen if one of those were to blow up in \na metropolitan area. They said that 100,000 people would die--100,000 \npeople would die. Yet this administration has opposed and we have not \ncommitted to allowing cities to reroute this hazardous material around \ntheir major metropolitan areas.\n  That is one amendment which I will come back to at another time.\n  At this moment I want to now speak to an amendment that is much \nbroader, Amendment No. 384.\n  We often say that September 11 changed everything. Well, it changed \neverything except it didn't change our behavior. It changed everything \nexcept\n\n[[Page S2756]]\n\nwhen we look at the budget of this administration in the last 6 years, \nor 4 years since then, and if we look at our tax policy since then, we \nlook at what hasn't changed.\n  My dad used to have an expression, Mr. President. You probably heard \nme say it before: Show me your budget, I will tell you what you value.\n  Tax cut after tax cut, overwhelmingly tilted to those who were at the \nhighest end of the tax bracket, is what this outfit has valued. The \ntruth is, we seem not to value protecting our cities, our homeland. The \ntruth is, as the Presiding Officer knows better than anyone, living on \nthe east coast in a State such as mine, only much larger, you know what \nthe costs of the 9/11 Commission recommendations are. You know how few \ndollars we have spent implementing the recommendations. Literally from \nyour home county, you could see the buildings collapse, the World Trade \nCenter towers collapse. Thousands of people from your State were \nsignificantly affected, many were killed.\n  We all ripped out our hair about how this was so terrible; we were \ngoing to not let this happen again. We went out there and took a real \ngood look at what needed to be done when the 9/11 Commission came \nalong. Precious little was done. Yet during the same period of time we \nmade sure to help people earning more than a million dollars a year. I \nam not picking on them. I am happy. I hope my grandkids make over a \nmillion dollars a year. I hope everybody in America can. I have no \nproblem with anybody making hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  One of the things we forget on the Senate floor is that those folks \nare just as patriotic as poor folks. Those folks are just as patriotic \nas middle-class folks. They didn't ask for these massive tax cuts. They \nare prepared to give some of them back in order to make the country \nmore safe, but we don't ask anything of them. So what happens? Just for \nthis year, for households making more than $1 million a year, to put \nthis in perspective, they are going to get a tax cut of $45 million. If \nyou look at it from 2008 to 2017, that aggregate tax cut, if you are at \nan income where you make more than a million dollars a year, is going \nto be $739 billion. Households with incomes of that magnitude obviously \ntake a big chunk of what are the fiscal priorities of this Nation.\n  We just had a long discussion here about the grant programs and how \nwe allocate funding to the various States. We debated that. But it is \nlike rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic unless there is actual \nmoney dedicated to provide for these needs. What we have not done is we \nhave not ensured a funding source. We have not provided the money \nneeded to implement the 9/11 Commission recommendations.\n  I say to my colleagues that we have money to fund these programs. \nWhen I raised this last year and I talked about how much money was \nneeded, as my friend from New Jersey has, they said: Oh, we can't \nafford it.\n  Give me have a break. We can't afford it? We can afford over $700 \nbillion in tax cuts for people making over $1 million a year, and we \ncan't afford it? I will point out that it comes to about a $50 billion \nprice tag over 5 years to implement all the 9/11 Commission Report. \nCan't afford it?\n  Let me point out that the Congressional Budget Office recently \nreleased a study indicating H.R. 1, the House counterpart to this bill, \nwill cost $21 billion, but the Senate bill we have here only costs $17 \nbillion. There are a few comprehensive estimates of what all the 9/\n11 recommendations would cost, but I did what you did, I say to the \nPresiding Officer, and what others did--I went to a bunch of very smart \npeople. I have been involved in this, as you have, from day one. We \nwent in and costed it out, what it would cost for the main \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. The truth is, we are easily \nable to fund it. It is a lot more than that; it is $50 billion over 5 \nyears, roughly.\n\n  In addition we are not prepared in terms of homeland security \nrelating to local cops, sheriffs--local police. If there is going to be \nsomebody who is trying to put sarin gas into a complex in your State or \nmine, it is not going to be some brave special forces soldier in \nfatigues wearing night-vision goggles who is going to figure this thing \nout; it is going to be a local cop riding behind the arena and seeing \nsomeone getting out of a dumpster. If we are going to break up these \nrings, it is going to be intelligence, but also it will be a local cop \nwalking a beat in Newark, NJ, or Wilmington, DE--or Newark, DE. ``By \nthe way, those three apartments that have been vacant for the last 7 \nyears, there are lights on in the window.''\n  What have we done? We slashed spending for local law enforcement. We \nslashed it $2.1 billion a year since this President has become \nPresident.\n  Show me your budget, I will tell you what you value. It is a little \nbit like taking care of veterans. Show me your budget, I will tell you \nwhat you value.\n  In addition, the study by the U.S. Conference of Mayors found that 75 \npercent of the cities in America do not have interoperable \ncommunications--75 percent. This is a disgrace. What do we need? We had \nHurricane Katrina, we had 9/11--what else do we need to demonstrate \nthat it is useful to have a local cop be able to speak to the National \nGuard that is called in, to be able to have somebody in the command \ncenter who can talk to everybody? Yet 75 percent of the cities do not \nhave interoperable communications capability--one of the strongest \nrecommendations made by the 9/11 Commission.\n  As I said, while there is not a comprehensive assessment, I have \nspent a lot of time talking to experts and found that roughly for an \nadditional $10.3 billion a year, we can implement all of the 9/11 \nrecommendations--all of them, including provisions in this title--and \ndo other commonsense things we know will make us more safe, such as \nreinvesting in local police.\n  The bottom line is this: If we simply commit to taking back a small \nfraction of the cuts for those making over $1 million a year, we can \npay for all the security upgrades we need. Here is how it would work. \nMy amendment simply puts the Senate on record calling for the Finance \nCommittee to report legislation to provide $53 billion in funding for \nhomeland security to be placed in the homeland security trust fund. It \nis called a Homeland Security and Neighborhood Safety Trust Fund. From \nthis trust fund, we require that spending be dedicated toward \ninitiatives and grant programs authorized in this legislation, \nincluding the Urban Area Security Initiative, the State Homeland \nSecurity Grant Program, emergency management performance grants, and \nrail and transit security grants. It would reinstate the COPS Program, \nthe FIRE Act grants, SAFER grants, and the Justice Assistance grants, \nwhich provide essential support to State and local police, allowing \nthem to coordinate with the Federal Government. It would be funding \nenhancements in interoperable communications, improve port security, \nincluding working toward 100 percent scanning of cargo containers, and \nupgrade and better prepare the Nation's public health sector to respond \nto acts of bioterrorism and nuclear terrorism.\n  I ask all my colleagues in earshot of my voice, go to the largest \ncities in your States and go to the emergency rooms in your hospitals. \nAsk how many times they have to close down their hospitals. They send \nout to all the ambulance drivers in the entire region that would be \nserviced by them a statement saying: We can't take any more today. What \nin God's name are we doing to prepare these hospitals and \ninfrastructure for a terrorist attack?\n  We also have to upgrade and develop new scanning technology to detect \ndangerous substances. That is what this money would be allowed to be \nused for.\n  When I introduced this legislation last year and got a vote, I \nexplained how I would allocate the $10.3 billion. I put $1 billion in \nhere for interoperability, I put in $1 billion to promote 100 percent \ncargo container scanning, $500 million to bolster the public health \ninfrastructure, and $100 million to improve government-wide information \nsharing. In order to leave what should be left--I took out these \nspecific allocations in order to give to my colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee and the Homeland Security Committee more \ndiscretion on how to spend the additional money in the outyears. I \nwithheld the specifics. It is just an order to the relevant committees \nto come up with how to spend that money.\n\n[[Page S2757]]\n\n  Any way you slice it, this will leave the most fortunate among us \nstill very fortunate but will take, from over $736 billion, $52 \nbillion. No one in this Chamber can tell me that there is anyone out \nthere who is going to say that is not fair. No one can tell me that \nwill have a scintilla of a negative impact on the economy. No one can \nargue, I respectfully suggest--and I invite them to do it--that, in \nfact, these things are not needed, what I am talking about here. These \nwere all talked about by various Senators.\n  The numbers are clear. Those who need the least help are getting the \nmost from the current tax cuts, and those fortunate Americans are twice \nblessed. They are blessed by our efforts in this bill, and they are \nblessed by the fact that they are doing very well through their own \nhard work.\n  I have said before, of the many opportunities squandered since 9/11, \nthe most tragic opportunity squandered by this administration is the \nfailure to call our country together, to give all of us a part to play \nin response to the new threats we face, not just middle-class folks who \nare sending their husbands, wives, sons, and daughters to Iraq and \nAfghanistan to try to protect us.\n  But despite the rhetoric that calls upon the proud recollections of \nour national purpose in conflicts such as World War II and the Cold \nWar, on this floor there has been an incredible vacuum of leadership. \nThose Presidents asked something of the American people. What has been \nasked except forfeit commitments to health care, education, and energy \nsecurity? And where does that burden fall? It falls on working women \nand men.\n  Let me just say as my time begins to expire that I know those who are \nvery well off. I know they are willing to do this. I had an opportunity \nto speak to a group of 50 people advertised to me as among the most \nwealthy people in the nation. It was a group of investors. I spoke \nbefore them, and I said to them that this is what I wanted to do. I \nsaid: Does anybody in here disagree with that? It was advertised to me \nthat a significant portion of these people were actually billionaires. \nWhen I raised that question, there was silence in the room, and finally \none guy honestly put his hand up.\n\n  He said: I am not too sure I am. I am not too sure you won't go out \nand waste the money.\n  I said: Will you support it if I come forward and do what I did in \nthe crime bill I wrote years ago, I drafted years ago--set up a trust \nfund, and the money we take from this tax cut to get this $50 billion-\nplus will be put into a trust fund, and it can only be used for \nhomeland security and neighborhood safety? Would you support it then?\n  I got an ovation, literally an ovation, mostly a standing ovation, I \nsay to you, Mr. President, from these extremely wealthy people. The \nwealthy are ready to commit just as the middle class and poor are.\n  Mr. President, I end where I began. As my dad used to say, don't tell \nme what you value, show me your budget. Don't anyone on this floor \npresume to tell me, in the years I have spent here, that this country \ncannot afford to spend, over the next 5 years, $10.2 billion a year to \nmake this Nation safer. Please don't anyone suggest that it is not \npossible to pay for this when, in fact, you have a tax policy that is \nso out of whack that even the people who are benefiting the most from \nit are willing to contribute to our national security. If we ask the \nsons and daughters, husbands and wives, mothers and fathers in each of \nour towns and cities to send their children, their husbands and wives \nto protect us abroad, we sure in the devil can ask the people making \nover $1 million a year--a total tax break of over $736 billion over the \nnext several years--to contribute $10.2 billion a year out of that tax \ncut. I am confident they are ready. They just need to be asked.\n  I hope, when the appropriate time comes, my colleagues will favorably \nconsider my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 316 and 342\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 15 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendments Nos. 316 and 342 \noffered by Senators McCaskill and Collins.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, if the Chair would inform me when I \nhave used 3 minutes because I want to yield my remaining time.\n  There have been so many things said about this amendment that are not \ntrue. I want to make sure my colleagues understand how many things are \nbeing said that are not true.\n  There is one truth everyone needs to embrace. That is, we are only \ntrying to give to the screening officers at airports the same worker \nprotections that we give so many of our men and women in uniform who \nare helping with our national security and safety. As I drove up this \nmorning to the Capitol, I was greeted by Capitol police officers. Does \nanyone doubt those Capitol police officers would do whatever is \nnecessary to try to protect us? Of course not. But yet those same \narguments are being used to try to discourage people from supporting \nthis amendment, that somehow if these workers are part of some \ncollective bargaining agreement, they will no longer be there at a \nmoment's notice to do whatever they are asked to secure our safety and \nsecurity.\n  As I said previously, how many Americans bought the NYPD shirts and \nhats and the New York fire department shirts and hats after 9/11? Those \nfirefighters in New York who went into that burning building losing \ntheir lives in the process, running into danger rather than away from \nit, all were working under a collective bargaining agreement. Does \nanyone doubt that they hesitated responding to an emergency because \nthey have basic worker protections? The notion is very un-American and, \nfrankly, it is mildly insulting to the men and women serving as \nofficers in our airports today.\n  The Border Patrol, same protections; Customs officials, same \nprotections; most of the employees in Homeland Security, the civilian \nemployees of the Department of Defense, FEMA employees, all of whom \nhave to respond to emergencies, all have these same basic worker \nprotections.\n  My amendment says they cannot collectively bargain for higher pay. My \namendment spells out clearly that the Secretary of Homeland Security \nand the Director of TSA have complete authority to mandate what these \nworkers do in times of an emergency. At the same time it is going to \nallow us to professionalize this workforce. This part of the Federal \nGovernment suffers from incredible turnover, as high as 50 percent. \nThat is a turnover rate that would be unacceptable in the private \nsector. It is inefficient. It is expensive. We are not getting the kind \nof experienced screeners who know what to look for and when to look for \nit based on their experience, not because of some job training program.\n  This amendment will provide those basic protections. It will \nprofessionalize the workforce. In the long run, it will make us all \nsafer.\n  I urge colleagues to support the McCaskill amendment. I yield the \nremainder of my time to Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains for both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator McCaskill has 4 minutes remaining, and \nSenator Collins has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to remind me when there \nis 1 minute remaining.\n  First, I commend the good Senator for offering this amendment. It is \nimportant to understand what it does not do. It does not provide a \nright to strike, a right to bargain over pay. It does not prevent TSA \nfrom responding to emergencies, and it does not prevent TSA from \nresponding to new threats. This amendment does none of that, even \nthough it has been distorted and misrepresented.\n  As the good Senator has pointed out, what are the existing attrition \nrates today? Look at the different security agencies, Immigration and \nCustoms correctional officers, Secret Service and Border Patrol, and \nTransportation Security. This is the national security threat, the idea \nthat the TSA has this kind of turnover. That is the nature of the \nthreat, having to get new people after new people after new people, \nbecause workers don't have a right to speak and don't have the right to \nbring their grievances.\n  What is the result? Even in this agency we find out in terms of lost \ntime and the injury rate, this agency leads the pack. What does it \nshow? It shows it is\n\n[[Page S2758]]\n\npoorly administered and the workers are not being treated fairly or are \nnot treated with respect.\n  The McCaskill amendment is simple in what it does. The Border Patrol \nagents have these kinds of protections. FEMA has these protections. \nImmigration and Customs have these protections. Unless we have the \nMcCaskill amendment, we will not have the range of these protections \nfor Transportation Security Administration workers. The others have it \nbut not TSA.\n\n  What does the other side have against working men and women? How \ninsulting, that these men and women will not put the security of the \nUnited States first. At the time of 9/11, under the Defense Department, \nthey moved hundreds and thousands of civilians all around the country. \nThey were all under collective bargaining agreements. Not one grievance \nwas filed, not a single one. These men and women understood their duty. \nThey understood the threat. They were patriotic Americans. What is it \nabout the other side that questions that these are men and women of \ndignity who will do their job when this Nation is threatened? What is \nit about? It certainly wasn't there at 9/11 when their brothers and \nsisters who work for the Department of Defense agency were moved all \naround. They were prepared to do everything they were asked to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, as the good Senator has pointed out, as the \nsmoke was coming out of the buildings in New York, when we saw the \ncollapse of the first buildings and men and women under collective \nbargaining agreements were asked to go into those fiery infernos, no \none was talking about collective bargaining agreements. They were \ntalking about doing their duty to the United States. Let us permit \nthese workers to do their duty. Let's give them these protections. \nLet's give them the kind of respect and dignity the McCaskill amendment \ngives them.\n  I reserve whatever time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is very clear to me that we can take \nsignificant steps today to give TSA employees more protections, and \nthat is what the amendment I and several others have proposed would do. \nIt would bring TSA employees under the Whistleblowers Protection Act, \nand it would allow them to appeal any adverse employment action such as \na firing or demotion to an independent agency, the Merit Systems \nProtection Board. These are rights I believe TSA employees should have. \nThey are rights that are similar to those enjoyed by other Federal \nemployees. But what we are trying to do is strike a balance between \ngiving the employees all of the standard collective bargaining rights \nand the security needs of the TSA.\n  The TSA security needs are not hypothetical. TSA has shared with us, \nin a highly classified briefing, details of when they have had to \nchange the employee work conditions or assignments or duties. This \nisn't just a hypothetical need. It is one we saw last summer be put in \nplace in the wake of a bombing plot that, fortunately, was thwarted. \nThese are needs that came into play in the response to Hurricane \nKatrina. What I have suggested in my amendment is that we take major \nsteps to afford more employee rights and protections to the TSA \npersonnel, but we do so in a way that maintains the flexibility TSA has \ntold us, both in classified session and in public hearings, they need \nto help safeguard our country.\n  The amendment I have proposed also includes other protections for the \nemployees. It makes very clear that they can join a union. There are \nseveral TSOs who have joined a union in order for representation, if \nthere is an adverse employment action.\n  Another provision of the bill recognizes this is not the final word \non the issue but asks for TSA and the GAO to take a look at the \npersonnel system for TSA and report back to us in a year's time about \nwhether there should be other changes made to improve the system.\n  The amendment also provides for a pay-for-performance system which \nhas been successfully implemented at TSA. We want to codify that.\n  I don't think this is an all-or-nothing debate. We can take some \nsignificant steps today. Secretary Chertoff has sent a letter on behalf \nof the administration that comments on the alternative proposal put \nforth by my friend from Missouri, Senator McCaskill. I do have a lot of \nadmiration for my friend and colleague, but I think my other colleagues \nshould be aware that the Department says that ``this amendment \nregrettably does not provide a workable solution. Indeed, in some \nrespects it would make it even more difficult for the . . . (TSA) to \nmanage its workforce than would section 803 [in the underlying bill.]''\n  I want to make sure my colleagues are aware that the Department of \nHomeland Security believes the underlying bill, the language authored \nby the Senator from Connecticut, is preferable to the language offered \nby the Senator from Missouri.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter from Secretary \nChertoff be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Department of Homeland Security,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Administration, I \n     would like to comment on the amendment proposed by Senator \n     McCaskill (SA 316 to SA 315). We appreciate Senator \n     McCaskill's effort to resolve the problems created by section \n     803 of S. 4, but this amendment regrettably does not provide \n     a workable solution. Indeed, in some respects it would make \n     it even more difficult for the Transportation Security \n     Administration (TSA) to manage its workforce than would \n     section 803--particularly managing its Transportation \n     Security Officers (TSO), who serve on the front lines to \n     secure our nation's civil aviation system.\n       Most notably, SA 316 could actually expand the \n     opportunities to bargain collectively beyond what is \n     contemplated by section 803 of the underlying bill. The \n     amendment casts doubt on whether bargaining over employee \n     compensation and benefits is prohibited, as it is under \n     current law and section 803. The amendment also does not \n     differentiate between mandatory and permissive subjects of \n     bargaining, or set terms for bargaining over procedures and \n     appropriate arrangements related to changes in conditions of \n     employment. Given the scope of section 111(d) of the Aviation \n     and Transportation Security Act (P.L. 107-7), these issues \n     will likely become the subject of litigation. Therefore, the \n     amendment could require TSA management to bargain to impasse \n     over matters that no other federal agency engaged in security \n     is required to address. Furthermore, the very definition of \n     ``pay'' could become the subject of time-consuming \n     litigation.\n       The amendment also promises to impede the quick and fair \n     resolution of grievances and other workplace disputes for the \n     thousands of TSOs. Although the Administrator of TSA \n     purportedly would not be required to bargain over responses \n     to emergencies or imminent threats, it is inevitable that \n     protracted litigation will ensue over the meaning of these \n     terms. Moreover, the very definition of ``emergencies, newly \n     imminent threats, or intelligence indicating a newly imminent \n     emergency risk'' could be subject to collective bargaining \n     and subsequent litigation. The resolution of these issues \n     might rest with an arbitrator with no direct knowledge of \n     intelligence, risk and threat assessment, and transportation \n     security. This would place the performance of TSA's security \n     mission in the hands of someone who neither has the expertise \n     needed to make these decisions nor is accountable for \n     them.\n       The amendment also fails to alleviate the adverse impact \n     that collective bargaining would have on TSA's day-to-day \n     security operations. TSA is responsible for providing and \n     managing complex, on-site security systems at more than 450 \n     commercial airports, which collectively screen approximately \n     two million passengers a day for thousands of commercial \n     flights. Collective bargaining would limit TSA's management \n     flexibility, which is an indispensable element of this \n     system. TSA must be able to react nimbly, not only to the \n     ever-evolving security threats that confront our Nation, but \n     also to changing air carrier schedules, weather disruptions, \n     and special events that draw large numbers of passengers to \n     particular airports. TSA also needs flexibility to screen not \n     only passengers and their checked baggage, but also air \n     cargo, airport employees, and contractors working at \n     airports. Simply put, collective bargaining remains \n     incompatible with the successful performance of TSA's vital \n     security mission.\n       In addition, the amendment would prevent TSA from \n     effectively disciplining employees who break the law. The \n     amendment would trigger Title 5's procedural requirements for \n     taking adverse actions against employees, including the 30-\n     day notice provision set forth in Chapter 75. This would \n     eliminate all accelerated adverse action proceedings, even \n     those based on clear and convincing evidence of theft, drug \n     possession or usage, and workplace violence. TSA currently \n     responds to\n\n[[Page S2759]]\n\n     such conduct by ensuring that the employees who commit these \n     violations are removed from the payroll in as few as three \n     days. The amendment also would call into question TSA's \n     ability to remove poor performers. Curtailing any of these \n     procedures would severely compromise TSA's ability to \n     guarantee a safe workplace and assure the traveling public of \n     the uniformly high caliber of its TSO workforce. Ironically, \n     it would also create a situation in which non-TSO employees \n     could be removed from the payroll much more rapidly than TSO \n     employees who directly affect security and customer service \n     and interact daily with the American public on a large scale.\n       Nor do the amendment's proposed restrictions on TSO \n     activities provide much comfort. The amendment states \n     explicitly that TSOs could not bargain over pay, but that is \n     no different from current law or section 803 of S. 4. \n     Moreover, the amendment specifically prohibits the right of \n     screeners to strike, but federal law already proscribes such \n     actions by each and every member of the federal workforce. \n     These provisions offer no more protection to the traveling \n     public than is found in existing law.\n       Ultimately, the amendment is unnecessary in light of the \n     significant innovative programs that TSA has implemented to \n     provide for a high performing workforce. These steps include: \n     (1) a comprehensive Model Workplace program; (2) an Office of \n     Occupational Safety, Health, and Environment; (3) a Nurse \n     Care Management program to eliminate or reduce workplace \n     injuries; (4) National Advisory Councils that provide the TSO \n     workforce with direct access to the Administrator and senior \n     management on all issues concerning security and workforce \n     conditions; (5) procedures for Alternative Dispute \n     Resolution; (6) whistleblower protection through a formal \n     agreement with the Office of Special Counsel; (7) a Disputes \n     Resolution Board to provide additional review of workplace \n     grievances; and (8) an extensive on-line training program to \n     provide not only refresher training for TSOs and other TSA \n     employees, but also the bases for career advancement. The \n     recognition of these programs in a modified amendment would \n     provide an appropriate framework to resolve the ongoing \n     issues with section 803 and SA 316. I look forward to working \n     with the Members on this most critical matter.\n       In the final analysis, the changes that SA 316 would make \n     to section 803 of S. 4 do not resolve the concerns expressed \n     in the Statement of Administration Policy dated February 28, \n     2007. As such, if section 803 is enacted in its current \n     format, or as amended by SA 316, the President's senior \n     advisors would continue to recommend that he veto the bill.\n       An identical letter was sent to Chairman Lieberman.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael Chertoff,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, there is no question that unions have \nthese rights for TSO agents. This is a commonsense approach. What is \nnot common sense is to put in jeopardy every traveling American for the \nsake of paying back a raw political debt. That is what this debate is \nabout. Do we jeopardize safety, do we jeopardize the flexibility, do we \njeopardize the fine work that has come from an incentivized system that \nhas very low turnover now compared to the rest of the industry, that \nhas a bonus system for great performance, a performance-based system, \nto give them what they need and not jeopardize the traveling American \npublic? The McCaskill amendment actually hurts our flexibility and our \nsecurity.\n  As a matter of fact, we had a hearing after this bill was on the \nfloor, wherein Mr. Hawley and Mr. Gage came before us and talked about \nunion representation of the TSO officers. Very revealing statements \nwere said, especially by Mr. Gage. When we raised concerns about \nflexibility during emergencies and complicated issues that required \nabsolute flexibility to move people around at all times, it was the \ntestimony of Mr. Hawley who said they have to plan, that they are in an \nemergency all the time, which means they have to have the flexibility \nall the time. Mr. Gage's response to that was: These are sometimes \nbogus emergency situations.\n  Well, the reason we have had such an effective airline screening \nprogram is because we call everything an emergency and plan for it as \nan emergency, so we never have an emergency.\n  This amendment will gut the flexibility of the TSA in doing the very \nthing we have asked them to do; that is, protect us and have an \ninstitution that is viable, responsive, and nimble to protect us, \nwithout having to have a shop steward ask them what we can do and when \nwe can do it.\n  Now, the McCaskill amendment says we will let you do that in an \nemergency, but the fact is, we are in an emergency mode all the time. \nSo whatever contract we might have signed is not going to have any \nbearing anyway. So the contrast for the American public on this vote--\nand we know this is going to be a party-line vote. Even those Members \nwho want to vote the other way have been told not to vote the other \nway. We know this is a party-line vote about paying back, so Mr. Gage \nand his associates can have 40,000 people a month pay $30 a month to \nput $12 million to $17 million in the coffers of the employees union. \nThat is what this is about.\n  This is not about security for this country and flexibility with the \nTSA. I urge a vote against the McCaskill amendment and a vote for the \nCollins amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is an attempt to find middle ground \non a very difficult issue. The amendment that I and my colleagues offer \nthe Senate would provide TSA employees with the right to appeal to the \nMerit Systems Protection Board any adverse action taken against them. \nThose rights would be identical to the rights that other Federal \nemployees have. It would give them the protections of the \nWhistleblowers Protection Act. It recognizes that TSA employees have \nthe right to join a union, and it calls for us to revisit this issue in \na year by having a report from TSA and the GAO.\n  I think this helps give more rights and employment protections to TSA \nemployees without impeding the necessary flexibility that TSA needs to \nhave for our security.\n  I urge support of the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order. The \nSenator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is one of those rare occasions \nwhen the\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\nSenator from Maine and I disagree. I appreciate the fact that Senator \nCollins is trying to find a middle ground in this contentious debate. \nShe gives the Transportation Screening Officers at TSA some employee \nrights but not the right to collectively bargain, which most employees \nin the Department of Homeland Security, and throughout our Government \nhas. Presumably, the contention is that the right to collective \nbargaining would interfere with the security responsibility of the \nagencies, but TSA in the underlying bill and under Senator McCaskill's \namendment would have absolute authority to take whatever actions are \nneeded to carry out its mission in an emergency without bargaining with \nany units, without even considering any collective bargaining \nagreement.\n  The fact is that Federal security forces generally have the right to \ncollectively bargain: Border Patrol agents, immigration officers, \nCustoms, Federal Protective Services, and the U.S. Capitol Police. \nThose collective bargaining rights do not interfere with their \nprotection of our security, nor would those rights for TSOs at TSA.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to offer a unanimous consent \nrequest for the order of the speakers to follow. It would be, Senator \nBunning of Kentucky be recognized for 5 minutes to call up an amendment \nand then set it aside; that Senator Schumer of New York then be \nrecognized for up to 5 minutes to call up three amendments and set them \naside; that Senator Kerry of Massachusetts be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes to offer a tribute to former Senator Tom Eagleton; that Senator \nGraham of South Carolina be recognized for up to 15 minutes to speak on \nan amendment; that Senator Wyden and Senator Bond be recognized for up \nto 10 minutes to call up an amendment; that Senator Kyl be recognized \nfor up to 5 minutes; and, finally, that Senator Landrieu be recognized \nfor up to 10 minutes to do a tribute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Excuse me. Is Senator Kyl for 5 minutes or 15 minutes? \nI said 5 minutes only because it is on my piece of paper as 5, but it \nis 15 minutes we want to give to Senator Kyl.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am just going to make a brief statement \nbefore the Senator from Connecticut propounds the unanimous consent \nrequest. Now that I have seen the unanimous consent request, I am not \ngoing to object to it, but I do want to comment briefly on the two \nvotes that we have just taken on the issue of the TSA employees.\n  I think those votes were extremely unfortunate because everyone in \nthis Chamber knows that the President is going to veto this important \nbill if the provisions remain in the bill as the Senate just voted.\n  If that happens, it means the TSA employees will not receive the \nadditional protections and rights that I advocated for in the amendment \nthat I presented to the Senate. They will be back to a situation where \nthey cannot appeal adverse employment actions to an independent agency, \nthe Merit Systems Protection Board. They will be back in the situation \nwhere they cannot be protected by the Whistleblower Protection Act.\n  It is unfortunate that the votes we have just taken will actually set \nback the cause of providing employee protections that the TSA screeners \nshould have.\n  I want to make sure that my colleagues are aware of what the \npractical implications and what the results will be of the votes just \ntaken because there are clearly sufficient votes in this Chamber to \nsustain the President's veto, and I think it is very unfortunate that \nwe are not going to be able to proceed to give these employees rights \nthey deserve, rights they should have, and rights that would not impair \nour security.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I express my regrets to Senator Collins \nthat she had not seen this list. I thought she had. We don't like to do \nit that way. It is a bipartisan list, as it turns out. I am going to \npropound a unanimous consent request again and do it in summary fashion \nwithout mentioning the topics again.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the order of speakers be as follows: \nSenator Bunning for 5 minutes; Senator Schumer for 5 minutes; Senator \nKerry for 10 minutes; Senator Graham for 15 minutes; Senator Wyden and \nSenator Bond to share 10 minutes; Senator Kyl for 15 minutes; and \nSenator Landrieu for 10 minutes. In each case, it is up to that amount. \nI know the Senate would be grateful if the Senators choose not to use \nthe full amount of time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to have permission to \nalternate between Republicans and Democrats. If I could be lined up to \nspeak after--who was the first Democrat after Senator Bunning? Senator \nSchumer. If I may be allowed to speak next, I would appreciate it. I \nwas lined up to speak at 2 o'clock originally, but we had the vote at 2 \no'clock and, obviously, that has been slid out now. If the Senator from \nConnecticut can move me in there, I would appreciate it. We have always \nalternated between Republicans and Democrats.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. We have Republicans and Democrats running together. It \nis a totally nonpartisan list.\n  Mr. ALLARD. All right. I was set up to speak at 2 o'clock, and then \nwe had the vote at 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. There was no order for the Senator from Colorado to \nspeak. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, 10 minutes. Senator Cornyn and I want to \nengage in a colloquy, and then I have a few comments. We just need 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMANN. Mr. President, I amend the request for the Senator \nfrom Colorado, Mr. Allard, to have 10 minutes after Senator Schumer's \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request, \nas modified? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the unanimous consent agreement, the Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 334 to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 334 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to setting aside \nthe pending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, this amendment makes changes in the \nimplementation of the Federal Flight Deck Officer Program, commonly \nreferred to as the Armed Pilot Program, to require the Department of \nHomeland Security to implement the package and program as Congress \noriginally intended.\n  Four years after Congress created this program, the Department of \nHomeland Security continues to drag its heels on providing flight deck \nofficers, commonly known as FFDOs, or armed pilots, with the necessary \ntools to prevent another September 11-type attack.\n  My amendment will ensure that all armed pilots can truly act as a \nreal defense against hijacking on commercial flights.\n  This amendment would end the ridiculous practice of forcing armed \npilots to carry their guns in lockboxes and would allow them to carry \nthe guns on their body where the gun is easily reachable and more \ndiscrete to carry.\n  No other Federal law enforcement officer is forced to carry a firearm \nin a lockbox, and Federal law enforcement officials agree that carriage \non the body of an officer is the best way for law enforcement officials \nto carry a firearm to ensure that the threat can be stopped in the \nsafest way possible.\n  In addition to putting more armed pilots in the skies, this amendment \nwould also put armed pilots on international flights.\n  The current law for the Armed Pilot Program allows pilots on these \nflights, but so far the State Department has been slow on entering into \nnegotiations\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\nwith other countries to allow this to occur.\n  My amendment requires the State Department to negotiate agreements \nwith other governments to get armed pilots on international flights. \nOver the last few years, many international flights have been canceled \nbecause of terrorist threats.\n  This amendment will also allow armed pilots to protect the flights of \nU.S. airlines and free up air marshals so they can be put on targeted \nforeign flights that we know terrorists are targeting.\n  This amendment also provides for the issuance of a metal badge for \narmed pilots so they can easily be identified in a crisis situation.\n  It is important to make sure that these pilots have a means to \nidentify themselves so that air marshals and other passengers know who \nthey are and that they are lawfully carrying a firearm.\n  It also requires TSA to give armed pilots the same screening \nprotocols other Federal law enforcement officers have so that the \nterrorists cannot easily identify them at security checkpoints.\n  Under current TSA requirements, all armed pilots must be screened \npublicly in plain view of everyone at the security checkpoint, as \nopposed to Federal law enforcement officers who are screened behind \nclosed doors.\n  Finally, this amendment would give pilots basic due process. It \nrequires the Department of Homeland Security to establish procedures to \ngive notice and appeal rights when making any decision against the \npilots. Currently, the pilots have no recourse.\n  I believe these changes that update the law governing the Federal \nFlight Deck Officer Program are vital and are needed to ensure that \nthis voluntary program runs as it was intended to run and would \nencourage more pilots to enter into it.\n  I have spoken many times in the past on the merits of this program \nand the need for it. It has saddened me that I must once again be \nforced to ask TSA to start implementing this program as it was \noriginally intended. Once again, we must be forcing TSA's hand to get \nenough pilots armed to actually create a strong defense against \nterrorists in the air. We currently have the opportunity to speed this \nprogram up and force TSA to do what Congress intended by adopting my \namendment.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from New York is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 367, as Modified, and 366 En Bloc, to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the managers of \nthe bill. We have made good progress on this bill, something that has \ntaken far too long to accomplish since the Commission's report.\n  Next, I would like to offer two amendments to this bill, which I \nfiled in an attempt to strengthen certain provisions. The committee \nversions of the bill make significant strides in several areas of \nsecurity, including improving truck security, and I offer a modified \nversion of No. 367 and the original, No. 366. Two amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \nreport the amendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes amendment \n     number 367, as modified, and amendment number 366, en bloc, \n     to amendment No. 275.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 367, as modified, and 366) are as follows:\n\n\n                     AMENDMENT NO. 367, AS MODIFIED\n\n       On page 303, strike line 12 and all that follows through \n     page 305, line 18, and insert the following:\n     of Transportation, shall develop a program to facilitate the \n     tracking of motor carrier shipments of high hazard materials, \n     as defined in this title, and to equip vehicles used in such \n     shipments with technology that provides--\n       (A) frequent or continuous communications;\n       (B) vehicle position location and tracking capabilities; \n     and\n       (C) a feature that allows a driver of such vehicles to \n     broadcast an emergency message.\n       (2) Considerations.--In developing the program required by \n     paragraph (1), the Secretary shall--\n       (A) consult with the Secretary of Transportation to \n     coordinate the program with any ongoing or planned efforts \n     for motor carrier or high hazardous materials tracking at the \n     Department of Transportation;\n       (B) take into consideration the recommendations and \n     findings of the report on the Hazardous Material Safety and \n     Security Operation Field Test released by the Federal Motor \n     Carrier Safety Administration on November 11, 2004; and\n       (C) evaluate--\n       (i) any new information related to the cost and benefits of \n     deploying and utilizing tracking technology for motor \n     carriers transporting high hazard materials not included in \n     the Hazardous Material Safety and Security Operation Field \n     Test Report released by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \n     Administration on November 11, 2004;\n       (ii) the ability of tracking technology to resist tampering \n     and disabling;\n       (iii) the capability of tracking technology to collect, \n     display, and store information regarding the movement of \n     shipments of high hazard materials by commercial motor \n     vehicles;\n       (iv) the appropriate range of contact intervals between the \n     tracking technology and a commercial motor vehicle \n     transporting high hazard materials;\n       (v) technology that allows the installation by a motor \n     carrier of concealed electronic devices on commercial motor \n     vehicles that can be activated by law enforcement authorities \n     to disable the vehicle and alert emergency response resources \n     to locate and recover high hazard materials in the event of \n     loss or theft of such materials; and\n       (vi) whether installation of the technology described in \n     clause (v) should be incorporated into the program required \n     by paragraph (1).\n       (b) Regulations.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary, through the \n     Transportation Security Administration, shall promulgate \n     regulations to carry out the provisions of subsection (a).\n       (c) Funding.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     the Secretary to carry out this section, $7,000,000 for each \n     of fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010, of which--\n       (1) $3,000,000 per year may be used for equipment; and\n       (2) $1,000,000 per year may be used for operations.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 366\n\n     (Purpose: To restrict the authority of the Nuclear Regulatory \n   Commission to issue a license authoring the export to a recipient \n   country of highly enriched uranium for medical isotope production)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MEDICAL ISOTOPE PRODUCTION.\n\n       Section 134 b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. \n     2160d(b)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking subparagraph (D);\n       (2) by striking paragraph (2);\n       (3) in paragraph (3), by striking ``paragraph (2)'' and \n     inserting ``this section'';\n       (4) in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A)(iv), by striking ``cost \n     differential in medical isotope production in the reactors \n     and target processing facilities if the products'' and \n     inserting ``cost differential of radiopharmaceuticals to \n     patients if the radiopharmaceuticals''; and\n       (B) by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(B) Feasibility.--For the purpose of this subsection, the \n     use of low enriched uranium to produce medical isotopes shall \n     be determined to be feasible if it could be accomplished \n     without a large percentage increase in the cost of \n     radiopharmaceuticals to patients.'';\n       (5) in paragraph (5), by striking ``(4)(B)(iii)'' and \n     inserting ``(4)(B)'';\n       (6) in paragraph (6), by striking ``(4)(B)(iii)'' and \n     inserting ``(4)(B)''; and\n       (7) in paragraph (7), by striking ``subsection'' and \n     inserting ``section for highly enriched uranium for medical \n     isotope production''.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I offer the first amendment, No. 367, to \nmake the provision in the underlying committee bill even stronger with \na new program to address trucks carrying high-hazard materials. Every \nday there are trucks that carry high-HAZMAT materials. If a truck is \nhijacked by a terrorist, it could spell disaster. We need to take \naction to prevent this from happening, and that is why my amendment \nwill create a system not only to track these high-hazard trucks but to \ntake action to stop a truck in its tracks by shutting down its engine \nif it strays off course.\n  This has worked in other countries. My amendment will require the \nDepartment of Transportation and TSA to work together to create a \nsystem to track these trucks, as well as respond accordingly if there \nis a problem. Every one of these trucks must submit a predetermined \nroute to the TSA. If a truck strays from its plan, and we will know \nthis by tracking its movements,\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\nwhich GSA allows, TSA is automatically alerted and the system quickly \nresponds.\n  As I said, we know a system such as this can work. It has been \nimplemented in other countries. Hazardous material in trucks is one of \nthe issues we have not dealt with sufficiently since 9/11. I look \nforward to the committee's receptiveness to this amendment and to \nworking with the chair and ranking member to see if we can adopt this \namendment. This is an important step.\n  The second amendment I offer, No. 366, along with my colleague, \nSenator Kyl, will restore export restrictions on highly enriched \nuranium to reduce risks of terrorists obtaining this material to make \nnuclear weapons. Highly enriched uranium, HEU, can be used to make \nactual nuclear weapons, such as that dropped on Hiroshima, not just \ndirty bombs.\n  Until 2005, U.S. law restricted exports of bomb-grade uranium. \nHowever, this antiterrorism policy was undercut by an ill-considered \namendment to the Energy Policy Act that eliminated these restrictions. \nBy increasing the amount of HEU in circulation around the world, the \nEnergy bill created an unacceptable risk by heightening the possibility \nthat weapons-grade uranium could be lost or stolen and fall into the \nhands of terrorists with known nuclear ambitions. What made this \nlanguage so astonishing is that it created much more risk without \nabsolutely any reward by claiming to fix a problem that didn't exist.\n  The reality of this situation is that terrorists don't care if the \nweapons-grade uranium they try to get their hands on was meant for \nmedical or military use. We know all they care about is how they can \nuse it to attack our Nation and our way of life. If we have learned \nanything since September 11, it is we must take every step to ensure \nterrorists can never lay their hands on the materials they would need \nto launch an attack of mass destruction against the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both these amendments. I hope we can \nwork with the committee to get them accepted.\n  Mr. President, with that, in deference to my colleagues, I yield the \nremainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Colorado is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 272\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of my \namendment No. 272 to the Improving America's Security Act, and I \nbelieve it will do that, improve America's security.\n  We have a rampant problem of identity theft in this country. Identity \ntheft not only affects innocent victims, it poses a security threat to \nour country. As the 9/11 Commission put it: ``Fraud in identification \ndocuments is no longer just a problem of theft.''\n  We have long been aware that failure to protect the integrity of the \nSSN has enormous financial consequences for the Government, the people, \nand the business community. We now know that shortcomings in the SSN \nissuance process can have far graver consequences than previously \nimagined. The difficult lessons of September 11, 2001 have taught us \nthat SSA can no longer afford to operate from a ``business as usual'' \nperspective. Whatever the cost, whatever the sacrifice, we must protect \nthe number that has become our national identifier; the number that is \nthe key to social, legal, and financial assimilation in this country.\n  We recognize SSA alone cannot resolve the monumental issues \nsurrounding homeland security. Efforts to make our Nation safer will \ninvolve new or expanded initiatives by almost every segment of our \npopulation, including State and local governments, private industry, \nnongovernmental organizations, and citizens. However, we also recognize \nthat, in endeavoring to protect our homeland, no Government system or \npolicy should be ignored. As such, SSA, as a Federal agency and public \nservant, must resolve to review its systems and processes for \nopportunities to prevent the possibility that anyone might commit or \ncamouflage criminal activities against the United States. We believe \nSSN integrity is a link in our homeland security goal that must be \nstrengthened.\n  The 9/11 Commission went on to note: `` . . . all but one of the 9/11 \nhijackers acquired some form of U.S. identification document, some by \nfraud.''\n  I have here an inspector general's report, inspector general for the \nSocial Security Administration, and he is talking about the integrity \nof the Social Security number. He says an important link in homeland \nsecurity is the Social Security number. To specifically quote him, he \nsays:\n\n       The difficult lessons of September 11, 2001, has taught us \n     that the Social Security Administration can no longer afford \n     to operate from a business-as-usual perspective. Whatever the \n     cost, whatever the sacrifice, we must protect the number that \n     has become our national identifier, the number that is the \n     key to social, legal, and financial assimilation in this \n     country.\n\n  He went on to say in his report:\n\n       We believe the Social Security number integrity is a link \n     in our homeland security goal that must be strengthened.\n\n  For every case of identity theft, there is a thief. We have to ask \nourselves: Why would someone want to steal somebody else's identity? \nAfter all, every person has an identity of their own. Why would \nsomebody be so dissatisfied with their own identity that they deem it \nnecessary to steal from another? The answer to that question is simple: \nThey have something to hide. For many, the fact they are trying to hide \nis that they are in this country illegally. Whether someone is here \nillegally in pursuit of work or to carry out the work of an \ninternational terrorist organization remains anyone's guess.\n  What we do know, however, is that there are clear signs of when an \nidentity has been stolen. One obvious sign is when multiple people are \nusing the same Social Security number. By law, every Social Security \nnumber has only one true owner. It follows, if 10 people are using the \nsame Social Security number, 9 of them are thieves: 9 of them have \nsomething to hide.\n  One common use of Social Security numbers is for reporting earnings. \nAnd where are earnings reported? Earnings are reported to the Social \nSecurity Administration. That means that when multiple people are \nreporting to the Social Security Administration using the same Social \nSecurity number, the Social Security Administration has information in \nits possession relating to the crime of identity theft.\n  What does the Social Security Administration do? Absolutely nothing. \nIt is prohibited from sharing their information with others in our own \nFederal Government, such as the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  I believe it is an example of what the 9/11 Commission described as, \nand I quote from the Commission:\n\n       The pervasive problem of managing and sharing information \n     across a large and unwieldy government that had been built in \n     a different era to confront different dangers.\n\n  In January of this year, a bipartisan group of Senators and I met \nwith Secretary Chertoff on this very issue. Secretary Chertoff \nexplained that, under current law, Government agencies are prevented \nfrom sharing information with one another that, if shared, could expose \ncases of identity theft.\n  My amendment tears down the wall that prevents the sharing of \nexisting information among Government agencies and permits the \nCommissioner of Social Security to share information with the Secretary \nof Homeland Security where such information is likely to assist in \ndiscovering identity theft, Social Security number misuse or violations \nof immigration law.\n  Specifically, it requires the Commissioner to inform the Secretary of \nHomeland Security upon discovery of a Social Security account number \nbeing used with multiple names or where an individual has more than one \nperson reporting earnings for him or her during a single tax year.\n  It seems logical that we would already be doing this, but we are not. \nIn the meantime, we are effectively enabling thieves to continue to \nperpetrate the crime of identity theft.\n  In addition to the national security implications, for every case of \nidentity theft there is an innocent victim.\n  Innocent victims like Connecticut resident John Harrison who had his \nactive duty military ID and Social Security number stolen. The thief \nran up an over $260,000 debt and opened 61 credit or bank accounts in \nthe victim's name. Meanwhile the victim lost his job and the military \ndecreased his retirement\n\n[[Page S2764]]\n\npay because Phillips had run up a debt owed to the U.S. Government.\n  Connecticut resident John Harrison is not alone, In fact, for the \nseventh year in a row, with nearly 250,000 complaints, identity theft \nis the No. 1 complaint received by the FTC from Connecticut residents. \nLikewise, for the State of Maine, 2006 marked the seventh year in a row \nthat identity theft complaints topped the Federal Trade Commission's \nAnnual ``List of Top Consumer Complaints.''\n  Even my home State of Colorado is no stranger to identity theft. With \n4,535 victims in 2005, we are ranked 5th in identity theft--behind only \nArizona, Nevada, California, and Texas.\n  For instance, an 84-year-old Grand Junction woman was deemed \nineligible for Federal housing assistance because her Social Security \nnumber was being used at a variety of jobs in Denver, making her income \ntoo high to qualify.\n  Unfortunately, for the victims of identity theft, by the time the \nidentity theft is discovered, the damage has already been done. Yet \nwhen the Social Security Administration has reason to believe that a \nSocial Security number is being used fraudulently, they are prevented \nfrom sharing it with the Department of Homeland Security. Withholding \nthis information effectively enables thieves to continue to perpetrate \nthe crime of identity theft against innocent victims.\n  By simply sharing information related to the fraudulent use of Social \nSecurity numbers among Government agencies, cases of identity theft \ncould be discovered much sooner. Victims of identity theft deserve to \nhave this existing information acted on, and my amendment allows this.\n  Senator Cornyn, who is on the floor with me, was at the meeting where \nSecretary Chertoff explained the problems with the Social Security \nnumbers and DHS not being notified so that they could take law \nenforcement actions against such acts as a terrorist threat.\n  I wonder if Senator Cornyn would give me his impression.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Would the Senator from Colorado tell us what portion of \nthe population is sort of disproportionately affected by this identity \ntheft, particularly when it involves Social Security numbers?\n  Mr. ALLARD. A large portion of the population that is affected by the \nSocial Security theft identification is the older population, those \nindividuals on Social Security. The impact it is going to have on them \nis immediate in some cases because they are qualifying for a certain \namount of Social Security based on the income that may be coming. If \nsomebody else is using their Social Security number, that exceeds, \nperhaps, what allowances they may have to qualify for the Social \nSecurity benefits. If an individual has a job, then the effect is felt \nmuch later on.\n  The retired individuals of this country are most dramatically \naffected in this regard.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Colorado whether he \nis aware that the Federal Trade Commission has identified the top 10 \nStates where identity theft is the biggest problem and that they have \nranked Arizona as No. 1; and Nevada, the State represented by the \nmajority leader; California; and Texas, No.4; and then Colorado at No. \n5.\n  Is the Senator aware that the Federal Trade Commission has ranked \nthose States as the top five States where identity theft is the biggest \nproblem.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Texas for his question, and, \nyes, I am very much aware of that. Those States are disproportionately \naffected because of the overpopulation they have within their \nboundaries.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Is the Senator from Colorado aware there are those who \nwill purchase bogus documents on the black market--basically for \npurposes of evading and breaking our immigration laws so they can \npurport to be someone whom they are not--and whether this, in his \nopinion, represents a security risk to the United States.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is one of the problems we are facing today and one \nof the problems that Secretary Chertoff of Homeland Security pointed \nout. It is vital that we be able to identify duplicate uses of Social \nSecurity numbers because a number of the terrorists that were here on \n9/11, attacking this country, were here under fraudulent IDs. It is an \nimportant aspect of law enforcement, and particularly homeland \nsecurity, to be able to carry on their responsibilities.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Finally, Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator \nwhether this isn't exactly the kind of stovepipe or wall that the 9/11 \nCommission talked about when it comes to information sharing between \nlaw enforcement and intelligence agencies. Isn't this exactly the same \nkind of information sharing they found so important to protecting the \nsecurity of our Nation?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Well, it is the very thing the 9/11 Commission was \npointing out that is a problem with protecting the citizens of this \ncountry, the stovepiping of information among the various agencies and \nwhere there is no passing of information back and forth.\n  This is a classic example where one agency, in this case the Social \nSecurity Administration, has a number, and they know it is being used \nmore than once throughout the country, yet nobody gets notified; it \nstays within the Social Security Administration. Even those law \nenforcement agencies within Homeland Security cannot get that \ninformation to act on it.\n  Secretary Chertoff said an important part of being able to carry out \nour function to ensure the security of this country is to get that \ninformation. Yet right now, the law explicitly prohibits the Social \nSecurity Administration from sharing that information with Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I think it is a problem that needs to be corrected, and the sooner we \ncan correct that, the better.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator, and I support his amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, let me summarize my comments by saying I \nthink it is important, in ensuring the security of this country, that \nwe pass this amendment. Without the sharing of that information between \nthe various agencies, it is going to be possible for anybody who comes \ninto this country illegally, terrorists especially, to stay within this \ncountry and operate in a way where they are not discovered. We want to \nhave law enforcement become aware of the presence of somebody here \nillegally, particularly if they are a terrorist. If their intention is \nto either destroy a building or to lay a bomb out somewhere, they are a \nreal threat to this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized for 10 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kerry are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \nearlier unanimous consent request so I can offer the Wyden-Bond \namendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 348 to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment with the \ndistinguished vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence. I thank him for the many hours he and his staff have put \nin, working with me on this amendment.\n  The purpose of the legislation before the Senate today is \nstraightforward: to apply what has been learned from one of the \ngreatest tragedies in American life in order to better protect the \nAmerican people in the days ahead. One of the tragic lessons of 9/11 is \nwhat we do not know can hurt us, and hurt us badly.\n  Because of the outstanding work of the 9/11 Commission, extensive \ninformation about what went wrong has been made public. The national \nsecurity community has learned from a number of its mistakes, and today \nis taking concrete steps to make sure what happened on September 11, \n2001, does not happen again. There has been a variety of reports that \nhave been issued, critical to our understanding of what happened that \ntragic day. The bipartisan 2002 Joint Congressional Inquiry, on which I \nwas privileged to serve, is one example, as well as the Department of \nJustice's report on FBI accountability.\n  There is one essential report that has remained classified. Nearly 2 \nyears ago,\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\nthe CIA inspector general submitted a report detailing CIA \naccountability in the runup to the 9/11 attacks. I am sure that some \nmay and will consider a number of the inspector general's findings \nunsettling, perhaps embarrassing, but the report is of high quality and \nit is comprehensive. The CIA inspector general has provided this \ncountry with an important perspective on one of the defining moments in \nAmerican history, and I believe the public has a right to know what \nwent wrong at the CIA, so we can make sure those mistakes are not \nrepeated.\n  I have spent more than a year working on a bipartisan basis with our \nfriend from Missouri, the previous chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, Senator Roberts, to make an unclassified version of this \nreport available to the public. I have repeatedly asked the \nintelligence community to redact any sensitive national security \ninformation in the report's executive summary so that it could be \ndeclassified. I have been joined in these efforts, in addition to the \nassistance Senator Bond has provided, by the current chairman, Senator \nRockefeller. I have already mentioned the help of Chairman Roberts for \nsome substantial length of time.\n  Multiple CIA Directors, as well as the former Director of National \nIntelligence, regrettably have not been willing to cooperate. Why the \nleaders of the CIA have been so reluctant to cooperate is not clear to \nme. Neither former Director Goss nor Director Hayden nor Ambassador \nNegroponte have ever provided a valid reason for keeping the report, \nthe entire report, classified. In fact, there is no good reason why the \nCIA cannot declassify this report. The executive summary is concise, \nand it contains little information about CIA sources and methods. It \ncould be redacted and released quickly. That information is in the \ninterests of the American people.\n  The amendment, the bipartisan amendment we offer today, would require \nthe Director of the CIA to declassify the executive summary of the \ninspector general's report on 9/11, removing only that information \nwhich must be redacted to protect this country's national security. The \namendment requires the Director do this within 30 days. I think anyone \nwho has read the report would agree that this is more than enough time.\n  I am pleased that the bipartisan leadership of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Bond, join me \nas cosponsors of the legislation.\n  The American people have a right to know what is in this report. Some \nof the findings may be unpleasant, others may be a source of pride, but \nat the end of the day the American people have a right to know about \nhow the Central Intelligence Agency performed at a critical moment in \nthis country's history. We need that information made public so as to \nensure that there is true accountability. September 11, 2001, is part \nof this country's history. To hide the truth from the American people \nis unacceptable.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  I see my friend from Missouri and thank him again for his patience \nduring the many hours our staffs have been working on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up the amendment at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon Mr. [Wyden], for himself, Mr. Bond, \n     and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered 348 to \n     amendment No. 275.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require that a redacted version of the Executive Summary \n   of the Office of Inspector General Report on Central Intelligence \n Agency Accountability Regarding Findings and Conclusions of the Joint \n  Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the \n   Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 is made available to the \n                                public)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Oregon for his \npersistence in pursuing something we both agree should and must be \ndisclosed and made public, to the extent it can consistent with \nnational security. Accountability for one's actions is something most \nof us are taught from childhood. It is rooted not only in religious \nteachings but also in the tenets of government at the Federal, State, \nand local levels.\n  For those of us in public service, whether we be in an elected \ncapacity or appointed position or some form of service directly related \nto the security of our Nation, we should know we must expect to be held \naccountable for our actions. When we serve the people and if we expect \nthe rewards of doing good deeds, just as surely we should face the \nnegative consequences of actions which do not turn out well.\n  In addition, the public, to the maximum extent possible consistent \nwith national security, should have made available to it the findings \nand the conclusions of the Government's own agencies with regard to \naccountability.\n  As my colleague from Oregon has stated, in June of 2005 the Office of \nInspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency published a report \nconcerning the conduct of intelligence activities prior to September \n11, 2001, and afterward. To this date, that report remains classified. \nThe amendment Senator Wyden and I propose requires the CIA to make as \nmuch of that report public as is possible, consistent with protecting \nthe sensitive sources and methods relating to our national security.\n  The Senator from Oregon has referred to the 9/11 Commission, the \njoint congressional inquiry. Our Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence spent 2 very intense years, 2003 and 2004, doing an \nextensive investigation of what the intelligence was, how it was \nformulated, what the problems were, and we found that there were \ntremendous holes in it. So much of what would be found in the inspector \ngeneral's report has already been stated. But I think to make the \nrecord clear and complete, so that we may ensure that all of the \nagencies working on national intelligence have the ability to learn \nfrom the mistakes--and we in our role as the oversight committee will \nuse the information in this report and on this floor, if need be--to \npoint out how we can make our intelligence better.\n  In an age where the war on terrorism has been brought to us by \nradical Islamic groups who continue to threaten us, good intelligence \nis the only defense we have adequate to the threat we face. It is \nimportant that we get it right.\n  Now, it is not pleasant to air some of these mistakes. We all make \nmistakes, but we better learn from them or we are destined to commit \nthem again.\n  I thank my colleague from Oregon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set aside this \namendment so that I may offer a Rockefeller-Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 389 to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. BOND. I send to the desk an amendment and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself and Mr. \n     Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered 389 to amendment \n     No. 275.\n\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide the sense of the Senate that the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Select Committee on \n       Intelligence of the Senate should submit a report on the \n  recommendations of the 9/11 Commission with respect to intelligence \n        reform and congressional intelligence oversight reform)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A REPORT ON THE 9/11 \n                   COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO \n                   INTELLIGENCE REFORM AND CONGRESSIONAL \n                   INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT REFORM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the \n     United States (referred to in this section as the ``9/11 \n     Commission'') conducted a lengthy review of the facts and \n     circumstances relating to the terrorist attacks of September \n     11, 2001, including those relating to the intelligence \n     community, law enforcement agencies, and the role of \n     congressional oversight and resource allocation.\n       (2) In its final report, the 9/11 Commission found that--\n       (A) congressional oversight of the intelligence activities \n     of the United States is dysfunctional;\n       (B) under the rules of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives in effect at the time the report was \n     completed, the committees of Congress charged with oversight \n     of the intelligence activities lacked the power, influence, \n     and sustained capability to meet the daunting challenges \n     faced by the intelligence community of the United States;\n       (C) as long as such oversight is governed by such rules of \n     the Senate and the House of Representatives, the people of \n     the United States will not get the security they want and \n     need;\n       (D) a strong, stable, and capable congressional committee \n     structure is needed to give the intelligence community of the \n     United States appropriate oversight, support, and leadership; \n     and\n       (E) the reforms recommended by the 9/11 Commission in its \n     final report will not succeed if congressional oversight of \n     the intelligence community in the United States is not \n     changed.\n       (3) The 9/11 Commission recommended structural changes to \n     Congress to improve the oversight of intelligence activities.\n       (4) Congress has enacted some of the recommendations made \n     by the 9/11 Commission and is considering implementing \n     additional recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n       (5) The Senate adopted Senate Resolution 445 in the 108th \n     Congress to address some of the oversight recommendations of \n     the 9/11 Commission by abolishing term limits for the members \n     of the Select Committee on Intelligence, clarifying \n     jurisdiction for intelligence-related nominations, and \n     streamlining procedures for the referral of intelligence-\n     related legislation, but other aspects of the 9/11 Commission \n     recommendations regarding oversight have not been \n     implemented.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     Senate each, or jointly, should--\n       (1) undertake a review of the recommendations made in the \n     final report of the 9/11 Commission with respect to \n     intelligence reform and congressional intelligence oversight \n     reform;\n       (2) review and consider any other suggestions, options, or \n     recommendations for improving intelligence oversight; and\n       (3) not later than December 21, 2007, submit to the Senate \n     a report that includes the recommendations of the Committee, \n     if any, for carrying out such reforms.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I ask that the \npostponed recognition of the distinguished Senator from South Carolina \nnow be instituted. I express my gratitude to him for allowing us to go \nforward with the intervening amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 286\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Lieberman \nfor working me into the line here. What I am rising to talk about is a \nvery important issue for how we conduct this war, for how the law works \nin a time of war, for the values Americans would like to embrace when \nwe are under siege as a nation, and try to give my explanation to what \nSenator Specter's amendment would do and why I oppose it so vehemently.\n  To give a little background and history of this issue, at least from \nmy perspective--and I would ask every Senator to look at this very \nclosely because this is a very important concept we are talking about--\nthe Guantanamo military installation to house enemy combatants, people \ndetermined by our military to be enemy prisoners of war out of uniform, \nmeeting the Geneva Convention's definition of an enemy combatant--the \nadministration chose Guantanamo as the jailing site. There were \nprisoners there who brought actions in our Federal court, arguing that \ntheir confinement needed to be reviewed by Federal courts. The \nadministration took the position that Guantanamo was outside the United \nStates. They lost. I think the administration should have lost. To me, \nGuantanamo, because of the lease and the relationship the U.S. military \nhas to that installation, is clearly part of the infrastructure of the \nUnited States.\n  The reason they made the argument is it is a long-held concept in law \nthat habeas rights do not apply to people overseas, that our \nconstitutional provisions granting to American citizens the right to \nbring a habeas petition when they are confined does not apply \nextraterritorially. The administration lost on the argument that \nGuantanamo was outside the United States, and the Federal court said: \nOkay, it is within the United States.\n  What habeas rights would attach to someone at Guantanamo Bay? Here is \nwhere Senator Specter and I dramatically differ. Senator Specter reads \nthe Rasul case to say that someone confined at Guantanamo who is a \nnoncitizen enemy combatant has a constitutional right under our \nConstitution to petition Federal courts, to have a district court judge \nreview their confinement. I think that is completely wrong.\n  The D.C. Court of Appeals recently held in a 2-1 decision that people \ndetained at Guantanamo Bay do not have constitutional rights under our \nConstitution to petition for habeas.\n  Rasul was about 2241, section 2241 of the U.S. Code, a congressional \nenactment that creates statutory habeas rights. That statute has been \namended in many different forms--restricting habeas, granting habeas, \nallowing States appellate procedures postconviction relief to be \nsubstitutes for habeas.\n  The Supreme Court said: Since Congress has not spoken as to whether \ndetainees at Guantanamo will be covered by 2241, we are going to allow \na case to go forward under that statute until Congress tells us \notherwise.\n  It was Justice O'Connor who was suggesting to the Congress we need to \nspeak. The administration at the time of the Rasul case had no \ninfrastructure in place to give due process to someone who is accused \nof being an enemy combatant. Justice O'Connor, in another case--I don't \nremember the name now--said: What you need to look at is Army \nRegulation 190-1, which is a procedure to guide military members how to \ndetermine who an enemy prisoner may be from a civilian who is an \ninnocent person involved in war. So what the military did, after the \nsecond Supreme Court case, was come up with a Combat Status Review \nTribunal. Now the Combat Status Review Tribunal is the due process \nright given to suspected enemy combatants.\n  To me, 9/11 was an act of war. It was also a crime, but it was an act \nof war. I believe the people housed at Guantanamo Bay are warriors, not \ncommon criminals. They will be afforded the due process rights of \nwartime law of armed conflict, not domestic criminal law.\n  What is the law of armed conflict when it comes to status? Article V \nof the Geneva Convention says that if there is a question of status, \nthe country which houses the person, is in charge of the person, will \nconduct a competent tribunal. A ``competent tribunal'' all over the \nworld is a military proceeding where the military of that country will \ndetermine if the person in front of them is a civilian, uniformed \nperson, or enemy combatant.\n  The Combat Status Review Tribunal is well beyond the due process \nrequirement of the Geneva Conventions. What happens at the Combat \nStatus Review Tribunal, first of all, is that the enemy suspect \nprisoner will go before a panel of three military officers trained in \nwho presents a military threat--an intelligence officer, a combat \nofficer, and a legal officer. I think tomorrow or Friday, the 14 high-\nvalue detainees who have been in CIA custody will go through this \nprocess.\n  The question for this Congress is, Do we want the military to make \nthe initial decision on who an enemy prisoner is based on what a \nmilitary threat is to our country and the expertise the military has in \ndetermining if this person\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\nis an enemy prisoner, enemy combatant, or do we want to give that to a \ndistrict court judge who has absolutely no training?\n  Enemy prisoners during World War II were not allowed to file habeas \npetitions and come into our Federal courts and sue the military during \na time of war to be released. Chief Justice Jackson said: Wait a \nminute. This is not our job. We are not trained for this. If we allow \nenemy prisoners detained by our military during a time of war to have \naccess to our Federal courts, Federal judges are taking over a job the \nmilitary is trained for and we are not trained for.\n  Here is what Justice Jackson said in the Eisentrager case:\n\n       We are cited to no instance where a court, in this or any \n     other country where the writ is known, has issued it on \n     behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in no \n     stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial \n     jurisdiction.\n\n  Nothing in the text of this Constitution extends such a right nor \ndoes anything in our statute.\n  So the Eisentrager case in 1950 clearly said habeas does not apply to \nenemy prisoners. I cannot find the language--it talks about why it is a \nbad idea--but it is forthcoming. So as early as 1950, the courts \nrejected enemy prisoner petitions in the Federal court.\n  Now, the question for Congress is, after 9/11--5 years later--do we \nas a Congress want to confer onto people classified by our military to \nbe enemy combatants a Federal court right never known in the law of \narmed conflict at any other time in our history? Do we want to be the \nfirst Congress in the history of the United States to take away from \nour military the ability to determine who a military threat is and make \nliterally a Federal court trial out of that decision?\n  There had been 160 habeas petitions filed before we acted last year. \nLet me tell you, they have sued our own military for everything \nimaginable: the quality of the food, DVD access, not enough exercise, \njudge-supervised interrogation. Some of the people who have brought \nthese cases are accused of killing Americans in the most brutal way.\n  One of the lawyers, Mr. Michael Ratner, who filed habeas petitions on \nbehalf of enemy combatants held at Guantanamo Bay, publicly stated:\n\n       The litigation [for the United States]. . . . It's huge. We \n     have over one hundred lawyers now from big and small firms \n     working to represent these detainees. Every time an attorney \n     goes down there, it makes it that much harder [for the U.S. \n     military] to do what they're doing. You can't run an \n     interrogation . . . with attorneys. What are they going to do \n     now that we're getting court orders to get more lawyers down \n     there?\n\n  It is clear that it does--according to one of the lawyers \nrepresenting detainees--make it very difficult for the military to do \ntheir job when it comes to intelligence gathering. I will have an \nunclassified summary to put into the Record at the end of my time that \ntalks about the information gained at Guantanamo Bay.\n  But here is what Justice Jackson said would be the real big mistake \nfor the Federal courts if you start granting habeas petitions and give \nenemy prisoners a right to sue our own people about their status in a \ntime of war:\n\n       The writ, since it is held to be a matter of right, would \n     be equally available to enemies during active hostilities as \n     in the present twilight between war and peace. Such trials \n     would hamper the war effort and bring aid and comfort to the \n     enemy. They would diminish the prestige of our commanders, \n     not only with enemies but with wavering neutrals. It would be \n     difficult to devise more effective fettering of a field \n     commander than to allow the very enemies he is ordered to \n     reduce to submission to call him to account in his own civil \n     courts and divert his efforts and attention from the military \n     offensive abroad to the legal defensive at home. Nor is it \n     unlikely that the result of such enemy litigiousness would be \n     a conflict between judicial and military opinion highly \n     comforting to enemies of the United States.\n\n  Was he prophetic? These 160 cases have created a nightmare for the \nmilitary at Guantanamo Bay. Medical malpractice suits have been filed, \n$100 million money-damage lawsuits have been filed. It has been a legal \nnightmare.\n  So what I am trying to persuade the Congress to do is not grant in \nstatute a right never given to any other enemy prisoner during any \nother war, because it is dangerous to do so.\n  What did we do to accommodate the unique needs of this war, a war \npotentially without end? For the first time in the history of our \ncountry, we are allowing Federal courts to review whether a person has \nbeen properly classified as an enemy prisoner. Once the military \ndecides Shaikh Mohammed's status Friday, the mastermind allegedly of 9/\n11, can you imagine 5 years after 9/11 the Congress would open up any \nFederal courtroom that a lawyer could shop to find--whatever judge the \nlawyer could find in the country--and allow Shaikh Mohammed to sue our \nown military about his status, creating a nightmare zoo courtroom \ntrial, bringing people from all over the world to determine his status, \nwhere the judge would have a say, not the military? That would be a \nmistake of monumental proportions.\n  What will happen is Shaikh Mohammed, in a classified setting, will \nhave evidence presented by the Government to show he is an enemy \ncombatant. He will have a chance to rebut that. When his case has been \ndecided, he will have an automatic right of appeal to the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, where the DC Circuit Court of Appeals will look at \nthe military decision in question and find out whether two things \noccurred. Were the due process rights given Shaikh Mohammed and other \nenemy combatant suspects consistent with our own Constitution? \nSecondly, was the evidence introduced sufficient to support the finding \nhe is an enemy combatant?\n  That is the proper role for a judge. That is what judges are trained \nto do. It would be a monumental mistake to allow a habeas petition to \nbe filed, where literally you could go to any court in the land and \nhave a full-blown trial, calling people off the battlefield to make the \ncase that this person was an enemy prisoner and give that \ndecisionmaking ability to a judge not trained in who is a military \nthreat to our country and take it away from the military.\n\n  That is why I am so passionate about this issue. I do believe in due \nprocess at a time of war. I have been a military lawyer for well over \n20 years. I believe our country should adhere to the Geneva \nConventions, that we should be a standard-bearer for what is right. But \nwe should not cripple our military's ability to defend us in a way that \nmakes absolutely no sense.\n  We should not put Federal judges on the frontlines in deciding who is \na threat to this country, when the military is trained to do that. Let \nthe judges look over the military's shoulder and in a proper way, \nconsistent with their training.\n  Now, what is going to happen? The case is going to go to the Supreme \nCourt soon. If I am wrong, I will take the floor and say so. Senator \nSpecter has a belief there is a constitutional right to habeas. I do \nnot believe that. But if the Court holds so, then I would be wrong. I \nwould argue that the DC Circuit Court of Appeals is an adequate \nsubstitute for habeas, but that will be up to the Court.\n  All I am asking is to allow the work product of last year that has \ngone before the DC Circuit Court of Appeals that has been upheld to go \nthrough the system. I will gladly sit down with Senators Specter and \nLevin to see if we can work on better due process rights for people \naccused of being an enemy combatant. I think we can do that as a \nCongress without turning that decision over to Federal judges. It is a \nvery dangerous thing we are proposing to do, to take away from the \nmilitary to determine who a threat is and to give it to a Federal \njudge.\n  Finally, I would like to say: I know this is a war without end. Two \nhundred-and-something people have been released from Guantanamo Bay \nbecause they get an annual review board to look at their status anew. \nWe do not want to keep people who have been misidentified who are not a \nthreat. But we do not have the choice of ``try them or let them go.'' \nThis is a war, and we can keep warriors off the battlefield as long as \nthey are a threat. When it comes time to determine who should bear that \nrisk, who should bear the risk of letting someone go at Guantanamo \nBay--the innocent civilian populations of the world who have been a \nvictim of people out of uniform wreaking havoc or the people who \nstarted this whole mess to begin with--if you are going to proportion \nrisk, I think it should fall on the people who created the problem to \nbegin with.\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\n  Twelve people have been released from Guantanamo Bay under the annual \nreview process of the 200-and-something. Twelve have gone back to the \nbattle. Three have been killed. So you make mistakes both ways. I don't \nwant to hold one person down there who should not be held, but I don't \nwant to let anybody go who is a threat to our country because we are at \nwar.\n  Due process rights attach to people in war, but we cannot criminalize \nwhat has been an act of war beginning on September 11, 2001. The people \ndown there will have their day in court. They will have a chance to \nhave a say about who they are and what the facts are. But I do believe \nthere are people down at Guantanamo Bay who are warriors. If they ever \ngot out, they would try to kill us again.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, will my friend from South Carolina \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I appreciate the Senator's remarks. I know the Senator \nfrom South Carolina has a background in military law, so he speaks with \nsome authority on these questions.\n  What interests me in this discussion is the rights of citizens as \nopposed to noncitizens. I wanted to ask my friend, first, am I right \nthat you are not arguing against the principle that an American \ncitizen, even one alleged to be an enemy combatant, does have habeas \ncorpus rights?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator is absolutely right; any American citizen. \nThe Padilla case is the best example you could give. Padilla was \ncharged as an enemy combatant, a U.S. citizen. It is true American \ncitizens in the past have been held indefinitely as enemy combatants. \nBut I do believe they should have access to our courts as a member of \ncitizenship. And they would have a constitutional right to seek relief \nfrom a Federal judge to determine whether the military or law \nenforcement officers make that decision. We are talking about people in \nthe same status as the Germans and the Japanese. There was a reason the \nthousands of enemy prisoners housed in the United States never had \naccess to our Federal courts. It is what Justice Jackson was saying. \nThe Federal judiciary would make a mockery of the military's ability to \nrun the war if you turned every military decision into a Federal court \ntrial as to who an enemy prisoner is. Justice Jackson, in the most \neloquent fashion, told us what could come if you conferred these rights \non enemy prisoners.\n  Here is what is odd. If I am a lawful combatant, if I am captured \ntomorrow as a member of the uniformed services of the United States, I \ndo not have any rights under the Geneva Conventions to go to the host \ncountry's judiciary. We are creating, for unlawful combatants, enemy \ncombatants, a right greater than someone who is captured as a lawful \ncombatant.\n  Under the Geneva Conventions, there is no right to go to a court in \nany land to ask to be released. But in America, if you are an unlawful \ncombatant, we are giving you your day in Federal court, after the \nmilitary acts, which I think is an accommodation for the fact that this \nwar is different. It is not lost upon this Senator this war is \ndifferent. There will be no signing on the ``Missouri.'' I do not know \nwhen this war is going to end. I do not want an enemy combatant \ndecision to be a de facto life sentence without robust due process. But \nI do believe, if the choice is between letting them go or having them \ndie in jail, if they are still a threat, let them die in jail.\n  I do believe every enemy prisoner is not a war criminal, and the \nchoice for the country is not ``let them go or try them.'' Because that \nis a false choice in the law of armed conflict. It would not serve us \nwell to say that every American captured in the next war is a war \ncriminal because they are performing their duties. You only confer war \ncriminal status on someone who goes outside the law of armed conflict. \nSo we are making some decisions for the ages.\n  I am all for due process. I am all for scrutiny and transparency \nbecause I want my country to win the war not changing whom we are. But \nI do not want us to fundamentally change the relationship between the \nmilitary and military threats. Our judges have a role to play. The \nCongress has a role to play. The military has a role to play. Keep \neverybody in their lanes, and this will work.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend.\n  So I take his answer to say also--correct me if I am wrong--that the \nexisting statute, including the MCA--which is the subject of the \nlawsuits we have been describing that are pending--the existing statute \ndoes not alter the right of American citizens who are alleged to be \nenemy combatants to use habeas corpus rights?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Senator is correct in two fashions. It says no \nmilitary commission can try an American citizen. A military commission \nat Guantanamo Bay cannot, as a matter of law, try an American citizen, \neven if they are an enemy combatant. Someone from America could join \nal-Qaida, but they are going to be tried in our Federal courts if they \nare caught.\n  What we are trying to do is have a military commission consistent \nwith the Uniformed Code of Military Justice to try people. The \ndifference between now and Nuremberg, I say to the Senator, is the war \nis still ongoing. The reason we are not going to release all the \ninformation as to why Shaikh Mohammed is an enemy combatant is because \nthat is very sensitive information. We will give a summary to the \npublic. And the courts will get to review that decision in full in a \nclassified setting. But I cannot stress to you enough we are at war.\n  The last time we had a Federal trial where somebody tried to blow up \nthe World Trade Center in the early 1990s, some of the information in \nthat courtroom setting that had to be released wound up in a cave in \nAfghanistan. I will talk about that later. We are trying to balance the \nneed to be safe and the obligations we have under the law of armed \nconflict. I think we have struck a good balance. If I am wrong, the \nSupreme Court will tell me. Please, just to my fellow Senators, let \nthis case go to the Supreme Court, see what they say, and we can fix it \nif we need to. That is all I am asking.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Again, I thank my friend. So in furthering what this \ndiscussion is about, it is whether non-American citizens seized in the \nwar on terrorism and alleged to be enemy combatants should have habeas \ncorpus rights under our Constitution?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am the biggest advocate that an American citizen such \nas Mr. Padilla should be tried in Federal court. The man who was caught \nworking with the Taliban in Afghanistan was in Federal court. Moussaoui \nwas in Federal court because we didn't have the Military Commissions \nAct. An American citizen will be tried in Federal court with all the \nrights of an American citizen available to them.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Let me ask this final question. This is the part of \nthis discussion that I struggle with, which is what is the appropriate \nstatus in the context in which we are talking about permanent lawful \nresidents of the United States.\n  In other words, if I understand what the Military Commissions Act--\nagain, correct me if I am wrong--says, is that a permanent, lawful \nresident of the United States who is apprehended as part of the war on \nterrorism and alleged to be an enemy combatant does not have a right of \nhabeas, or a right to have a case heard in Federal court. That concerns \nme. This is what I want to ask my friend from South Carolina who has \nhad experience with this to clarify, as to whether that may be--if I \ncan use the term a ``denial'' of equal protection--to say a permanent, \nlawful resident of the United States cannot have the same rights in \nthese cases that a citizen of the United States has.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, that is a very good question, and I think that is \nsomething we actually need to sit down and look at, that situation \nwhere you are not a citizen, but you are here on a legal status. I \nwould be, quite frankly, very comfortable to clarify that, if anyone \never finds themselves in that category, to say, no, you are going to \nhave all the rights of an American citizen.\n  What I am trying to do is make sure that we don't change 200 years of \nhistory. The people who assassinated President Lincoln, within 30 days \nthey were caught, tried, and executed in a military commission format. \nWe have had American civilians tried in military commissions in times \nof war, but they were reviewed by our Federal courts. Some of the \nGerman saboteurs who landed during World War II, I\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\nthink one or two of them actually were American citizens who left to go \nback to Germany to aid the enemy. They got tried by military \ncommissions, and the Supreme Court reviewed their case.\n  What I am saying is that an enemy prisoner, a noncitizen, since time \nbegan in our country and in every other country, has been treated under \nthe law of armed conflict, not domestic statutes. That is a distinction \nof great significance, and we don't need--the due process rights these \nenemy combatants, noncitizens, have are greater than the Geneva \nConventions require, and every enemy combatant had their day in Federal \ncourt but in a way consistent with what judges are trained to do.\n  I don't believe it is in our national interests during ongoing \nhostilities to take away from the military the ability to classify who \nthey believe to be a threat, what status that person has acquired based \non their activities. I do believe the courts can look at every case and \nsee: Was due process afforded? Did the evidence support the finding? \nThat, to me, is the magic combination, and habeas destroys that \ncombination.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from South Carolina. This, to me, \nhas been a very helpful exchange. I would like to continue the \ndiscussion on the distinct question of what the habeas rights of \npermanent lawful residents of the United States should be.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It is a great area to discuss. I thank the Senator. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from South Carolina if \nhe would be willing to respond to a few questions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would be honored to respond to my friend from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will begin with the subject matter brought up by the \nSenator from Connecticut about the status of aliens. I would note that \nin the Rasul case, the Supreme Court, Justice Stevens speaking for a \nmajority, answered this categorically:\n\n       Aliens held at the base, like American citizens, are \n     entitled to invoke the Federal courts' section 2241 \n     authority--\n\n  Which is the habeas corpus statute.\n  So the court has dealt with that conclusively in Rasul much the same \nway that Justice O'Connor did speaking for plurality in an earlier \ncase.\n  Addressing the question to the Senator from South Carolina, earlier \ntoday I noted the order establishing Combat Status Review Tribunals, \nand it provided that:\n\n       All detainees shall be notified--\n\n  Leaving out some irrelevant material--\n\n     of the right to seek a writ of habeas corpus in the courts of \n     the United States.\n\n  Is the Senator familiar with that provision?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No, sir, I am not.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, I hadn't been until a few days ago. But this is \nthe Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, in a memorandum dated \nJuly 7, 2004, to the Secretary of the Navy.\n  The Senator from South Carolina made the argument that the judges \nwere not appropriate to make determinations of reviewing the orders or \nthe conclusions of the Combat Status Review Tribunal. How would the \nSenator from South Carolina account for the acquiescence by the--\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have been told that the order the Senator is talking \nabout was implemented in the Rasul decision, and it would be a correct \nstatement of Mr. Wolfowitz to make.\n\n       Rasul said that habeas rights attached to Guantanamo Bay \n     detainees until Congress says otherwise, and that is the \n     difference we have. I read Rasul to say, since Congress \n     hasn't spoken under 2241, Guantanamo Bay is within U.S. \n     jurisdiction and the statute would apply to anybody held \n     at Guantanamo Bay. It is not an overseas location. Until \n     Congress speaks, under 2241 you will have the right.\n\n  Congress has spoken. We spoke last year. We took 2241 and changed it. \nWe excluded noncitizens and any prisoners from the habeas rights under \n2241 and, quite honestly, that issue has gone to the D.C. Circuit Court \nof Appeals, and we won last week.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, the question about the Department of Defense \nagreeing to allow habeas corpus rights was not taken up by the Circuit \nCourt for the District of Columbia and the Detainee Treatment Act. \nCongress gave the Department of Defense the right to establish the \nrules, and that is one of the rules. Wait a minute. The question hasn't \ncome yet.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. OK.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is it fair to change the rules in the middle of the \nprocess after the Department of Defense has stated that they think it \nis appropriate for a Federal court--they specifically talk about courts \nof the United States--to make a determination under habeas corpus to \nsee if the definition which they set for enemy combatants has been \nfollowed. They have specified that there has to be evidence. To the \ndefinition of what or who is an enemy combatant:\n\n       An individual who was part of or supporting the Taliban or \n     al-Qaida forces, or associated forces that are engaged in \n     hostilities against the United States or its coalition \n     partners. This includes any person who has committed a \n     belligerent act or has directly supported hostilities in aid \n     of enemy armed forces.\n\n  Now, the Department of Defense who promulgated this order concluded \nthat it was within the purview of the Federal courts, and that is \nreally a judicial function to determine whether the definition for \nenemy combatant has been achieved, isn't it?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If I may respond, I think it is not remotely fair to say \nthat the Department of Defense has conceded that habeas corpus rights \nshould be given to detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Once Rasul was decided \nand the Government lost, that it was outside the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States, the Rasul case said: Until Congress acts, you will have \na habeas right. The administration has come to me and other Members of \nthis body since that decision and has been begging us to address 2241. \nThe Supreme Court, in three separate decisions, has said Congress needs \nto get involved. The administration's theory was, there is no room for \nCongress in the courts.\n  Here is where the Senator and I have been partners. I have always \nbelieved the executive branch has to collaborate with the Congress, and \nthey have been hard-headed about this and they wound up losing in \ncourt. They lost on whether it was outside the United States. Once the \ncourt ruled 2241 applied, the DOD had no other choice but to tell \npeople: This is a statutory right. They were telling people at \nGuantanamo Bay: This is your statutory right. They were coming to me \nand other Senators saying: Please change 2241 because it is hampering \nthe war effort.\n  That is exactly where we find ourselves. We took the input of the \nadministration, we voted last year, we stripped habeas from 2241 where \ndistrict court judges could make military decisions, and we are \nreplaced in the appeals process where Federal courts do look at what \nthe military does after they have decided. I think not only did the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals uphold that as a proper thing to do but \nthe Supreme Court will also.\n  So my belief is that it was our decision as Congress as to whether to \ngive these enemy prisoners habeas rights, unlike any other war. We \ndecided with Rasul we didn't want to do that. I think it is the best \ndecision we have ever made. If you had asked this Congress on September \n30, 2001: Would you want to create a Federal court action for any al-\nQaida member caught to go into Federal court and bring lawsuits against \nour own troops alleging not enough exercise, bad DVD access, you name \nit, we would have said no. That would have been crazy. Why would we \nwant to give this group of people who are trying to kill us all rights \nthat we didn't give the Japanese and the Nazis who were trying to kill \nus all?\n  So now we find ourselves in Congress filling in the gap that the \ncourt found. The Congress has spoken. We told the courts, D.C. Circuit \nCourt of Appeals: No habeas rights under 2241. We substituted another \nprocedure that I think makes sense, and the court found out that we did \nit in a constitutional manner, and I think we are going to win at the \nSupreme Court.\n  But having said that, if there are other ways to improve due process \nwhere the Congress can make this CSRT process better, count me in. But \nI am not going to sit on the sidelines and watch the Federal courts do \nsomething they are not trained to do before Congress blesses it. If the \nSenator is\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\nright that the Supreme Court says apart from 2241 an enemy prisoner, \nnoncitizen, has a constitutional right to habeas, then I would be \nwrong. I would argue that our procedures under the D.C. Circuit Court \nof Appeals method of going to challenge the military is an adequate \nsubstitute. But I am firmly convinced that our courts are going to say \nthere is no constitutional right for these prisoners, like there was \nnone for Japanese and German prisoners, and that Congress has made a \ngood decision to take the Federal courts and put them behind the \nmilitary, not in front of the military.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, if I may respond, when the Supreme Court said \nCongress should act, they were saying that Congress should legislate on \nhow a military commission should be tried. But moving to your argument \nabout the issue of constitutional right, how could it be that if the \nConstitution says that the right of habeas corpus can be suspended only \nin the event of invasion or insurrection? How can it be argued that \nthere is no constitutional right?\n  That is the argument that the Attorney General made in the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing. Where the Constitution explicitly says the \nconstitutional right of habeas corpus can be suspended only in invasion \nor insurrection, and no one says that either of those factors is \npresent here, isn't that a flat-out statement that there is a \nconstitutional right?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. All I can tell my colleague is that issue went up to the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals 2 weeks ago and they said just as clearly \nas you can say it that there is no constitutional right for a \nnoncitizen enemy prisoner classified as such by our military during \nhostilities to come into our Federal courts. Just like Justice Jackson \nsaid in 1950, that would be a disaster. I just can't believe any \nFederal court is going to say that Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of \n9/11, who is an al-Qaida member, gets more rights than the Nazis. I \njust don't believe they are going to do that. If I am wrong, I will \ncome to the floor of the Senate and say I am wrong. But I think I am \nright. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals agrees with me, and I believe \nwe are going to win at the Supreme Court, if we can let these judges \nlook at something without changing it every 30 days.\n  Let's give this a shot and see what happens. We will know soon. I \napologize, but I have to go.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Wait just a minute. Make your answers a little more \nresponsive and brief, and I won't keep you too long. I will keep you \njust a few more minutes.\n  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said that the \nSupreme Court, speaking explicitly through Justice Stevens, only dealt \nwith a holding on the statute.\n  They classified it as dictum when they said there was a \nconstitutional right. Let me move on quickly to a couple of other \npoints.\n  As to the adequacy of proceedings in the combat status review \ntribunals, you have the case involving In re: Guantanamo, which I cited \nthis morning, where Judge Green dealt with the precise case in the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit Court, the Boumediene case, which had a \nprocedure where the detainee was charged with talking to somebody who \nwas from al-Qaida, and he asked who it was and they could not identify \nthe person. There was laughter in the courtroom, and Judge Green said \nit is understandable that there was laughter in the courtroom because \nnothing had been established.\n  I ask a very simple, direct question, and maybe you can even answer \nit yes or no. Was that a fair proceeding?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I can tell you that the Court will soon tell us. If I can \ngive you what I think is the right answer, the combat status review \ntribunal, as to whether they provided adequate due process is on appeal \nnow to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will soon tell us not just \nabout war crimes legislation but about the CSRT provisions and whether \nthey are constitutional.\n  I argue we are going to win on that one because 190-1 of the Army \nmanual was the model that set up the combat status review tribunal. \nWhat right does a person have under the Geneva Conventions, in a time \nof war, when it comes to the question of status? Article 5 says \ncompetent tribunals--and all over the world that competent tribunal is \nnot a Federal judge or the equivalent in another country, it is a \nmilitary tribunal. If the Court rules the combat status review tribunal \ndoesn't afford due process, I will sit down with you and others to make \nit comply to the Court's decision. I have no desire to take somebody \nfrom any part of the world and put them at Guantanamo Bay if they \nshould not be there. That doesn't make America better or stronger. I do \nbelieve, contrary to the laughter in the courtroom, that the people \nbest able to determine whether an enemy prisoner is a threat to our \ncountry or, in fact, an enemy prisoner is not some circuit judge or \ndistrict court judge anywhere in America who was never trained in this, \nbut military officers who are trained in making those decisions. They \nare the ones I trust. They have done it in every other war; they should \ndo it in this war. I am willing to have their work product looked at by \nthe Federal courts, and that is going on right now. We will soon know \nthe answer to that question. Are CSRTs constitutional? If not, we will \nfix them.\n  I hate to leave. I have enjoyed this debate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have one more thing. I take your last extended \nstatement to be a ``no,'' am I right?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I believe they will be constitutional. If you think there \nhas been a miscarriage of justice in any case, that will go to court. \nIf you think something happened in the CSRT that is laughable, then the \nFederal court is going to get to look at every case. I can assure you \nand every other American that every decision made by the military on \nGuantanamo Bay will work its way to the Federal court, and our judges \nwill look at the record and the process, and they will tell us in \nindividual cases and as a group whether this works. Give them a chance \nto do it.\n  With that, I have to leave.\n  Mr. SPECTER. One last question. I still take that to be a ``no.'' It \nwas not a complex question. Do you think it is fair where the \nDepartment of Defense sets the rules, contrary to your assertion, that \nthey think Federal judges can decide whether the evidence establishes \nthe standard for an enemy combatant, do you think it is as fair under \nAmerican justice to have a presumption of guilt?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No. This is an administrative hearing. The enemy \ncombatant status determination is not a criminal decision. It is, in an \narmed conflict, an administrative decision where the procedure is set \nup. I will get you the regulation and we will introduce it, but it is \narticle 5 on steroids. It has presumptions, rebuttable presumptions, \nand you have an annual review board on what should be determined to be \na enemy combatant. You have a new hearing every year on whether new \nevidence came in, whether you are still a threat to the country, and \nwhether you have intelligence value. Two hundred people have been \nreleased at Guantanamo Bay because they have gone through the process \nand the military determined they are no longer a threat. Twelve of the \ntwo hundred have gone back to killing Americans.\n  There is no perfect system. We are trying to be fair. God knows we \nwant to be fair, but I tell you what, in close calls between letting \nsomeone go who the military thinks is a member of al-Qaida and killing \nother Americans and innocent people, I am going to make sure they stay \nin jail and let the judges determine if we have done it fairly. I will \nnot sit on the sidelines and open the gates to people who have been \ncaught in the process of aiding the enemy or becoming the enemy just \nbecause we are trying to create new rules for this war that we have \nnever had in any other war because some people don't like Bush. Bush \nmade a lot of mistakes, but this war is going to go on long after Bush \nis gone.\n  If you let these people out of jail, at least 12 of them are going to \ncome back and kill you.\n  With that, I must leave. We will continue the debate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let me say, in conclusion, that bombast and oratory and \nrepetition cannot undercut a few very basic facts. One is that the \nDepartment of Defense established a rule to give Guantanamo detainees \nthe right of habeas corpus. They set out a standard as\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\nto what would constitute being an enemy combatant. These are rules, \nwhen they call for evidence, that judges are equipped to decide. When \nthere is a rebuttable presumption of guilt, undercutting the basic \nprinciple of America, the presumption of innocence, that is basically \nunfair.\n\n  When you talk about the decision by the Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia, where they limited the Supreme Court opinion to a \nnarrow holding on the statute, although the court then went on to say \nthere was a constitutional right, that will not pass muster when it \ncomes back to the Supreme Court. It is fallacious to the utmost to \nargue that there is no constitutional right to habeas corpus, when the \nConstitution explicitly says the right of habeas corpus may be \nsuspended only in time of invasion or rebellion. It simply cannot be \ncontended rationally that there is no constitutional right to habeas \ncorpus.\n  I am as concerned as the Senator from South Carolina about protecting \nAmerica. I led the fight to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. But the \nquestion is, is there some reason to hold the detainees? In the case \nthat went to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals, you had \nthe District Court looking at the information--it wasn't evidence--\nwhich was that the detainee had a conversation with an al-Qaida member, \nbut they could not identify him. The proceeding was a laughingstock. \nThat is the detainee in the District of Columbia Circuit Court case \nwhich is going to the Supreme Court.\n  I don't think this Congress ought to wait or punt to the Supreme \nCourt. We passed a statute which takes away Federal court jurisdiction \nto make the simple determination: Is there a reason to hold them? We \nought not to let that stand.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated today, received by \nSenator Leahy and myself, be printed in the Record. It sets forth \neloquently the reasons why habeas corpus for detainees should be \nreinstated by the Congress. It is signed by RADM Don Guter, who was the \nNavy's Judge Advocate General; RADM John Hutson, the Navy's Judge \nAdvocate General at an earlier period; BG David Brahms, who was the \nMarine Corps senior legal adviser from 1983 until 1988; and BG James \nCullen, who was the chief judge of the U.S. Army Court of Criminal \nAppeals.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     March 7, 2007\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy, Chairman,\n     Hon. Arlen Specter, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter: We strongly \n     support your legislation to restore habeas corpus for \n     detainees in US custody. We hope that it quickly becomes law.\n       Known as the ``Great Writ,'' habeas corpus is the legal \n     proceeding that allows individuals a chance to contest the \n     legality of their detention. It has a long pedigree in Anglo \n     Saxon jurisprudence, dating back to 13th Century England when \n     it established the principle that even Kings are bound by the \n     rule of law. Our Founding Fathers enshrined the writ in the \n     Constitution, describing it as one of the essential \n     components of a free nation.\n       In discarding habeas corpus, we are jettisoning one of the \n     core principles of our nation precisely when we should be \n     showcasing to the world our respect for the rule of law and \n     basic rights. These are the characteristics that make our \n     nation great. These are the values our men and women in \n     uniform are fighting to preserve.\n       Abiding by these principles is critical to defeating \n     terrorist enemies. The U.S. Army's Counterinsurgency Manual, \n     which outlines our strategy against non-traditional foes like \n     al Qaeda, makes clear that victory depends on building the \n     support of local populations where our enemies operate \n     through the legitimate exercise of our power. The Manual \n     states: ``Respect for preexisting and impersonal legal rules \n     can provide the key to gaining widespread and enduring \n     societal support. . . . Illegitimate actions,'' including \n     ``unlawful detention, torture, and punishment without trial . \n     . . are self-defeating, even against insurgents who conceal \n     themselves amid non-combatants and flout the law.'' Our \n     enemies have used our detention of prisoners without trial or \n     access to courts to undermine the legitimacy of our actions \n     and to build support for their despicable cause.\n       It is certainly true that prisoners of war have never been \n     given access to courts to challenge their detention. But the \n     United States does have a history of providing access to \n     courts to those who have not been granted POW status and are \n     instead being held as unlawful combatants, as are the \n     detainees in this conflict. See., e.g., Ex Parte Quirin, 317 \n     U.S. 1 (1942) (rejecting the claim that the Court could not \n     review the habeas claim of enemy aliens held for law of war \n     violations).\n       POWs are combatants held according to internationally \n     prescribed rules, and are released at the end of the war in \n     which they fought. In a traditional war, it is generally easy \n     to determine who is a combatant and governed by these special \n     rules. But the war we are fighting today is different. \n     Detainees held at Guantanamo Bay were captured in 14 \n     countries around the world, including places as far away from \n     any traditional battlefield as Thailand, Gambia, and Russia. \n     Some were sold to the United States by bounty hunters. Our \n     enemies blend into the civilian population, making the \n     practice of identifying them more difficult. For all these \n     reasons, the possibility of making mistakes is much higher \n     than in a traditional conflict. In such a situation, it is \n     incumbent on our nation to ensure that there is an \n     independent review of the decision to detain.\n       The denial of habeas corpus also threatens to harm our \n     national interests by placing American civilians at risk. \n     Imagine if an enemy of the United States arrested an American \n     citizen--a nurse or interpreter or employee of a military \n     contractor--because they once provided assistance to our \n     armed forces, and held that American without charge or \n     opportunity to challenge their detention in court. We would \n     be outraged, and rightly so. Yet, this is the precedent we \n     are setting by holding without charge those deemed to have \n     aided the enemy and denying them access to a court that could \n     review the basis of their detention.\n       A judicial check on the decision to detain is in the best \n     tradition of the United States--a tradition that ensures \n     accountability, accuracy, and credibility. Restoring habeas \n     corpus will help ensure that we are detaining the right \n     people and showcase to the world our respect for the rule of \n     law and the values that distinguish America from our enemies.\n       We hope that Congress will act quickly to pass this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rear Admiral Don Guter, USN (Ret.)\n     Rear Admiral John D. Hutson, USN (Ret.)\n     Brigadier General David M. Brahms, USMC (Ret.)\n     Brigadier General James P. Cullen, USA (Ret.).\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I rise to speak for a few minutes on the \ntopic that was being covered by Senators Specter, Graham, Lieberman, \nand others, and that is the right of detainees--in particular, \ndetainees at Guantanamo Bay--to petition the court system through what \nwe refer to as habeas corpus and question the specific details that \nhave led to their confinement, to their definition or status as an \nenemy combatant.\n  This is an important issue. Naturally people get excited when they \nare debating this issue. Senator Graham is no exception. But one thing \nthat he mentioned I think must be addressed, and that is this is about \nletting people out of jail, letting people go free who might attack the \nUnited States at a later date. I feel very strongly that this isn't \nabout letting people out of jail, and it isn't even necessarily about \nletting people object to the conditions of their confinement, because I \nbelieve Congress can and should address the habeas issue without \nnecessarily allowing any frivolous petition regarding conditions to go \nforward. But it is about the rights of these individuals to question \nthe determination that they are an enemy combatant.\n  The U.S. military or other forces operating on behalf of our \ncoalitions overseas have captured and detained individuals and \ndetermined that they are enemy combatants and, therefore, they can be \ndetained indefinitely on the basis of that determination.\n  The situations that arose in previous conflicts were also brought up. \nWhat about similar situations in the Second World War, the First World \nWar, or other engagements of the U.S. military in our past? I rise \ntoday, most importantly, to emphasize that there is a significant \ndifference between this war and those conflicts. There are differences \nin some very important ways that make this right or this ability to \npetition against your definition as an enemy combatant very important.\n  First, this is not a war where we have troops lined up or engaged on \na battlefield in uniform. These are very different combatants, very \ndifferent enemies we face, by that definition, not always easily \nrecognized and sometimes incredibly difficult to recognize\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\nthose who are planning to kill U.S. citizens or our allies around the \nworld. They are not on a specific battlefield and certainly not in \nuniform.\n  Second, these enemy combatants--and there are many thousands of enemy \ncombatants the United States faces around the world--could be almost \nanywhere in the world. It makes this very different than past \nconflicts. They could be here in the United States, they could be in \nPakistan, they could be in Somalia, they could be in Kenya, they could \nbe in Germany, they could be in Spain, or they could be in the United \nKingdom. As a result, we could have an individual in any one of these \ncountries captured, detained, and placed into our incarceration in \nGuantanamo Bay or another facility and designate them as an enemy \ncombatant.\n  That is highly unusual when compared to past conflicts or past \nbattles and, I think, as a result could naturally cause significant \nproblems in relations with other military organizations that are \nsupporting our efforts, other countries' diplomatic affairs, all of \nwhich are important to our success in this effort.\n  So because these are individuals who could be captured and detained \nfrom anywhere around the world, we have to take extra consideration to \nmake sure they are dealt with in a straightforward way that respects \nprinciples of due process.\n  Third, a third important distinction in this conflict is because of \nthe nature of the conflict, these individuals could be held \nindefinitely without any clear prospect of being released through the \nprocesses that would often bring a conclusion to hostilities, \nnegotiation, a cease-fire, or surrender.\n  We all recognize this conflict is very different in that regard. When \nconstituents back home in New Hampshire ask me, When is this struggle \nagainst terrorism going to end? You certainly can't give a definitive \nanswer in terms of time, but you also are very hard pressed to give a \ndefinitive answer in terms of specific objectives--when we capture this \nindividual, when we destroy this organization, when we bring stability \nto this part of the world that is traditionally encouraged or fermented \njihadists. So we have for these individuals--many of whom are evil \nindividuals who have plotted and planned against the United States and \nour allies around the world--indeterminate, unlimited detention at the \nhands of the United States.\n  Given those differences that set this conflict apart from past \nmilitary conflicts in our history, I think it is in keeping with our \nstandards of due process to ensure that when someone finds themselves \nindefinitely held by the United States in this conflict, they can at a \nminimum petition, object to their status or the determination of their \nstatus as an enemy combatant, and at least argue on appeal the facts of \nthe case, make an argument as to why they should not be classified as \nan enemy combatant.\n  Senator Specter and others made the argument when we were considering \nthe Detainee Treatment Act that this ought to be done in the D.C. \nCircuit Court of Appeals. I think the exact time, place, and manner of \nthis appeal can and should be determined by an act of Congress. But I \nthink what is most important is that we not simply say because \ncommanders on the battlefield decided--when I use the word \n``battlefield,'' I mean in this modern sense--commanders somewhere in \nthe field, somewhere around the world, after you were arrested or \ndetained or captured, decided you were an enemy combatant, that we are \ngoing to let that determination stand without appeal, without \nobjection, without petition.\n  At the very least, again, it is consistent with the principles of due \nprocess that are so important to this country that we give that \ndetainee at least one opportunity to object in a court to the specifics \nthat led to him being determined an enemy combatant.\n  This is an important issue, but I think it is not just important \nbecause it affects our security, which we all want to protect to the \ngreatest extent possible, but because it speaks to our own citizens and \nit speaks to people around the world as to what kind of a society we \nare and what principles we hold to be dearest.\n  This is an issue that deserves thorough debate in the Senate. I look \nforward to hearing more from both sides and working with Senator \nSpecter to try to move forward a process that addresses these concerns, \nthat doesn't necessarily have to grant all rights and all privileges \naccorded to every U.S. citizen to those who are determined to be enemy \ncombatants, but at least gives them the fundamental right to challenge \nthat determination which could and, in many cases, should lead to their \nindefinite incarceration at Guantanamo Bay.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, while the Senator from New Hampshire is \nstill on the floor, I thank him and commend him for his statement \ndirectly to the issues. He has articulated them very well. It is a \ndifferent circumstance and what we are looking at is the issue of \nindefinite detention and some process where there has to be some reason \ngiven for the detention. It doesn't haven't to comply with the \ntechnical Rules of Evidence, although the Department of Defense \nregulation calls for evidence, and evidence is a work of art \ncomprehending competency of items to establish a fact. But without \nmoving into the full range of evidence for some reason to hold them--\nand I agree with the Senator from New Hampshire that we are not looking \nfor a remedy to test living conditions or to test food or test a wide \nvariety of items that may be comprehended in other habeas corpus \nsituations, but just detention--that is all--just detention.\n  I am agreeable to modifying the amendment to specifying just \ndetention. The Senator from New Hampshire raises a valid point that \nthere may be other Senators--he estimates as many as 10--who are \ninclined to support an amendment which directed itself only at \ndetention.\n  There is the right of modification. I am going to talk to more of my \ncolleagues to see if that would produce a significantly different \nresult.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I yield the floor, and in the absence of any Senator seeking \nrecognition suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nrise in support of the Specter-Leahy amendment, No. 286, which I hope \nwe will have an opportunity to consider very shortly.\n  This amendment, which Senator Specter has addressed on the floor \nduring the course of the day, is long overdue.\n  Last fall, Congress enacted a deeply flawed law called the Military \nCommissions Act. The law gives any President the power to imprison \npeople indefinitely without charging them with any crime. It takes away \nfundamental due process as protected by the Constitutionally-protected \nright of habeas corpus. It allows our Government to continue to hold \nhundreds of prisoners for years without ever charging them with any \nwrongdoing.\n  I was one of 34 Senators who voted against the creation of this \nMilitary Commissions Act. I hope this year that Congress will begin to \nundo the damage to fundamental American values that was done by this \nlegislation.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania and the \nSenator from Vermont, the Specter-Leahy amendment, is an excellent \nplace to start. This amendment would repeal the provision of the \nMilitary Commissions Act that eliminated habeas corpus for detainees.\n  Habeas corpus is the legal name for a procedure that allows a \nprisoner to challenge their detention in court. It is a basic \nprotection against unlawful imprisonment. It is one of the bedrock \nprinciples that separates America from many other countries around the \nworld.\n  Over 700 lawyers from the Chicago area sent me a letter last year \nstrongly opposing the elimination of habeas corpus for detainees. Here \nis how they explained the importance of this basic fundamental right, \nand I quote:\n\n       The right of habeas corpus was enshrined in the \n     Constitution by our Founding Fathers as the means by which \n     anyone who is detained by the Executive may challenge the\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\n     lawfulness of his detention. It is a vital part of our system \n     of checks and balances and an important safeguard against \n     mistakes which can be made even by the best intentioned \n     government officials.\n\n  Why is this administration so interested in protecting itself from \nthe judicial review of our courts? Because the courts have repeatedly \nruled that the administration's policies have violated the law and our \nconstitution.\n  After the September 11 terrorist attacks, the administration \nunilaterally created a new detention policy for America. They claimed \nthe right to seize anyone, including an American citizen in the United \nStates, and to hold them until the end of the war on terrorism, \nwhenever that might be.\n  They claimed that even an American citizen who is detained has no \nrights. That means no right to challenge their detention, no right to \nsee the evidence against them, no right to even know why they are being \nheld. In fact, an administration lawyer claimed in court that detainees \nwould have no right to challenge their detention even if they were \nbeing tortured or summarily executed.\n  Using their new detention policy, the administration has detained \nthousands of individuals in secret detention centers around the world. \nOnly time will lead to the complete disclosure of what they have done. \nThe most well-known, Guantanamo Bay, is only one of those centers. Many \nhave been captured in Afghanistan and Iraq, and people who never raised \narms against us have been taken prisoner far from the battlefield, in \nplaces such as Bosnia and Thailand.\n  Who are the detainees in Guantanamo Bay? Well, back in 2002 then \nDefense Secretary Rumsfeld described them, and I use his words, ``the \nhardest of the hard core.'' He went on to call them, ``among the most \ndangerous, best trained, vicious killers on the face of the earth.'' \nThose are the words of Secretary Rumsfeld.\n  Well, I went to Guantanamo last July. There were some 400 detainees \nbeing held. There have been many others who have gone through that \ncamp. Hundreds of people have been detained at Guantanamo, many for \nyears, without ever being charged, and then were released.\n  Imagine, if you will, that you were scooped up by some government \nofficial, transported a thousand miles away to this rock in the middle \nof the Caribbean, this high-temperature, high-pressure location, and \nthen held literally for years without ever being charged with any \nwrongdoing.\n  Every American would agree with what I am about to say. Every \ndangerous person should be arrested and detained to protect America \nfrom terrorism. When we have good cause to believe that a person \nthreatens our country, I believe it is our right, when it comes to our \nbasic security, to detain that person and to hold that person as long \nas they are a threat to our country. In this case, however, hundreds of \nindividuals were taken from their homes, their businesses, their \nfamilies, their countries, and transported to Guantanamo, and held \nwithout charges, sometimes for years, before they were released.\n  According to media reports, military sources indicate that many of \nthe detainees had no connection to al-Qaida or the Taliban and were \nsent to Guantanamo over the objections of intelligence personnel who \nultimately recommended they be released. It was a mistake. They never \nshould have been held. They should not have been detained. Years were \ntaken off their lives, while the image of Guantanamo has been created \nacross the world.\n  One military officer said:\n\n       We are basically condemning these guys to long-term \n     imprisonment. If they weren't terrorists before, they \n     certainly could be now.\n\n  That quote comes from one of our military officials.\n  Based on a review of the Defense Department's own documents, Seton \nHall University Law School reported that only 5 percent, 1 out of 20, \nof the detainees at Guantanamo were captured by U.S. forces, while 86 \npercent were taken into custody by Pakistani or Northern Alliance \nforces at a time when the United States was paying huge amounts of \nmoney for the capture of any suspected Arab terrorist.\n  The Defense Department's own documents revealed that the large \nmajority of detainees never participated in any combat against the \nUnited States on a battlefield, and only 8 percent, that is fewer than \n1 out of 10, of those being detained were even classified as al-Qaida \nfighters.\n  In 2004, in the landmark decision of Rasul v. Bush, the Supreme Court \nrejected this administration's indefinite detention policy. The Court \nheld that detainees at Guantanamo have the right to habeas corpus to \nchallenge their detentions in Federal court. The Court held that the \ndetainees' claims that they were detained for over 2 years without any \ncharge against them and without any access to counsel, and I quote the \nCourt, ``unquestionably described custody in violation of the \nConstitution, or laws or treaties of the United States.''\n  That is why the amendment being offered by the Senator from \nPennsylvania and the Senator from Vermont is so critically important. \nWhat we have enshrined in the Military Commissions Act is a violation \nof the fundamental values of our country.\n  As I have said before, and will repeat, anyone who is a danger to \nthis country should be stopped, detained, arrested, and imprisoned, if \nnecessary, before they harm anyone in our country. Those who are \ndetained should be detained for cause. There should be a reason. There \nshould be a charge against them. They should have the most fundamental \naccess to justice, which we preach around the world; that they can \ndefend themselves, know what they are being charged with, see the \nevidence being used against them, and have the right to counsel so that \nthey can express their innocence in the most effective way.\n  How did the administration react to the Supreme Court decision in \n2004? Instead of changing its policies to comply with the Constitution, \nthe law, they came to the Republican-controlled Congress at that time \nand demanded that habeas corpus for detainees be eliminated.\n  This isn't about the rights of suspected terrorists. It is about who \nwe are as Americans. Eliminating habeas corpus is not true to our \nvalues. Sadly, it creates an image of America that causes problems even \nfor our troops in the field.\n  Recently, I went on a trip to South America with Senator Harry Reid, \nour majority leader in the Senate, and we talked to leaders in \ncountries in South America. I can recall one leader saying that he \nwanted the United States to remove a base from his country. He said: We \ndon't want to have another Guantanamo here in our sovereign country.\n  Guantanamo has become an image which needs to change. Even the \nPresident has called for the closing of Guantanamo. Yet what the \nCongress has done is to not only keep Guantanamo in business but to \nkeep it in business with rules that are inconsistent with our \nConstitution and our fundamental values.\n  Tom Sullivan is a friend of mine and a prominent attorney in Chicago. \nHe was a former U.S. attorney, a lead prosecutor for our Government in \nthat area. He served in the Army during the Korean war.\n  For nothing, on a pro bono basis, Tom Sullivan has taken on cases of \nseveral Guantanamo detainees. He has practiced law for more than 50 \nyears. He believes, even as a former professional prosecutor, that \nhabeas corpus is a fundamental bedrock of America's legal system \nbecause it represents the only recourse available when the Government \nhas made a mistake, detained a person and charged them with something \nof which they are not guilty.\n  ADM John Hutson, another man I have come to know and respect, was a \nNavy Judge Advocate for 28 years. Last year, he testified in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee hearing on the Military Commissions Act. Here is \nwhat Admiral Hutson, former Navy Judge Advocate, had to say about \neliminating habeas corpus, and I quote:\n\n       It is inconsistent with our own history and tradition to \n     take this action. If we diminish or tarnish our values, those \n     values that the Founders fought for and memorialized in the \n     Constitution and have been carefully preserved in the blood \n     and honor of succeeding generations, then we will have lost a \n     major battle in the war on terror.\n\n  Admiral Hutson concluded:\n\n       We don't need to do this. America is too strong. Our system \n     of justice is too sacred to tinker with in this way.\n\n  He also testified that eliminating habeas corpus really puts our own \nsoldiers at risk. Remember, John Hutson\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\nhas given his life to our country's military, and here is what he said:\n\n       If we fail to provide a reasonable judicial avenue to \n     consider detention, other countries will feel justified in \n     doing exactly the same thing. It is our troops who are in \n     harm's way and deserve judicial protections. In future wars, \n     we will want to ensure that our troops or those of our allies \n     are treated in a manner similar to how we treat our enemies. \n     We are now setting the standard for that treatment.\n\n  I have heard arguments on the Senate floor: Oh, it is going to glut \nthe courts of America if the 400 detainees at Guantanamo have some \nrights, if they have an opportunity to question the charges that have \nbeen brought against them, if they can use habeas corpus. I do not \nbelieve that is true and even if it was it is a small price to pay, a \nsmall price for America to pay to respect the most fundamental right \nthat we believe to be part of our system of justice.\n  Will there be abuses? Well, I am sure there will be. There have been \nin virtually all the laws we have enacted. But we will be able to say \nat the end of the day that even in the midst of a war on terror, even \nas we feared what might happen tomorrow in the wake of 9/11, that \nAmerica never lost its way in terms of its fundamental values and \nprinciples.\n  The Military Commissions Act, which passed this Senate, unfortunately \nis a step in the wrong direction. I fully support the Specter-Leahy \namendment. We should honor American values and protect our brave men \nand women in uniform by restoring the right of habeas corpus, and I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be added as a \ncosponsor to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, while the Senator from Illinois is \nstill on the Senate floor, I want to thank him for those eloquent \nremarks going right to the core of the issue, the importance of \nprotecting America from terrorists and at the same time a balance in \nprotecting Americans' constitutional rights.\n  When he refers to Tom Sullivan, the very distinguished Chicago \nattorney, I might note that Mr. Sullivan testified at a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing and brought forth a number of examples, which I put \ninto the Record earlier today, where it is recited in some detail \npeople who were detained at Guantanamo for very long periods of time. \nOne specifically commented about crossed the border, was supposed to \nhave been associated with someone from al-Qaida, no reason for keeping \nhim was given, no evidence to that effect, but was kept for 5 years and \nthen released.\n  Let me express a concern I have, which I discussed earlier with the \nSenator from Illinois, and that is I am concerned that this amendment \nwill not receive a vote. Last year, the Senate voted on a 51-to-48 \nvote, to include language in the Military Commissions Act that limited \nFederal court habeas jurisdiction. I have suggested that there be a \ncloture petition filed on this bill, if we are going to vote on cloture \nlater this week on the underlying bill, and that would be a case where \nwe might vote on cloture on this amendment. I would structure it in \nthat fashion only as a way to get a vote so that people will have to \ntake a position, and I simply wanted to make reference to that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 312\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I offered an amendment on behalf of \nSenator Cornyn on Friday, and I now ask for the regular order with \nrespect to amendment No. 312.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 312, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 389, after line 13, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 15__.

Madam President, this modification is a series of \nrevisions relating to terrorism, and in a moment I will describe those \nprovisions. The majority leader has indicated that he will file a \ncloture motion tonight in order to bring the bill to a close because we \nhave been unable to get an agreement to vote on several of these \nterrorist-related amendments. I am prepared to file a cloture motion on \nthis amendment and, therefore, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on pending \n     amendment No. 312, as modified, to amendment No. 275 to \n     Calendar No. 57, S. 4, a bill to make the United States more \n     secure by implementing unfinished recommendations of the 9/11 \n     Commission to fight the war on terror more effectively, to \n     improve homeland security, and for other purposes.\n         John Cornyn, Jon Kyl, Mike Crapo, John Ensign, Saxby \n           Chambliss, Judd Gregg, Richard Burr, Jim Bunning, Sam \n           Brownback, Mitch McConnell, Craig Thomas, Tom Coburn, \n           Wayne Allard, Jim DeMint, John Thune, Pat Roberts, \n           Lindsey Graham.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, just by way of explanation, this \nmodified amendment aims to improve our national security in five areas. \nFor the first time, it will make it a crime to recruit people to commit \nterrorist acts on American soil. For the first time, it would allow for \nthe immediate deportation of suspected terrorists whose visas have been \nrevoked for terrorism-related activities. For the first time, it would \nprevent the release of dangerous illegal immigrants whose home \ncountries actually don't want them back. For the first time, it would \nmake it a crime to reward the families of suicide bombers, and it would \nincrease the penalty for those who torment the families of our service \nmen and women by calling their families and falsely claiming that their \nloved ones have been killed in the field of battle. It contains five \nprovisions that would make our homeland more secure by penalizing \nrecruiters, deporting terrorist suspects, keeping dangerous criminals \nbehind bars, and protecting the families of our troops.\n  Voting on this amendment will not slow down the bill. We are not \ninterested in doing that. We will gladly agree to vitiate cloture in \nexchange for a unanimous consent vote on this amendment or, if cloture \nis invoked, we will agree to yield back the 30 hours of postcloture \ntime in order to move ahead.\n  The war against terrorism requires that we adapt our methods to \nemerging threats, and that is precisely what these new and vital \nprovisions would allow us to do.\n  Let me conclude by saying we believe these amendments are definitely \nrelated to the bill. We had hoped to be able to get an agreement to \nhave this amendment considered. So far, that has not occurred, but we \nwant to reiterate we have no desire to slow down the passage of the \nbill. That is why I felt compelled to file cloture at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am very sympathetic to the concerns \nof the Republican leader about trying to move forward with some votes. \nI do wish he had discussed his approach with the managers of this bill \nsince he\n\n[[Page S2778]]\n\nhas taken us completely by surprise on the Senate floor, but I think he \nhas raised an important issue, that our Members deserve to have votes \non the important issues that are before us. If we are going to complete \naction on this bill by the end of the week, we need to start voting. We \nneed to start disposing of these amendments, whether they are adopted \nor rejected or withdrawn. So I am sympathetic to the frustration of the \nRepublican leader over this matter. We do need to move forward and have \nvotes.\n  I do wish he had discussed his intentions with the managers of the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Maine, the distinguished ranking member of the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee. In response, I would point out that \nthese amendments, which are now consolidated in this modification, \nactually have been pending now for some time but we have been \nunsuccessful in persuading the majority to give us an opportunity for \nan up-or-down vote on them.\n  The bill we are debating is entitled ``A Bill to Make the United \nStates More Secure By Implementing Unfinished Recommendations of the 9/\n11 Commission to Fight the War on Terror More Effectively, to Improve \nHomeland Security, and for other purposes.'' I can't think of any \namendment that would be more appropriate to accomplishing the stated \ngoal of this particular legislation than the one I have pending now.\n  The distinguished Republican leader has summarized, I think very \nwell, what is contained in this modification. But just so none of my \ncolleagues are confused, these are not new matters. This modification \nsimply represents a consolidation of several amendments that are \npending on the floor and have been pending for some time, but which \nhave been refused an opportunity to have a full and fair debate \nfollowed by an up-or-down vote by the majority.\n  We all know it has been more than 5 years since September 11. And, \nthere remains some unfinished business that needs to be addressed by \nthis legislation, and my amendment will do just that.\n  One of the things left to do is to target terrorist recruiting. The \nFBI and other agencies have made it clear that al-Qaida and other \nterrorist organizations are intent on attacking our country again and \nare busy recruiting those who wish to join them. We know al-Qaida is a \npatient enemy, waiting years to attack--sometimes embedding into \nsociety and appearing to be a part of the regular population until, but \nat a time of their choosing, rising out of their sleeper cells to \nattack innocent civilians to accomplish their goals.\n\n  According to congressional testimony, terrorists and terrorist \nsympathizers are actively in the process of recruiting terrorists \nwithin the United States. So we are not just talking about a wholly \nforeign enemy that would attack us from abroad; we are talking about \npeople being recruited to carry out terrorist attacks here in the \nUnited States. Of course their goal is to find individuals who do not \nfit the traditional terrorist model, who can operate freely in our \ncountry, and who are willing to engage in these heinous acts. \nRecruiting these type of individuals, those who blend easily into our \nsociety, provides al-Qaida an operational advantage.\n  This is not an academic discussion. Let me just use one example to \ndemonstrate this reality. Intelligence materials related to Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed, the so-called mastermind of the 9/11 plot, show that \nhe was running terrorist cells within the United States. These \ndocuments show that al-Qaida's goal was to recruit U.S. citizens and \nother westerners so they could move freely within our country, so they \nwould be unlikely to be identified and stopped at our border's edge or \nin our airports or land-based ports before they carry out their \nattacks. These terrorist recruiters have targeted mosques, prisons, and \nuniversities throughout the United States where they could identify and \nrecruit people who might be sympathetic to their jihadist message and \nthen persuade these individuals to join their organization.\n  Unbelievably, we currently have no statute in place that is designed \nto punish those who recruit people to commit terrorist acts. This \namendment includes a provision that would remedy this serious gap in \nour law. It simply provides that it is against the law to recruit or, \nin the words of the amendment, ``to employ, solicit, induce, command or \ncause'' any person to commit an act of domestic terrorism, \ninternational terrorism, or a Federal crime of terrorism, and any \nperson convicted of this would face serious punishment.\n  This amendment also provides that anyone committing this crime should \nbe punished for up to 10 years in the Federal penitentiary. If a death \nresults in connection with this crime, he or she can be punished by \ndeath or a term of years or for life; if serious bodily injury to any \nindividual results, then a punishment of no less than 10 years or more \nthan 25 years is available to the judge.\n  This is a commonsense measure, designed to fill a serious gap in our \nCriminal Code that, frankly, should not continue to exist more than 5 \nyears after September 11. This fits exactly with the stated purpose of \nthis legislation, and I hope our colleagues will vote in favor of this \namendment.\n  Two other provisions in this amendment that again represent \namendments that have been previously filed and are pending but which I \nhave now included in this consolidated amendment. One includes a remedy \nto a problem created by a Supreme Court decision in 2001, the Zadvydas \ncase, which held that dangerous criminal aliens must be released after \nan expiration of 6 months if there is no likelihood that their home \ncountry would take them back in the near future, even if their home \ncountry will not take them. This means that they have to be released \ninto the general population of the United States, free to re-commit \nserious crimes.\n  In other words, what the Supreme Court said is that Congress had not \nspecifically authorized the Department of Homeland Security to hold \ndangerous criminal aliens whose home country will not take them back \nfor longer than 6 months pending their deportation or repatriation to \ntheir home country. This amendment remedies that decision. In fact, the \nSupreme Court invited the Congress to revisit this decision, since it \nis purely a statutory holding.\n  Specifically, this amendment would allow DHS to protect the American \npeople from dangerous criminal aliens until their removal proceedings \nare completed. It allows the Department of Homeland Security to detain \ncriminal aliens after a final order of removal and beyond the 90-day \nremoval period if removal is likely to occur in the foreseeable future \nor for national security and public safety grounds. It preserves the \nright of the alien to seek review of continued detention through habeas \nproceedings after exhaustion of administrative remedies. And to be \nclear, my amendment does preserve the right of the affected alien to \nseek administrative and judicial review of these decisions. But, the \namendment makes clear that it is intended to fill an important gap by \nauthorizing DHS to protect the American people from the willy-nilly \nrelease of dangerous criminal aliens after 6 months. This situation has \noccurred and will continue to occur and it is important for Congress to \nstep up and to fix this problem created by the interpretation of this \nstatute in 2001 by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The last element of this consolidated amendment that I want to \nmention has to do with material support for suicide bombers and other \nterrorists. We hear too often the difficulty in identifying and \nstopping suicide bombers before they can carry out their deadly \nattacks. One incentive to those who decide to carry out these attacks \nis financial rewards promised to the families of suicide bombers who \nare assured that their families will be paid and cared for after they \ncommit their heinous acts. This provision would ban the payment of \nfinancial rewards or other material support to the families of suicide \nbombers such as Assad, a known terrorist who has enticed people to \nengage in these attacks, with a promise to pay their families up to \n$25,000, if my memory serves me correctly, as a reward. This provision \nwould ban the\n\n[[Page S2779]]\n\npayment of these types of financial rewards and dry up a real incentive \nused to induce or facilitate carrying out of a terrorist attack and \nsend to prison those who do so.\n  I would add that this amendment also increases the punishments for \nthose convicted of providing material support. The Department of \nJustice has told us that the material support statute is one of the \nmost important anti-terror tools in their tool box, and it is only \nright and appropriate that we use this opportunity to strengthen the 9/\n11 bill with this important improvement to such an effective statute.\n  In conclusion, this amendment provides real anti-terror and anti-\ncrime tools to the 9/11 bill and will ensure, as the preface of this \nbill states, that it will finish the unfinished business of the 9/11 \nCommission and of the Nation, making us more secure, 5 years-plus since \nthe dastardly attacks of 9/11.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, on rollcall vote 62, I voted ``yea'', it \nwas my intention to vote ``nay''. I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to change my vote since it will not affect the outcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 345\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to amendment No. 345, \nwhich was submitted by Senator Coburn of Oklahoma. This amendment \ndiverts funds that Congress has designated to be obligated before \nOctober 1 of this year through the Department of Commerce \nInteroperability Grant Program into a yet-to-be created Homeland \nSecurity grant program.\n  This amendment is offered at the same time the President is proposing \nto decrease funding for State and local preparedness grants and \nfirefighter assistance grants from the enacted fiscal year 2007 levels \nby $1.2 billion.\n  To make matters worse, the amendment delays the obligation of $1 \nbillion in interoperability grants by up to 3 years. In the President's \n2008 budget proposal, the administration reduces State and local \nprograms by $840 million and assistance to firefighter grants by $362 \nmillion.\n  The transfer of the $1 billion the Federal Communications Commission \nwill raise as part of the digital television spectrum auction to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security will mask the technical decrease in the \nbudget request. In the end, it means less money for the first \nresponders, which I believe is bad for national security.\n  It is important to remember that as part of the Deficit Reduction Act \nof 2005, Congress created the $1 billion fund in the Department of \nCommerce to support State and local first responders in their efforts \nto talk with one another in times of emergency. The interoperability \nsubtitle in this act expands upon prior action taken in the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005 and provides additional guidance to the Commerce \nDepartment.\n  The provision which I introduced with Senators Stevens, Kerry, Smith, \nand Snowe was reported out of the committee with unanimous support of \nthe Members. The Commerce Department grant program is intended to jump-\nstart the efforts of the administration to address a key 9/11 \nCommission concern--interoperability.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has been and continues to be too \nslow to act, and the Coburn amendment would only exacerbate the \nproblem. If the Coburn amendment were to pass, it would first decrease \ngrants to first responders this fiscal year by $700 million; eliminate \nthe $100 million fund for strategic reserves of communications \nequipment, designed to be rapidly deployed in the event of a major \ndisaster; and, third, eliminate the all-hazards approach that considers \nthe likelihood of natural disasters as well as terrorist attacks that \nthe Commerce Department would use making interoperability grants. \nContrary to the Senator's assertion, the Commerce Department \nInteroperability Grant Program is complementary to and not duplicative \nof the DHS grant program.\n  First, the Department of Commerce will award all $1 billion in grants \nby September 30 of this year, while the DHS program as currently \nconstructed is not authorized until fiscal year 2008, and is still \nsubject to appropriations.\n  This money is needed now and should be in addition to the regular \nappropriation process, not awarded over the next 3 years as a \nsubstitute for appropriations funding. Second, the program allows the \nAdministrator of the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration to direct up to $100 million of these funds for the \ncreation of State and Federal strategic technology reserves of \ncommunications equipment that can be readily deployed in the event that \nterrestrial networks fail in times of disaster.\n\n  Should this occur--it did occur in Katrina--there is no comparable \nprogram created in the DHS grant program. The strategic reserve program \nis a necessary initiative that has not been prioritized by the DHS to \ndate.\n  Recently, an independent panel created by Federal Communications \nCommission Chairman Kevin Martin to review the impact of Hurricane \nKatrina on communications networks noted the impact that limited pre-\npositioning of communications equipment had in slowing the recovery \nprocess. As a result, the program will help to ensure that our focus on \ninteroperability also considers the importance of communications \nredundancy and resiliency as well.\n  Third, in addition to minimum funding allocations, the Department of \nCommerce Interoperability Grant Program would further require that \nprioritization of those funds be based upon an all-hazards approach \nthat recognizes the critical need for effective emergency communication \nand response to natural disasters such as tsunamis, earthquakes, \nhurricanes, and tornados, in addition to terrorist attacks.\n  While the DHS program being created would consider natural disasters \nas one of the many factors in awarding of grants, the Department of \nCommerce Interoperability Grant Program's all-hazards approach places a \nhigh priority on funding States based on the threats they face from \nnatural catastrophes as well as terrorist attacks.\n  We have heard two contradicting arguments to support the elimination \nof the Department of Commerce grant program. The author claims both \nthat the DHS is doing all of the administrative work for the Department \nof Commerce grant program, and that there is a risk of double-dipping \nbecause the DHS will not know who is receiving the Department of \nCommerce grants. Both claims cannot be right and, in fact, neither is \ntrue. The NTIA and the DHS have been working together for months to \ncraft an agreement under which the two agencies will disburse the $1 \nbillion raised from the DTV spectrum auction.\n  On February 16, 2007, the DHS and the NTIA entered into a memorandum \nof understanding covering the administration of the grant program. \nWhile the DHS will play a large role in administering the grants, the \nNTIA will work with the DHS to establish the grant procedures, which \nwill ensure that an all-hazards approach is followed and that a \nstrategic reserve equipment program is developed.\n  The interoperability subtitle further ensures that the grants funded \nare consistent with the Federal grant guidance established by the \nSAFECOM Program within the DHS. As a result, the DHS will be fully \naware of who is getting grants and for what purposes. At the same time, \nthe NTIA will maintain a leadership role in guiding the \ninteroperability grant program. The NTIA has a long history of \naddressing interoperable communications issues, and it is vital that \nthe administration help guide the DHS's work.\n  Since its creation, the NTIA has served as the principal \ntelecommunications policy adviser to the Secretary of Commerce and the \nPresident and manages the Federal Government's use of the radio \nspectrum. According to Assistant Secretary Kneuer, the Administrator of \nthe NTIA, the ``intersection of telecommunications policy and spectrum \nmanagement has been the key focus of the NTIA, including public safety \ncommunications and interoperability issues.''\n  In this capacity, the NTIA has historically played an important role \nin assisting public safety personnel and improving communications \ninteroperability and recognizing that effective solutions involve \nattention to issues of spectrum and government coordination as well as \nfunding. Its work more than\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\na decade ago in creating the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee, \nformed by the FCC and the NTIA pursuant to Congress's direction, framed \nthis issue in this way:\n\n       At the most basic level, radio-based voice communications \n     allow dispatchers to direct mobile units to the scene of a \n     crime and allow firefighters to coordinate and to warn each \n     other of impending danger at fires. Radio systems are also \n     vital for providing logistics and command support during \n     major emergencies and disasters such as earthquakes, riots, \n     or plane crashes. . . .\n       In an era where technology can bring news, current events, \n     and entertainment such as the Olympics to the farthest \n     reaches of the world, many police officers, firefighters, and \n     emergency medical service personnel working in the same city \n     cannot communicate with each other. Congested and fragmented \n     spectral resources, inadequate funding for technology \n     upgrades, and a wide variety of governmental and \n     institutional obstacles result in a critical situation which, \n     if not addressed expeditiously, will ultimately compromise \n     the ability of Public Safety officials to protect life and \n     property.\n\n  The Coburn amendment would disrupt the MOU, upset the work the NTIA \nand the DHS have undertaken, and delay the awarding of interoperability \ngrants.\n  Finally, the NTIA's administration of the grant program will not only \nhelp to integrate the disparate elements that must be part of effective \ninteroperability solutions but will also ensure greater program \ntransparency and oversight. Given the myriad of different grant \nprograms administered by the Department of Homeland Security, it is \ncritical that these funds--specifically allocated by Congress to speed \nup our efforts to improve communications interoperability for first \nresponders--not get lost in the shuffle of other disaster and \nnondisaster grants. As a result, the provisions not only devote the \nNTIA's attention to the success of this program but also require the \ninspector general of the Department of Commerce to annually review the \nadministration of this program.\n  In sum, the Department of Commerce interoperability grant program \nimproves the Nation's security. Senator Coburn's amendment would delay \nthe awarding of needed interoperability grants and disrupts months of \nwork by the NTIA and the DHS. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the Coburn amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, since 2001, we have heard a growing cry \nfrom public safety officials that police, firefighters, and emergency \nmedical response personnel throughout the country need help to achieve \ninteroperability in today's communications world.\n  Sadly, this problem actually predated September 11. More than a \ndecade ago, the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration formed the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee to \nexamine the communications needs of first responders and public safety \nofficials. That report called for more spectrum, technological \nsolutions, and more funding, and was filed 5 years to the day before \nthe tragedy of 9/11. It called for those improvements to save lives on \na daily basis. These solutions are not geared just for the huge \ndisasters but are also geared for the everyday tragedies that can be \navoided with better communications and better interoperability.\n  Thanks to the work of the last Congress, public safety stands ready \nto finally receive the help that the FCC and NTIA called for more than \n10 years ago.\n  Last year, the Congress set a hard date for broadcasters to turn over \n24 megahertz of spectrum to public safety for communications and \ninteroperability. Right now, the FCC is examining proposals to maximize \nthe broadband potential of that spectrum, which will bring great new \nservices and capabilities to policemen, firefighters, and other \nemergency personnel. In addition, Congress created a $1 billion \ninteroperability grant program with the funds that will be received \nfrom the auctioning off of the rest of the spectrum recovered from \nbroadcasters. That program originated out of our Senate Commerce \nCommittee. The Department of Commerce and Department of Homeland \nSecurity have signed a memorandum of understanding to work together in \nthis regard.\n\n  Additionally, at the very end of the Congress last year, we \naccelerated the granting of the awards as part of what was called the \nCall Home Act. Therefore, by law, the interoperability grants which are \navailable must be awarded by September 30, 2007. Public safety has been \nwaiting for a very long time for these funds, and they finally have a \ndate-certain when the interoperability grants will be awarded.\n  Having worked with the FCC and the NTIA over the last decade, our \nSenate Commerce Committee has watched as the public safety \ncommunications market has evolved, and we have heard about a number of \ntechnological solutions that may address both near-term and long-term \ninteroperability needs. Internet protocol systems can be used as \nbridges between otherwise incompatible communications systems now. \nStrategic technological reserves can be created to quickly replace \ninfrastructure that is destroyed in large-scale disasters. Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita demonstrated the need for portable wireless systems \nthat are readily deployed when a disaster destroys the existing \ncommunications infrastructure. Standards development and dedicated \ninteroperability channels facilitate planning and incident management \nbetween agencies.\n  All of these solutions can be achieved now and are provided for by \nthe provisions of the Commerce Committee's interoperability provisions. \nUnfortunately, the amendment of my friend, the Senator from Oklahoma, \nwould delay all of these solutions. That would be unfortunate for \npublic safety and very harmful to the public.\n  The Homeland Security Committee has created its own interoperability \nprogram that is separate from the Commerce $1 billion program. However, \nthat program is a separate one. It is focused on the long term, after \nadditional planning is done, and would still be several years away from \neven awarding grants, let alone implementing them.\n  It is time we finally deliver on our promises to the police, \nfirefighters, and emergency medical personnel. Those around the country \nreally believe us, and we believe we can deliver the technological \nreserves and interoperability communications that will help first \nresponders now by moving forward with the $1 billion public safety \ngrant program, administered by NTIA. We really should not wait any \nlonger. We cannot plan indefinitely. It has been over 10 years, as I \nhave said. These solutions take time to implement. We should move \nforward on these programs now. With the Commerce program, public safety \nwill be able to move forward with real solutions and begin addressing \nthe problems that have plagued our Nation's first responders for too \nlong.\n  We are able to come across some really interesting innovations, too. \nThrough the NTIA's program, it is possible to use communications \nconcepts and bring about interoperability without a large expenditure \nfor new equipment. This first $1 billion will stretch real far if it is \nused on the plans of the NTIA. If it is delayed--unfortunately, I think \nthat is what the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma would do. It \nwill really put us in the position where we cannot implement what has \nbeen done now.\n  These people--first responders--have been planning now for 3 years to \nget this money, and it is going to be paid out this year under the \nprogram we have already enacted into law.\n  I urge my friend from Oklahoma: Don't delay that $1 billion. I \nunderstand there may be some concerns about the $3 billion in this \nbill. Even that, though, is money that will be planned--it will be \nseveral years before it will be made available. The money we have, the \n$1 billion that is already provided by law, is available as soon as it \ncomes in. I think it will go a long way to meeting the immediate needs \nof first responders.\n  So I hope the Senator will not really persevere with his amendment. I \nunderstand his concerns, and we share the concerns of the use of money. \nI do believe, if you study the technology now, it is possible to put \ntogether--we have one program where the National Guard has a mobile \nunit that is equipped with interoperability concepts that came about \nthrough software. Using the software on that vehicle, they can bring \nabout interoperability with any system anyone uses in the first-\nresponder era today.\n  If we move forward on those things we can do now, immediately, with \ninteroperability--brought about through the use of technology--it will \nsave us a lot of money in the long run. I believe this $1 billion will \ndemonstrate we can do this, make this interoperability capability \navailable to our first responders at a lot less money than other people \nbelieve. I think this $1 billion is needed, and it will go a long way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, let me compliment the \nchairman and ranking member for their foresight in making sure we have \nthe capability to have interoperability, with the wisdom of taking \nspectrum and putting it specifically for that.\n  I want to answer several of the questions that have been raised \nbecause they are somewhat peculiar to me.\n  But before I do that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Kyl be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, I would also like to \nnote that one of the members of your committee, who was instrumental in \nbringing this interoperability grant program to the floor, is also a \ncosponsor of my amendment, realizing we do not need both programs and \nthat they need to be combined.\n  Now, what does DHS tell us about the present grant program? Here is \nwhat they tell us. And I say to the American public, you ask yourself \nif you want your Government to run this way. What they say is: We can \nmeet the September 30 deadline, and we may be able to tell you who is \ngoing to get grants, but we are not going to be able to tell you, \nanywhere close, how much money they are going to get. So they can tell \nthem who will get the grants because that is what the law says, but \nthey will never have the capability, for several months thereafter, to \nknow how much money they are going to get. So nobody is going to buy \nanything until the actual grants are going to be awarded.\n  Let's clear up the difference between the Departments of Commerce and \nHomeland Security. No. 1, Homeland Security has the authority for \ninteroperable communications. I do not care where this grant program \nis, quite frankly. I do not care if it is at Homeland Security or at \nCommerce. I do not care. But what I do know is, out of that $1 billion, \nthe only thing the Department of Commerce is going to keep is $12 \nmillion with which to use to announce the grants. That is what they \nhave told us. So $988 million out of that--the rest of that money--is \ngoing to go for grants, administered by, controlled by, run by Homeland \nSecurity.\n  So if the problem with my amendment is that the money isn't going to \nget out there to do it, Homeland Security has already said the money \nisn't going to get out there to do it. Commerce has already said the \nmoney isn't going to get out there to do it. We know who will get \nmoney, but the money won't get out there regardless of what they have \nsaid, because they just came to an understanding of the agreement 3 \nweeks ago on administering this money.\n  I think it is very wise what the chairman and ranking member have \ndone in terms of allocating resources. As a matter of fact, I applaud \nthem for that. I think it is wise to dedicate resources to certain \nthings when we sell spectrum. I would tell my colleagues most Americans \nwould say: You are going to give grant money, but you don't know how \nmuch you are going to give and you are not going to give it on the \nbasis of competition in allocation of those resources because you have \na date to meet that doesn't fit with fiscal responsibility. It doesn't \nfit with the best outcome or the ability to follow up to see what \nhappened with the money. So we do have a date in the law by which they \nhave to do it. But how are they going to do it, because the date in \nthere is wrong. They are liable to give the wrong people too much money \nand the right people not enough, because we are telling them what they \nhave to do.\n  The second thing--let me put up a chart. These programs are \nidentical, even though you claim they are not. Let me show my \ncolleagues how they are identical. Under the PSIC grant programs, they \nare State and regional planning; under the DHS program, they are State \nand regional planning. Under the system design and engineering, PSIC; \nsame thing under DHS. System procurement and installation; same thing \nunder DHS. Technical assistance, the same. Implementing a strategic \ntechnology reserve is the only difference, but guess where it is made \nup. ``Other appropriate uses as determined by the administrator of \nFEMA.'' Do you think they are not going to put in that reserve there? \nThey certainly are. They are going to do it.\n  So there is no difference in the grant programs whatsoever, other \nthan the deadline, which isn't going to be followed anyway. Like I say, \nI don't care if this is at Homeland Security or Commerce, I would as \nsoon it be at Commerce in terms of the spectrum.\n  But the fact is the American people shouldn't have to pay for the \nadministration of two separate programs running parallel with two \nseparate sets of requirements to Congress. We ought to get them \ntogether. We ought to figure out how we do it so we have one grant, and \nif, in fact, we need $4.3 billion. The problem is, we don't know how \nmuch money we need. We are throwing money at it.\n  The second question I would ask is if this program belongs at \nCommerce, why Commerce agreed to give 99.9 percent of it to FEMA and to \nthe Department of Homeland Security. They don't think it belongs there.\n  The other point I would make in rebuttal to the Senator from Hawaii \nis this amendment doesn't decrease funding at all. This takes $3.3 \nbillion and an amount greater than $1 billion and combines it so the \nsame amount of money is there, except it is going to make the money be \nspent better. It is going to allow us the time to do it.\n  I agree we need to get money out to our primary responders. This \nisn't about trying to hold that up. I am not trying to do that. But the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has already said the money isn't going \nto go out by your day. There isn't one application right now at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security for this money. We all know how \nWashington works. They haven't even written the requirements for the \ngrant applications yet, which will take another 90 to 120 days. So we \nhave a laudable goal that is not going to be accomplished, and if it is \ngoing to be accomplished, it will be accomplished in a very inefficient \nand wasteful way, which the American people don't deserve.\n  I think this is a very good chance for us to talk about what is wrong \nwith us in the Congress. We are working at cross purposes. We have one \ncommittee working here and one committee working here, rather than \nsolving those problems for the best interests of our country. I want \nHawaii to have everything it needs in terms of tsunami prevention, in \nterms of interoperability. I know there are special requirements in the \nState of Alaska because line of sight can't be used and much of our \nemergency frequencies require some of that. I believe we can take care \nof those problems and combine these grant programs in a way that the \nAmerican taxpayer gets value, in a way where we can measure the \naccountability of what we do, in a way in which we can have \ntransparency for the dollars we get in reauctioning the spectrum, and \nplus the other $3.4 billion that is going to come out in terms of \nappropriated funds for these other grant programs. The American people \nwant that. They deserve that.\n  To me, this isn't about a turf battle of control. To me, this \namendment is about common sense for the American public to combine two \nprograms into one so we spend less money, and we don't duplicate things \nand we don't duplicate efforts.\n  I understand and appreciate very much the long service of Senator \nInouye and Senator Stevens and their commitment to making sure these \nthings are coming through. I am not trying to be a fly in the ointment \nto mess up what are very good-intended results, but I am a realist. The \nvery things my colleagues have asked to happen in the Budget Act that \nwas passed are not going to happen. Homeland Security has said that. So \nif those things aren't going to happen, and if the fears of what isn't \ngoing to happen can be allayed, can we not figure out a way to put \nthese programs together where the American people get the best value, \nand also as a part of my amendment which says: Can we look to the \nprivate sector to not just give us interoperability in Hawaii among \nNational Guard and first responders, but how about between California \nand Arizona, or Texas and Oklahoma, or Maryland and New York, if they \nneed Maryland first responders there, which has not been addressed in \nany of the legislation that has been put forward. There is great \ntechnology out there. There are great companies out there that could do \nthat.\n\n[[Page S2782]]\n\n  Again, without desiring to interfere or upset, I believe the \napplication of some pretty commonsense principles ought to be applied \nto these two grant programs. I am willing to discuss with the chairman \nand the ranking member how to do this a different way. I am raising it \non the floor because I think the taxpayer is not getting good value, \nand I think we ought to talk about that.\n  The National Taxpayer Union endorses this amendment. The Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste endorses this amendment. Your very own \ncommittee member, who was one of the first people to say we should have \nauctioned spectrum for first responders, is a cosponsor of this \namendment. So I am willing to defer to what the ranking member and the \nchairman of this committee want to do, but I think we ought to stick it \nout here until we can work a way for the American people to get better \nvalue, better clarity, better transparency, and better accountability \nfor these funds.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think the Senate should be sure of what \nthe Coburn amendment does. In the first place, it repeals the section \nof the Call Home Act that was enacted in the last Congress that makes \nthis $1 billion available to NTIA immediately upon receipt. Secondly, \nit says the payments that are made under that $1 billion allocation \nmust be made under the terms of section 1809 of the Homeland Security \nAct of 2002. Then it has this section, subsection (c) on page 2 of the \namendment, which limits the awards under that section to $300,000 in \n2007, $350,000 in 2008, and $350,000 in 2009. Existing law makes that \n$1 billion available as of September 30 of this year.\n  So the Senator is not only changing the manner in which the money can \nbe used as opposed to what we enacted in the last Congress, but he is \nputting limitations on the grants that can be made out of the $1 \nbillion so that only $300 million is available this year--$300 million \nfor the whole Nation to meet the immediate needs for interoperability.\n  We had before our committee the so-called siren call proposal to take \nover the whole of the spectrum and turn it over to a trust and let that \ntrust sell some of this so they could make even more money available in \nthe first year. We have spoken about that, and it is a no-brainer to do \nthat. That would create a trust that is equivalent to compete with the \nFCC on the sale of the first spectrum and it would reduce the money \nthat is coming in on the first sale, so we could get enough money to \npay the $1 billion. But the $1 billion has been promised to these first \nresponders as of September 30 under the memorandum of agreement between \nHomeland Security and the NTIA. It can be administered and it will be \nadministered. It will be used for a whole series of things. But again, \nI emphasize, it can be used for software, for systems to make current \nsystems interoperable without buying a whole bunch of new equipment, \nwherever it is made, whether it is made in Oklahoma or California. It \nis not going to be made in Hawaii or Alaska, I can tell you that.\n  But as a practical matter, what we are interested in is making every \nentity in the country that is involved with interoperability problems \nto be able to make an application for these grants immediately after \nSeptember 30. The Senator from Oklahoma would limit that in this fiscal \nyear to $300,000. By the way, none of it is even going to be available \nuntil September 30. So it is one of those things that is sort of \ndifficult to understand. We can't have much available in fiscal year \n2007. We can have money available this year, in the calendar year 2007, \nunder the existing law.\n  I urge the Senate not to repeal existing law, to make this money \navailable. It is in a memorandum of understanding between these two \nagencies. We are not trying to usurp the functions of Homeland \nSecurity. We are trying to meet the needs of communications. That is \nour job. We have done our job. The existing law will make $1 billion \navailable as of September 30. I do not think it should be repealed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, listening very carefully to the statement \nof the Senator from Oklahoma, one might get the impression that this \nmeasure was submitted by the Senators from Alaska and Hawaii to benefit \nour two States. Hawaii and Alaska are not even mentioned in this \namendment. What we want is a National Interoperability Grant Program. \nIt may be of interest that the State of Hawaii is almost completely \ninteroperable, but we want all other States to have that benefit. So \nthis is not one of these earmarked measures, I can assure my \ncolleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. First, let me sincerely apologize to the Senator from \nHawaii if he took my words to mean that. I did not mean that. I \nreferred to his words in terms of tsunami. I have no inference \nwhatsoever that this has any parochial interest of either the Senator \nfrom Hawaii or the Senator from Alaska. But it is interesting that the \ndebate doesn't ever come back to the fact of whether we have two \nprograms; it is all about the money. The fact is the money will not get \nout there. Homeland Security has already said that.\n  Now, the reason the $350 million--not thousand--was chosen is because \nat the same time this happened, you are going to have another $1 \nbillion come through in--the fiscal year is going to be over this year \non September 30 of 2007. The worst problem that happens in our Federal \nGovernment today is the indiscriminate, rushed issuing of grants, of \nthrowing money at something, rather than a measured response of grants.\n  These aren't competitive grants, I would remind the people who are \nlistening to this debate. There is no competition for this money. You \ndon't have to compete by saying you have a greater need than somebody \nelse or you have a greater risk than somebody else. This is money that \nis going to go out, period. It is not based on competition for the \ngreatest need or the greatest risk.\n  The last thing we need to be doing is having a grant program that is \nrushed so we are not making sure the money is well spent. In the last 2 \nyears we have discovered $200 billion of waste, fraud, abuse, or \nduplication in the discretionary budget of the Federal Government--$200 \nbillion. We would have enough money to pay for the war, pay for \nexpanding the military in this country, and cutting our deficit in half \nif we would do our job in terms of eliminating duplication, fraud, \nabuse, and waste.\n  What this amendment is about is let's don't waste any of this $1 \nbillion these two gentlemen have so wisely put for one great purpose.\n  So that is my intention today, I assure the Senators from Alaska and \nHawaii. We all know how homeland security works. We have seen all too \nwell some of the failings and lack of efficiency and lack of \nresponsiveness in that agency. To now assume the other side of that, \nthat that is going to happen overnight because we have mandated by \nlaw--if it does, it will be a very poor choice of the use of this \nmoney.\n  I thank the Senator from Hawaii and the Senator from Alaska for their \ndebate on this issue. My goal was to have a debate about whether we \nshould have two programs and whether we should waste money. It is not \nabout the debate of whether we need to have 911 interoperability and \nthe functionality that needs to be there in all the States. But we \nshould look at the whole as well as the individual. I compliment them \non finding a funding stream that doesn't add to our children's debt. \nUnfortunately, we have not done that in this bill with the other \ngrants, which I think is a mistake.\n  My hope is we will be able to have a vote on this amendment before we \ngo to cloture--or even after cloture--because it is germane, and we can \ndefend the germaneness of this amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I intend to make a motion to table. I \nhave discussed it with the leader. I think he would like to have that \nvote take place at 6:15. Would the majority floor staff confirm that.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I think that would be appropriate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, temporarily, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. While the Senator from Alaska is checking on the other \namendment, I ask unanimous consent to speak on another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 295\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Alaska is \nworking out a vote on the amendment that was just discussed. I wished \nto come to the floor to talk about the Landrieu amendment that is \npending on this bill and to also say I have been joined in this \namendment by Senators Stevens, Lieberman, Kennedy, Obama, Martinez, and \nVitter, and others may join as we push forward on this amendment to the \nunderlying bill.\n  This amendment has to do with a waiver provision, to waive the 10-\npercent match that is normally required when a disaster strikes a \ncommunity--and for good reason. We have required in the past for the \nlocal governments, based on their capacity to pay for part of the \nrecovery, to put up anywhere from 25 percent to 10 percent. But on \noccasion, we have waived the 10-percent or the 25-percent requirement \nwhen it becomes apparent that the disaster is so overwhelming, the \nability for these communities to repay is virtually impossible. That \nhas been done over 38 times in the past. Most recently, it was done \nwith Hurricane Andrew. That was a terrible storm. It doesn't look like \nit on this graph, but Hurricane Andrew, believe me, for the people in \nHomestead, FL, was the end of the world. Literally, their town was \ncrushed.\n  Prior to Katrina and Rita, that storm was the costliest storm, \ncausing $40 billion in damage to parts of Florida. Unfortunately for \nFlorida, they have been hard hit ever since. But for discussion \npurposes, this is $139 per capita--a terrible storm but not a lot of \nmoney per capita. The World Trade Tower attack was a terrible tragedy \nin our Nation, which is why this bill is being discussed; the damage \nwas $390 per capita. Mr. President, look and see what the Katrina and \nRita double whammy and subsequent breaking of the levees cost per \ncapita in Louisiana--$6,700. It is literally off the chart.\n  This has been part of the problem in Washington--not you, Mr. \nPresident, because you came down and Senator Lieberman came down and \nthe Senator from Alaska came down and walked the neighborhoods, so you \nunderstand it. But this is literally off the chart--what is happening \nin terms of the amount of disaster recovery going on in Louisiana and \nMississippi, along the gulf coast.\n  The Landrieu amendment seeks to waive the 10-percent match so that \nthe billion dollars would then be available to go to infrastructure \nprojects. But almost as important as the extra money that could be \napplied to the disaster recovery itself, 95 percent of the red tape \nwould be eliminated because, under the current program, there are three \nor four different reviews, different regulations between HUD and FEMA. \nAll of the administrative efforts we have made to date have been for \nnaught because nothing has been waived. So the solution is this \namendment.\n  I am going to ask this body to vote on this amendment, on this \nwaiver. The amazing thing about this is that because the President has \nthe option to do this now, there is no cost to this amendment; it \nscores at a zero. I know it is counterintuitive, but the score on this \namendment is zero. There can be no point of order raised against it. It \ndoesn't technically cost anything. Because of that and the obvious \nmerits of the waiver, which were done in this case and done 38 other \ntimes, we are asking for it to be done for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, \nfor Mississippi and Louisiana, and also for Hurricane Wilma, which is \ncaught up in this general disaster as well.\n  I thank those who have cosponsored this amendment with me. I thank \nSenator Stevens for being able to let me speak as he decides on votes \nfor the pending amendment. I am going to ask the leadership to schedule \na vote because it is most certainly justified and could be done \nadministratively but has not been. Congress has a responsibility to \nact, to do what is right, fair and helpful and to eliminate the red \ntape in our communities, in my case, from St. Bernard Parish to Cameron \nParish, from Biloxi and Pascagoula, all the way over to places in south \nTexas that are still hurting and deserve to have this waiver so they \ncan spend money not on red tape but on roads, bridges, houses, and \nschools that need to be rebuilt so America's energy coast can get back \nto work.\n  Katrina and Rita were the first and third costliest disasters in \nAmerican history, but Louisiana and other states impacted by these \nstorms have not received a similar waiver.\n  Unfortunately for State and local governments in Louisiana, 10 \npercent translates into more than $1 billion dollars that must be sent \nback to Washington.\n  Louisiana has over 23,000 Project Worksheets pending, and Mississippi \nhas over 10,000.\n  Some people have suggested that the States provide this matching \nfunding on behalf of the local governments.\n  Let me explain why that will not work.\n  All of the State's money for assistance to local governments exists \nin the form of Community Development Block Grants.\n  FEMA's Public Assistance Program and HUD's CDBG Program have separate \naccounting requirements and separate environmental assessment \nrequirements.\n  For the State to apply funding from this source for every single \nproject would require approximately $20,000 per project. That \ntranslates into nearly half-a-billion dollars wasted on administrative \npaperwork.\n  The State has asked for a single set of standards, but FEMA would not \nagree to this.\n  The State has asked permission to provide a single payment to cover \nthe 10 percent match, after adding its share of all the pending \nprojects, but FEMA would not allow this either.\n  This Global Match would save thousands of man-hours and hundreds of \nmillions of dollars.\n  Louisiana has not been able to cut through the red tape though, and \nhas been told it must waste this money on duplicative bureaucratic \nprocedures.\n  This money could be reinvested into housing, infrastructure, and \neconomic development, in order to bring families, communities, and \nbusinesses back to life in the Gulf region.\n  Gulf coast States lost their tax base after properties were destroyed \nall over the region. The hurricanes claimed over 275,000 homes and \n20,000 businesses.\n  Progress is being made but many challenges remain.\n  In communities where the damage was most severe, the struggle \ncontinues to rebuild economic infrastructure and restore vitality. \nLocal governments have had to lay off thousands of employees, and pay \nthose who remain with money they receive from Federal loans.\n  I would like to briefly talk about the situation in several of these \ncommunities.\n  Cameron Parish in Southwest Louisiana is home to 9,681 people.\n  It was the site of landfall for Hurricane Rita on September 24, 2005, \nand the eye of the storm passed directly over it.\n  Winds exceeding 110 miles per hour pounded the parish for more than \n24 hours, and storm surges 15 to 20 feet high submerged it completely.\n  The Cameron Parish School Board has reported that 100 percent of its \nfacilities need repairs, and 62 percent were totally destroyed.\n  Only two public buildings, the Parish courthouse and the District \nAttorney's office were left standing. Both are in need of extensive \nrepairs.\n  Other buildings destroyed include: 5 fire stations, 4 community \nrecreation centers, 4 public libraries, 3 parish maintenance barns, 2 \nparish multi-purpose buildings, ``Courthouse Circle,'' Cameron Parish \nPolice Jury Annex Building, Cameron Parish Sheriff's Department \nInvestigative Office, The Cameron Parish Health Unit, Cameron Parish \nSchool Board Office, Cameron Parish Mosquito Control Barn, and the \nWaterworks district 10 office.\n\n[[Page S2784]]\n\n  Katrina produced a category 5 surge and winds in excess of 125 miles \nper hour when it made landfall in St. Bernard Parish.\n  As the storm surge traveled across Lake Borgne and up the Mississippi \nRiver Gulf Outlet, MRGO, it overtopped the levee along the northern \nedge of the urbanized area of St. Bernard Parish, and broke through the \nlevee on the Industrial Canal in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward.\n  Water from both levee breaks flooded most of the parish inside to \ndepths of up to 14 feet. Flood waters remained for approximately 3 \nweeks.\n  Most structures outside the hurricane levee protection systems have \nbeen entirely destroyed and removed by the storm surge, estimated to be \nbetween 20 and 30 feet.\n  A flood-related breach of a nearby refinery's oil tank released about \n1 million gallons of crude oil, further damaging approximately 1,800 \nhomes and polluting area canals.\n  Fishing communities in the eastern areas of the parish were \ndestroyed.\n  Less than a month after Katrina, an 8-foot storm surge from Hurricane \nRita breached recently repaired levees, and again caused widespread \nflooding in the parish.\n  In all, 127 St. Bernard citizens died, about 68,000 people were \ndisplaced, and 100 percent of the parish housing stock, over 25,000 \nunits, was either destroyed or damaged so severely that it became \nuninhabitable.\n  All parish businesses and government buildings, and most utility \nsystems, were also destroyed. Damaged levees, decimated wetlands, and \nthe still-open MRGO have left the parish vulnerable to future storms.\n  Prior to Katrina, there were approximately 25,123 occupied housing \nunits in St. Bernard Parish, consisting mostly of single family homes \nand apartments.\n  After the storms, the entire housing stock of the parish was \nsubmerged under storm water, for nearly 3 weeks in many areas. Many \nhomes in the parish are damaged beyond repair and may need to be \ndemolished.\n  By the time the waters receded, more than 80 percent of the housing \nstock had been damaged.\n  It makes very little sense to require communities to put up this \nmatch in their current financial condition. Doing so will only serve to \ndelay rebuilding across the region.\n  If we fail to act, we abandon Federal precedent, and we allow FEMA to \ncontinue wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on \nduplication and waste.\n  I remind my colleagues that these hurricanes caused the greatest \nnatural disaster in the history of this country. I ask only that we \noffer the same treatment to victims along the Gulf coast that we have \noffered victims on 32 other occasion.\n  Unfortunately for the State and local governments in Louisiana, 10 \npercent translates into more than $1 billion that must be sent back to \nWashington. Louisiana has over 23,000 project worksheets pending, and \nMississippi has over 10,000. Some people have suggested that the States \nprovide this matching funding on behalf of the local governments. There \nare several reasons why that will not work.\n  All of the State's money for assistance to local governments exists \nin the form of Community Development Block Grants.\n  FEMA's Public Assistance Program and HUD's CDBG Program have separate \naccounting requirements, separate non-discrimination requirements, and \nseparate environmental assessment requirements.\n  For the State to apply funding from CDBG for every single project, \nwould require approximately $20,000 per project. That translates into \nnearly half-a-billion dollars wasted on administrative paperwork.\n  The State has asked for a single set of standards, but FEMA would not \nagree to this. The State has asked permission to provide a single \npayment to cover 10 percent match, after adding its share of all the \npending projects, but FEMA would not allow this either. This Global \nMatch would have saved thousands of man-hours and hundreds of millions \nof dollars, Louisiana has not been able to cut through the red tape \nthough, and has been told it must waste this money on duplicative \nbureaucratic procedures.\n  This money could be reinvested into housing, infrastructure, and \neconomic development, in order to bring families, communities, and \nbusinesses back to life in the Gulf region. It makes very little sense \nto require communities to put up this match in their current financial \ncondition. Doing so will only serve to delay rebuilding across the \nregion. These hurricanes caused the greatest natural disaster in the \nhistory of this country.\n  This amendment offers the same treatment to victims along the Gulf \ncoast, that we have offered disaster victims on 32 other occasions. If \nwe fail to act, we will have abandoned federal precedent in the midst \nof our county's worst disaster, and we will allow FEMA to continue \nwasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars on unnecessary \nduplication and waste.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter to the President be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 2007.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As you are aware, FEMA regulations call \n     for a ten percent match for every dollar made available \n     through FEMA's public assistance program in connection with \n     the effort to recover from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We \n     understand that requiring states to match federal expenditure \n     helps to encourage states to spend program funds more wisely. \n     However, given the magnitude of this disaster and the \n     extremely difficult circumstances that Louisiana and many \n     Gulf Coast communities now face, we believe that the most \n     appropriate step for the Federal government is to waive the \n     match requirement in this case.\n       While the people of Louisiana are grateful to the nation \n     for the help that they have received, the State still \n     confronts a massive shortfall between the dollars that have \n     come in from all sources and the real costs of recovery, a \n     shortfall that the state estimates to be $40 billion. The $1 \n     billion in matching funds that Louisiana could be required to \n     send to the Federal government could be better spent on \n     rental assistance, mental health, school infrastructure and a \n     variety of other needs that have fallen through the cracks of \n     the Stafford Act.\n       Although FEMA regulations encourage the President to \n     require a 10 percent match for the PA program, the Stafford \n     Act clearly gives the President the discretion to waive this \n     matching requirement. To be certain, this is not a request \n     without precedent or beyond the scope of the Federal \n     government's earlier decisions. Since 1985, FEMA has granted \n     waivers on the state match for public assistance in 32 \n     different disasters. Yet having been battered by the first \n     and third worst hurricanes in United States history, \n     Louisiana must still meet the match requirement.\n       Per capita cost is the usual determinant regarding the need \n     for a match. Louisiana's cost per capita was approximately \n     $6,700. This is contrasted with two earlier cases where the \n     state match was waived. In New York, after September 11th, \n     the cost per capita was $390.00. In Florida, after Hurricane \n     Andrew, the cost per capita was $139.00. These numbers, taken \n     alone, illustrate the unprecedented level of damage that \n     Louisiana has suffered and the massive scale of the challenge \n     before us. However, taken with the realities that are evident \n     when you visit the Gulf Coast and speak to state and local \n     officials, it is clear that your decision to waive this \n     requirement is not only prudent, but vital to the recovery \n     effort.\n       In short, basic equity and previous precedent argues that \n     Louisiana's state match be waived. We appreciate your \n     attention to this matter, and look forward to your \n     assistance.\n       With sincere regards,\n           Sincerely,\n     Harry Reid,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Mary L. Landrieu,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Joseph I. Lieberman,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To authorize NTIA to borrow against anticipated receipts of \n the Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund to initiate \n    migration to a national IP-enabled emergency network capable of \n      receiving and responding to all citizen activated emergency \n                            communications)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n\n                      TITLE XIV--911 MODERNIZATION\n\n     SEC. 1401. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``911 Modernization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1402. FUNDING FOR PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 3011 of Public Law 109-171 (47 U.S.C. 309 note) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``The'' and inserting:\n       ``(a) In General.--The''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Credit.--The Assistant Secretary may borrow from the \n     Treasury, upon enactment of this provision, such sums as \n     necessary, but not to exceed $43,500,000 to implement this \n     section. The Assistant Secretary shall reimburse the \n     Treasury, without interest, as funds are deposited into the \n     Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Fund.''.\n\n     SEC. 1403. NTIA COORDINATION OF E-911 IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n       Section 158(b)(4) of the National Telecommunications and \n     Information Administration Organization Act (47 U.S.C. \n     942(b)(4)) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following: ``Within 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     the 911 Modernization Act, the Assistant Secretary and the \n     Administrator shall jointly issue regulations updating the \n     criteria to provide priority for public safety answering \n     points not capable, as of the date of enactment of that Act, \n     of receiving 911 calls.''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. This amendment has been cosponsored by Senators Clinton, \nInouye, Smith, Snowe, and Hutchison.\n  Mr. President, 911 calls provide the first line of defense in the \nsafety of our citizens and is critical to public safety personnel.\n  Technological advances now allow 911 calls to provide more \ninformation, such as the caller's location and telephone number. In too \nmany parts of the country, the public safety community doesn't have the \ntechnology needed to receive location or other information. They need \nfunding help to upgrade their equipment so this is possible.\n  Congress previously allocated $43.5 million as part of the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2005 for E-911 grants, so the 911 system can be \nupgraded. However, as it currently stands, the grants cannot be awarded \nuntil after the digital television proceedings are completed.\n  Our amendment would add the 911 Modernization Act, S. 93, to this \nbill, which passed unanimously out of the Commerce Committee several \nweeks ago.\n  This would allow the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration to borrow $43.5 million from the Treasury to fund the \nEnhance 911 Act Grant Program in advance of the spectrum auction. \nBecause these funds are only advanced, the CBO has informed us that \nthis amendment does not score.\n  The National Emergency Number Association that focuses on 911 \nrecently announced that more than 20 percent of the country doesn't \nhave enhanced 911 capability. That 20 percent is in rural America and \ncovers 50 percent of the counties of our country.\n  There is a matching fund requirement in the underlying law to ensure \nthat this money is spent wisely by public safety entities that are \ncommitted to improve the 911 calling capability of the citizens. This \nmeans that local governments must match under the law, and this enables \nus to know there is local support for the activities that would be \nfinanced by this money.\n  The amendment has the support of the Association of Public Safety \nCommunications Officers International and the National Emergency \nNumbering Association. I will submit a letter from these two premier \n911 public safety organizations for the Record. With this borrowing \nauthority, the NTIA could get the money out to the public safety \ncommunity now. The funds will be replaced, and enhanced 911 calls can \nbegin saving lives in more of rural America. This is absolutely \nessential. Again, 50 percent of our counties do not have the ability to \nmove forward unless this money is made available. Borrowing the money \nnow, so it will be repaid out of the spectrum auction, is the best way \nto proceed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I mentioned be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 5, 2007.\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Vice-Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye and Vice-Chairman Stevens: As you \n     know, the 9-1-1 system is the connection to the public for \n     daily emergencies and also plays a vital role in more \n     significant homeland security events, from reporting on a \n     potential outbreak to hazardous materials spills. In fact, as \n     the connection to the general public, 9-1-1 centers are \n     likely to be the first to know of a developing homeland \n     security event. Thus, it is imperative that our 9-1-1 system \n     be adequately funded to ensure that all Americans have access \n     to a 9-1-1 system that is fully prepared to respond to \n     requests for help in every situation.\n       Congress took steps to address the funding needs of 9-1-1 \n     by passing the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004. Unfortunately, no \n     appropriations were provided for grants in the 109th \n     Congress. However, thanks to your leadership, the Deficit \n     Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171) did include a provision \n     that requires $43.5 million in spectrum auction proceeds to \n     be allocated for grants to Public Safety Answering Points \n     (PSAPs) authorized by the ENHANCE 911 Act. Currently, those \n     grant funds will not be available until sometime in late 2008 \n     or 2009 after auction revenues are deposited into the \n     Treasury.\n       Obtaining funding for this grant program as soon as \n     possible is critical to allow underfunded PSAPs to obtain the \n     resources they need to upgrade their wireless E9-1-1 \n     capabilities and for necessary staffing and training needs. \n     Currently, nearly half of the counties in the United States \n     do not contain a PSAP with the ability to precisely locate \n     wireless 9-1-1 calls. Therefore, we were pleased with the \n     introduction of the 911 Modernization Act (S. 93) by Vice-\n     Chairman Stevens which would provide NTIA with advanced \n     borrowing authority for the $43.5 million provided in the \n     Deficit Reduction Act and make those funds immediately \n     available for grants. We strongly support ensuring that \n     immediate funding is provided for 9-1-1 and hope your offices \n     will work together to make this legislation, and 9-1-1 \n     funding in general, a priority.\n       In addition to the 911 Modernization Act, it is also \n     imperative that Congress provide sufficient funding to NHTSA \n     and NTIA in the FY 2008 budget for ENHANCE 911 Act grants and \n     for the administration of the 9-1-1 Implementation and \n     Coordination Office (ICO). Providing this funding will ensure \n     that the potential of the ENHANCE 911 Act to greatly improve \n     9-1-1 service is fully realized. Thank you for your continued \n     leadership on 9-1-1 and emergency communications issues and \n     we look forward to continue working with you and your staff \n     on these and other important issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jason Barbour,\n       President, NENA.\n     Wanda McCarley,\n       President, APCO International.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

If I may explain with \nrespect to the Senator from Iowa?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, the Senator from Iowa has, in the \nnormal course of Senate proceedings, asked unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment to offer an amendment of his own. I am \nobjecting to that. I want to explain why.\n  We now have 50 amendments pending. We have a group of amendments \nSenators Collins and I have agreed on and are willing to offer by \nconsent, but at least two Senators are objecting to us doing that until \nthere is an agreement to vote on amendments that they want a vote on.\n  We have a very important bill that has a sense of urgency to it, the \n9/11 legislation. Therefore, as the manager of the bill on this side--\nand, incidentally, I will add that cloture was filed, surprisingly, on \nfour of the amendments. We have come to a point where the bill as \nreported out of our committee on a nonpartisan vote is ready to go. But \nthese 50 amendments are stopping it from getting to a conference with \nthe House.\n  Until we have an agreement across party lines as to how we are going \nto proceed, I am going to, respectfully, with no prejudice to my friend \nfrom Iowa, object to setting aside the pending amendment, which is the \nStevens amendment, No. 299. That would be for anyone else who would \nwant to offer an amendment at this time, until there is an agreement on \nhow we are going to proceed to get this urgent bill passed, hopefully, \nby the end of the week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 386\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to offer another \namendment to S. 4 that seeks to strengthen our Nation's homeland \nsecurity by closing a loophole in our securities laws. My amendment \nwould amend section 203(b)(3) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 \nand would narrow an exemption from registration for certain investment \nadvisers. There is a homeland security element to this fix because it \ncan sometimes be important to know who is managing large sums of money \nfor wealthy foreign investors. For example, it was recently reported \nthat a Boston-based private equity firm, Overland Capital Group, Inc, \nis under investigation by the IRS and DOJ counterterrorism division. \nSuch firms, which manage hundreds of millions of dollars for wealthy \ninvestors in total secrecy, ought to have to at least register with the \nSEC.\n  Currently, section 203(b)(3) of the Investment Advisers Act provides \na statutory exemption from registration for any investment adviser who \nhad fewer than 15 clients in the preceding 12-month period and who does \nnot hold himself out to the public as an investment adviser. This \namendment would narrow this exemption, which is currently used by \nlarge, private pooled investment vehicles, commonly referred to as \nhedge funds. These hedge funds use this section of the securities laws \nto avoid registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission--SEC.\n  Much has been reported during the last few years regarding hedge \nfunds and the market power they yield because of the large amounts of \ncapital they invest. In fact, some estimates are that these pooled \ninvestment vehicles are trading nearly 30 percent of the daily trades \nin U.S. financial markets. The power this amount of volume has is not \nsome passing fad, but instead represents a new element in our financial \nmarkets. Congress needs to ensure that we know who is running these \nlarge vehicles to ensure the security of those markets.\n  The failure of Amaranth and the increasing interest in hedge funds as \ninvestment vehicles for public pension money means that this is not \njust a high stakes game for the super rich. It affects regular \ninvestors. Indeed, it affects the markets as a whole. My recent \noversight of the SEC has convinced me that the Commission and the Self-\nRegulatory Organizations--SROs--need much more information about the \nactivities of hedge funds in order to protect the markets from \ninstitutional insider trading and other potential abuses. This is one \nsmall and simple step toward greater transparency--to require that \nhedge funds register and tell the regulators who they are. This is not \na burden, but rather a simple, common sense requirement for \norganizations that wield hundreds of billions of dollars in market \npower every day. The SEC has already attempted to do this by \nregulation.\n  Congress needs to act because of a decision made last year by a \nFederal appeals court, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2006, the \nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a SEC administrative rule that \nrequired registration of hedge funds. This decision effectively ended \nall registration of hedge funds with the SEC.\n  My amendment would narrow the statutory exemption from registration \nand bring much needed transparency to hedge funds. The amendment would \nauthorize the SEC to require investment\n\n[[Page S2787]]\n\nadvisers to register unless the adviser: No. 1, had $50 million or less \nin assets under management, No. 2, had fewer than 15 clients, No. 3, \ndid not hold himself out to the public as an investment adviser, and \nNo. 4, managed the assets of fewer than 15 investors, regardless of \nwhether the investors participate directly or through a pooled \ninvestment vehicle, such as a hedge fund.\n  This amendment is a first step in ensuring that the SEC has the \nneeded statutory authority to do what it attempted to do for the last 2 \nyears. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as we work to \nprotect investors large and small.\n  I am not surprised by the objection today. For the record, I want \neveryone to know that this morning when I said I intended to offer this \namendment, my phones started ringing off the hook. Lots of powerful \npeople don't want to see an amendment like this, but Americans want \ntheir Government to know who is running these funds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today, I wish to speak to my amendment No. \n381 that seeks to improve the U.S.'s national security through \nincreasing our ability to fuel our country from domestic resources.\n  Americans are familiar with the violence, terrorism, and instability \nin the Middle East. But forms of that instability are spreading around \nthe world, including to our own backyard.\n  This chart by the Energy Information Agency summarizes some of the \nenergy security hot spots around the world. Since September 2005 when \nthis chart was made, U.S. security interests have gotten even worse in \nsome regions. On February 26, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez \nnationalized U.S. oil interests--the motivation for the Soviet-style \nmove was to improve Venezuelan strategic interests.\n  Adding insult to injury, while signing an agreement allowing Chinese \ncompanies to explore in Venezuela, Mr. Chavez stated that, ``We have \nbeen producing and exporting oil for more than 100 years but they have \nbeen years of dependence on the United States. Now we are free and we \nmake our resources available to the great country of China.''\n  China has recognized that energy is a true security interest and has \ninked deals with Russia and OPEC, along with Castro's Cuba.\n  The fact is that our national security is linked with our energy \nsecurity. Yet even if we were to stop importing oil from the Middle \nEast tomorrow our national security interests would still be at risk.\n  And we are not alone.\n  European Union countries as a whole import 50 percent of their energy \nneeds, a figure expected to rise to 70 percent by 2030. A significant \nand increasing volume of those imports come from Russia.\n  In December 2005, Russia decided to turn off the gas to Ukraine, \naffecting imports into Italy, Austria, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia. A \nsimilar dispute between Russia and Belarus affected Germany's oil \nimports.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, global energy demand \nis expected to rise by nearly 60 percent over the next 20 years.\n  In order to meet motorists' demands today and tomorrow and the global \nstruggle for energy security, I am introducing the Domestic Fuels \nSecurity Act.\n  The Domestic Fuels Security Act lays out a coordinated plan to \nincrease the production of critical clean transportation fuels for \ntoday and tomorrow in four significant ways.\n  First, the amendment provides a coordinated process whereby the \nFederal Government--at the option of a Governor and in consultation \nwith local governments--would be required to assist the State in the \npermitting process for domestic fuels facilities. These would include \ncoal-to-liquids plants, modern refineries, and biorefineries. And this \nvoluntary, coordinated, from-the-grassroots-up process would do so \nwithout waiving any environmental law.\n  Second, the amendment would look to the future and conduct a full \nenvironmental review of fuel derived from coal.\n  The U.S. has 27 percent of the world's coal supply--the largest in \nthe world--nearly 250 billion tons of recoverable reserves. It is \ncritical that we learn to use what we have and do so in an \nenvironmentally responsible way.\n  Third, the amendment seeks to spur a viable coal-to-liquids industry \nin a comprehensive way. In order for a new fuels industry--to develop \nthree components are required--upfront costs to design and build, a \nsite to do it, and a market to sell the product.\n  The amendment provides loan guarantees and loans for the startup \ncosts. It provides incentives to some of the most economically \ndistressed communities--Indian tribes and those affected by BRAC--to \nconsider locating a facility in their backyard through Economic \nDevelopment Administration grants. Last, the amendment requires the \nDepartment of Defense to study the national security benefits of having \na domestic coal-to-liquids, CTL, fuels industry to comprehensively \nassess a new market.\n  I have to give credit to my colleagues, Senators Bunning, Obama, \nLugar, Pryor, Murkowski, Bond, Thomas, Craig, Martinez, Enzi, and \nLandrieu, who together had introduced a bill with similar language. I \nam hopeful that they will join me in moving this amendment.\n  We can all agree that increasing domestic energy security is a vital \nobjective. Yet it also provides good jobs.\n  According to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic \nOpportunity, a CTL plant, with an output of 10,000 barrels per day, can \nsupport 200 direct jobs onsite, at least 150 jobs at the supporting \ncoal mine, and 2,800 indirect jobs throughout the region. During \nconstruction, another 1,500 temporary jobs will be created.\n  Fourth, cellulosic biomass ethanol--renewable fuel from energy crops \nlike switchgrass--is a popular concept but faces financial barriers. \nRecently, the Federal Government has released some initial money to \nhelp develop the industry, but more could be done.\n  In order to entice private sector investment, it is important for the \ncollective fuels industry and motorists to know what our renewable \nresource base is, as well as traditional fuels. This amendment requires \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission to convene a task force to \nassess how we should modernize our reserves--both traditional and \nrenewable for cellulosic biomass ethanol feedstocks.\n  Energy security, job security, American security--please join me in \npassing the Domestic Fuels Security Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe chart to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     OIL AND NATURAL GAS

Mr. President, more than 5 years after the 9/11 \nattacks, the number of victims continues to rise because of the lasting \nhealth impacts experienced by far too many of those who selflessly \nresponded to this disaster in 2001. On that day, and in the following \nmonths, thousands worked and lived by the Ground Zero site, amidst the \ndust, smog, and toxic mix of debris. And now we are seeing those \nworkers, responders, and residents become sick from what they were \nexposed to on 9/11 and the following months. I believe we have a moral \nobligation to take care of those suffering from 9/11-related illnesses.\n  The work of Senator Harkin, Senator Byrd, Senator Specter, and all of \ntheir colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee has been \ninvaluable in securing funding to address many of the health issues \nthat have appeared following 9/11. In December 2001, we learned that \nhundreds of firefighters were on medical leave because of injuries \nrelated to 9/11 issues, and the Appropriations Committee responded by \nallocating $12 million for medical monitoring activities so that we \ncould track and study the health impacts associated with the rescue and \nresponse efforts at the World Trade Center. Thousands of individuals \nsigned up for this program, and in Congress, we worked to meet the \ndemand by appropriating an additional $90 million to monitor other \nworkers and volunteers who were at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills.\n  Through this work, we learned that many of those who were exposed are \nnow experiencing significant health problems from this exposure--people \nwho were in the prime of their life before 9/11 now suffering from \nasthma, sinusitis, reactive airway disease, and mental health issues. \nSo in December 2005, I worked with Senator Harkin and other \nappropriators, as well as my colleagues in the New York Congressional \nDelegation, to secure an additional $75 million in funding that would \nfor the first time provide Federal funding for treatment to help those \nwho were disabled by these attacks get the care that they needed.\n  Sadly, we are once again running out of funding to take care of the \nheroes who never questioned their responsibility on 9/11 and are now \npaying a terrible price. While the President has proposed providing \nadditional funding for treatment in the fiscal year 2008 budget, we \nmust act sooner to provide sufficient funds to ensure treatments \nthrough the rest of the current fiscal year.\n  That is why I introduced an amendment to the 9/11 bill we are \nconsidering today to divert $3.6 million in funding--originally part of \nthat $20 billion secured for New York in the wake of \n9/11 that the administration proposed to cut in its fiscal year 2008 \nbudget. At a time when treatment needs are so urgent, I believe that we \nneed to ensure that dollars that were intended for 9/11 needs can be \nused to address the mounting health crisis that we are facing as a \ndirect result of these attacks. I believe it is important to raise \nawareness of the fact that these programs--programs that are helping \ntens of thousands of first responders in New York and around the \nNation--are in danger of having to turn patients away.\n  I am extremely grateful for what we have been able to accomplish with \nthe support of Senator Harkin and other appropriators. They have shown \nthat they consider it our national responsibility to care for those who \ndid our country proud in the hours, days, weeks, and months following \nthat horrific attack. I am also proud that I will be working with my \ncolleagues on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, including Senators Kennedy, Enzi, and Harkin, to develop a \nlasting solution to address these health care needs. But while we are \nworking on those solutions, we must ensure that these programs continue \nto operate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my good friend and colleague, Senator Clinton, \nfor her kind remarks. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 took place nearly \n1,000 miles from Iowa. But the attacks on the World Trade Center and \nthe Pentagon were really an attack on the heart of America. Iowans \nanswered the call of service and came to the aid of those affected by \nthese attacks. The Musco Lighting Company from Muscatine donated \nlighting equipment to assist the World Trade Center recovery efforts. \nQuad-Cities fire departments collected more than $75,000 for the \nUniformed Fighter Association's 9/11 Disaster Relief Fund.\n  And just as Iowans and other Americans responded to the calls for \nhelp, I am proud that the Appropriations Committee has worked step by \nstep with the New York delegation to address the many desperate needs \nthat arose from 9/11. I was proud to work with Senator Clinton, Senator \nByrd, and my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to secure $20 \nbillion immediately after 9/11 to help both short and longer term \nrecovery efforts at Ground Zero, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, PA. The \nfunding for tracking health outcomes is a particular concern to myself \nand Senator Specter. This funding has been used to monitor not only the \nbrave responders and recovery workers who live in New York, but also \nall who responded from around the country, including more than 35 from \nIowa.\n  I thank you for your leadership on this issue and I look forward to \nworking with you on the upcoming emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill to maintain the current monitoring and treatment program for 9/11 \nresponders and recovery workers.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator. On behalf of the thousands of \nfirefighters, police officers, rescue workers, residents, students, and \nothers who are suffering from 9/11-related illnesses, I look forward to \nworking with you on the upcoming emergency supplemental appropriations \nlegislation to ensure that those who are sick can receive the care they \nneed.

Mr. President, Missouri's own Harry Truman once said:\n\n       A politician is a man who understands government. A \n     statesman is a politician who has been dead for 10 years.\n\n  Somehow, another son of Missouri, Senator Tom Eagleton, managed to be \nboth a keen master of government and a statesman in his own lifetime, \nas well as a dear friend of many in this Chamber. On this past Sunday, \nTom passed away at age 77.\n  Tom Eagleton was a man who radiated wit, warmth, and a brand of \nintellectual and moral seriousness that\n\n[[Page S2789]]\n\ncommanded respect, even as he won the affection of all those around \nhim. A Senator and a statesman, a humanitarian and a humorist, Tom left \nhis indelible mark on the issues that mattered most to him. His \nproudest accomplishment in a superb career in public life, and in the \nSenate particularly, was an amendment to cut off funds for America's \ndisastrous bombing of Cambodia. He was also a principal author of the \nSenate's War Powers Resolution, which sought to dramatically limit the \nPresident's ability to commit forces abroad without the consent of \nCongress.\n  Ever true to his principles, Tom voted against the version that was \nreported by the conference committee, which he believed the executive \nwould ultimately exploit as a 60-day blank check to use armed force. \nOver President Nixon's veto, and without Senator Eagleton's vote, the \nbill was passed. As usual, Tom Eagleton's concerns proved only too \nprescient.\n  Senator Eagleton was a fierce and passionate critic of the Vietnam \nwar, and he worked tirelessly to end that conflict. In 1971 he made a \nstatement before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, one that I \nremember. It came about 3 weeks or so after I had been privileged to \ntestify to that committee. He made an argument that resonates as \nclearly today as it did at the time he made it. He spoke of the need to \nset a firm date for withdrawal.\n  In an essay he wrote entitled ``Whose Power Is War Power,'' he quoted \nJustice Story:\n\n       In a Republic, it should be difficult to make war and easy \n     to make peace.\n\n  And yet, he said:\n\n       In Vietnam, war came easy and peace comes hard.\n\n  His words ring equally true of the war in Iraq, a war he fervently \nopposed from the outset.\n  For a brief period of time, for the 2 years our careers overlapped in \nthe Senate, I had the privilege of working closely with Tom. He was as \ndecent and as humble as he was passionate. I remember, when I first \ncame to the Senate in 1985, Tom and I were unlikely seatmates, the two \nmost recent additions to the Foreign Relations Committee. He wrote a \nletter, spontaneously, to Senator Pell, then the committee chair. If \nthere was an opportunity for him to serve as a ranking minority \nDemocrat on a subcommittee, he said: ``I would prefer to forego [it] in \nfavor of Senator Kerry.''\n  It was a magnanimous gesture that impressed me enormously, and also \nmade a difference to my early involvement in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. In a place where seniority counts--then a lot more than even \ntoday, where prerogatives matter--and sometimes far too much, it was \nunusual to defer to a freshman Senator as he did. But that was Tom \nEagleton.\n  Tom's collegiality didn't stop at the aisle. One of his great friends \nin the Senate was his junior Senator, his colleague from Missouri, \nRepublican Senator John Danforth. He championed Jack's nomination to \nbecome U.N. Ambassador and the two cooperated on countless issues, most \nrecently as ex-Senators, cochairing Missouri's stem cell initiative to \nprotect all forms of stem cell research allowed under Federal law. They \nwere friends for 40 years, and colleagues in the Senate for 10. They \nshowed a spirit of bipartisan cooperation too often missing from \ntoday's politics.\n  On so many issues, Tom Eagleton was a trailblazer and a visionary. He \nhelped to write the Clear Air Act of 1970 and the Clean Water Act of \n1972, foundations of today's environmental protection regime.\n  He was among the few in the Senate to oppose the Reagan tax cuts as \nhe said: ``Once again, once again,'' shouting in his famous baritone, \n``largesse to the rich.''\n  As he left Washington 20 years ago, he sounded an early warning that \nthere was too much money in American politics, and he was a staunch \ncritic of the Iraq war, from its initial walkup to the present.\n  Tom Eagleton blazed other trails as well. In 1956 he became the \nyoungest circuit attorney in the history of St. Louis, a record that \nstill stands. And in 1960, when he ran for Missouri attorney general on \nthe same ticket as another Catholic, John F. Kennedy, he held his \nground when anti-Catholic bigots scrawled graffiti over his campaign \nposters. Tom Eagleton, in all of his career, never lost a Missouri \nelection in his entire life.\n  Tom's pre-Senate career took him from the Navy to the district \nattorney's office to the lieutenant governorship. I might add, \nparenthetically, it happens to be the exact same course I followed. He \nwas the youngest Lieutenant Governor in Missouri's history. I \nempathized personally with his quip that Missouri's No. 2 spot was good \nfor standing at the window and ``watching the Missouri River flow by.''\n\n  Tom Eagleton was a quick wit, but he was also a man fully committed \nto living by his conscience, whether it led him to take conservative \npositions on social issues or even to censure a colleague from his own \nside of the aisle after ethical lapses. As the Senate debated ousting a \nDemocratic Senator who had been convicted of bribery and conspiracy, \nSenator Eagleton was firm. He said, ``We should not perpetrate our own \ndisgrace by asking him to remain.'' He loved justice, and it is fitting \nthat the Federal courthouse in downtown St. Louis now bears his name.\n  In 1968, his commitment to reform led him to challenge a sitting \nDemocratic Senator whose record, many believed, was tarnished by \ncorruption. After the race, his defeated opponent said bitterly:\n\n       The man who builds a house on public service builds it of \n     straw and on sand.\n\n  But Tom Eagleton proved that wrong. He retired in 1987 with the love \nand admiration of millions in his home State of Missouri and across the \ncountry. When he announced in 1984 that he would not seek reelection to \na fourth term, his statement was full of the same personal humility \nthat had led him to hand over his seniority to a freshman Senator. He \ndeclared that ``public offices should not be held in perpetuity'' and \nadded that he had enjoyed ``a full and complete career.''\n  As his colleague Dale Bumpers of Arkansas said:\n\n       Tom's goal was never to be carried out of the Senate in a \n     pine box. He chose his career in politics because he \n     considered it the best place from which to promote justice, \n     nobility, freedom and dignity.\n\n  When Tom announced he would not seek reelection, the Kansas City Star \nsummed up the legacy he was leaving behind:\n\n       Senator Thomas F. Eagleton is the kind of politician the \n     system is supposed to produce but so rarely does. He has \n     elevated the job of politics because he does not accept the \n     conventional denigration of politics. He believes it is a \n     noble profession, and in the hands of such as himself, it is \n     exactly that.\n\n  In the two decades since he left the Senate, Tom never let go of his \nindefatigable sense of justice, his unique sense of humor, his taste \nfor politics, or his love of Missouri. Once, after a ``Meet the Press'' \nappearance a few years ago that I was on, Tom sent me a handwritten \nnote afterward. He said that while he thought I ``demolished'' my \nRepublican counterpart, I really ``should have knocked his toupee off \nhis head.'' That was Tom Eagleton, always seeing the humorous or \nabsurd, and he sent a lot of Senators personal notes such as that over \nthe years that made us laugh. He was the point man for the effort that \nwooed the Rams football team from Los Angeles to St. Louis, and even \nTom was stunned by the affection that football fans showed him on the \nstreets of St. Louis--particularly after the Rams' Super Bowl victory \nin 2000.\n  After a plane crash killed Governor Mel Carnahan, the Missouri \nDemocratic nominee for the Senate in October 2000, it was Senator \nEagleton who took the lead in knocking down spurious claims that it \nwould be illegal to keep Carnahan's name on the November ballot.\n  In addition to his three books, Tom wrote over 50 op-eds for his \nhometown newspaper after leaving the Senate at age 57. He truly \nbelieved in the word ``citizenship.''\n  In the last of those op-eds, published November 3, 2005, Senator \nEagleton was candid in his analysis of the current disaster in Iraq. He \nwrote:\n\n       Hubris is always the sword upon which the mighty have \n     fallen.\n\n  And:\n\n       From here on, any President will have to level with the \n     American people before going to war.\n\n  Tom Eagleton loved the Senate. He loved this institution. He was an \nexpert in its rules and procedures and he believed in the \nconstitutional power to\n\n[[Page S2790]]\n\nmake decisions of war and peace. In addition to his most famous book, \n``War and Presidential Power: A Chronicle of Congressional Surrender,'' \nhe also coauthored a textbook for high school students called ``Our \nConstitution and What It Means.'' Most of all, you could see the \npleasure he took from simply being here.\n  Above all, Tom Eagleton loved his family, his home State of Missouri, \nand the St. Louis Cardinals. At one point he even considered applying \nto become the Commissioner of Major League Baseball, but he couldn't \ngive up his Senate seat as long as Missouri had a Republican Governor \nto appoint his successor.\n  This January, Tom celebrated his 50-year anniversary with his \nwonderful wife Barbara. Together they raised two children, Terence and \nChristy, and three grandchildren. Tom Eagleton was the quintessential \nfamily man. He never stopped giving. He gave his life to serving his \nState and his country, and when he died he left instructions that his \nbody was to be given to Washington University for medical research.\n  Senator Tom Eagleton lived a full and remarkable life, and all of his \ncolleagues and all the country will miss him dearly. He died with no \nregrets. ``My ambition,'' he said, ``since my senior year in high \nschool was to be a Senator.''\n  Not everybody achieves their ambition. Tom Eagleton actually did a \nlot more than that. He achieved his own ambitions and earned the love \nand enduring respect of millions. Along the way, he inspired so many of \nus, not least of all the no-longer-freshman Senator from Massachusetts \nwho, 23 years later, rises sadly and proudly to pay tribute to the man \nwho once gave up his seniority but never gave up his principles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to report the 2007 National \nCollegiate Men's and Women's Rifle Championships will be held in \nFairbanks, AK on March 9 and 10. Forty-eight student-athletes will \nparticipate in this exciting competition.\n  Although rifle is relatively new as an NCAA sport, 44 colleges and \nuniversities now sponsor rifle teams. Nationwide, hundreds of student-\nathletes compete in this sport. These young men and women are \ntremendously skilled--to score a bull's-eye in the smallbore \ncompetition, for instance, shooters must strike a target the size of \nthe period at the end of this sentence. Remarkably, they are able to \nconsistently hit this mark from a distance of 50 feet.\n  Like more traditional sports, rifle has a positive impact on its \nparticipants. Marsha Beasley, the former head coach of West Virginia \nUniversity's team, once observed: ``Rifle provides a wonderful \nopportunity to learn many life skills such as self-discipline, \nconcentration, the ability to relax under pressure, goal-setting, \nsportsmanship and teamwork.'' Just as important, rifle teaches \nparticipants how to handle guns in a safe, responsible manner. It is \nalso one of the few sports where men and women compete against each \nother as equals.\n  Rifle competition has a great history in our State, and Alaskans are \nhonored the NCAA has chosen Fairbanks as this year's host. The timing \nof this event is particularly fitting--2007 marks the 70th anniversary \nof the University of Alaska Fairbanks' first rifle team.\n  Over the years, UAF has found great success in this sport. The \nuniversity is the NCAA's reigning rifle champion and has claimed the \nnational title in 7 of the past 8 years. Since 1988, 39 Nanooks have \nbeen selected as All-Americans in rifle. Seven of these competitors \nhave won individual rifle championships.\n  Rifle's popularity is also apparent throughout our state. Today, \nFairbanks is one of several Alaska cities with a robust rifle \ncommunity, and many high schools in our state now sponsor rifle teams \nas well.\n  Mr. President, while I will be rooting for the home team, the \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks, I wish each participant the best in \nthis competition. The names of each team and individual selected for \nthe 2007 National Collegiate Men's and Women's Rifle Championships are \nas follows:\n\n\n       Team Qualifiers: Jacksonville State University, Murray \n     State University, Texas Christian University, United States \n     Military Academy, United States Naval Academy, University of \n     Alaska Fairbanks, University of Kentucky, University of \n     Nebraska.\n       Individual Qualifiers (Smallbore Three-Position): Matthew \n     Hamilton--United States Military Academy, Lee Lemenager--\n     University of Nevada, Reno, Layne Lewis--University of Alaska \n     Fairbanks, Jennifer Lorenzen--University of Mississippi, \n     Meghann Morrill--University of Nevada, Reno.\n       Individual Qualifiers (Air Rifle): Erica Burnham--Tennessee \n     Technological University, Wesley Hess--United States Military \n     Academy, Ashley Jackson--University of Kentucky, Keegan \n     Singleton--University of Memphis, Leah Wilcox--University of \n     Texas at EI Paso, Shannon Wilson--University of Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/07/senate-section/article/S2790-2", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING HERMAN JOSEPH GESSER III\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a staff member \nwho is, unfortunately, leaving to go back to Louisiana. I want to spend \na few minutes talking about his wonderful service.\n  Herman Joseph Gesser came to work in Washington for 1 year. He is an \nattorney and a very able architect and thought he would come and work \nhere for the Louisiana delegation to contribute to our State and to \nlearn the ways of Washington in public service. Ten years later, he is \nstill here. We are sad to see him return to Louisiana, but family \nresponsibilities and duties call him home.\n  He has been projects director and general counsel of my office now \nfor 9 years. He has served with diligence and dedication, honesty, \nintegrity, and creativity. He is truly one of the most sought after and \npopular members of the Senate staff. He has worked on transportation \nprojects. He has been an expert on Corps of Engineers projects, someone \nwhom both Republican and Democratic staffers trust to give them just \nthe facts, give it to them straight, and give it to them quickly.\n  I laugh and say everybody in Louisiana needs a Bubba on their staff. \nI sure have had a very special Bubba on my staff for all these many \nyears, as he is called and referred to kindly and in a very friendly \nway.\n  Bubba has served the people of his home parish, New Iberia Parish, \nwith distinction. He has done some extraordinary work, as I said, in \nthe area of transportation. He is going to be missed.\n  He really is a true example of selfless service. He could be, Mr. \nPresident--as you know, many of our staff could make a great deal more \nmoney, particularly in his case with the double degrees he has as a \nlawyer and an architect. But yet for 10 years, he has chosen to serve \nand stay through the challenges of Katrina and Rita where his talents \nand abilities were called on literally daily and was one of the go-to \npeople I counted on to give me facts, to give them to me quickly so I \ncould advocate more effectively on behalf of the 4.5 million people in \nLouisiana and the millions of people who live in the gulf coast area.\n  I wanted to publicly recognize Herman Joseph Gesser, a citizen of \nLouisiana and a great servant to the people of our State in such a time \nof need.\n  I know his father is very proud of him. I know his mother, who just \npassed away last year, still continues to give him blessings from \nHeaven, and that his extended family and many friends are very grateful \nto him for the support he has given to us all these many years.\n  His homecoming in south Louisiana will be greeted with fanfare by his \nhometown, but it will be a great loss to the Landrieu staff in \nWashington, DC.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/07/senate-section/article/S2790-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2790-S2791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING FIRST ROBOTICS\n\n  Mr. REID.

As a \nresult of his leadership, FIRST has grown into one of the leading \nrobotics competitions in the entire country. This\n\n[[Page S2791]]\n\nproject has even grown to include a partnership with the UNLV Howard R. \nHughes College of Engineering.\n  I am pleased to welcome 12 local teams as well as 50 teams from \nacross the country and the world to Las Vegas and to UNLV. I hope they \nwill be able to enjoy everything Las Vegas has to offer. It is also \nimportant to recognize the contributions of the parents, teachers, \nmentors, volunteers, and sponsors for this event. Without their \nsupport, I am certain this event would not be possible.\n  With the backing of the entire Las Vegas community, I am certain that \nthe FIRST Robotics, FRC, Regional Competition will be an outstanding \nsuccess.

Mr. President, today I wish to join my colleagues from \nthe Helsinki Commission in commemorating the founding of the Charter 77 \nmovement 30 years ago, and praising Vaclav Havel, one of Charter 77's \nfirst spokesmen and the first post-Communist President of \nCzechoslovakia.\n  Many aspects of Vaclav Havel's biography are well known. His advanced \nformal education was limited by the Communist regime because of his \nfamily's pre-World War II cultural and economic status. By the 1960s, \nhe was working in theater and writing plays. But by 1969, the Communist \nregime had deemed him ``subversive,'' and his passport was confiscated.\n  In 1977, he took the daring step of joining two others--Jan Patocka \nand Jiri Hajek--in becoming the first spokesmen for the newly \nestablished ``Charter 77'' movement. This group sought to compel the \nCzechoslovak Government to abide by the international human rights \ncommitments it had freely undertaken, including the Helsinki Final Act.\n  In the 1970s and 1980s, Vaclav Havel was repeatedly imprisoned \nbecause of his human rights work. His longest period of imprisonment \nwas 4\\1/2\\ years, 1979-1983, for subversion. After this, Havel was \ngiven the opportunity to emigrate but, courageously, he chose to stay \nin Czechoslovakia. By February 1989, Havel had come to symbolize a \ngrowing human rights and democratic movement in Czechoslovakia and, \nthat year, the Helsinki Commission nominated him for the Nobel Peace \nPrize.\n  Remarkably, in November 1989, the repressive machinery of the \nCommunist regime--a regime that for five decades had persecuted and \neven murdered its own citizens--collapsed in what has come to be known \nas the ``Velvet Revolution.''\n  To understand just how repressive the former regime was--and \ntherefore how stunning its seemingly sudden demise was--it may be \ninstructive to recall the first measures of the post-Communist \nleadership, introduced in the heady days of late 1989 and early 1990. \nFirst and foremost, all known political prisoners were released. \nMarxism-Leninism was removed as a required course from all school \ncurricula. Borders were opened for thousands of people who had \npreviously been prohibited from traveling freely. Control over the \nPeople's Militia was transferred from the party to the Government. The \nFederal Assembly passed a resolution condemning the 1968 Soviet-led \ninvasion of Czechoslovakia. Approximately 40 Ambassadors representing \nthe Czechoslovak Communist regime were recalled. Newly appointed \nForeign Minister Jiri Dienstbier announced that the ``temporary'' 1968 \nagreement allowing Soviet troops to remain in Czechoslovakia was \ninvalid because it was agreed to under duress and that Soviet troops \nwould withdraw from the country. The Politburo announced it would end \nthe nomenklatura system of reserving certain jobs for party \nfunctionaries. The secret police was abolished. Alexander Dubcek, \nleader of the 1968 Prague Spring, was elected Chairman of the Federal \nAssembly on December 28 and, a day later, Vaclav Havel was voted to \nreplace Gustav Husak. In February 1990, Vaclav Havel addressed a joint \nsession of Congress.\n  Charter 77 paved the way for all of these things, and more: for \nCzechoslovakia's first free and fair elections since 1946, for the \nnormalization of trade relations between our two countries, and for the \nCzech Republic's accession to NATO. Not surprisingly, the work of \nCharter 77 continues to inspire, as is evidenced by the adoption of the \nname ``Charter 97'' by human rights activists in Belarus, who are still \nworking to bring to their own country a measure of democracy and \nrespect for human rights that Czechs have now enjoyed for some years.\n  I am therefore pleased to recognize the 30th anniversary of the \nCharter 77 movement and to join others in honoring Vaclav Havel who \nremains, to this day, the conscience of the global community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/07/senate-section/article/S2791-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2791-S2793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize a great \nAmerican and true military heroine who has honorably served our country \nfor 30 years in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps: COL Lenore S. Enzel. COL \nLenore Enzel was born in Brooklyn and raised in Queens, NY. She \nreceived her diploma in nursing from Roosevelt Hospital School of \nNursing, her baccalaureate degree in nursing from Hunter College-\nBellevue Hospital, and her master's degree from the University of \nHawaii. Upon retiring from the U.S. Army after faithfully serving for \n30 years, Colonel Enzel and her husband, LTC Richard Berry, will reside \nin New York.\n  Colonel Enzel began her military career as a staff nurse at Tripler \nArmy Medical Center, HI. She quickly rose through the ranks and served \nthroughout the country, including in New Jersey, Colorado, Texas, \nArizona, Georgia, as well as two other tours at Tripler Army Medical \nCenter.\n  In each assignment, Colonel Enzel excelled and was rewarded with \ngreater responsibilities. After serving as ambulatory section chief at \nFort Hood, TX, she transitioned to Recruiting Command, serving as the \n2nd Recruiting Brigade chief nurse and later as the 2nd Army Medical \nDetachment commander. Colonel Enzel successfully assimilated into the \nhighly complex recruiting environment and became the No. 1 subject \nmatter expert for Army medical recruiting.\n  With her path to executive leadership clearly set, Colonel Enzel \nserved as deputy commander at Fort Huachuca, AZ. Colonel Enzel \nspearheaded the reengineering process as the hospital downsized to a \nfreestanding clinic. Colonel Enzel returned to Hawaii, serving as \ndeputy director and later director, clinical services, TRICARE Pacific \nLead Agency, Tripler Army Medical Center. She managed complex health \ncare issues in a joint arena for 380,000 beneficiaries in 70 countries \nspread across 13 time zones and 100 million square miles. Colonel \nEnzel's last assignment was in Texas, as deputy commander for patient \nservices/nursing, William Beaumont Army Medical Center, Ft. Bliss, TX. \nShe managed care provided to 132,000 beneficiaries at this 150-bed \nteaching hospital. The increased productivity of the hospital has in \nlarge part been due to her drive and leadership.\n  Colonel Enzel is a meritorious leader, administrator, clinician, \neducator, and mentor. Throughout her career she has served with valor \nand profoundly impacted the entire Army Medical Department. Her \nperformance reflects exceptionally on herself, the U.S. Army, the \nDepartment of Defense, and the United States of America. I extend my \ndeepest appreciation to COL Lenore Suzan Enzel on behalf of a grateful \nnation for her more than 30 years of dedicated military \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/07/senate-section/article/S2793-3", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2793-S2794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO PUTNAM COUNTY, GEORGIA\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, today I honor the 200th \nAnniversary of Putnam County, GA.\n  Putnam County was created by an act of the Georgia Assembly on \nDecember 10, 1807. It was laid out from Baldwin County and lies in the \nheart of Georgia's Piedmont region. It was named for one of the most \nnoted patriots of the Revolutionary War, GEN Israel Putnam of \nMassachusetts.\n  The city of Eatonton was founded as the seat of Putnam County in 1808 \nand was incorporated the following year.\n  Known as the ``Dairy Capital of Georgia,'' Putnam County is also home \nto\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\nRock Eagle 4-H Center. The Rock Eagle Mound is 102 feet long and 120 \nfeet wide. It is believed to have been built by Native Americans over \n2,000 years ago and was listed on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces in 1978. Putnam County is also the birthplace of several famous \nGeorgians, including journalist and author Joel Chandler Harris, author \nAlice Walker, and Chick-fil-a founder and CEO S. Truett Cathy.\n  It gives me a great deal of pleasure and it is a privilege to \nrecognize on the floor of the U.S. Senate the contributions of Putnam \nCounty to the State of Georgia.

S2797-S2823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \n        Coleman):\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\n  S. 789. A bill to prevent abuse of Government credit cards; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it's time we put a stop to wasteful, \nabusive, and fraudulent use of government credit cards. In fact, it's \noverdue. For several years, I have been working with the Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) to investigate misuse of government credit \ncards and the lack of internal controls in agencies that breeds such \nactivity. We have found shockingly flagrant abuses like $2,443 in \ntaxpayers' money going to pay for a down payment on a sapphire ring at \na place called E-Z Pawn and $1,935 in taxpayers' money used to purchase \ntwo LA-Z-Boy reclining rocking chairs with full lumbar support and \nvibrator-massage features, all using government purchase cards. \nGovernment travel cards, which are only to be used for legitimate \ntravel-related expenditures, have been used to pay for everything from \nwomen's lingerie from Frederick's of Hollywood to tickets to the \nPhantom of the Opera to a seven night Alaskan cruise for two. In each \nreport it has issued, the GAO has made recommendations about what kind \nof controls need to be implemented to prevent such abuses from \noccurring in the future. Our oversight work has helped shine a light on \nthis problem and has led to some improvements. Some agencies have moved \nto fix the specific shortcomings highlighted by the GAO, and the Office \nof Management and Budget has issued a circular to agencies that seeks \nto bring about an improved control environment. However, I believe a \nmore comprehensive approach is needed. There is considerable \ncommonality between the control breakdowns the GAO found in the \nagencies it investigated. The same controls were often missing or \ninadequate, and therefore the same recommendations are repeated in \nreport after report. The OMB circular does not address many of these \nrecommendations and it makes no sense for the GAO to visit every agency \nand bureau in the Federal Government to point out where they fall \nshort. We know what is needed to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of \ngovernment credit cards and we must ensure that these internal controls \nare implemented consistently across the federal bureaucracy. That is \nwhy I am reintroducing the Government Credit Card Abuse Prevention Act, \nalong with Senators Lieberman, Collins, and Coleman. I should also \nmention that Representative Joe Wilson will be reintroducing companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives and I appreciate his help \nand assistance as we've worked together on this legislation.\n  Based primarily on the recommendations of the GAO in numerous \nreports, as well the work of agency inspectors general and my own \noversight work, my bill seeks to curtail waste, fraud, and abuse of \ngovernment purchase cards, government travel cards, and centrally \nbilled accounts. By way of background, government purchase cards are \nessentially credit cards held by an agency that authorized individuals \nuse to purchase items necessary for the work of the agency. Since the \nagency pays the bills directly, the American taxpayer is on the hook \nwhen improper purchases slip through the cracks. That means hard \nworking American citizens are paying for someone else's Christmas \nshopping, or at the very least items with little or no legitimate \npublic interest. Just like the parents' credit card in the hands of an \nundisciplined teenager, government purchase cards in the hands of \npoorly trained bureaucrats with inadequate oversight can lead to rash \nand ill-considered impulse buys. Take for instance an incident \nuncovered by the GAO when an individual at the Air Force Academy found \na dead deer alongside the road and decided to use a government purchase \ncard to pay for mounting the mule deer head to hang on the wall at the \noffice.\n  Centrally billed accounts are another credit product that federal \nagencies use, primarily for purchasing transportation services. Like \npurchase cards, the bill is sent to the government so it's the taxpayer \nwho pays when the bureaucrats let things slip through the cracks. For \ninstance, we've had repeated cases where government employees had \nairplane tickets purchased on their behalf directly from a centrally \nbilled account, and then they sought and received reimbursement as \nthough they had paid for the ticket. In other words, the ticket was \npaid for twice with the employee pocketing the cost the second time, \nand no one would be the wiser if it weren't for the GAO. The GAO has \nalso found millions of dollars worth of fully refundable, unused \nairline tickets that no one bothered to cash in. I was pleased to work \nwith Senator Coleman, then the Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations, to bring these issues with centrally billed accounts \nto light, as well as Senator Collins, who was at the time the Chairman \nof the Government Affairs Committee. In addition to being co-requesters \nof the GAO reports, they held hearings in their respective committees \nand were kind enough to invite me to testify about our work.\n  Government travel cards, on the other hand, are not paid directly \nwith taxpayers' money like purchase cards and centrally billed \naccounts, but they are only supposed to be used to pay for legitimate \nexpense while on official government travel. Failure by employees to \nrepay these cards results in the loss of millions of dollars in rebates \nto the Federal Government. Also, when credit card companies are forced \nto charge off bad debt, they raise interest rates and fees on everyone \nelse. Nevertheless, government travel cards with high credit limits \nhave been handed out like candy at a parade to individuals with abysmal \ncredit ratings who ordinarily would never be issued that kind of \ncredit. It's no surprise then when we learn that certain government \nemployees have abused their government travel cards to buy jewelry, \ntake in a New York Yankees game, or to fuel an internet gambling habit. \nSuch abusive charges often occur when the cardholder is not even on \ntravel at all. In fact, government travel cards have been used to \nprovide cash advances in employees' hometowns. There are even examples \nof charges at so called ``gentleman's clubs'' like Cheetah's Lounge and \nDeja Vu Showgirls, and even at legalized brothels. Suffice it to say \nthat the GAO was able to determine that these charges were not for food \nor other approved travel expenses. It also comes as no surprise when \nthe GAO found that employees issued government travel cards despite bad \ncredit often bounce checks when their bill comes due, sometimes \nrepeatedly and fraudulently. Common sense then leads us to the same \nconclusion that the GAO came to through empirical analysis, namely that \na significant relationship exists between potential travel card fraud, \nabuse, and delinquencies and individuals with substantial credit \nhistory problems. That is why my legislation requires agencies to \nperform credit checks for travel card holders and issue only restricted \ncards for those with poor or no credit to reduce the potential for \nmisuse.\n  My bill would also require a series of common sense internal \ncontrols, which the GAO has found to be lacking in many cases, to be \nimplemented in every federal agency. These include: maintaining a \nrecord of each cardholder, including single transaction limits and \ntotal credit limits so agencies can effectively manage their \ncardholders; implementing periodic reviews to determine if cardholders \nhave a need for a card; properly recording rebates to the government \nbased on prompt payment; providing training for cardholders and \nmanagers; utilizing available technologies to prevent or catch \nfraudulent purchases; establishing specific policies about the number \nof cards to be issued, the credit limits for certain categories of \ncardholders, and categories of employees eligible to be issued cards; \ninvalidating cards when employees leave the agency or transfer; \nestablishing an approving official other than the purchase card holder \nso employees cannot approve their own purchases; reconciling purchase \ncard charges on the bill with receipts and supporting documentation; \nsubmitting disputed purchase card charges to the bank according to the \nproper procedure; making purchase card payments promptly to avoid \ninterest penalties; retaining records of purchase card transactions in \naccordance with standard government record keeping polices; utilizing \nmandatory split disbursements when reimbursing employees for travel \ncard purchases to ensure that travel card bills get paid; comparing \nitems submitted on travel vouchers\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\nwith items already paid for with centrally billed accounts to avoid \nreimbursing employees for items already paid for by the agency; and \nsubmitting refund requests for unused airline tickets so the taxpayers \ndon't pay for tickets that were not used.\n\n  My bill would also provide that each agency Inspector General \nperiodically conduct risk assessments of agency purchase card and \ntravel card programs and perform periodic audits to identify \npotentially fraudulent, improper, and abusive use of cards. We have had \ngreat success working with Inspectors General using techniques like \ndata mining to reveal instances of improper use of government charge \ncards. Having this information on an ongoing basis will help maintain \nand strengthen a rigorous system of internal controls to prevent future \ninstances of waste, fraud, and abuse with government charge cards.\n  In addition, my bill requires penalties so that employees who abuse \ngovernment charge cards will not get away scot free. In fact, in cases \nof serious misuse or fraud, the bill provides that employees must be \ndismissed and suspected cases of fraud will also be referred to the \nappropriate U.S. Attorney for prosecution under federal anti-fraud \nlaws. It is essential that we send a clear message that misuse and \nfraudulent use of government credit cards will not be tolerated. The \nlack of consistency in the past in applying punishments to those caught \nabusing government charge cards has sent the wrong message and led to \nan environment where misuse of government charge cards is more likely. \nMy bill will change that.\n  The American people expect us to be good stewards of their money and \ntheir cynicism about government only builds when they read about \nbureaucrats saying, ``Just put it on plastic'' willy nilly with their \nhard earned dollars. Unfortunately, such incidents persist. In the wake \nof Hurricane Katrina, Congress hastily passed a supplemental spending \nbill containing an ill-advised provision to dramatically raise the \nmicro-purchase threshold for purchase cards. I worked with Senators \nCollins and Lieberman, the leaders of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, to reverse what amounted to an \ninvitation to misuse government purchase cards. Then, because of our \nconcerns and the concerns of other members of Congress about the \npotential for fraud and abuse of purchase cards in the response to the \nhurricanes in the Gulf Coast region, the GAO conducted an investigation \nof purchase cards at the Department of Homeland Security. Just last \nSeptember, the GAO issued its report finding instances of abusive or \nquestionable government charge card transactions, including the \npurchase of a beer brewing kit, a 63-inch plasma television with a \nprice tag of $8,000 that was found unused in its original box 6 months \nlater, and tens of thousands of dollars for training at golf and tennis \nresorts. Clearly the abuse of government credit cards remains a problem \nand Congress needs to act. My bill will establish the discipline needed \nin government agencies to keep those credit cards in the wallet unless \nneeded. I am particularly glad to be joined in introducing this bill by \nChairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins as well as Senator \nColeman. Their leadership on this issue will continue to be invaluable. \nI urge the rest of my colleagues to join us in this effort and put a \nstop to the bureaucratic shopping spree.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 789\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a collaborative program to protect the \nGreat Lakes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Great Lakes \nCollaboration Implementation Act'' with Senator George Voinovich and \nour co-sponsors. I also want to thank Representatives Vern Ehlers and \nRahm Emanuel for introducing similar Great Lakes restoration \nlegislation in the House today.\n  The Great Lakes are vital not only to Michigan, but to the Nation. \nRoughly one-tenth of the U.S. population lives in the Great Lakes basin \nand depends daily on the lakes. The Great Lakes provide drinking water \nto 40 million people. They provide the largest recreational resource \nfor their 8 neighboring States. They form the largest body of \nfreshwater in the world, containing roughly 18 percent of the world's \ntotal; only the polar ice caps contain more freshwater. They are \ncritical for our economy by helping move natural resources to the \nfactory and to move products to market.\n  While the environmental protections that were put in place in the \nearly 1970s have helped the Great Lakes make strides toward recovery, a \n2003 GAO report made clear that there is much work still to do. That \nreport stated: ``Despite early success in improving conditions in the \nGreat Lakes Basin, significant environmental challenges remain, \nincluding increased\n\n[[Page S2801]]\n\nthreats from invasive species and cleanup of areas contaminated with \ntoxic substances that pose human health threats.'' More recently, many \nscientists reported that the Great Lakes are exhibiting signs of stress \ndue to a combination of sources, including toxic contaminants, invasive \nspecies, nutrient loading, shoreline and upland land use changes, and \nhydrologic modifications. A 2005 report from a group of Great Lakes \nscientific experts states that ``historical sources of stress have \ncombined with new ones to reach a tipping point, the point at which \necosystem-level changes occur rapidly and unexpectedly, confounding the \ntraditional relationships between sources of stress and the expected \necosystem response.''\n  The zebra mussel, an aquatic invasive species, caused $3 billion in \neconomic damage to the Great Lakes from 1993 to 2003. In 2000, seven \npeople died after pathogens entered the Walkerton, Ontario drinking \nwater supply from the lakes. In May of 2004, more than ten billion \ngallons of raw sewage and storm water were dumped into the Great Lakes. \nIn that same year, over 1,850 beaches in the Great Lakes were closed. \nEach summer, Lake Erie develops a 6,300 square mile dead zone. There is \nno appreciable natural reproduction of lake trout in the lower four \nlakes. More than half of the Great Lakes region's original wetlands \nhave been lost, along with 60% of the forests. Wildlife habitat has \nbeen destroyed, thus diminishing opportunities necessary for fishing, \nhunting and other forms of outdoor recreation.\n  The Great Lakes problems have been well-known for several years, and, \nin 2005, 1,500 people through the Great Lakes region worked together to \ncompile recommendations for restoring the lakes. These recommendations \nwere released in December 2005, and, today, I am introducing this \nlegislation to implement many of those recommendations.\n  This bill would reduce the threat of new invasive species by enacting \ncomprehensive invasive species legislation and put ballast technology \non board ships; it specifically targets Asian carp by authorizing the \nimprovement, operation and maintenance of the dispersal barrier. The \nbill would improve fish and wildlife habitat by providing additional \nresources to States and cities for water infrastructure. It would \nprovide additional funding for contaminated sediment cleanup and would \ngive the EPA additional tools under the Great Lakes Legacy Act to move \nprojects along faster. The bill would create a new grant program to \nphase out mercury in products and to identify emerging contaminants. \nThe bill would authorize the restoration and remediation of our \nwaterfronts. It would authorize additional research through existing \nFederal programs as well as our non-federal research institutions. And \nit would authorize coordination of Federal programs.\n  The Great Lakes are a unique American treasure. We must recognize \nthat we are only their temporary stewards. If Congress does not act to \nkeep pace with the needs of the lakes, and the tens of millions of \nAmericans dependent upon them and affected by their condition, the \ncurrent problems will continue to build, and we may start to undo some \nof the good work that has already been done. We must be good stewards \nby ensuring that the Federal government meets its ongoing obligation to \nprotect and restore the Great Lakes. This legislation will help us meet \nthat great responsibility to future generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 793. A bill to provide for the expansion and improvement of \ntraumatic brain injury programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the Traumatic Brain Injury Act. It is my pleasure to be \njoined in this effort by the Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, \nLabor and Pension Committee, Senator Ted Kennedy, with whom I worked on \nthe original legislation over 10 years ago.\n  Sustaining a traumatic brain injury--or TBI--can be both catastrophic \nand devastating. The financial and emotional costs to the individual, \nfamily, and community are enormous. Traumatic brain injuries contribute \nto a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability \nannually.\n  Individuals with TBI and their families are often faced with \nchallenges, such as improper diagnosis, inability to access support or \nrehabilitation services, institutional segregation, unemployment, and \nbeing forced to navigate complicated and cumbersome service and support \nsystems.\n  Of the 1.4 million who sustain a TBI each year in the United States: \n50,000 die; 235,000 are hospitalized; and 1.1 million are treated and \nreleased from an emergency department. Brain injuries are the most \nfrequent reasons for visits to physicians and emergency rooms.\n  These statistics are more revealing when one considers that every 16 \nseconds someone in the U.S. sustains a head injury; and every 12 \nminutes, one of these people will die and another will become \npermanently disabled. Of those who survive, each year, an estimated \n80,000 to 90,000 people experience the onset of long-term disability \nassociated with a TBI. An additional 2,000 will exist in a persistent \nvegetative state.\n  Even more startling is the fact that brain injury kills more \nAmericans under the age of 34 than all other causes combined and has \nclaimed more lives since the turn of the century than all United States \nwars combined.\n  Recent publicity about brain injuries Americans have sustained in \nIraq points out that TBI is an everyday threat to our servicemen and \nservicewomen--68 percent of war veterans are returning home with \nsustained brain injuries. According to the Defense and Veterans Brain \nInjury Center, which serves active duty military, their dependents and \nveterans with TBI, traumatic brain injury is one of the leading causes \nof death and disability on today's battlefield. While not specifically \naddressed by this bill, the Federal TBI program helps to provide \nresources that supplement the networks which serve our returning \nsoldiers.\n  The distress of TBI is not limited to diagnosis. A survivor of a \nsevere brain injury typically faces 5 to 10 years of intensive services \nand estimated lifetime costs can exceed $4 million. Direct medical \ncosts and indirect costs such as lost productivity of TBI totaled an \nestimated $60 billion in the United States in 2000.\n  To recognize the large number of individuals and families struggling \nto access appropriate and community-based services, Senator Kennedy and \nI wrote the TBI Act of 1996, PL 104-166.\n  The TBI Act of 1996 launched an effort to conduct expanded studies \nand to establish innovative programs for TBI. It gave the Health \nResources and Services Administration (HRSA) authority to establish a \ngrant program for States to assist it in addressing the needs of \nindividuals with TBI and their families. It also delegated \nresponsibilities in the areas of research, prevention, and surveillance \nto the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (CDC), respectively.\n  Title XIII of the Children's Health Act of 2000, PL 106-310, \nreauthorized the programs of the TBI Act of 1996. This reauthorization \nalso added a provision on protection and advocacy, P, services for \nindividuals with TBI and their families by authorizing HRSA to make \ngrants to State P Systems.\n  The Traumatic Brain Injury Act is the only Federal legislation that \nspecifically addresses issues faced by 5.3 million American children \nand adults who live with a long-term disability as a result of \ntraumatic brain injury. Reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury \nAct will provide for the continuation of research, not only for the \ntreatment of TBI, but also for prevention and awareness programs which \nwill help decrease the occurrence of traumatic brain injury and improve \nthe long-term outcome.\n  This legislation authorizes the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, HRSA, to make grants for projects of national \nsignificance that improve individual and family access to service \nsystems; assist States in developing service capacity; improve \nmonitoring and evaluation of rehabilitation services and supports; and \naddress emerging needs of servicemen and women, veterans, and \nindividuals and families who have experienced\n\n[[Page S2802]]\n\nbrain injury through service delivery demonstration projects.\n  This bill also authorizes HRSA to include the American Indian \nConsortium as an eligible recipient of competitive grants awarded to \nStates, Territories, and the District of Columbia to develop \ncomprehensive system of services and supports nationwide.\n  Furthermore, this bill instructs HRSA and the Administration on \nDevelopmental Disabilities to coordinate data collection regarding \nprotection and advocacy services.\n  Also funded by the TBI program, the CDC supports multiple projects \nand programs, including those that monitor TBI, link people with TBI to \ninformation about services, and prevent TBI-related disabilities. These \nprojects comprise initiatives such as generating national estimates for \nTBI deaths, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits; planning \nthe future of TBI registries and data systems; and educating health \ncare professionals about TBI. In addition, the CDC funds TBI research \nin various academic institutions to investigate TBI in children and \nadolescents.\n  This year, Congress has an opportunity to strengthen the TBI Act by \nauthorizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, to \ndetermine the incidence and prevalence of traumatic brain injury in the \ngeneral population of the United States, including all age groups and \npersons in institutional settings such as nursing homes, correctional \nfacilities, psychiatric hospitals, child care facilities, and \nresidential institutes for people with developmental disabilities.\n  Brain injury is a complex issue and there is still much unknown. With \nFederal funds provided within the TBI program, researchers at the NIH \nare studying many issues related to the special cognitive and \ncommunication problems experienced by individuals who have traumatic \nbrain injuries. Scientists are designing new evaluation tools to assess \nthe special problems that children who have suffered traumatic brain \ninjuries encounter. Because the brain of a child is vastly different \nfrom the brain of an adult, scientists are also examining the effects \nof various treatment methods that have been developed specifically for \nchildren. In addition, research is examining the effects of some \nmedications on the recovery of speech, language, and cognitive \nabilities following traumatic brain injury. Reauthorization of the TBI \nprogram will enable this important research to continue and expand.\n  As I have mentioned, there is still a lot of unknown surrounding the \nissue of TBI; however, one aspect is definite, and that is that people \nare never the same after TBI. Not only are their lives forever changed, \nbut they must face these changes in a compromised state. The TBI \nprogram offers balanced and coordinated public policy in brain injury \nprevention, research, education, and community-based services and \nsupports for individuals living with traumatic brain injury and their \nfamilies.\n  Reauthorization of the Traumatic Brain Injury Act will further \nprovide mechanisms for the research, prevention, and treatment of TBI \nand the improvement of the quality of life for those Americans and \ntheir families who may sustain such a devastating disability. I ask my \ncolleagues' support in promptly reauthorizing the Traumatic Brain \nInjury Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 793\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it's a privilege to join with Senator \nHatch in introducing legislation to reauthorize the Traumatic Brain \nInjury Act. The reauthorization will expand assistance to the millions \nof adults and children in the nation who are facing serious problems \nbecause of brain injuries. Its provisions also have a major role in \nmeeting the critical needs facing many of our wounded soldiers \nreturning home from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The numbers tell the story. As of this month, almost 25,000 service \nmembers have been wounded in Iraq, and approximately two-thirds of the \ninjuries include brain injuries. Here at home, an extremely high number \nof children from birth to age 14 experience traumatic brain injuries--\napproximately 475,000 a year--and some of the most frequent injuries \nare among children under the age of five.\n  Soldiers and children--I cannot think of two more deserving groups of \npeople in our nation.\n  Reauthorization of the Act is essential to continue the availability \nof federal funds for traumatic brain injury programs. The bill \nreauthorizes grants that assist States, Territories, and the District \nof Columbia in establishing and expanding coordinated systems of \ncommunity-based services and supports for children and adults with such \ninjuries. It also extends the ability to apply for these grants to \nAmerican Indian Consortia.\n  When Congress approved the Traumatic Brain Injury Act as part of the \nChildren's Health Act of 2000, we had the foresight to establish a \nspecific provision called the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals \nwith Traumatic Brain Injury Program. This program has proved to be \nessential because individuals with traumatic brain injuries have an \narray of needs, including assistance in returning to work, finding a \nplace to live, obtaining supports and services such as attendant care \nand assistive technology, and obtaining appropriate mental health, \nsubstance abuse, and rehabilitation services.\n  Often these individuals--especially our returning veterans--must \nremain in extremely expensive institutions far longer than necessary, \nbecause the community-based supports and services they need are not \navailable. Such services can lead both to reduced government \nexpenditures and to increased productivity, independence and community \nintegration, but the advocates must possess special skills, and their \nwork is often time-intensive.\n  In addition, our legislation provides funds for CDC programs that \nprovide extremely important data gathering and information on injury \nprevention. In a time when both the Administration and Congress are \nsearching for programs that provide the right kind of ``bang for the \nfederal buck,'' an Institute of Medicine report last March showed that \nthe TBI programs work. The programs in the Act were funded for a total \nof only $12 million dollars last year, and yet their benefit is \nobvious. Clearly these programs should be reauthorized and the funding \nshould be increased. Although the reauthorization is for ``such sums as \nmay be necessary,'' we must do all we can to expand the appropriations \nin the years ahead in order to meet the urgent need for this \nassistance.\n  The IOM report called the current TBI programs an ``overall \nsuccess,'' stating that ``there is considerable value in providing . . \n. funding,'' and ``it is worrisome that the modestly budgeted HRSA TBI \nProgram continues to be vulnerable to budget cuts.'' As the study \nsuggests, this program must be continued and allowed to grow, so that \neach state has the resources necessary to maintain vital services and \nadvocacy for the estimated 5.3 million people currently living with \ndisabilities resulting from brain injury. When our wounded soldiers \nreturn to their communities, the services and supports they need must \nbe available.\n  The nation owes these deserving people--especially our service \nmembers and our children--the services and advocacy available under \nthese critical programs. I urge my colleagues to act quickly on this \nimportant reauthorization and enact this bipartisan bill as soon as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Salazar, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 795. A bill to assist aliens who have been lawfully admitted in \nbecoming citizens of the United States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Citizenship \nPromotion Act (CPA) of 2007 with my good\n\n[[Page S2804]]\n\nfriend Congressman Luis Gutierrez. In the Senate, we are joined by \nSenator Salazar, Senator Menendez, and Senator Bingaman. The CPA will \nencourage the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to \ncharge fees for services to legal immigrants that are fair and \nreasonable, and it would remove other potential bureaucratic barriers \nto the pursuit of citizenship.\n  Immigration policy remains one of the most contentious and divisive \nissues in our politics. And it is contentious and divisive because our \npolicies are full of mixed messages. We must state clearly what our \nimmigration policy should achieve--a legal, orderly, and secure \nimmigration system that values immigrants, recognizes our right to \ncontrol who enters our country, and promotes the legal pursuit of \ncitizenship.\n  Most recently, the unanimous declarations of our support for legal \nimmigrants has run head on into a USCIS proposal to dramatically \nincrease immigration application fees beyond the reach of many working \nclass legal immigrants. For a family of four that is working hard and \nlegally pursuing the American dream, the new fees could put citizenship \nout of reach for many immigrants. For a family of four, the new fees \nwould raise the cost of the application for citizenship by 80 percent \nto more than $2,400 dollars. And the fees for all other services will \nrise as well.\n  The Administration argues that people will pay any fee to become \nAmericans. For many people, that is true. But for others, the new fee \nwill send the message that they need only apply if they can afford it. \nIt sends the message that we measure character based on income.\n  Our government has never provided services based on what people are \nwilling to pay. That is why we are introducing the Citizenship \nPromotion Act to ensure that immigration application fees are both \nreasonable and fair and that the citizenship process itself respects \nthe individuality of each applicant.\n  For immigrants who choose to come to America and pursue citizenship, \nthere are numerous barriers. First, family, friends, and community are \nleft behind. The new communities they enter come with the challenge of \na new language, different social norms, and sometimes discrimination. \nAnd yet, every year, thousands of immigrants fully embrace the values \nand ideals that make us all Americans and unite us in our common \npursuit of a better, more democratic society.\n  The dues we charge legal immigrants for joining the American family, \nfrom application fees to naturalization tests to background checks are \nall necessary, but should not eliminate people on the basis of income, \nage, or ethnicity. Excessive fees, testing that asks trivial questions \nor is administered without consideration for the applicant's \ncircumstances, and background checks that take years to complete tell \nus more about ourselves than they do about those wishing to enter.\n\n  We believe that there are ways to help cushion the blow to immigrants \nfrom increased costs without hurting the agency. The CPA would make it \nclear to the USCIS that application fees do not need to fund all direct \nand indirect costs. We would maintain fees at their current levels and \nrequire that before raising fees any further, the agency report to \nCongress on its direct and indirect costs and how much in \nappropriations it would need to establish reasonable and fair fees.\n  In addition to ensuring that fees are fair, we want to make sure that \nother aspects of pursuing citizenship are fair as well. Our bill \nrequires that citizenship tests be administered with consideration for \nthe applicant, that the agency work with the FBI to move background \nchecks through the process more quickly, and that any new application \nprocedure make it possible for people without Internet access to \ncontinue submitting their applications on paper. The bill also creates \na new grant program to give community based organizations the resources \nnecessary to prepare and equip immigrants to become citizens.\n  Let's stop sending mixed messages. Let's work together and set \nimmigration fees at a level that are fair and consistent with our \ncommitment to being an open, democratic, and egalitarian society.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \n        Webb):\n  S. 797.

A bill to establish the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 \nBicentennial Commission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, in just five years, our Nation will \nobserve the bicentennial of a defining moment in our Nation's history--\nthe war of 1812. Sometimes referred to as America's ``Second War of \nIndependence,'' the War of 1812 played a critical role in shaping our \nnational heritage and identity. To ensure that this anniversary will be \ncommemorated properly and in a timely manner, I am today re-introducing \nlegislation to establish the Star Spangled Banner National Historic \nTrail and the Star-Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial \nCommission. Joining me in co-sponsoring one or more of these measures \nare my colleagues Senators Mikulski, Warner, Webb, Levin, and Clinton. \nI spoke during the 109th Congress about the significance of the War of \n1812, its impact on our Nation's history and culture and the rationale \nfor these two measures. I want to highlight some of those principal \npoints today.\n  The United States declared war on Britain in June 1812, after \nenduring years of naval blockades, trade restrictions with the European \ncontinent, and seizure of American ships and sailors in the ongoing war \nbetween Britain and France. With only a small army and practically no \nnavy, our young Nation was ill-prepared to face Britain--then the \nworld's preeminent naval power. By the summer of 1814 defeat seemed \ncertain, with the British combined land and sea invasion of the \nChesapeake region and the burning of the Capitol, the White House and \nmuch of the federal city. But in their attack on Baltimore, the British \nmet stiff resistance. American patriots successfully defended Fort \nMcHenry and the British invasion was repelled. It was during this \nbattle that Francis Scott Key witnessed our flag flying intact, despite \nthe continuous bombardment, and wrote the words which were to become \nour National Anthem. Today, many historians see the War of 1812 as the \ndefinitive end of the American Revolution--a war which preserved and \nstrengthened our democracy, brought America to the international stage, \nand helped forge our national identity through the symbols of the \nNational Anthem and the Star Spangled Banner.\n  To commemorate the historic events associated with the War of 1812, \neight years ago I joined with my predecessor, Senator Paul Sarbanes, in \nsponsoring legislation directing the National Park Service to conduct a \nstudy of the feasibility and desirability of designating the routes \nused by the British and Americans during the Chesapeake Campaign of the \nWar of 1812 as a National Historic Trail. That study was completed in \nMarch 2004 and recommended that the proposed Star Spangled Banner \nNational Historic Trail ``. . . be established by the Congress as a \nnational historic trail with commemorative recreation and driving \nroutes and water trails.'' The study found that the proposed series of \nland and water trails fully meet the eligibility criteria for \ndesignation as a National Historic Trail--they retain historic \nintegrity, are nationally significant, and have significant potential \nfor public recreational use and historic interpretation. The study \nrecommended that the trail be managed through a partnership between the \nNational Park Service, a trail organization and state and local \nauthorities and concluded that the costs of implementing the proposed \ntrail would be minimal. The study also recommended that the Congress''. \n. . establish a War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission to coordinate the \n200th anniversary of the War of 1812.''\n  The two pieces of legislation I am reintroducing today would \nimplement\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\nthese two recommendations of the National Park Service. The first \nmeasure would authorize the establishment of the Star Spangled Banner \nNational Historic Trail, an approximately 290-mile series of land and \nwater trails tracing the story of the only combined naval and land \nattack on the United States and the events leading up to the writing of \nthe Star Spangled Banner. Sites along the National Historic Trail would \nmark some of the most important events of the War of 1812 including \nbattles between the British Navy and the American Chesapeake Flotilla \nin St. Leonard's Creek in Calvert County; the British landing at \nBenedict; the Battle of Bladensburg; the burning of the Nation's \nCapitol, White House and Washington Navy Yard; the British naval feints \nup the Potomac River to Alexandria and on the upper Chesapeake Bay; the \nBattle of North Point; and the successful American defense of Fort \nMcHenry on September 14, 1814, which inspired the poem that became our \nNational Anthem. The second measure would authorize the establishment \nof a ``Star Spangled Banner and War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission'' \nto plan, coordinate and facilitate programs and other efforts to \ncommemorate the historic events associated with the War of 1812. Made \nup, in part, by citizens from the thirty states involved in the War, \nthe Commission is tasked with planning, encouraging, developing, \nexecuting and coordinating programs to ensure a suitable national \nobservance of the War of 1812. Both these measures were approved by the \nfull Senate during the 109th Congress, but unfortunately were not acted \nupon by the House Committees of jurisdiction.\n  With the bicentennial of the War of 1812 quickly approaching, it is \nvital that the Congress move swiftly to approve these measures and \nenable the proper commemoration of this important period in our \nnation's history. The legislation will help provide Americans and \nvisitors alike with a better understanding and appreciation of our \nheritage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the two measures I am \nintroducing be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the texts of the bills were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 797\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide individuals with disabilities and older Americans with equal \naccess to community-based attendant services and supports, and for \nother purposes, to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, Senator Specter and I, and others \nintroduce the Community Choice Act. This legislation is needed to truly \nbring people with disabilities into the mainstream of society and \nprovide equal opportunity for employment and community activities.\n  In order to work or live in their own homes, Americans with \ndisabilities and older Americans need access to community-based \nservices and supports. Unfortunately, under current Medicaid policy, \nthe deck is stacked in favor of living in an institutional setting. \nFederal law requires that States cover nursing home care in their \nMedicaid programs, but there is no similar requirement for attendant \nservices. The purpose of our bill is to level the playing field, and to \ngive eligible individuals equal access to the community- based services \nand supports that they need.\n  Although some States have already recognized the benefits of home and \ncommunity-based services, they are unevenly distributed and only reach \na small percentage of eligible individuals. Some States are now \nproviding the personal care optional benefit through their Medicaid \nprogram, but others do not.\n  Those left behind are often needlessly institutionalized because they \ncannot access community alternatives. The civil right of a person with \na disability to be integrated into their own community should not \ndepend on their address. In Olmstead v. L.C., the Supreme Court \nrecognized that needless institutionalization is a form of \ndiscrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act. We in \nCongress have a responsibility to help States meet their obligations \nunder Olmstead.\n  The Community Choice Act is designed to do just that, and to make the \npromise of the ADA a reality. It will help rebalance the current \nMedicaid long term care system, which spends a disproportionate amount \non institutional services. Today, almost two-thirds of Medicaid long \nterm care dollars are spent on institutional services, with only one-\nthird going to community-based care.\n  This current imbalance means that individuals do not have equal \naccess to community-based care throughout this country. An individual \nshould not have to move to another State in order to avoid needless \nsegregation. Nor should they have to move away from family and friends \nbecause their own choice is an institution.\n  Federal Medicaid policy should reflect the goals of the ADA that \nAmericans with disabilities should have equal opportunity, and the \nright to fully participate in their communities. No one should have to \nsacrifice their ability to participate because they need help getting \nout of the house in the morning or assistance with personal care or \nsome other basic service.\n  We have made some progress to date, as CMS has started to award Money \nFollows the Person demonstration grants. But that is only a start. \nTogether, that initiative and the Community Choice Act could \nsubstantially reform long term services in this country. With \nappropriate community-based services and supports, we can transform the \nlives of people with disabilities. They can live with family and \nfriends, not strangers. They can be the neighbor down the street, not \nthe person warehoused down the hall. This is not asking too much. This \nis the bare minimum that we should demand for every human being.\n  Community based services and supports allow people with disabilities \nto lead independent lives, have jobs, and participate in the community. \nSome will become taxpayers, some will get an education, and some will \nparticipate in recreational and civic activities. But all will \nexperience a chance to make their own choices and to govern their own \nlives.\n  The Community Choice Act will open the door to full participation by \npeople with disabilities in our workplaces, our economy, and our \nAmerican Dream and I urge all my colleagues to support us on this \nissue. I want to thank Senator Specter for his leadership on this issue \nand his commitment to improving access to home and community-based \nservices for people with disabilities. I would also like to thank \nSenators Kennedy, Inouye, Salazar, Biden, Lieberman, Clinton, Schumer, \nand Dodd for joining me in this important initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 799\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Long-term services and supports provided under the \n     Medicaid program established under title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) must meet the ability \n     and life choices of individuals with disabilities and older \n     Americans, including the choice to live in one's own home or \n     with one's own family and to become a productive member of \n     the community.\n       (2) Research on the provision of long-term services and \n     supports under the Medicaid program (conducted by and on \n     behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services) has \n     revealed a significant funding and programmatic bias toward \n     institutional care. Only about 37 percent of long-term care \n     funds expended under the Medicaid program, and only about \n     12.5 percent of all funds expended under that program, pay \n     for services and supports in home and community-based \n     settings.\n       (3) In the case of Medicaid beneficiaries who need long-\n     term care, the only long-term care service currently \n     guaranteed by Federal law in every State are services related \n     to nursing home care. Only 30 States have adopted the benefit \n     option of providing personal care services under the Medicaid \n     program. Although every State has chosen to provide certain \n     services under home and community-based waivers, these \n     services are unevenly available within and across States, and \n     reach a small percentage of eligible individuals. In fiscal \n     year 2003, only 7 States spent 50 percent or more of their \n     Medicaid long-term care funds under the Medicaid program on \n     home and community-based care. Individuals with the most \n     significant disabilities are usually afforded the least \n     amount of choice, despite advances in medical and assistive \n     technologies and related areas.\n       (4) Despite the more limited funding for community \n     services, the majority of individuals who use Medicaid long-\n     term services and supports are in the community, indicating \n     that community services is a more cost effective alternative \n     to institutional care.\n       (5) The goals of the Nation properly include providing \n     families of children with disabilities, working-age adults \n     with disabilities, and older Americans with--\n       (A) a meaningful choice of receiving long-term services and \n     supports in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \n     individual's needs;\n       (B) the greatest possible control over the services \n     received and, therefore, their own lives and futures; and\n       (C) quality services that maximize independence in the home \n     and community, including in the workplace.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To reform the Medicaid program established under title \n     XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) to \n     provide services in the most integrated setting appropriate \n     to the individual's needs, and to provide equal access to \n     community-based attendant services and supports in order to \n     assist individuals in achieving equal opportunity, full \n     participation, independent living, and economic self-\n     sufficiency.\n       (2) To provide financial assistance to States as they \n     reform their long-term care systems to provide comprehensive \n     statewide long-term services and supports, including \n     community-based attendant services and supports that provide \n     consumer choice and direction, in the most integrated setting \n     appropriate.\n       (3) To assist States in meeting the growing demand for \n     community-based attendant services and supports, as the \n     Nation's population ages and individuals with disabilities \n     live longer.\n       (4) To assist States in addressing the decision of the \n     Supreme Court in Olmstead v. L.C., (527 U.S. 581 (1999)) and \n     implementing the integration mandate of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act.\n\n            TITLE I--ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICAID PLAN BENEFIT\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to designate a United States courthouse located in \nFresno, California, as the ``Robert E. Coyle United States \nCourthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce legislation \nto name the Federal courthouse building at Tulare and ``O'' Streets in \ndowntown Fresno, CA the ``Robert E. Coyle United States Courthouse.''\n  It is fitting that the Federal courthouse in Fresno be named for \nretired U.S. District Judge Robert E. Coyle, who is greatly respected \nand admired for his work as a judge and for his foresight and \npersistence that contributed so much to the Fresno Courthouse project. \nJudge Coyle has been a leader in the effort to build the courthouse in \nFresno for more than a decade. Indeed, he personally supervised this \nproject. He was often seen with his hard hat in hand, walking from his \nchambers to the new building to meet project staff.\n  Judge Coyle, working with the Clerk of the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District, conceived and founded a program called \n``Managing a Capitol Construction Program'' to help others understand \nthe process of having a courthouse built. This Eastern District program \nwas so well received by national court administrators that it is now a \nnationwide program run by Judge Coyle.\n  In addition to meeting the needs of the court for additional space, \nthe courthouse project has become a key element in the downtown \nrevitalization of Fresno. Judge Coyle's efforts, and those in the \ncommunity with whom he has worked, produced a major milestone when the \nbuilding was occupied in January of 2006.\n\n[[Page S2812]]\n\n  Judge Coyle has had a distinguished career as an attorney and on the \nbench. Appointed to California's Eastern District bench by President \nRonald Reagan in 1982, Judge Coyle has served as a judge for the \nEastern District for 20 years, including 6 years as senior judge. Judge \nCoyle earned his law degree from the University of California, Hastings \nCollege of the Law in 1956. He then worked for Fresno County as a \nDeputy District Attorney before going into private practice in 1958 \nwith McCormick, Barstow, Sheppard, Coyle & Wayte, where he remained \nuntil his appointment by President Reagan.\n  Judge Coyle is very active in the community and has served in many \njudicial leadership positions, including: chair of the Space and \nSecurity Committee; chair of the Conference of the Chief District \nJudges of the Ninth Circuit; president of the Ninth Circuit District \nJudges Association; Member of the Board of Governors of the State Bar \nof California; and president of the Fresno County Bar.\n  My hope is that, in addition to serving the people of the Eastern \nDistrict as a courthouse, this building will stand as a reminder to the \ncommunity and people of California of the dedicated work of Judge \nRobert E. Coyle.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 802. A bill to provide for the implementation of the Owyhee \nInitiative Agreement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Owyhee \nInitiative Implementation Act of 2007, a bill which is the result of a \nfive-year collaborative effort between all levels of government, \nmultiple users of public lands, and conservationists to resolve decades \nof heated land-use conflict in the Owyhee Canyonlands in the \nsouthwestern part of my home State of Idaho.\n  This is comprehensive land management legislation that enjoys far-\nreaching support among a remarkably diverse group of interests that \nlive work and play in this special country.\n  Owyhee County contains some of the most unique and beautiful \ncanyonlands in the world and offers large areas in which all of us can \nenjoy the grandeur and experience of untouched western trails, rivers, \nand open sky. It is truly magical country, and its natural beauty and \ntraditional uses should be preserved for future generations. Owyhee \nCounty is traditional ranching country. Seventy-three percent of its \nland base is owned by the United States, and it is located within an \nhour's drive of one of the fastest growing areas in the nation, Boise, \nID.\n  This combination of attributes, including location, is having an \nexplosive effect on property values, community expansion and \ndevelopment and ever-increasing demands on public land. Given this \nconfluence of circumstances and events, Owyhee County has been at the \ncore of decades of conflict with heated political and regulatory \nbattles. The diverse land uses co-exist in an area of intense beauty \nand unique character. The conflict over land management is both \ninevitable and understandable--how do we manage for this diversity and \ndo so in a way that protects and restores the quality of that fragile \nenvironment?\n  In this context, the Owyhee County Commissioners and several others \nsaid ``enough is enough'' and decided to focus efforts on solving these \nproblems rather than wasting resources on an endless fight. In 2001, \nThe Owyhee County Commissioners, Hal Tolmie, Dick Reynolds, and Chris \nSalove, met with me and asked for my help. They asked whether I would \nsupport them if they could put together, at one table, the interested \nparties involved in the future of the County to try and reach some \nsolutions. I told them that if they could get together a broad base of \ninterests who would agree to collaborate in a process committed to \nproblem-solving, I would dedicate myself to working with them and if \nthey were successful, I would introduce resulting legislation. They \nagreed. Together, we set out on a six-year journey on a road that is as \nchallenging as any in the Owyhee Canyonlands. Sharp turns, steep \ninclines and declines, big sharp rocks, deep ruts, sand burrs, dust and \na constant headwind is exactly what those of us who have worked so hard \non this have faced every day.\n\n  This is very difficult work and in speaking of difficult work, I want \nto acknowledge the effort of my friend and colleague from Idaho, \nRepresentative Mike Simpson, and the challenge he has taken on as he \nadvocates his Central Idaho Economic Development Act. I support his \nwork and his legislation.\n  The Commissioners appointed a Chairman, an extraordinary gentleman, \nFred Grant. They formed the Work Group which included The Wilderness \nSociety, Idaho Conservation League, The Nature Conservancy, Idaho \nOutfitters and Guides, the United States Air Force, the Sierra Club, \nthe county Soil Conservation Districts, Owyhee Cattleman's Association, \nthe Owyhee Borderlands Trust, People for the Owyhees, and the Shoshone \nPaiute Tribes to join in their efforts. All accepted, and work on this \nbill began. As this collaborative process gained momentum, the County \nCommissioners expanded the Work Group to include the South Idaho Desert \nRacing Association, Idaho Rivers United and the Owyhee County Farm \nBureau. Very recently, the Commissioners have further expanded the \neffort to include the Foundation for North American Wild Sheep and the \nIdaho Backcountry Horsemen.\n  The Commissioners also requested that the Idaho State Department of \nLands and the Bureau of Land Management to serve and those agencies \nhave provided important support.\n  This unique group of people chose to work without a professional \nfacilitator, preferring instead to deal with differences face-to-face \nand together create new ideas. For me, one of the most gratifying and \nemotional outcomes has been to see this group transform itself from \npolarized camps into an extraordinary force that has become known for \nits intense effort, comity, trust and willingness to work toward a \nsolution.\n  They operated on a true consensus basis, only making decisions when \nthere was no voiced objection to a proposal. They involved everyone who \nwanted to participate in the process and spent hundreds of hours \ndiscussing their findings, modifying preliminary proposals and \nultimately reaching consensus solutions. They have driven thousands of \nmiles inspecting roads and trails, listening to and soliciting ideas \nfrom people from all walks of life who have in common deep roots and \ndeep interest in the Owyhee Canyonlands. They sought to ensure that \nthey had a thorough understanding of the issues and could take proper \nadvantage of the insights and experience of all these people.\n  While this whole process and its outcomes are indeed remarkable, one \nof the more notable developments is the Memorandum of Agreement between \nthe Shoshone Paiute Tribes and the County that establishes government-\nto-government cooperation in several areas of mutual interest. I want \nto particularly note the efforts and support of Mr. Terry Gibson, \nChairman of the Shoshone Paiute Tribes, a great leader and a personal \nfriend.\n  All of these individuals and organizations have asked that I seek \nSenate approval of their collaborative effort, built from the ground up \nto chart their path forward.\n  The Owyhee Initiative transforms conflict and uncertainty into \nconflict resolution and assurance of future activity. Ranchers can plan \nfor subsequent generations. Off-road vehicle users have access assured. \nWilderness is established. The Shoshone-Paiute Tribe knows its cultural \nresources will be protected. The Air Force will continue to train its \npilots. Local, State and Federal government agencies will have \nstructure to assist their joint management of the region. And this will \nall happen within the context of the preservation of environmental and \necological health. This is indeed a revolutionary land management \nstructure--and one that looks ahead to the future.\n  Principle features of the legislation include: development, funding \nand implementation of a landscape-scale program to review, recommend \nand coordinate landscape conservation and research projects; scientific \nreview process to assist the Bureau of Land Management; designation of \nWilderness and Wild and Scenic Rivers; release of Wilderness Study \nAreas; protections of tribal cultural and historical resources against \nintentional and\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\nunintentional abuse and desecration; development and implementation by \nthe BLM of travel plans for public lands; and a board of directors with \noversight over the administration and implementation of the Owyhee \nInitiative.\n  This can't be called ranching bill, or a wilderness bill, or an Air \nForce bill, or a Tribal bill. It is a comprehensive land management \nbill. Each interest got enough to enthusiastically support the final \nproduct, advocate for its enactment, and, most importantly, support the \nobjectives of those with whom they had previous conflict.\n  Opposition will come from a few principal sources: those who simply \ndon't want to have wilderness designated; those who don't want \nlivestock anywhere on public land; and, those who do not want to see \ncollaboration succeed. While I respect that opposition, I prefer to \nmove forward in an effort that manages conflict and land, rather than \nexploit disagreements.\n  The status quo is unacceptable. The Owyhee Canyonlands and its \ninhabitants, including its people, deserve to have a process of \nconflict management and a path to sustainability. The need for this \npath forward is particularly acute given that this area is an hour's \ndrive from one of the Nation's most rapidly-growing communities. The \nOwyhee Initiative protects water rights, releases wilderness study \nareas and protects traditional uses.\n  I commend the commitment and leadership of all involved. We have \nestablished a longterm, comprehensive management approach. It's been an \nhonor for me to work with so many fine people and I will do everything \nin my power to turn this into law.\n  The Owyhee Initiative sets a standard for managing and resolving \ndifficult land management issues in our country. After all, what better \nplace to forge an historical change in our approach to public land \nmanagement, than in this magnificent land that symbolizes livelihood, \nheritage, diversity, opportunity and renewal?\n  And with that, I would like to recognize and thank the people who \nhave been the real driving force behind this process: Fred Grant, \nChairman of the Owyhee Initiative Work Group, his assistant Staci \nGrant, and Dr. Ted Hoffman, Sheriff Gary Aman, the Owyhee County \nCommissioners: Hal Tolmie, Chris Salova, & Dick Reynolds and Chairman \nTerry Gibson of the Shoshone Paiute Tribes. I am grateful to Governor \nJim Risch of the Great State of Idaho for all of his support. Thanks \nto: Colonel Rock of the United States Air Force at Mountain Home Air \nForce Base, Craig Gherke and John McCarthy of The Wilderness Society, \nRick Johnson & John Robison of the Idaho Conservation League, Inez Jaca \nrepresenting Owyhee County, Dr. Chad Gibson representing the Owyhee \nCattleman's Association, Brenda Richards representing private property \nowners in Owyhee County, Cindy & Frank Bachman representing the Soil \nConservation Districts in Owyhee County, Marcia Argust with the \nCampaign for America's Wilderness, Grant Simmons of the Idaho \nOutfitters and Guides Association, Bill Sedivy with Idaho Rivers \nUnited, Tim Lowry of the Owyhee County Farm Bureau, Bill Walsh \nrepresenting Southern Idaho Desert Racing Association, Lou Lunte and \nWill Whelan of the Nature Conservancy for all of their hard work and \ndedication. I'd also like to thank the Idaho Back Country Horseman, the \nFoundation for North American Wild Sheep, Roger Singer of the Sierra \nClub, the South Board of Control and the Owyhee Project managers, and \nall the other water rights holders who support me today. This process \ntruly benefited from the diversity of these groups and their \nwillingness to cooperate to reach a common goal of protecting the land \non which they live, work, and play.\n  The Owyhee Canyonlands and its inhabitants are truly a treasure of \nIdaho and the United States; I hope you will join me in ensuring their \nfuture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                 S. 802\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal a provision enacted to end Federal matching \nof State spending of child support incentive payments; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKFELLER. Mr. President, today I am proud to join with \nbipartisan colleagues, Senators Cornyn, Kohl, Snowe, and Coleman, to \ntry to increase investments in the successful Child Support Enforcement \nprogram.\n  Our Federal child support enforcement is an extraordirary program. In \n2005, the program collected $23 billion to serve 16 million children \nand families, with a Federal investment of only approximately $4 \nbillion. For every dollar invested in this Program, there is a return \nof $4.58. This program is a real bargain.\n  Child support enforcement is a program that deserves more investment \nbecause it works, and because it provides long term support for \nchildren. The historic welfare reform of 1996 changed Federal \nassistance to families with children to a temporary program that only \nprovides 60 months of support. Currently 3.4 million children are \ncotered by welfare reform. Child support serves more children, and \nhelps to ensure that their parents provide support until the age of 18. \nThis program is essential for families, and it promotes our fundamental \nvalue of parental responsibility.\n  As part of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2006, new limits were imposed \non Federal incentive funds to prohibit the match. While this provision \nsaved almost $3 billion, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \nestimated that children and families would loose $8.3 billion. That is \na bad deal.\n  Our bill is designed to fix this problem and continue to invest in a \nprogram that has been proven to work so well for our children and \nfamilies. In my personal view, it is better to encourage families to \nrely on child support from their parents first.\n  In the past, my State of West Virginia has used its incentive \npayments and matching funding to support computers and staff \ninvestments. According to our West Virginia Bureau, prior to incentive \nfunding, the agency had 18 percent to 20 percent staff turnover. But \nwith incentive funding, staff turnover has been reduced to 10 percent \nand West Virginia collections are up to $180 million. This is very good \nfor my State.\n  I believe this bipartisan bill will be a good deal for child support \nenforcement, our children and families, and our States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, three letters of support and the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record. I truly appreciate the support of \nNational Conference of State Legislatures, The National Child Support \nEnforcement Association, and the joint support of advocacy groups of \nCenter for Law and Social Policy, the National Women's Law Center and \nthe Coalition on Human Needs.\n  There being no objection, the letters and bill were ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Conference\n\n\n                                        of State Legislatures,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2007.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Rockefeller, Cornyn, Kohl, Snowe, and \n     Coleman: NCSL strongly supports your legislation repealing \n     the provision in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 that \n     prohibits states from using child support incentive funds to \n     match federal funds for the program. When this action was \n     taken, the Congressional Budget Office identified the cut as \n     an intergovernmental mandate that exceeds the threshold of \n     the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act.\n\n[[Page S2818]]\n\n       States have used incentive funds to draw down federal funds \n     used for integral parts of the child support enforcement \n     program. The funds have allowed states to establish and \n     enforce child support obligations, obtain health care \n     coverage for children, and link low-income fathers to job \n     programs. The cut ignored the fact that funds for child \n     support enforcement are used effectively and responsibly. In \n     fact, the child support enforcement program received a \n     Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) rating of \n     ``effective,'' and continues to be one of the highest rated \n     block or formula grants of all federal programs.\n       Consistent child support helps save children from being \n     raised in poverty. Reductions in child support administrative \n     funds inevitably lead to lower child support collections, \n     leaving families less able to achieve self-sufficiency.\n       State legislators applaud your efforts to undo this ill-\n     considered action of the previous Congress. We urge the 110th \n     Congress to adopt your bill. Please have your staff contact \n     Sheri Steisel or Lee Posey for further information or \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sandy Rosenberg,\n       Delegate, Maryland, Chairman, NCSL Human Services and \n     Welfare Committee.\n     Leticia Van de Putte,\n       Senator, Texas, President, NCSL.\n     Donna Stone,\n       Representative, Delaware, President Elect, NCSL.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Child Support\n\n\n                                      Enforcement Association,\n\n                                                    March 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Jay Rockefeller,\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     Hon. Norm Coleman.\n       Dear Senators: I am sending this letter on behalf of the \n     National Child Support Enforcement Association (NCSEA) in \n     strong support of your bill to restore the authority for \n     states to use performance incentives as match for federal \n     funds for the child support enforcement program.\n       NCSEA is a nonprofit, membership organization representing \n     the child support community--a workforce of over 60,000. \n     NCSEA's mission is to promote the well-being of children \n     through professional development of its membership, advocacy \n     and public awareness. NCSEA's membership includes line/\n     managerial/executive child support staff; state and local \n     agencies; judges; court masters; hearing officers; government \n     and private attorneys; social workers; advocates; \n     corporations that partner with government to provide child \n     support services and private collection firms.\n       The child support enforcement program operates in all \n     states as provided by Title IV-D of the federal Social \n     Security Act. The program enjoys healthy partnerships with \n     the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement, and a large \n     and varied group of stakeholders. Courts and law enforcement \n     officials carry out many of the day to day functions; \n     employers collect almost 80% of child support through income \n     withholding, hospitals assist with paternity acknowledgment, \n     and other state and local agencies provide enforcement \n     services and related services to assist obligors in finding \n     and maintaining employment. We share a common mission that is \n     reflected in the program's National Strategic Plan:\n\n       To enhance the well-being of children by assuring that \n     assistance in obtaining support, including financial and \n     medical, is available to children through locating parents, \n     establishing paternity, establishing support obligations, and \n     monitoring and enforcing those obligations.\n\n       One of the unique features of the child support enforcement \n     program is that unlike government public assistance programs, \n     it has a major interstate component, and requires close \n     collaboration among the states to provide services on behalf \n     of children whose parents live in different states. In \n     today's mobile society, strong interstate collaboration and \n     comparable levels of service across state lines are \n     essential. Collectively, the program provides services on \n     behalf of over 17 million children--representing nearly one \n     quarter of the nation's children. If one or more states do \n     not have the resources to operate effective programs, there \n     are repercussions across the entire network of states in the \n     child support system. The bottom line is that some of the \n     children who depend upon the program will fall through the \n     cracks.\n       We are proud of the accomplishments of the program, but are \n     continually striving to do more. The program is cost \n     effective, goal oriented, and accountable for results. It has \n     received recognition from the highest levels of government at \n     the federal, state, and local levels. One of these was an OMS \n     Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) score of 90 percent, \n     representing the highest rating among all social services and \n     block grant/formula programs.\n       The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171), passed by \n     a closely divided Congressional vote, made major cuts to \n     child support funding, including eliminating the purposeful \n     federal match on incentive payments, reducing the match rate \n     for paternity testing, and imposing a collection fee on \n     parents. States were required to implement the collection of \n     the fee in October 2007 unless legislation was required. The \n     first two provisions are effective on October 1, 2008, unless \n     reversed by Congress.\n       States and child support organizations have been working \n     hard to address these drastic funding reductions, and with \n     all honesty, the plans that are being made are not good for \n     the families served by this nationally recognized program. \n     Our members report that vital services may be eliminated or \n     substantially reduced as budgets and staffing are cut. \n     Important to the effectiveness of the program is the ability \n     to take action quickly to establish paternity and an \n     obligation to support. States report that early intervention \n     results in more regular support payments and more involvement \n     of the father in the life of the child. Just as importantly, \n     close monitoring and on-ongoing enforcement are vital to the \n     regular receipt of child support payments. This close \n     monitoring and interaction with the obligor ensures that \n     those parents who need assistance in finding and maintaining \n     employment are helped.\n       As states lose resources, they will be less able to timely \n     perform ``core'' functions such as paternity establishment, \n     order establishment, enforcement and distribution of \n     payments. The progress the program has made toward improved \n     performance will be jeopardized. In addition, states will \n     have to make tough choices, perhaps sacrificing customer \n     service, outreach to incarcerated parents, and fatherhood \n     programs in favor of funding only the ``essential'' service \n     areas.\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that child \n     support collections would be reduced by $8.4 billion as a \n     result of the federal cuts contained in the Deficit Reduction \n     Act. (The actual number may be higher based on new scoring \n     from the CBO.) CBO assumed that states would make up half of \n     the funding gap resulting from federal cuts to the program. \n     While states are working to secure adequate funding for the \n     program, as of today no state has had a budget increase \n     approved by its state legislature. Twenty-three (23) states \n     have not yet made a request for additional funding. Many \n     state budgets are so tight that a request for additional \n     funding is not feasible. It is also important to keep in mind \n     that even if additional state funding is approved during the \n     current budget cycle, it does not guarantee adequate funding \n     in the future.\n       As the Congress works to address needs of America's \n     families both in the federal budget and in other funding \n     authorization bills, we urge you to consider the needs for \n     strong and fair child support enforcement. Children who don't \n     receive regular financial support from both parents are \n     disadvantaged in a number of ways. Children need the \n     resources provided by child support payments from parents to \n     compete in our complex society. Parents need access to a \n     child support system that determines equitable child support \n     awards, monitors and enforces obligations, and transfers \n     payments from the obligor to custodial parent quickly. State \n     and local child support agencies have a successful history of \n     performing these important tasks, doubling their child \n     support collection rates since Congress enacted the 1996 \n     welfare reform legislation. Taxpayers are well served by a \n     strong child support program that increases family self-\n     sufficiency and decreases dependence on public assistance.\n       Your interest in the child support program and commitment \n     to the families served by the state and local programs is \n     once again evidenced with your sponsorship of this critical \n     funding bill. The child support program has long enjoyed \n     strong bi-partisan support and we are most pleased to see \n     that support clearly shown in your sponsorship.\n       Please consider NCSEA as a resource to you and to your \n     colleagues and staff as you proceed with this legislation. We \n     stand ready to provide you details on what we do, how our \n     members use federal funds, the impact of funding reductions, \n     our efforts to improve the quality of our services to \n     families, and any other information you need to make an \n     informed decision.\n       Thank you for your advocacy on behalf of children and \n     families served by this important program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Mary Ann Wellbank,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Women's Law Center,\n\n                             Center for Law and Social Policy,\n\n                                     Coalition on Human Needs,\n\n                                                    March 7, 2007.\n     Hon. Jay Rockefeller,\n     Hon. John Cornyn,\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     Hon. Norm Coleman.\n       Dear Senators: The National Women's Law Center, Center for \n     Law and Social Policy, and Coalition on Human Needs, \n     organizations that have worked for years to strengthen child \n     support enforcement, strongly support your bill to restore \n     funding for child support enforcement to ensure that children \n     continue to receive the support they deserve from both their \n     parents.\n       The federal-state child support enforcement program \n     provides services to over 17 million children. In FY 2005, it \n     collected $23 billion in child support from noncustodial \n     parents at a total cost of $5 billion to the federal and \n     state governments: $4.58 in collections for every $1 \n     invested, making it highly cost-effective. All families in \n     need of child support enforcement services are eligible, but \n     most of the families that rely on the\n\n[[Page S2819]]\n\n     program are low- and moderate-income families. Families that \n     formerly received public assistance make up nearly half (46 \n     percent) of the caseload; current recipients represent 16 \n     percent of the caseload.\n       Child support helps families escape poverty, provide for \n     their children's needs, and avoid a return to welfare. But \n     the cuts to child support enforcement funding included in \n     last year's Deficit Reduction Act will significantly reduce \n     child support collections for families and impede paternity \n     establishment, as states and counties reduce staff, forgo \n     computer upgrades, and abandon promising initiatives. Last \n     year, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that $8.4 \n     billion in child support will go uncollected over the next 10 \n     years.\n       Your bill would protect child support enforcement services \n     by restoring the federal match for incentive funds that \n     states reinvest in the child support program. This match is a \n     key part of the results-based incentive payment system, \n     overhauled by the Child Support Performance Incentive Act \n     (CSPIA) of 1998, that has given states the incentives--and \n     the resources--to dramatically improve their child support \n     programs. Over the past 10 years, child support collection \n     rates have doubled, and the program has been strengthened on \n     a nationwide basis, thanks to the implementation of child \n     support reforms enacted by Congress as part of the 1996 \n     welfare reform law.\n       On a bipartisan basis, Congress has enacted significant \n     reforms to child support enforcement that are making a real \n     difference in children's lives. Your bill would prevent this \n     progress from unraveling.\n       We thank you for your leadership on behalf of children and \n     families.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joan Entmacher,\n       Vice President, Family Economic Security, National Women's \n     Law Center.\n     Vicki Turetsky,\n       Senior Staff Attorney, Center for Law and Social Policy.\n     Debbie Weinstein,\n       Executive Director, Coalition on Human Needs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 803\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Support Protection Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF PROVISION ENACTED TO END FEDERAL MATCHING \n                   OF STATE SPENDING OF CHILD SUPPORT INCENTIVE \n                   PAYMENTS.\n\n       Section 7309 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Public \n     Law 109-171, 120 Stat. 147) is repealed.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Child Support \nProtection Act of 2007 so State child support enforcement agencies may \ncontinue the extraordinary progress and cost-effectiveness they have \ndeveloped in child support collections in recent years.\n  This legislation is necessary to avoid a reversal in the dramatic \nimprovements in the child support program's performance over the past \ndecade. Without it, many families may be forced back into the welfare \ncaseload.\n  Child support enforcement reduces reliance on Medicaid, Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF), and other social service \nprograms. Effective enforcement enables former welfare families, and \nworking families with modest incomes, to receive this important source \nof supplemental income and gain the self-sufficiency to avoid having to \ndraw on government resources through public assistance programs. In \nfact, over 1 million Americans were lifted out of poverty through the \nchild support program in 2002.\n  In 2004, collections nationwide totaled $21.9 billion, while total \nprogram costs were $5.3 billion. For every $1 spent in child support \nenforcement, $4.38 is collected for children who need it. Because of \nthis rate of return, the President's budget continually rates the \nprogram as ``one of the highest rated block/formula grants of all \nreviewed programs government-wide. This high rating is due to its \nstrong mission, effective management, and demonstration of measurable \nprogress toward meeting annual and long term performance measures.''\n  In particular, the Texas child support program has made significant \nstrides over the past seven years in collections, performance, and \nefficiency, all of which will be seriously undermined without this \nvital legislation.\n  I speak with authority on this matter. During my tenure as Attorney \nGeneral of Texas, the Child Support Division made dramatic increases in \ncollections from deadbeat parents, and the office continues to bring in \nrecord collections each year. Texas now ranks second in the Nation in \ntotal collections--with collections in Fiscal Year 2006 surpassing $2 \nbillion--a figure that has doubled since Fiscal Year 2000.\n  This outstanding performance has earned the program the second \nhighest Federal performance incentive award for the past 3 years. \nBecause the Texas program has achieved that level of performance, the \nprohibition on using incentive payments to draw down matching Federal \nfunds for program expenditures will have a much greater impact on Texas \nthan on the 48 other States ranked below it. The loss of the match on \nincentive payments effectively punishes Texas's success. Unless we pass \nthis legislation, the Child Support Division in the Office of the Texas \nAttorney General will face a dramatic reduction in federal financial \nparticipation and may be forced to close many offices throughout the \nState.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the following letter \nfrom the National Child Support Enforcement Association supporting this \nlegislation.\n  I look forward to this bill's consideration in the future.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            National Child Support\n\n\n                                      Enforcement Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2007.\n     Hon.

Norm Coleman.\n       Dear Senators: I am sending this letter on behalf of the \n     National Child Support Enforcement Association (NCSEA) in \n     strong support of your bill to restore the authority for \n     states to use performance incentives as match for federal \n     funds for the child support enforcement program.\n       NCSEA is a nonprofit, membership organization representing \n     the child support community--a workforce of over 60,000. \n     NCSEA's mission is to promote the well-being of children \n     through professional development of its membership, advocacy \n     and public awareness. NCSEA's membership includes line/\n     managerial/executive child support staff; state and local \n     agencies; judges; court masters; hearing officers; government \n     and private attorneys; social workers; advocates; \n     corporations that partner with government to provide child \n     support services and private collection firms.\n       The child support enforcement program operates in all \n     states as provided by Title IV-D of the federal Social \n     Security Act. The program enjoys healthy partnerships with \n     the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement, and a large \n     and varied group of stakeholders. Courts and law enforcement \n     officials carry out many of the day to day functions; \n     employers collect almost 80 percent of child support through \n     income withholding, hospitals assist with paternity \n     acknowledgment, and other state and local agencies provide \n     enforcement services and related services to assist obligors \n     in finding and maintaining employment. We share a common \n     mission that is reflected in the program's National Strategic \n     Plan:\n       To enhance the well-being of children by assuring that \n     assistance in obtaining support, including financial and \n     medical, is available to children through locating parents, \n     establishing paternity, establishing support obligations, and \n     monitoring and enforcing those obligations.\n       One of the unique features of the child support enforcement \n     program is that unlike government public assistance programs, \n     it has a major interstate component, and requires close \n     collaboration among the states to provide services on behalf \n     of children whose parents live in different states. In \n     today's mobile society, strong interstate collaboration and \n     comparable levels of service across state lines are \n     essential. Collectively, the program provides services on \n     behalf of over 17 million children--representing nearly one \n     quarter of the nation's children. If one or more states do \n     not have the resources to operate effective programs, there \n     are repercussions across the entire network of states in the \n     child support system. The bottom line is that some of the \n     children who depend upon the program will fall through the \n     cracks.\n       We are proud of the accomplishments of the program, but are \n     continually striving to do more. The program is cost \n     effective, goal oriented, and accountable for results. It has \n     received recognition from the highest levels of government at \n     the federal, state, and local levels. One of these was an OMS \n     Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) score of 90 percent, \n     representing the highest rating among all social services and \n     block grant/formula programs.\n\n[[Page S2820]]\n\n       The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-171), passed by \n     a closely divided Congressional vote, made major cuts to \n     child support funding, including eliminating the purposeful \n     federal match on incentive payments, reducing the match rate \n     for paternity testing, and imposing a collection fee on \n     parents. States were required to implement the collection of \n     the fee in October 2007 unless legislation was required. The \n     first two provisions are effective on October 1, 2008, unless \n     reversed by Congress\n       States and child support organizations have been working \n     hard to address these drastic funding reductions, and with \n     all honesty, the plans that are being made are not good for \n     the families served by this nationally recognized program. \n     Our members report that vital services may be eliminated or \n     substantially reduced as budgets and staffing are cut \n     Important to the effectiveness of the program is the ability \n     to take action quickly to establish paternity and an \n     obligation to support. States report that early intervention \n     results in more regular support payments and more involvement \n     of the father in the life of the child. Just as importantly, \n     close monitoring and on-ongoing enforcement are vital to the \n     regular receipt of child support payments. This close \n     monitoring and interaction with the obligor ensures that \n     those parents who need assistance in finding and maintaining \n     employment are helped.\n       As states lose resources, they will be less able to timely \n     perform ``core'' functions such as paternity establishment, \n     order establishment, enforcement and distribution of \n     payments. The progress the program has made toward improved \n     performance will be jeopardized. In addition, states will \n     have to make tough choices, perhaps sacrificing customer \n     service, outreach to incarcerated parents, and fatherhood \n     programs in favor of funding only the ``essential'' service \n     areas.\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that child \n     support collections would be reduced by $8.4 billion as a \n     result of the federal cuts contained in the Deficit Reduction \n     Act. (The actual number may be higher based on new scoring \n     from the CBO.) CBO assumed that states would make up half of \n     the funding gap resulting from federal cuts to the program. \n     While states are working to secure adequate funding for the \n     program, as of today no state has had a budget increase \n     approved by its state legislature. Twenty-three (23) states \n     have not yet made a request for additional funding. Many \n     state budgets are so tight that a request for additional \n     funding is not feasible. It is also important to keep in mind \n     that even if additional state funding is approved during the \n     current budget cycle, it does not guarantee adequate funding \n     in the future.\n       As the Congress works to address needs of America's \n     families both in the federal budget and in other funding \n     authorization bills, we urge you to consider the needs for \n     strong and fair child support enforcement. Children who don't \n     receive regular financial support from both parents are \n     disadvantaged in a number of ways. Children need the \n     resources provided by child support payments from parents to \n     compete in our complex society. Parents need access to a \n     child support system that determines equitable child support \n     awards, monitors and enforces obligations, and transfers \n     payments from the obligor to custodial parent quickly. State \n     and local child support agencies have a successful history of \n     performing these important tasks, doubling their child \n     support collection rates since Congress enacted the 1996 \n     welfare reform legislation. Taxpayers are well served by a \n     strong child support program that increases family self-\n     sufficiency and decreases dependence on public assistance.\n       Your interest in the child support program and commitment \n     to the families served by the state and local programs is \n     once again evidenced with your sponsorship of this critical \n     funding bill. The child support program has long enjoyed \n     strong bi-partisan support and we are most pleased to see \n     that support clearly shown in your sponsorship.\n       Please consider NCSEA as a resource to you and to your \n     colleagues and staff as you proceed with this legislation. We \n     stand ready to provide you details on what we do, how our \n     members use federal funds, the impact of funding reductions, \n     our efforts to improve the quality of our services to \n     families, and any other information you need to make an \n     informed decision.\n       Thank you for your advocacy on behalf of children and \n     families served by this important program.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Mary Ann Wellbank,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. In Congress, we rarely have the opportunity to consider a \nsimple, straightforward issue. It is uncommon when we can debate an \nissue with significant bipartisan support; one that the Senate has a \nstrong record on. And it seems exceptional when we are able to show our \nsupport for a Federal program that really works.\n  But the legislation my colleagues and I are introducing today gives \nus that rare opportunity. Our legislation restores cuts to the child \nsupport enforcement program. The program helps States collect support \nthat is owed to hardworking, single parent families. It is one of the \nmost effective Federal programs, collecting more than $4 in child \nsupport for every dollar spent. And the Senate already has a strong \nrecord in support of the child support enforcement program, with 76 \nSenators voting for a resolution that rejected cuts to the program.\n  Which is why I was so disappointed when conferees included in the \nDeficit Reduction Act a provision to prevent, States from receiving \nFederal matching funds on incentive payments. While the scope of this \nprovision may have seemed narrow to the conferees, the impact has been \nfelt throughout the country. And my State of Wisconsin has felt it more \nthan most--as a high-performing State, Wisconsin stands to lose more \nFederal funding than a State with a poorer enforcement record. Congress \nshould not send the message to States that they will be penalized for \nsuccess--but that's exactly what the child support funding cuts did.\n  I fought against the Deficit Reduction Act, because I knew these cuts \nwould hurt Wisconsin families. The impact has been clear. The cuts are \nso damaging--and the program so important--that one Wisconsin community \nhas decided to hold a raffle, to raise funds for their child support \nenforcement program. I have heard from child support directors who will \nbe forced by budget cuts to fire staff. And I have heard from scared \nconstituents who are owed child support that they worry they will never \nsee.\n  That is why I am proud to join Senators Rockefeller, Cornyn, Snowe \nand Coleman in introducing this legislation. By repealing the DRA cuts, \nwe help our States, our counties--and most importantly--we help those \nconstituents relying on child support payments.\n  I urge my colleagues to take this rare opportunity--to do what's \nsimple, to support the Senate's record, and to vote in favor of a \nprogram with proven success at helping our nation's children.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 805. A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to assist \ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa in the effort to achieve \ninternationally recognized goals in the treatment and prevention of \nHIV/AIDS and other major diseases and the reduction of maternal and \nchild mortality by improving human health care capacity and improving \nretention of medical health professionals in sub-Saharan Africa, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 805\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``African Health Capacity \n     Investment Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``HIV/AIDS'' has the meaning given \n     such term in section 104A(g) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b-2(g)).\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The World Health Report, 2003, Shaping the Future, \n     states, ``The most critical issue facing health care systems \n     is the shortage of people who make them work.''.\n       (2) The World Health Report, 2006, Working Together for \n     Health, states, ``The unmistakable imperative is to \n     strengthen the workforce so that health systems can tackle \n     crippling diseases and achieve national and global health \n     goals. A strong human infrastructure is fundamental to \n     closing today's gap between health promise and health reality \n     and anticipating the health challenges of the 21st \n     century.''.\n       (3) The shortage of health personnel, including doctors, \n     nurses, pharmacists, counselors, laboratory staff, \n     paraprofessionals, and trained lay workers is one of the \n     leading obstacles to fighting HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (4) The HIV/AIDS pandemic aggravates the shortage of health \n     workers through loss of life and illness among medical staff, \n     unsafe working conditions for medical personnel, and \n     increased workloads for diminished staff, while the shortage \n     of health personnel undermines efforts to prevent and provide \n     care and treatment for those with HIV/AIDS.\n       (5) Workforce constraints and inefficient management are \n     limiting factors in the treatment of tuberculosis, which \n     infects over \\1/3\\ of the global population.\n       (6) Over 1,200,000 people die of malaria each year. More \n     than 75 percent of these deaths\n\n[[Page S2821]]\n\n     occur among African children under the age of 5 years old and \n     the vast majority of these deaths are preventable. The \n     Malaria Initiative of President George W. Bush seeks to \n     reduce dramatically the disease burden of malaria through \n     both prevention and treatment. Paraprofessionals and \n     community healthworkers can be instrumental in reducing \n     mortality and economic losses associated with malaria and \n     other health problems.\n       (7) For a woman in sub-Saharan Africa, the lifetime risk of \n     maternal death is 1 out of 16. In highly developed countries, \n     that risk is 1 out of 2,800. Increasing access to skilled \n     birth attendants and access to emergency obstetrical care is \n     essential to reducing maternal and newborn mortality in sub-\n     Saharan Africa.\n       (8) The Second Annual Report to Congress on the progress of \n     the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief identifies the \n     strengthening of essential health care systems through health \n     care networks and infrastructure development as critical to \n     the sustainability of funded assistance by the United States \n     Government and states that ``outside resources for HIV/AIDS \n     and other development efforts must be focused on \n     transformational initiatives that are owned by host \n     nations''. This report further states, ``Alongside efforts to \n     support community capacity-building, enhancing the capacity \n     of health care and other systems is also crucial for \n     sustainability. Among the obstacles to these efforts in many \n     nations are inadequate human resources and capacity, limited \n     institutional capacity, and systemic weaknesses in areas such \n     as: quality assurance; financial management and accounting; \n     health networks and infrastructure; and commodity \n     distribution and control.''.\n       (9) Vertical disease control programs represent vital \n     components of United States foreign assistance policy, but \n     human resources for health planning and management often \n     demands a more systematic approach.\n       (10) Implementation of capacity-building initiatives to \n     promote more effective human resources management and \n     development may require an extended horizon to produce \n     measurable results, but such efforts are critical to \n     fulfillment of many internationally recognized objectives in \n     global health.\n       (11) The November 2005 report of the Working Group on \n     Global Health Partnerships for the High Level Forum on the \n     Health Millennium Development Goals entitled ``Best Practice \n     Principles for Global Health Partnership Activities at \n     Country Level'', raises the concern that the collective \n     impact of various global health programs now risks \n     ``undermining the sustainability of national development \n     plans, distorting national priorities, diverting scarce human \n     resources and/or establishing uncoordinated service delivery \n     structures'' in developing countries. This risk underscores \n     the need to coordinate international donor efforts for these \n     vital programs with one another and with recipient countries.\n       (12) The emigration of significant numbers of trained \n     health care professionals from sub-Saharan African countries \n     to the United States and other wealthier countries \n     exacerbates often severe shortages of health care workers, \n     undermines economic development efforts, and undercuts \n     national and international efforts to improve access to \n     essential health services in the region.\n       (13) Addressing this problem, commonly referred to as \n     ``brain drain'', will require increased investments in the \n     health sector by sub-Saharan African governments and by \n     international partners seeking to promote economic \n     development and improve health care and mortality outcomes in \n     the region.\n       (14) Virtually every country in the world, including the \n     United States, is experiencing a shortage of health workers. \n     The Joint Learning Initiative on Human Resources for Health \n     and Development estimates that the global shortage exceeds \n     4,000,000 workers. Shortages in sub-Saharan Africa, however, \n     are far more acute than in any other region of the world. The \n     World Health Report, 2006, states that ``[t]he exodus of \n     skilled professionals in the midst of so much unmet health \n     need places Africa at the epicentre of the global health \n     workforce crisis.''.\n       (15) Ambassador Randall Tobias, now the Director of United \n     States Foreign Assistance and Administrator of the United \n     States Agency for International Development, has stated that \n     there are more Ethiopian trained doctors practicing in \n     Chicago than in Ethiopia.\n       (16) According to the United Nations Development Programme, \n     Human Development Report 2003, approximately 3 out of 4 \n     countries in sub-Saharan Africa have fewer than 20 physicians \n     per 100,000 people, the minimum ratio recommended by the \n     World Health Organization, and 13 countries have 5 or fewer \n     physicians per 100,000 people.\n       (17) Nurses play particularly important roles in sub-\n     Saharan African health care systems, but approximately \\1/4\\ \n     of sub-Saharan African countries have fewer than 50 nurses \n     per 100,000 people or less than \\1/2\\ the staffing levels \n     recommended by the World Health Organization.\n       (18) Paraprofessionals and community health workers can be \n     trained more quickly than nurses or doctors and are \n     critically needed in sub-Saharan Africa to meet immediate \n     health care needs.\n       (19) Imbalances in the distribution of countries' health \n     workforces represents a global problem, but the impact is \n     particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (20) In Malawi, for example, more than 95 percent of \n     clinical officers are in urban health facilities, and about \n     25 percent of nurses and 50 percent of physicians are in the \n     4 central hospitals of Malawi. Yet the population of Malawi \n     is estimated to be 87 percent rural.\n       (21) In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, such as Kenya, \n     thousands of qualified health professionals are employed \n     outside the health care field or are unemployed despite job \n     openings in the health sector in rural areas because poor \n     working and living conditions, including poor educational \n     opportunities for children, transportation, and salaries, \n     make such openings unattractive to candidates.\n       (22) The 2002 National Security Strategy of the United \n     States stated, ``The scale of the public health crisis in \n     poor countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by \n     epidemics and pandemics like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and \n     tuberculosis, growth and development will be threatened until \n     these scourges can be contained. Resources from the developed \n     world are necessary but will be effective only with honest \n     governance, which supports prevention programs and provides \n     effective local infrastructure.''.\n       (23) Public health deficiencies in sub-Saharan Africa and \n     other parts of the developing world reduce global capacities \n     to detect and respond to potential crises, such as an avian \n     flu pandemic.\n       (24) On September 28, 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza \n     Rice declared that ``HIV/AIDS is not only a human tragedy of \n     enormous magnitude; it is also a threat to the stability of \n     entire countries and to the entire regions of the world.''.\n       (25) Foreign assistance by the United States that expands \n     local capacities, provides commodities or training, or builds \n     on and enhances community-based and national programs and \n     leadership can increase the impact, efficiency, and \n     sustainability of funded efforts by the United States.\n       (26) African health care professionals immigrate to the \n     United States for the same set of reasons that have led \n     millions of people to come to this country, including the \n     desire for freedom, for economic opportunity, and for a \n     better life for themselves and their children, and the rights \n     and motivations of these individuals must be respected.\n       (27) Helping countries in sub-Saharan Africa increase \n     salaries and benefits of health care professionals, improve \n     working conditions, including the adoption of universal \n     precautions against workplace infection, improve management \n     of health care systems and institutions, increase the \n     capacity of health training institutions, and expand \n     education opportunities will alleviate some of the pressures \n     driving the migration of health care personnel from sub-\n     Saharan Africa.\n       (28) While the scope of the problem of dire shortfalls of \n     personnel and inadequacies of infrastructure in the sub-\n     Saharan African health systems is immense, effective and \n     targeted interventions to improve working conditions, \n     management, and productivity would yield significant \n     dividends in improved health care.\n       (29) Failure to address the shortage of health care \n     professionals and paraprofessionals, and the factors pushing \n     individuals to leave sub-Saharan Africa will undermine the \n     objectives of United States development policy and will \n     subvert opportunities to achieve internationally recognized \n     goals for the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS and other \n     diseases, in the reduction of child and maternal mortality, \n     and for economic growth and development in sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should help sub-Saharan African \n     countries that have not already done so to develop national \n     human resource plans within the context of comprehensive \n     country health plans involving a wide range of stakeholders;\n       (2) comprehensive, rather than piecemeal approaches to \n     advance multiple sustainable interventions will better enable \n     countries to plan for the number of health care workers they \n     need, determine whether they need to reorganize their health \n     workforce, integrate workforce planning into an overall \n     strategy to improve health system performance and impact, \n     better budget for health care spending, and improve the \n     delivery of health services in rural and other underserved \n     areas;\n       (3) in order to promote systemic, sustainable change, the \n     United States should seek, where possible, to strengthen \n     existing national systems in sub-Saharan African countries to \n     improve national capacities in areas including fiscal \n     management, training, recruiting and retention of health \n     workers, distribution of resources, attention to rural areas, \n     and education;\n       (4) because foreign-funded efforts to fight HIV/AIDS and \n     other diseases may also draw health personnel away from the \n     public sector in sub-Saharan African countries, the policies \n     and programs of the United States should, where practicable, \n     seek to work with national and community-based health \n     structures and seek to promote the general welfare and \n     enhance infrastructures beyond the scope of a single disease \n     or condition;\n       (5) paraprofessionals and community-level health workers \n     can play a key role in prevention, care, and treatment \n     services, and in the more equitable and effective \n     distribution of health resources, and should be integrated \n     into national health systems;\n       (6) given the current personnel shortages in sub-Saharan \n     Africa, paraprofessionals and community health workers \n     represent a critical potential workforce in efforts to reduce\n\n[[Page S2822]]\n\n     the burdens of malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and other \n     deadly and debilitating diseases;\n       (7) it is critically important that the governments of sub-\n     Saharan African countries increase their own investments in \n     education and health care;\n       (8) international financial institutions have an important \n     role to play in the achievement of internationally agreed \n     upon health goals, and in helping countries strike the \n     appropriate balance in encouraging effective public \n     investments in the health and education sectors, particularly \n     as foreign assistance in these areas scales up, and promoting \n     macroeconomic stability;\n       (9) public-private partnerships are needed to promote \n     creative contracts, investments in sub-Saharan African \n     educational systems, codes of conduct related to recruiting, \n     and other mechanisms to alleviate the adverse impacts on sub-\n     Saharan African countries caused by the migration of health \n     professionals;\n       (10) colleges and universities of the United States, as \n     well as other members of the private sector, can play a \n     significant role in promoting training in medicine and public \n     health in sub-Saharan Africa by establishing or supporting \n     in-country programs in sub-Saharan Africa through twinning \n     programs with educational institutions in sub-Saharan Africa \n     or through other in-country mechanisms;\n       (11) given the substantial numbers of African immigrants to \n     the United States working in the health sector, the United \n     States should enact and implement measures to permit \n     qualified aliens and their family members that are legally \n     present in the United States to work temporarily as health \n     care professionals in developing countries or in other \n     emergency situations, as in S. 2611, of the 109th Congress, \n     as passed by the Senate on May 25, 2006;\n       (12) the President, acting through the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations, should \n     exercise the voice and vote of the United States--\n       (A) to ameliorate the adverse impact on less developed \n     countries of the migration of health personnel;\n       (B) to promote voluntary codes of conduct for recruiters of \n     health personnel; and\n       (C) to promote respect for voluntary agreements in which \n     individuals, in exchange for individual educational \n     assistance, have agreed either to work in the health field in \n     their home countries for a given period of time or to repay \n     such assistance;\n       (13) the United States, like countries in other parts of \n     the world, is experiencing a shortage of medical personnel in \n     many occupational specialties, and the shortage is \n     particularly acute in rural and other underserved areas of \n     the country; and\n       (14) the United States should expand training opportunities \n     for health personnel, expand incentive programs such as \n     student loan forgiveness for people of the United States \n     willing to work in underserved areas, and take other steps to \n     increase the number of health personnel in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 5.

to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 95\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew \n     heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient \n     Greece in forming a representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821 that ``it is in your land that \n     liberty has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we \n     shall imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if \n     we succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas, during World War II, Greece played a major role in \n     the struggle to protect freedom and democracy by bravely \n     fighting the historic Battle of Crete, giving the Axis powers \n     their first major setback in the land war and setting off a \n     chain of events that significantly affected the outcome of \n     World War II;\n       Whereas Greece paid a high price for defending the common \n     values of Greece and the United States in the deaths of \n     hundreds of thousands of Greek civilians during World War II;\n       Whereas, throughout the 20th century, Greece was 1 of only \n     3 countries in the world, outside the former British Empire, \n     that allied with the United States in every major \n     international conflict;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush, in recognizing Greek \n     Independence Day in 2002, said, ``Greece and America have \n     been firm allies in the great struggles for liberty. . . . \n     Americans will always remember Greek heroism and Greek \n     sacrifice for the sake of freedom. . . . [and a]s the 21st \n     century dawns, Greece and America once again stand united; \n     this time in the fight against terrorism. . . . The United \n     States deeply appreciates the role Greece is playing in the \n     war against terror. . . .

which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __ INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Openness to international students, scholars, \n     scientists, and exchange visitors serves vital and \n     longstanding national foreign policy, educational, and \n     economic interests.\n       (2) The real and perceived erosion of such openness \n     undermines the national security interests of the United \n     States.\n       (3) The report of the National Commission on Terrorist \n     Attacks Upon the United States recommended: ``The United \n     States should rebuild the scholarship, exchange, and library \n     programs that reach out to young people and offer them \n     knowledge and hope.''.\n       (4) The Government Accountability Office convened a forum \n     in September 2006 to discuss concerns whether the United \n     States will be able to ``attract an appropriate share of \n     talented international students to its universities and to \n     its workforce,'' in which participants ``identified real and \n     perceived barriers created by U.S. immigration policy.''.\n       (5) Increased marketing by countries such as Great Britain \n     and Australia give rise to concerns that the United States \n     has lost market share with regard to international students. \n     The European Union has set forth a comprehensive strategy to \n     be the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy \n     in the world by 2010, and part of this strategy is aimed at \n     enhancing economic competitiveness by making the European \n     Union the most favorable destination for students, scholars, \n     and researchers from other regions of the world.\n       (6) International students studying in the United States \n     and their families contribute more than $13,000,000,000 to \n     the United States economy each year, making higher education \n     a major service sector export.\n       (b) Driver's Licenses for International Students and \n     Exchange Visitors.--Section 202(c)(2)(C) of the REAL ID Act \n     of 2005 is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(v) Provisions for nonimmigrants monitored under sevis.--\n     With respect to nonimmigrants subject to the monitoring \n     system required under section 641 of the Illegal Immigration \n     Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. \n     1372)--\n\n       ``(I) notwithstanding clause (ii), a temporary driver's \n     license or temporary identification card issued under this \n     subparagraph shall be valid for the shorter of--\n\n       ``(aa) the period during which the applicant is authorized \n     to remain in the United States;

and\n       (D) permit a language training program established after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, which is not \n     accredited under subparagraph (A), to qualify as an \n     accredited language training program under such section \n     101(a)(15)(F)(i) during the 2-year period beginning on the \n     date on which such program is established.\n       (d) Countering Visa Fraud.--The Secretary of State shall--\n       (1) require United States consular offices, particularly \n     consular offices in countries from which large numbers of \n     international students and exchange visitors depart for study \n     in the United States, to submit to the Secretary plans for \n     countering visa fraud that respond to the particular fraud-\n     related problems in such countries;

and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) by the Secretary of State if the Secretary has \n     provided for expedited visa review because the alien is--\n       ``(i) a frequent visitor to the United States, who--\n\n       ``(I) has a history of visa approvals;\n       ``(II) has provided biometric data;

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 100) designating the week beginning \n     March 12, 2007, as ``National Safe Place Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Craig and 14 \nof my colleagues in support of a resolution designating the week of \nMarch 12 through 17, 2007, as National Safe Place Week.\n  This resolution recognizes the participating businesses, community \norganizations, youth service agencies, and volunteers that are part of \nthe YMCA National Safe Place Program and work for the safety and well \nbeing of at-risk youth.\n  Youth today face a growing amount of pressure in their daily lives at \nschool, at home, and in the community. For some youth, problems include \nabuse or neglect at home, drug or alcohol addictions of family members \nand friends, trouble at school or dangerous situations on a date.\n  Young people who face these serious situations should not feel left \nalone and should have a place to go to in their community.\n  Over the past 24 years, the National Safe Place Program has provided \nimmediate help to more than 200,000 youth in crisis at nearly 16,000 \nSafe Place locations and with counseling by phone.\n  This important program is currently operated by 140 agencies serving \n700 communities in 40 States--bringing together the private and public \nsector to reach out and help at-risk youth who might be neglected, \nabused, threatened or in unsafe situations.\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n\n  In my home State of California, there are nine designated Safe Place \nprograms with 1,738 Safe Place sites located in over 65 communities \nwhich have served more than 5,000 youth.\n  National Safe Place sites include fast food restaurants, convenience \nstores, fire stations, schools, libraries, office buildings or even a \ncity bus and are marked by large, yellow Safe Place signs displayed \nprominently in front windows.\n  In Fresno, CA, for example, city buses are all designated as Safe \nPlaces.\n  Any youth can walk into a Safe Place site and receive immediate help \nfrom a trained volunteer, and further help from a Safe Place staff \nperson who can provide counseling, residential assistance or \nprofessional referrals, as needed.\n  The National Safe Place Week recognizes the commitment, resources, \nand energy of thousands of businesses, community organizations and \nvolunteers who make this effective, growing network of support for \nyouth possible. In addition, it seeks to increase awareness of the \ncrises that youth face today.\n  I am encouraged by the National Safe Place Program's positive impact \non communities throughout the Nation, and I hope that more communities \nwill choose to participate in this innovative program.\n  The National Safe Place Program brings us closer to making our \ncountry safe for youth, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 100\n\n       Whereas the youths of the United States will be the future \n     bearers of the bright torch of democracy;\n       Whereas youths need a safe haven from various negative \n     influences, such as child abuse, substance abuse, and crime, \n     and youths need to have resources readily available to assist \n     them when faced with circumstances that compromise their \n     safety;\n       Whereas the United States needs increased numbers of \n     community volunteers acting as positive influences on the \n     youths of the Nation;\n       Whereas the Safe Place program is committed to protecting \n     the youths of the United States, the Nation's most valuable \n     asset, by offering short term safe places at neighborhood \n     locations where trained volunteers are available to counsel \n     and advise young people seeking assistance and guidance;\n       Whereas the Safe Place program combines the efforts of the \n     private sector and nonprofit organizations to reach young \n     people in the early stages of crisis;\n       Whereas the Safe Place program provides a direct way to \n     assist programs in meeting performance standards relative to \n     outreach and community relations, as set forth in the Runaway \n     and Homeless Youth Act (42 U.S.C. 5701 et seq.);\n       Whereas the Safe Place placard displayed at businesses \n     within communities stands as a beacon of safety and refuge to \n     at-risk youths;\n       Whereas more than 700 communities in 40 States make the \n     Safe Place program available at nearly 16,000 locations;\n       Whereas more than 200,000 youths have gone to Safe Place \n     locations to get help when faced with crisis situations and \n     have received counseling by phone as a result of Safe Place \n     information the youths received at school;\n       Whereas, through the efforts of Safe Place coordinators \n     across the United States, each year more than 500,000 \n     students learn in a classroom presentation that the Safe \n     Place program is a resource they can turn to if they \n     encounter an abusive or neglectful situation, and 1,000,000 \n     Safe Place information cards are distributed; and\n       Whereas increased awareness of the Safe Place program will \n     encourage more communities to establish Safe Place locations \n     for the youths of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of March 12 through March 18, 2007, \n     as ``National Safe Place Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to--\n       (A) promote awareness of, and volunteer involvement in, the \n     Safe Place program; and\n       (B) observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/07/senate-section/article/S2850-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 8, 2007\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will be in a situation where we \ncan continue to work on, of course, S. 4. I indicated to the \ndistinguished Republican leader yesterday that I am not certain but I \nthink I can get consent as to the cloture motion which was filed by the \nRepublicans earlier today, that we would be happy to vote on that \ntomorrow sometime. We would also be willing to vote on the two I just \nfiled. If that does not happen, of course, we will be in a situation \nwhere we will have a cloture vote on Friday.\n  As I told everyone here early this week, the first cloture motion \nwhich we will vote on will be the one the Republicans filed. If cloture \nis not invoked, we will immediately move to the cloture motions I \nfiled. There will be 30 hours in relation to that cloture motion if \ncloture is invoked and, of course, that time won't run out until \nsometime Saturday.\n  So it is really up to the minority as to what they want to do. We are \nwilling to move it up 1 day or do it on Friday, whatever is their \ninterest. Remember, 30 hours would not run out until sometime Saturday \nnight. If we voted at, say, 10 a.m. Friday morning, 30 hours would run \nout sometime Saturday afternoon, 4 p.m. or thereabouts. If that, in \nfact, were the case and cloture were invoked and there are some germane \namendments postcloture, we could dispose of those on Friday.\n  Anyway, we are in a situation where it appears that unless the \nminority decides to allow us to have those votes on Thursday, we would \nbe in session Friday for a good part of the day and maybe going into \nSaturday unless we work something out.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield for \nan observation, I think we have made pretty good progress on getting \namendments disposed of. Hopefully, we can do more of that tomorrow. I \nthink both sides have been operating in good faith, and we will \nconsider tomorrow what other possibilities there might be.\n  I think I can speak for the majority on this side in saying that we \ncertainly look forward to wrapping up this bill in the near future. \nThere are a few other amendments we would like to have considered, and \nthose discussions are ongoing between my staff and the majority \nleader's staff.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say this: The Republican leader is \nabsolutely right, and we have tried real hard on some nongermane \namendments to get some votes. It is not all their fault. We have, on \nour side, a Senator or two who simply will not let us agree to votes on \nnongermane amendments because they say and have said for the last 2 \ndays: You gave a vote on theirs; why don't I get a vote on mine. So we \nhave agreed to.\n  As I explained to some Senators assembled here in the well earlier \ntoday, when we moved to this bill, I said it would be open for \namendment, and it has been, and there is no way we can get out of \ngermane amendments. We can invoke cloture, but they are still \navailable.\n\n[[Page S2851]]\n\n  On the nongermane amendments, you run into problems like we have run \ninto in these last couple of days. There are some really big issues \npeople are objecting to and not allowing these other amendments to be \nheard unless they get theirs. We have this habeas corpus issue, and \nthere has been all kinds of talk on that. That is okay, from my \nperspective, but we have spent a lot of time on that issue before. We \nhave over on this side something dealing with Katrina about which \nSenator Landrieu feels very strongly. We have a Senator over here who \nis interested in the PATRIOT Act and changing that. It goes back and \nforth, with both sides having all kinds of things they want, but it is \nan open process.\n  Now, the one thing that maybe we can do in the future to make things \na little more orderly is have an open amendment process. But when an \namendment is called, we have to dispose of that. What we have tried to \ndo here is have people come and give their statements about amendments \nthey want to offer, and we have allowed them to offer them. What \nhappens is you get too many amendments stacked up, and it gives \nindividual Senators, frankly, too much power because they hold \neverybody else hostage.\n  So I think what we are going to do in the future--and I will discuss \nthis in more detail with the distinguished Republican leader--is have \nopen amendments but not allow these amendments to be stacked up. By \ndoing it the way we have done it here, trying to be more open, it takes \naway a lot of the authority of the two managers because the authority \non these bills floats to individual Senators because they have all \nthese amendments and they want to offer them, which I have no problem \nwith, but they won't allow other people to have votes on their \namendments unless they get amendments.\n  This legislative process is the art of compromise and trying to work \nthings out. Quite frankly, during the last couple of days, we have had \nSenators on both sides who have been very uncompromising, and it has \nmade it very difficult for the managers and I would think Senator \nMcConnell and myself.\n  Having said that, I appreciate all the problems we have here. \nRemember, for 220 years, this has been the U.S. Senate. It is a \nwonderful institution. Sometimes, however, it can be very consternating \nto work things through, but we will get it done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/03/07/senate-section/article/S2851-1", "month": "03", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
