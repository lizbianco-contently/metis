Madam President, this morning the Senate will be in a \nperiod of morning business for an hour, the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders. Republicans will control the first \nhalf and the majority controls the final 30 minutes.\n  The reason we did not go immediately to the bill at this time is \nthere is a very important markup taking place in the Finance Committee \ndealing with the Energy bill, particularly the tax portions of the \nEnergy bill. It is my understanding that Senators Boxer and Grassley, \nwith other members of the committee, have worked out a bipartisan \nmeasure they will bring to the floor as an amendment in the immediate \nfuture and it will be done today.\n  Once morning business closes, the Senate will then immediately resume \nconsideration of the Energy bill about which I referred. Under our \norder of yesterday, the Senate will debate the Bunning and Tester \namendments for a total of 2\\1/2\\ hours.\n\n\n                           order of procedure\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time for debate for these two \namendments this morning be equally divided and controlled as previously \nordered until 1 p.m., and that the Senate then recess until 2:15; that \nat 2:15, the remaining debate time also be equally divided and \ncontrolled, with the other provisions of the previous order remaining \nin effect.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. The agreement just entered now delays the conference recess \nperiod until 1 p.m. Following disposition of those two amendments this \nafternoon, the Senate will then debate three more amendments with the \ntotal debate time up to 90 minutes. Votes on these amendments will \noccur upon the use or yielding back of that time, so Members should \nexpect two votes around 3 to 3:15, and then three more votes around \n5:30.\n  I have conferred in detail with the distinguished Republican leader \ngoing over the schedule. I have told Democratic Senators, and I will \nrepeat this at the caucus, we have a lot to accomplish before this work \nperiod ends. We have to complete the energy legislation, we have to \ncomplete work on the immigration bill, and we have to start defense \nauthorization in some manner, recognizing that we will not have a lot \nof time on that.\n  It is up to the individual Senators as to how much time we take. If \nall time is used--as I said, I have gone over this in detail with the \nRepublican leader and our staffs--we will not be able to finish until \nSaturday, a week from this Saturday, sometime in the evening. That \nwould mean we would have to be in session this weekend. Maybe we have \nsome people who may not object to one or two things. That being the \ncase, we may not have to be in on Sunday this week. But everyone should \nunderstand, we have a lot of important votes. We have people running \nfor President on both sides of the aisle. They should plan on being \nhere, because their votes could make the difference. The energy \nlegislation is extremely important. There are three issues that are the \nmain focus of this\n\n[[Page S7838]]\n\nlegislation, by the business community, the environmental community, \nand the press. That is coal to liquids--that matter is going to be \nresolved this afternoon, hopefully; CAFE, which hopefully will be \nresolved in the next 24 hours; and then we have the renewable portfolio \nstandards we are always working on. We hope we can get that done in \nsome manner. There are other important amendments, but I mentioned the \ntop three. We have what we have to complete prior to the July 4 recess. \nIt is up to us how much time we take. If we happen to finish this \nconglomeration of legislation earlier, it would be to the good of the \norder, but if we aren't able to do that, we are going to have to stay \nhere, which would be sometime Saturday evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7838-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 1639\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, it is my understanding that at some \npoint in time in the near future we will have a bill brought to the \nfloor known as the Employee Free Choice Act. I thought this morning I \nwould take a few minutes to discuss the Employee Free Choice Act, what \nI think it means, why I think it is here, but why we are where we are \ntoday in America in terms of labor and management relations.\n  At the beginning of the last century, the Industrial Revolution began \nin full force. As a byproduct of it, America went to a manufacturing \nsociety, a creative society. Business flourished--textiles, automobile \nproduction, manufacturing of all types.\n  Out of that came huge employment opportunities. Out of it came large \ncompanies, and out of it, unfortunately, came abuse of workers. In the \n1920s it became obvious something had to be done. In 1935, this \nCongress and the President then signed the Wagner Act, which created \nthe National Labor Relations Board, and for 72 years since then, our \ncountry has flourished under the rules and regulations of the National \nLabor Relations Board, and addressing the rights of workers.\n  It also created the opportunity for workers to join together, to \nunionize, to collectively bargain, and to negotiate. It has served \nAmerica well. What has happened over those 72 years is the creation of \na plethora of worker benefit programs backed by the U.S. Government. \nPrior to 1935, there was little if any federal worker protection laws. \nOut of that grew the demand for organization and ultimately unions, and \nout of that came the Wagner Act. Since then have come the following: \nOSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; the National \nLabor Relations Board; the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; a \nnew minimum wage, recently raised on the signature of the President \nhere; the adverse effect wage rate, to protect those who come to this \ncountry and work as immigrants, to ensure they are not taken advantage \nof; workers compensation, a universal plan to make sure that workers in \nhigh-risk jobs have compensation for injuries they incur in the \nworkplace; not to mention the Mine Safety & Health Administration, the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, and literally hundreds of agencies in \nthe American Government today, created since 1935, for the protection \nof workers. Those all came about because workers deserved that \nprotection in terms of their health, their safety, their compensation, \nand other benefits that arise.\n  Now, why did those laws come to pass? They came to pass because the \nunion movement began to organize businesses and got management's \nattention, and management responded, and where it did not, the \nGovernment responded.\n  Now, how did the union system work under the Wagner Act? It was very \nsimple. It said: If 30 percent of the employees of a company decide \nthey want to sign off on a card saying they want a vote as to whether \nthat company should unionize, they get the chance to have that vote, \nthat vote, as sought by labor, and as was demanded in fact by the \norganizers, a secret ballot. It was a secret ballot because, in large \nmeasure, workers did not trust management. They thought company \nownership would intimidate a worker, threaten a worker, try and \nprohibit them from making their own free choice, so they insisted on \nthe secret ballot, just as our Founding Fathers did, and just as we \ntoday protect the secret ballot for those who vote for or against us, \nand for or against amendments to our Constitution or any referendum \nthat comes before them.\n  So the secret ballot allowed brave people to vote, in privacy, as to \nwhether they wanted to be organized. If they were organized, if they \nvoted 50 percent plus one to organize, they could form a union. If they \nformed that union, they then had the right to collectively bargain, use \nthe strength of their numbers with management, negotiate contracts to \nprotect themselves and their interests, and bargain for benefits.\n  That is not a bad system. It is a neutral system. It is a fair \nsystem. When you got the 30-percent signatures, you then had a neutral \nsystem where management had the opportunity to tell you all the reasons \nwhy they were going to be better and you did not need to organize; and \nlabor had all the opportunity they needed to tell you why not to \nbelieve that and that you needed to organize.\n  Out of that came a vote, a private vote, a secret ballot vote. If 50 \npercent plus one voted for it, the union got to organize.\n  Now, what does the Employee Free Choice Act say? It says: Well, you \nare no longer going to have the opportunity of avoiding intimidation \nbecause we are going to take away the secret ballot. We are going to \nsay: If union leaders decide they want to come in and organize a \ncompany that is not unionized, they can get 50 percent plus one to sign \noff on a card chit and you have a union. There is no vote. There is \njust the card sign-off, but it is not signed off in secret. You no \nlonger have the neutrality to have the opportunity of management \ngetting the chance to make its case. You have a negative environment of \nworker against company and, worst of all, as I read the legislation, as \nI understand it, it would then say: The first contract with the company \nis not negotiated, it is written by Federal mediators.\n  Give me a break. We are going from a system that has improved America \nto the safest, most productive, most opportunistic country in the \nworld, where we have no child labor, we have minimum wages, we have \nhourly standards, we have worker protections, we have overtime, we have \ncomp time, we have OSHA, we have regulatory commissions of every type \nto ensure, and we have good union management relationships in most \nplaces in this country.\n  Why is this before us? It is before us because there has been a \ndecline in union membership. It is before us because the problems that \ngave way to the union movement have been solved in large measure, and \nwe have responded with the laws necessary to\n\n[[Page S7839]]\n\nprotect people and their rights regardless of age or sex or disability. \nWe have done that.\n  But the union movement has not changed with the times. There are \nexceptions. There are many great relationships today. One of them is \nSMACNA, the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors' National \nAssociation. I happen to know a little bit about these folks because of \nmy work in development and construction. They have a partnership with \ntheir union. It is not an adversarial relationship. They have taken \nadvantage of the Wagner Act.\n  We must preserve a system that protects workers. Ours is a neutral \nsystem, a level playing field for those who wished to be organized and \nthose who wished for organization not to take place. They have a level \nplatform.\n  I don't know why it is coming to the floor. I don't know why it is \nnot going through the committee system. I don't know why it is going to \nbe a quick 1-day vote, which is my understanding of the way it will be.\n  I will stake my claim on 72 years of success under the Wagner Act, \nunder the right to protect and continue to protect the secret ballot, \nand of my desire to see to it that we honor those things we have \ncreated in response to the bad things that happened in the early part \nof the 20th century. Why change a good thing? Yes, we have a decline \nnow in the union movement. Buy why do you all of a sudden create a \nsituation of intimidation, an unbalanced situation, an uneven playing \nfield, all for the sake of trying to save a movement that won't save \nitself?\n  I submit there is today, has been in the past, and will be in the \nfuture a viable place for the collective bargaining of workers and for \nunions but not if it is an unlevel playing field, not if the company \nand management don't have the same equal rights as do those workers, \nand not, most importantly, if those workers don't have protection of \nthe secret ballot.\n  As I understand it, the vast majority, over 70 percent of union \nmembers, like the secret ballot. Over 70 percent of Republicans and \nDemocrats--far more than that--like the secret ballot and think card \ncheck is crazy. To date, the only thing I have seen endorsing card \ncheck in print was the 2005 Communist Party convention in the United \nStates which endorsed card check and the Employee Free Choice Act. Give \nme a break. This is one time where we ought to ratify what is right \nwith America, ratify the success we have had in the past, honor the \nills we corrected, honor the employees who make America work, continue \nto see to it that the employees do have a free choice, a private \nchoice, a secret ballot, and continue to work in the greatest country \non the face of this Earth with the greatest worker protection of any \nnation in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, later today a great injustice is going to \nbe hoisted upon the American people, and a great shame about this \ninjustice is that a great many Americans won't even hear about it. If \nour friends on the other side--if their plans hold, later today they \nwill call up H.R. 800, the horribly misnamed Employee Free Choice Act, \nwhich would deny workers all over this great country their right to \ncast a private ballot when choosing whether to join a union. I find it \npathetic that at a time when our Nation is at war, every day additional \nillegal immigrants enter our borders, and energy prices are at their \npeak, our friends on the other side are turning away from the important \nbusiness the American people sent us here to do and are instead \ninsisting on spending the next couple of days paying back their union \ncronies.\n  If I am not mistaken, I recall reading that the energy package is the \n``second highest legislative priority'' for our friends on the other \nside in the Senate. I guess that means that because we are interrupting \nthat ``high'' priority, paying back the unions must be their very first \npriority.\n  Much has already been said about the denial of a National Labor \nRelations Board-supervised and protected secret ballot election, a \nprivate vote on whether employees want to be represented by a union. It \nseems to me that the Democrats' and the unions' real objection to \nprivate ballot elections is not the form of vote, a secret ballot \nversus card check; their real objection is ever since the 1947 Taft-\nHartley amendments, the law allows employers to communicate with their \nemployees about union organization. What unions really want is to \nsilence the employer during a union organizing campaign through a card \ncheck process. Then the union would be able to persuade or even \nintimidate the employees so the union can be certified based on a card \ncheck as soon as the union gets to a majority, no matter how ephemeral \nthat support really is.\n  What that means is that if the union gets 50 percent plus one talking \nto the employees, then that company automatically becomes unionized \nwithout a secret ballot election. But it is even worse than that. The \nway they have drafted this bill, it will lead to mandatory arbitration, \nwhich will result in the Government setting the terms and conditions of \nemployment, even pension plans. That is even worse than the card check \naspect, which is about as bad as it gets. The real key for the unions \nis that the process be within the union's control and before the \nemployer has an opportunity to communicate with the employees. In \neffect, the unions want to force employer neutrality based on the \nemployer's inability to respond to a union organizing campaign.\n  How quick must the quick certification process be to satisfy unions? \nNLRB statistics reveal that in 2006, 94.2 percent of all initial \nrepresentation elections were conducted within 56 days of the filing of \nthe petition with the NLRB and that the median time was 39 days. \nApparently for union organizers, a little over a month is too long for \nthem to maintain majority support, although it is important to note \nthat under the current secret ballot election procedures, unions still \nwin about 60 percent of all elections. That is fine as long as there is \na balance in these programs, as long as both sides are treated fairly.\n  Also union authorization cards make it virtually impossible for \nemployees to change their minds, which can happen in the privacy of the \nvoting booth. Revoking a signed union authorization card is virtually \nimpossible today, when cards are used to trigger NLRB-supervised \nelections. You can imagine how hard it would be for an employee to \nrevoke a signed card under a card check process.\n\n  The U.S. Supreme Court has said that union authorization cards are \n``inherently unreliable'' indicators of employee support. Even unions \nthemselves have stated that union authorization cards are less reliable \nthan NLRB-protected private ballot elections. But the real reason \nunions seek card check is not because it is more reliable but because \nit can be controlled entirely by the union before the employer can \naddress the union campaign propaganda. What that really means is that \nemployees will be denied an informed choice.\n  Under current law, to convince employees to vote for a union, the \nunion may use the pressures of the employee polls and interrogation. \nUnions may make predictions. They may promise benefits, whether \nachievable or not, and they may make false statements about the \nemployer. It may well be that the labor leaders have never been able to \nnegotiate the wages and benefits they promise will result from the \nformation of a new union. It may be that the union, in fact, has \nnegotiated contracts with other employers in the same industry and \ngeographic area that are less generous than the employees currently \nreceive at the location being organized. The union's claims about the \nemployer's safety record, its compliance with employment laws, its \nbusiness practices, its executive compensation, its future business \nplans, and so forth are grossly exaggerated. If we silence employers, \nwho is going to inform the employees of these facts? Certainly not the \nunion.\n  Of course, employees may know well that in general their employer \nwould prefer not deal with a union, but if, as a result of card check, \nemployers are prevented from responding to a union's campaign \nmisstatements, who will?\n  That is not a license for an employer to threaten, intimidate, or \ncoerce employees during an organizing campaign. Under current law, \nemployers are not permitted to threaten, coerce, or promise new \nbenefits or threaten withdrawal of existing benefits. But under\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\ncurrent law, the employer can respond factually to the campaign-puffing \nof the union so that the choice made by the employees is an informed \nchoice. Through a quickie card check process, that ability will \neffectively be denied.\n  So let's be clear: When down the road the union lobby offers to \ncompromise by preserving secret ballot elections supported by a \nmajority, even a supermajority, of signed union authorization cards but \nonly where such secret ballot elections are conducted by the NLRB in a \nweek or two from the date the union files an election petition, it will \nbe no compromise. There are still a few of us around who remember the \nquickie election provision of the so-called labor law reform bill in \n1977 and 1978. The unions then, just as today, were seeking to in \neffect silence employers during union organizing campaigns. Today, they \nare seeking that result by denying workers secret ballot elections. If \nthey thought they could get away with it, unions would have Congress \nrepeal employer free speech rights entirely.\n  Denial of employee secret ballot elections and denial of free speech \nvital to ensure an informed choice doesn't sound very much like \nemployee free choice to me. It sure doesn't sound very democratic with \na small ``d'' or even a large ``D.'' That is only part of it. If you \nget into the mandatory arbitration that will inevitably occur because \nthey won't be able to negotiate, in fairness, union contracts, you are \ngoing to have the wonderful people here in the Federal Government \ntelling not only the unions but especially the businesses what they can \nand cannot do. They will set the terms and conditions of employment by \nmandatory arbitration and, in the end, they will also basically \ndetermine things such as pension plans. This isn't right.\n  We believe in secret ballot elections in this country. We believe in \nfair processes. As I have said, the process works pretty well because \nunions win 60 percent of these elections. When they win fairly, that is \nthe right thing. That may be a good thing. The fact is, under this \nbill, it stacks the whole labor process in favor of one side--the \nunions--and takes away the rights of employers to be able to inform \ntheir employees of the truth if there are misrepresentations by the \nunion and, even if there aren't, to inform their employees how much \nbetter off they may be without a union so that they can make truly an \ninformed choice. There are decent provisions in the labor laws that \npermit a reasonable, decent, honorable process.\n  What really interests me is that the trade union movement is \ndemanding a secret ballot election process in other countries. Why \nwould they demand it in other countries and yet deny it here for both \nemployers and employees in these very important decisions that have to \nbe made by employees under our current very fair laws?\n  Right now, the balance is a little bit in favor of unions. That is \nmaybe as it should be. But at least it is a balance. Both sides have \nbasically an equal chance of keeping unions, accepting unions, or \ndenying unions.\n  Frankly, one of the reasons my friends in the trade union movement \nwant this type of an unfair process is because they have been losing \nmembers. It is easy to see why. We are on an energy bill right now that \nmay be the death knell of our automobile industry if we don't handle it \nexactly right. The fact is, we could lose the American automobile \nindustry, run by Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler, if we don't handle \nit properly. We will go to foreign-made cars. That would be disastrous, \nin my opinion. But part of the reason is the unions have negotiated \ncontracts that are so expensive that a lot of the companies just can't \nproduce the high-quality cars at reasonable prices that they used to be \nable to do.\n  There are good reasons for unionization. I am one of the few people \nhere who actually held an AFL-CIO union card. I came up through the \ntrade union movement, learned a trade through a formal apprenticeship, \nbecame a journeyman, a skilled tradesman. I believe in unions. I \nbelieve in a fair collective bargaining process. But it ought to be \nfair. One of the ways you make it fair is by having secret ballot \nelections. In this particular case, this hoax which is going to be \nbrought up on the floor and done in a very quickie way is not the way \nto go.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7840-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7840-S7842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OUR NUCLEAR DETERRENT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for more than six decades, the bedrock \nof American national security has been a strong, reliable, and cutting-\nedge nuclear deterrent. Literally thousands of the best scientists and \nengineers in the world have dedicated themselves to ending World War \nII, winning the Cold War, and protecting the free world.\n  Each year, the Directors of the three national nuclear weapons \nlaboratories must certify to the President, and through him to the rest \nof the United States, that our nuclear weapons systems are reliable. \nThat certification process assures Americans, and warns our \nadversaries, that the Nation's nuclear stockpile will be able to \ncontinue to perform its basic mission--prevention of a nuclear weapons \nexchange.\n  During these six decades, discussion of the nature and size of our \nnuclear deterrent has been literally constant. Each year, hundreds of \nscientists, engineers, and global strategists devote innumerable hours \nand days to intense discussions of the proper strategy for the Nation \nand the proper nuclear stockpile to implement that strategy.\n  Each year, Presidents have recommendations based upon the work of \nspecialists inside and outside the Federal Government. Since the end of \nphysical testing of our nuclear weapons stockpile--a big event; and, in \nfact, a major event in American nuclear weapons evolution, the idea we \nwould no longer test our weapons--America has relied on a concept \ncalled stockpile stewardship to try to keep our nuclear weapons \nresources certifiably reliable.\n  This Nation has already embarked upon, and through three different \nPresidents has reaffirmed, a commitment to physical testing-free \ntesting that has cost billions of dollars. Our strategy has been \nsimple: the most reliable weapons without physical testing, upgraded as \nstrategy dictates.\n  At the same time, the United States has embarked on a major reduction \nin the size of our stockpile and in the nuclear stores of other \nnations. We have done this through programs this Senator has supported \nand authored during the past 20 years. I salute Senator Richard Lugar, \nmy colleague from Indiana, and former Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, for \ntheir groundbreaking work in forging these programs, and I am proud I \nhave been able to work with them in these critical efforts.\n  Because of these initiatives--the Nunn-Lugar, Nunn-Lugar-Domenici, \nthe Nuclear Cities Initiative, the Global Initiative for Proliferation \nPrevention, the Nuclear Nonproliferation Research and Development \nProgram, and others--our world is safer.\n  In total, under Nunn-Lugar, we have deactivated 6,982 warheads, 644 \nICBMs, 485 ICBM silos, 100 mobile ICBM launchers, 155 bombers, 906 air-\nlaunched cruise missiles, 436 submarine-launched ballistic missile \nlaunchers, 611 submarine-launched ballistic missiles, 30 strategic \nmissile submarines, and 194 nuclear test tunnels. Indeed, nine more \nwarheads were deactivated in the last month.\n  We have offered thousands of Russian nuclear scientists alternative \npay and occupations, in hopes they will be less susceptible to \nblandishments from other parties. We are sharing nonproliferation \nefforts with other nations beyond the former Soviet Union states.\n  In more stark terms, under the Washington-Moscow Treaty, ratified by \nthe Senate and signed by the President, we will have in our nuclear \nstockpile, by 2013, fewer weapons than at any time since the era of \nPresident Eisenhower. We will have fewer nuclear weapons than we had, \nin other words, before the Cold War began in earnest.\n  So this two-pronged approach--international cooperation against \nproliferation and for elimination of weapons, coupled with the \ninception of Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship--has been America's \nstrong response to the need to reduce the danger of both nuclear\n\n[[Page S7841]]\n\nweapon stockpiles and physical nuclear testing.\n  Almost a decade ago, in a speech at Harvard University, I outlined \nwhat I called a new nuclear paradigm. That paradigm envisioned, among \nother things, a cut in American nuclear weapons to what I then called a \nthreat-based nuclear stockpile; that is, a stockpile commensurate with \nthe anticipated international threat to our Nation.\n  Critical to that concept was, and remains, the principle of \nreliability and the continuous battle against degradation of our \npresent stockpile. No serious expert advocated simply keeping the very \nsame physical weapons we had 20 or 25 years ago, with no upgrading or \nimprovements. At some point, the degradation of components in those \nweapons would mean the certification necessary from the three weapons \nlabs Directors to the President could not be honestly made.\n  In short, without upgrades and continuous nonphysical monitoring, our \nnuclear weapons deterrence could be put in serious doubt. Yet at this \nvery time, the youngest nuclear weapons designs in our arsenal are 20 \nto 25 years old. Age-related component degradation could impact several \ndifferent systems at the same time, calling into question reliability.\n  For the past several years, this Senate has supported, on a \nbipartisan basis, spending the money necessary to protect our stockpile \nfrom degradation. At the same time, we have recognized some of our \nsystems are too complicated, pose risks to workers, and need \nsubstantial upgrading.\n  This background brings me to the present Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 2008 proposed by the House \nAppropriations Committee and scheduled for House floor action this \nweek.\n  That bill, if enacted without substantial change, would send American \nnuclear deterrence strategy in a new, unknown, direction. Think about \nthat. More than 20 years of intensive study, by some of the best minds \nin the world, could begin to be overturned by enactment of a single \nappropriations bill. The new direction wouldn't be enacted as the \nresult of 3 to 4 years of intensive study and hearings by all of the \nrelevant committees of Congress. It wouldn't result from a convocation \nof the best minds at our disposal. It wouldn't result from the kind of \npain-staking analysis of future risks that any prudent American would \ndemand from its government. No, that new path would begin by a single \nappropriations bill, devised by a small group with the best of \nintentions, but far from public view and analysis. In that regard, I \nask unanimous consent that an article from the Washington Post, \n``Congress seeks new direction for Nuclear Strategy,'' by Walter \nPincus, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 18, 2007]\n\n           Congress Seeks New Direction for Nuclear Strategy\n\n                           (By Walter Pincus)\n\n       Congress is moving to change the direction of the Bush \n     administration's nuclear weapons program by demanding the \n     development of a comprehensive post-Sept. 11, 2001 nuclear \n     strategy before it approves funding a new generation of \n     warheads.\n       ``Currently there exists no convincing rationale for \n     maintaining the large number of existing Cold War nuclear \n     weapons, much less producing additional warheads,'' the House \n     Appropriations Committee said in its report, released last \n     week, on the fiscal 2008 Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Bill. The full House is expected to vote on \n     the measure this week.\n       The Bush administration had sought $88 million for the \n     Reliable Replacement Warhead program next year so that cost \n     and engineering studies could be completed and a decision \n     could be reached on congressional approval to build the first \n     RRW model, with the first new warheads ready by 2012.\n       The House already passed the fiscal 2008 Defense \n     Authorization Bill, which reduced RRW funding and called for \n     development of a new nuclear weapons strategy before steps \n     are taken to produce new warheads.\n       While the Senate has yet to act on the authorization or \n     appropriations measure, the Senate Armed Services and \n     Appropriations committees are expected to follow the House's \n     example by reducing proposed RRW spending and demanding \n     development of a new nuclear weapons policy.\n       Rep, Ellen O. Tauscher (D-Calif.), chairman of the House \n     Armed Services subcommittee that handles strategic weapons, \n     said in an interview last week that she expects that the \n     question of future U.S. nuclear weapons policy will be passed \n     to the next administration, since the Bush White House is \n     preoccupied with other subjects.\n       The House appropriations bill eliminates RRW funding and \n     directs the Energy and Defense departments and the \n     intelligence agencies to develop a ``comprehensive nuclear \n     defense strategy based on current and projected global \n     threats.'' And it slows down funding of the Bush \n     administration's program to modernize the facilities where \n     nuclear weapons are built, stored and dismantled.\n       ``These multi-billion dollar initiatives are being proposed \n     in a policy vacuum without any administration statement on \n     the national security environment that the future nuclear \n     deterrent is designed to address,'' the report said. ``[I]t \n     is premature to proceed with further development of the RRW \n     or a significant nuclear complex modernization plan.''\n       The committee pointed out that neither the Pentagon's \n     Quadrennial Defense Review last year nor the administration's \n     2001 Nuclear Posture Review ``provided a long term nuclear \n     weapons strategy or the defined total nuclear stockpile \n     requirements for the 21st century.''\n       The House bill more than triples the amount the Bush \n     administration is asking for dismantlement of old warheads \n     and adds $30 million to modify a facility at the Nevada \n     nuclear test site so it can be used for dismantling weapons. \n     At present, the only facility that does that work is the \n     Pantex plant near Amarillo, Tex., which also refurbishes \n     currently deployed weapons.\n       Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), chairman of the \n     Appropriations subcommittee handling the nuclear program, has \n     indicated he is thinking along the same lines, according to a \n     senior Democratic staffer familiar with his views. ``The \n     Tauscher approach makes sense,'' the staff member said.\n       He noted that senior Bush administration officials had not \n     publicly supported the RRW program despite a request by Sen. \n     Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.), a former Appropriations \n     subcommittee chairman and a proponent of the new warheads. \n     The Senate subcommittee is expected to provide limited funds \n     for the program ``so we have a couple of years to gather \n     information while the next administration lays out future \n     requirements.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Note an important point in this story. The funding cuts \nare proposed now; a new strategic direction will be forged later in \nthis decade. Such an approach is absolutely backwards. We should forge \nthe new direction, if one is believed appropriate in a world of \nincreasing threats to our security, after great study. We should fund \nour present strategy, 20 years in the making, now.\n  The House Bill and the Post story focus on the so-called RRW, the \nReliable Replacement Warhead. The RRW is a proposed new element of \nadministration policy. The intent of the RRW, to enable increased \nreliability and design simplification in weapons of comparable \nexplosive yield is, in my view, a very appropriate consideration, which \nmay well result in the ability to maintain still smaller future \nstockpiles supported by a still smaller future weapons complex. But, as \nother legislators have suggested and as I noted in the last paragraph, \nI agree that a study of the complete role of the RRW in the Nation's \nnuclear deterrent is appropriate. That study must involve far greater \nresources than those involved in the House report language. \nFurthermore, Congress will have many opportunities to review and \nfinalize any decision for actual deployment of the RRW, but the funds \nproposed for investment in the RRW now should provide the detailed data \nto underpin any future congressional decision to shift portions of our \ndeterrent to that design.\n  But far beyond the RRW debate, with or without any RRW, stockpile \nstewardship is absolutely vital to our national security. As long as \nthis Nation requires a nuclear deterrent in our defense or in support \nof our allies, we must maintain the skills and infrastructure that \nsupport the viability of that stockpile. That must include both trained \npeople and the facilities to enable their work to proceed. Th House \nbill does harm to the Stockpile Stewardship Program. It cuts all \nfunding for the new CMRR facility, which would replace the present \nfacility, which will be inoperable after 2010. Without a new facility, \nour Nation will not be able to support the pit mission, which is a \nsingle point failure in the complex. Without a viable pit capability, \nthe U.S. nuclear deterrent is vulnerable. The House bill cuts the \nNuclear Material Safeguard and Security Upgrade, required to meet the \nDesign Basis Threat around the key nuclear facilities that contain \nspecial nuclear material; it would cut stockpile services, the \nfoundation of the production capability for our Nation; it would cut \nalmost in half\n\n[[Page S7842]]\n\nour pit mission, the critical component of our nuclear deterrent \nsystems; it would cut funding for the repair and elimination of old and \nunused facilities that now drain funds from required new facilities; it \nwould cripple advanced computing, the key to science-based stockpile \nstewardship; force the shutdown of LANSCE, the accelerator needed for a \nvariety of research; and, cut the Z machine, another component of our \nnonphysical testing regime.\n\n  I urge all my colleagues to attend to this debate as it moves through \nthe House and to markup in subcommittee next week on the Senate side. \nImplementing and funding a new strategic policy after extensive debate \nis intelligent; defunding critical parts of our present strategy \nwithout a clear new path in view poses serious risks to our national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Today we remember them and all firefighters and their \nfamilies for whom courageous service is a part of their everyday lives.\n  My home State of Massachusetts endured a similar disaster several \nyears ago when six firefighters died in Worcester, MA.

Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate on a matter \nwe will have an opportunity to vote on as this week goes on; and that \nis the Employee Free Choice Act. I think to understand this issue, we \nhave to understand what has been happening to the middle class, the \nworking families in this country over the period of these last 30 years \nand what happened to the middle class in the 20 or 30 years before that \nand what happened at the turn of the century as we came into the 20th \ncentury.\n  In my own State of Massachusetts, at the turn of the century, coming \ninto the 1900s, we had the most extraordinary and excessive \nexploitation of American workers. They were not just American workers, \nthey were children.\n  All one has to do is travel up to Lowell, MA, where we have a \nnational park, and travel through the areas that are preserved--some of \nthe old textile mills--and you will read, encased in many of those \nwonderful viewing stands, these letters of children who were 8 or 9 or \n10 years old who worked 15 hours a day. They were paid very minimum \nsalaries, and they were required to work. We had the exploitation of \nwomen in those conditions. The conditions were extraordinarily \ndangerous. We had the wages that were completely inadequate to provide \na decent wage for people who were working long and hard.\n\n  Then we saw the changes that took place in the 1940s as workers came \ntogether and demanded economic and social justice. We saw the changes \nthat took place in the workplace in terms of fairness and equity. \nInterestingly, we saw the vast increase in productivity. The American \neconomy grew stronger. The middle class were the ones who brought us \nout of the Great Depression, the ones who fought in World War II, the \nones who put us back on track after we had 16 million Americans who \nserved in World War II and brought us back to a strong and expanding \neconomy, where everyone moved along together. Everyone moved along \ntogether.\n  We made enormous progress during the 1950s and the 1960s and in the \nearly 1970s. We made economic progress for workers and working \nfamilies, and we made social progress too. We passed Medicare and \nMedicaid. We passed the higher education bill. We passed legislation to \nstop child labor. We passed a whole range of different kinds of \nprograms to make this a more fair and a more just country with strong \nopposition, but I don't hear any effort to try and repeal those marks \nof progress we made in terms of economic and social justice. And, the \ncourts obviously filled an enormous responsibility.\n  So what happened during this period of time? I am putting up a chart \nthat shows the number of abuses of workers. This part of the chart \nshows from 1941 to 1966. During this period of time, we had what we are \ntalking about--majority sign-up. We had it in effect during this period \nof time, interestingly enough. Card checkoffs were in effect during \nthis period of time, from 1941 all the way up to 1966 and then the \nNational Labor Relations Board and the Supreme Court gradually \neliminated of that protection. Then we found an increase in the various \nabuses we had during this period of time; that is, firing workers who \nwere interested in trying to form a union. The refusal to accept the \noutcome of an election. We find a series of different kinds of abuses \nto make it more and more difficult for people to be able to join the \nunions.\n  But what we had here is the fact that we had labor and management \nagreements and we had progress and economic prosperity during this \nperiod of time.\n  This chart shows during that same period of time, where we talked \nabout actually peak union membership, wages and productivity rise \ntogether. Look at from 1947 to 1964. We see an increase in productivity \nand an increase in wages and America moved along together. There was \neconomic progress that moved along.\n  Then, as we find the unions beginning to decline, we find that \nworkers are falling further and further and further behind. Wages now \nhave flattened, basically, and often, in terms of their purchasing \npower, have actually gone down. We see that since the loss of card \ncheck, productivity grew 206 percent more than wages.\n  So we had the idea that workers were able to get together and \nrepresent their views, and we had the increase in productivity. Then we \nsaw the country making very important progress.\n  Well, how is that reflected in the Nation? This chart shows what was \nhappening in that same period of time, from 1947 to 1973. Growing \ntogether. Here it is in 1947, 1957, 1967, up to 1973: The lowest, 20 \npercent; the second, 20 percent; the 20 percent in the middle; and \nthen, fourth and fifth, virtually all the same in terms of real \neconomic growth during the same period I just pointed out where we had \nmaximum union activity, increasing productivity, and the Nation, the \nUnited States of America, all growing, growing, and growing together. \nThat was going on from 1947 through 1973.\n  I see my friend from the State of Washington. How much time--I can \nmake this long or short. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If we divide a half hour between us, I would then have \nhow many minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let me back up. There is 20 minutes remaining \nin morning business for the majority.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. All right. Well, then I yield myself 5 minutes, which \nwould be a total of 15 minutes, if that is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Chair would let me know when I have 1 minute.\n  We have just seen what has happened from 1947 to 1973 through the \ncourse of the middle class. Now let's take a look at the years 1973 to \n2000. We have the beginning of America growing apart. Look what is \nhappening. The lowest, the second lowest, the middle, the fourth. Look \nat what is happening at the top: 20 percent, growing higher during this \nperiod of time. This was the beginning of the Reagan revolution that \nwas taking place, extraordinary tax programs that were taking place, \nreflecting itself in how America is growing. Are we growing more \ntogether, or are we growing more apart?\n  Look what has happened now in the most recent times. The lowest 20 \npercent, because of the rates of inflation, are actually going down. \nThen the second 20 percent, the middle 20 percent--and the top 1 \npercent is the one that was growing during this period of time.\n  What has happened at the same time is that we see the corporate \nprofits have now gone up 63 percent more compared to workers' wages and \nbenefits, which have now basically stabilized. This country, the United \nStates, grows together, works together. We are a united people. We see \nwhat has been happening as a result of the fact that unions have been \neffectively attacked and diminished in this country.\n  Before I conclude, this past Sunday was Father's Day. Look at the \ndifference between fathers and sons in 1964 and 1994. From 1964 to \n1994, what we have seen is the sons did better. The middle class was \nexpanding. The sons did better than their fathers over this period of \ntime. There was growth. Look what is happening from 1974 to 2004: a \ndecline of 12 percent. The son is doing poorer than the father for the \nfirst time in the history of this country--the first time in the \nhistory of this country.\n  We know the corresponding difference. We had workers who were able to \nget together, and we find out there is a corresponding increase. When \nyou diminish the unions, you diminish the power of working men and \nwomen. That happens to be the fact.\n  What is the trade union movement asking for? All they want is what we \nhad years ago. All they are asking for is what we had during the period \nfrom 1947 to 1966, and it worked then. Look at the wages and \nproductivity and what happened in the United States of America. We all \ngrew together. We all grew together. So why this emotional reaction and \nresponse from the other side: My God, the Employee Free Choice Act. \nThis is some crazy idea that we can't possibly even think about or even \ntolerate.\n  This is an idea that has been tried and tested. How few the times are \nin the Senate when we are trying to do something that has been tried \nand tested and successful. We had the measure which was effectively the \ncard checkoff during the period when wages and productivity grew \ntogether and we had the fact that America, the United States of America \ngrew together.\n  That is the choice we have in the Employee Free Choice Act. Are we \ngoing to go back to this period of time when we as a country and a \nsociety grow together, or are we going to continue to grow apart? That \nis the heart of the question, and the Employee Free Choice Act is \nreally the resolution and the solution.\n  So I look forward to more time. I see my friend. I have taken time \nnow. I am thankful that my good colleague and friend from the State of \nWashington wishes to address this issue. This is very basic and \nfundamental about our country and about the kind of America we want.\n  I come from a State that takes pride in the fact that the Mayflower \narrived on the coast off of Massachusetts, and the captain and the crew \ncame together after 6 weeks and they signed the Mayflower Compact. And \nthat is the compact that made Massachusetts a commonwealth. What is a \ncommonwealth? It is a common interest in all of the families saying we \nare going to work together to make a better State, a better country, a \nbetter nation, a better world. That is what is at the base of this \nlegislation and what it is all about, and I hope the Senate will give \nus a chance to vote in favor of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to join \nmy colleague from Massachusetts and thank him for his work. I rise \ntoday to voice my support for workers, for their families, and for \ntheir right to share in the prosperity the Senator from Massachusetts \ntalked about that they helped create for this country.\n  As chairwoman of the Employment and Workplace Safety Subcommittee, \nprotecting workers' rights is a critical priority for me.\n  In last year's election, we all heard the voice of America's voters \ncalling for change. I am very proud to say that Democrats have been \nworking very hard to help working Americans and their families secure a \nbetter future, and we are making progress. We recently, in fact, passed \nlegislation to increase the minimum wage--the first increase in a \ndecade. For the first time in 10 years, many Americans now have the \nopportunity to begin to lift themselves out of poverty. So we are \nmoving in the right direction.\n  But our work doesn't end there. Now it is time to help workers by \nensuring that their voices are heard in the workplace--voices for \nbetter benefits, voices for better wages, voices for better health \ncare, and voices for better pensions. As we all know, unfortunately, \ntoday in too many of our workplaces workers who do try to exercise \ntheir legal rights are blocked by an unbalanced system that can trap \nthem in unacceptable working conditions. I think it is time for \nCongress to stand with our Nation's workers and give them their voice \nback by strengthening protections for our workers so they can freely \nchoose to join a union.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act will make the promise of employee choice \na reality, and it will restore the balance of the relationship between \nour employers and our employees. I am very proud to be a cosponsor of \nthis important and balanced legislation.\n  So why is this bill necessary? Well, because workers should be able \nto share in the prosperity they helped to create. This bill is an \nimportant step in helping millions of working families get their fair \nshare of the economic pie.\n  Our Nation's greatest asset is our people. American workers drive our \neconomy. Their determination for a better future bolsters our Nation's \nprosperity. That is why I was so concerned to learn that workers \nbelieve the American dream is slipping away from them today. In fact, \naccording to a poll conducted earlier this year by the Change to Win \nFederation, 82 percent of those surveyed said they believe working \nfamilies are falling behind. I find that troubling, given that worker \nproductivity has increased 3.1 percent each year between 2000 and 2004, \nand that corporate profits have more than doubled since 2001.\n  To me, it doesn't add up that American workers and American families \nare the ones who are losing. They are working very hard to help our \ncountry prosper, but they are not reaping their fair share of the \nbenefits.\n  Unions can make a very positive difference. They allow our workers to \ncollectively express their voices to employers on working conditions, \nhealth care, pensions, and other benefits, and the benefits we are \ntalking about lead to better lives for Americans. Women who belong to a \nunion earn 31 percent more than women workers who are not union \nmembers. That is an extra $179 a week and $9,300 more a year in income. \nThink about it. An extra $179 could help working moms put more food on \nthe table for their family or help to pay for the education of a son or \ndaughter. It could help her put a little more away for retirement, \nmaking she and her family less dependent on Social Security.\n  Workers who are union members are twice as likely to have employer \nhealth care coverage. Union families who pay insurance premiums for \ntheir coverage pay 36 percent less than their counterparts, saving them \nalmost $1,300 a year.\n\n[[Page S7844]]\n\n  With the enactment of the Employee Free Choice Act, it is estimated \nthat up to a quarter of a million workers and their families in my home \nState of Washington alone would participate in their employer's health \ninsurance plan. That is a step in the right direction for the 866,000 \nWashington State residents who were uninsured in 2005. They are also \nmore likely to have guaranteed pensions. Sixty-eight percent of \nunionized workers are covered compared to only 14 percent of nonunion \nworkers--68 percent compared to 14 percent.\n  The AFL-CIO estimates that up to 250,000 Washington State workers \nwould participate in their employer's defined benefit pension plan with \nthe passage of the bill we are talking about today.\n  Workers recognize the benefits that unions offer them. In fact, 53 \npercent of U.S. workers say they would join a union if they could.\n  Clearly unions empower their members to access better benefits and \nprovide a better life for their families.\n  But what about other workers, those who don't belong to a union? Are \nunions beneficial for the rest of us? The answer is an emphatic yes.\n  Unions have forged the way for millions of working families--union \nand nonunion--to share in the prosperity they helped create.\n  Progressive employment policies such as the minimum wage, the 8-hour \nwork day, the 40-hour work week, employer-provided health care and \npension plans emerged from the labor movement and have become the \nstandard in today's workplace.\n  I think we can all agree that unions benefit our society as a whole. \nI am sure the 60 million U.S. workers who say they would join a union \nif they could think so, too.\n  Why is union membership declining when so many workers want to join \nand unions clearly benefit all of us. As it turns out, exercising your \nright to organize with other workers isn't an easy task under our \ncurrent system.\n  The system is broken. We all know that a fair labor market can only \nexist when employers and employees have a respected voice in the \nsystem. I am sorry to say that is not the case today.\n  Some unscrupulous employers are silencing employees who try to join a \nunion to better their economic situation for their families, and that \nis not fair.\n  Under current law, workers who want to join a union use the majority \nsign up method to let the union know they are interested.\n  Then, employers have the power to make a choice.\n  They can choose to recognize their employees' wishes, and many \nprogressive employers do, or they can demand a NLRB election, stalling \nthe process and silencing the voices of their employees.\n  During the election process, employers have unlimited access to \nworkers in the workplace. They can require workers to attend mass \nmeetings to hear antiunion messages and even require one-on-one \nmeetings between supervisors and employees. And, under our country's \nlabor laws, these practices are perfectly legal.\n  I think we can all understand how intimidating these tactics can be. \nMore often than not, employers create an unfriendly work environment \nwhere employees don't feel comfortable discussing unions or their \nbenefits. In many cases they fear for their livelihood, and rightfully \nso.\n  Unlike the peer relationship between coworkers, employers hold a \nspecial position of power over their employees. Employers have power \nover a worker's wages and benefits and, ultimately, they can fire an \nemployee.\n  A recent analysis from the National Labor Relations Board shows that \none in five union supporters are illegally fired for union activity \nduring the organizing campaign.\n  Too often, workers who clearly voice their desire for representation \nhave been silenced by their employers.\n  On the other hand unions do not have access to workers while on the \njob. They are not allowed to enter the workplace at any time to meet \nwith employees. Employees interested in learning about union membership \nmust meet with representatives and employees on their own time.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act does nothing to change this \nrelationship. It does not limit the access employers have to workers. \nAnd, it doesn't expand the union's access to employees on the job.\n  If employees make it through this obstacle and elect to form a union, \nthe ordeal is not over yet. Bad faith employers can drag out the \ninitial negotiations process, often for years, using the time and their \nunlimited access to employees on the job to convince them that unions \nare a bad idea.\n  It is easy to see who holds most of the cards in this relationship. \nWorkers shouldn't have to risk their livelihoods to exercise their \nright to form a union. But it happens all the time.\n  Hardworking Americans shouldn't have to go through such an ordeal to \nform a union. The Employee Free Choice Act can help eliminate some of \nthe unfair barriers that workers face and make it easier for them to \norganize.\n  How does this bill address the problem?\n  The Employee Free Choice Act can make a difference. It can help \nworkers gain a respected voice in the conversation with employers, and \nit can penalize bad faith actors who break the law.\n  First, the bill ensures that employees who want to organize can do so \nwithout interference. By allowing employees to choose majority sign up, \nthe Employee Free Choice Act gives workers their voice back.\n  Second, this bill ensures there's time for reasonable negotiations, \nbut it does not allow one side to act in bad faith and string employees \nalong in a never-ending process that is designed to block their ability \nto self-organize.\n  Third, this bill will hold bad actors accountable if they break the \nlaw. According to ``American Rights at Work,'' every 23 minutes in \nAmerica, an employer fires or retaliates against a worker for their \nunion activity.\n  We shouldn't tolerate illegal discrimination and retaliation against \nworkers who are just trying to exercise their rights. If an employer \nviolates the rights of its employees and is charged by the National \nLabor Relations Board, this bill will impose stricter penalties.\n  It balances the playing field by requiring that the NLRB stop bad \nfaith employers from interfering in a union campaign or contract \nnegotiations.\n  It puts teeth in the current law by making employers who break the \nlaw pay three times back pay and imposes civil penalties for unfairly \ndiscriminating against pro-union workers.\n  This will ensure that breaking the law doesn't just become part of \n``the cost of doing business.''\n  Some would have us believe that the Employee Free Choice Act \nradically changes the rules of the game or takes away employers' \nrights. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  First, it does not eliminate the secret ballot. I am pleased that \nthis bill gives employees the opportunity to vote by secret ballot if \nthey so choose. For too long, some employers have had control over the \nballoting process, and this bill gets the balance right by making sure \nemployees have the free choice to use a secret ballot or majority sign \nup.\n  Second, it does not create a new process. Some would have us believe \nthis bill upsets the current system by creating a new process for \nforming a union. But majority sign up has always been allowable under \nthe law. Today, some progressive employers voluntarily recognize their \nemployees' choice to organize.\n  Third, it does not trap employees into union membership. Opponents of \nthis bill would also have us believe that allowing employees to choose \nmajority sign up as their preferred method for choosing a union would \nlead to union coercion or would trap other workers into union contracts \nagainst their will. That is not true.\n  Let's look at the facts about coercion and intimidation.\n  American Rights at Work found that antiunion behavior is widespread \namong some employers. Among those employers faced with a union \ncampaign, 30 percent of employers fire prounion workers; 49 percent of \nemployers threaten to close a worksite when workers attempt to form a \nunion, although only 2 percent actually do; 51 percent of employers \ncoerce workers into opposing unions with bribery or favoritism--both \nare illegal; 82 percent of employers faced with an organizing campaign \nhire union-busting consultants to stop union campaigns; 91 percent of \nemployers force employees to\n\n[[Page S7845]]\n\nattend one-on-one antiunion meetings with their supervisors.\n  Some would have us believe that unions can be just as bad, but the \ndata doesn't back that up.\n  In her testimony before a House committee earlier this year, Nancy \nSchiffer, an attorney with AFL-CIO, told that they had reviewed 113 \ncases cited by the HR Policy Association as ``involving'' fraud \ncoercion.\n  It found that only 42 decisions actually identified coercion, fraud \nor misrepresentation in the signing of union authorization forms--and \nthat's since the passage of the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. \nThat is less than one case per year.\n  Compare that one case a year with the more than 31,000 cases filed in \n2005 alone of employers engaging in illegal firings and other \ndiscrimination against workers for exercising their right to form a \nunion. Clearly, unions have proven to be good faith actors in this \nprocess.\n  Fourth, it does not change an employer's free speech or property \nrights. One thing this bill does not change is the access to employees \nthat exists today. Currently, employers have full access to employees \nduring the workday. Unions do not. This bill leaves that relationship \nunchanged.\n  Finally, it does not bankrupt or harm businesses. Opponents to this \nbill would also have us believe allowing workers the free choice of \nforming a union would be bad for business or would bankrupt employers. \nAgain nothing could be further from the truth.\n  We know that majority sign up can work for employers and employees \nbecause it is already happening for some progressive employers. Take \nCingular Wireless, now known as AT, for example.\n  In my home State of Washington, we have seen proof that companies can \nremain competitive and profitable and still follow the law and respect \nworker rights.\n  Cingular Wireless gave its workers in Bothell, WA, the free choice \nthey are entitled to. As a result, nearly 1,000 workers in my hometown \ndecided to organize, and Cingular won praise for its responsible, \nrespectful approach to employee choice.\n  Today, the company continues to be one of the top wireless providers \nin the country. Choosing to respect their employees' choice to unionize \ndid not bankrupt them or make them any less competitive.\n  This bill helps us find the right balance in relationship between \nworkers and management. I hope that my colleagues will join with me in \nraising our voices in support of workers and their families by voting \nyes on this bill.\n  Thank you Mr. President,\n  I wish to speak to amendment No. 1614 sponsored by Senators Byrd, \nLandrieu, Webb, Rockefeller, Salazar, and Tester.\n  The energy bill we have been debating this week is going to bring us \ngreater energy independence and clean up our energy supply to help \ncombat climate change.\n  The bill is clean and green and will make great strides in developing \nclean energy sources, and increasing efficiency.\n  But we must admit that we have done little in this bill to address \nAmerica's largest energy resource and also one of our largest \npolluters--coal.\n  Coal supplies over half of our electricity generation, it drives our \nindustry and manufacturing and can be turned into a liquid \ntransportation fuel to replace foreign oil.\n  Coal is relatively cheap and easily accessible.\n  We have enough coal for 250 years if we keep using it at the same \nrate that we are now.\n  Not only are we going to keep using coal, but most energy experts \npredict we are going to use more of it in the future.\n  But we have to start doing better when it comes to greenhouse gas \nemissions from coal.\n  I do not believe that government has been providing the right \nincentives to move the coal industry in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7845-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7845-S7846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF JUNETEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. Res. \n231 and the Senate then proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 231) recognizing the historical \n     significance of Juneteenth Independence Day and expressing \n     the sense of the Senate that history should be regarded as a \n     means for understanding the past solving the challenges of \n     the future.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today is the 142nd anniversary of \nJuneteenth, a day when our Nation celebrates the complete abolition of \nslavery. The Emancipation Proclamation freed slaves beginning January \n1, 1863, and brought to an end what Abraham Lincoln called ``two \nhundred and fifty years of unrequited toil.'' America's Civil War had \nended at Appomattox, VA, in April 1865, but it was not until June 19, \n1865, 2 months later, and a full 2\\1/2\\ years after the Emancipation \nProclamation that the news finally reached Galveston, TX. That day has \nbecome known throughout our Nation as ``Juneteenth.''\n  In communities across the country, Juneteenth is an occasion for all \nAmericans to reflect on a tragic period that shaped our Nation and \ncontinues to influence us yet today. For Marylanders, Juneteenth is a \ntime to reflect upon our own history. Slavery existed in Maryland from \nthe State's inception as an English colony. In 1664, slavery was \nofficially sanctioned by law, and it thrived until 1864 when it was \nabolished with ratification of a new State constitution.\n  In 1820, Maryland's population was approximately 400,000, less than \none-tenth our current size. The slightly more than 100,000 slaves in \nMaryland accounted for one-quarter of Maryland's population, while the \n39,000 free Black Marylanders accounted for nearly 10 percent. By 1860, \nthe State's overall population had grown considerably, while the number \nof slaves had declined to about 87,000, or 13 percent, while the number \nof slaves had free Blacks numbered about 83,000 or 12 percent.\n  Although Maryland was a slave State, it did not secede from the \nUnion. And the contributions of Marylanders to the Union cause and the \nabolitionist movement did much to tilt the national balance in favor of \nfreedom. Antislavery activists--Black and White, free and enslaved--\ntook tremendous risks for the cause of freedom. Harriet Tubman, who was \nborn Araminta Ross in Dorchester County, and Frederick Douglass, who \nwas born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey in Talbot County, were \nboth born into slavery, put their own lives on the line as courageous \ncrusaders for freedom. Having escaped their own captors, they dedicated \ntheir lives to fighting for the emancipation of all slaves. They are \ntrue American heroes.\n  This year, the Maryland General Assembly passed a resolution that I \nwill quote here in part:\n\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of Maryland, That the \n     State of Maryland expresses profound regret for the role that \n     Maryland played in instituting and maintaining slavery and \n     for the discrimination that was slavery's legacy; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the State of Maryland commits itself to the \n     formation of a more perfect union among its citizens \n     regardless of color, creed, or race; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the State of Maryland recommits itself to \n     the principle that all people are equal and equally endowed \n     with inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of \n     happiness.\n\n  Today, on the 142nd anniversary of Juneteenth, I wish to commend my \nformer colleagues in the Maryland General Assembly for this resolution, \nand I urge all my colleagues in the Senate to join me in celebrating \nJuneteenth and honoring those who made that day possible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today we celebrate Juneteenth Independence \nDay in observance of the date upon which slavery finally came to an end \nin the United States, June 19, 1865. It was on this date that slaves in \nthe Southwest finally learned of the end of slavery. Although passage \nof the 13th amendment in January 1865 legally abolished slavery, many \nAfrican Americans remained in servitude due to the slow dissemination \nof this news across\n\n[[Page S7846]]\n\nthe country. Since that time, 143 years ago, the descendants of slaves \nhave observed this anniversary of emancipation as a remembrance of one \nof the most tragic periods of our Nation's history. The suffering, \ndegradation, and brutality of slavery cannot be repaired, but the \nmemory can serve to ensure that no such inhumanity is ever perpetrated \nagain on American soil.\n  Throughout the Nation, we also celebrate the many important \nachievements of former slaves and their descendants. We do so because \nin 1926 Dr. Carter G. Woodson, son of former slaves, proposed such a \nrecognition as a way of preserving the history of African Americans and \nrecognizing the enormous contributions of a people of great strength, \ndignity, faith, and conviction--a people who rendered their \nachievements for the betterment and advancement of a Nation once \nlacking in humanity towards them. Every February, nationwide, we \ncelebrate African American History Month. And, every year on June 19 we \ncelebrate Juneteenth Independence Day.\n  I am happy to join with my colleagues, Senators Durbin, Reid, Obama, \nStabenow, Brownback, Kerry, Landrieu, Cardin, Lieberman, McCaskill, \nClinton, Leahy, Kennedy, Dodd, Sanders, Menendez, Brown, Pryor, and \nLautenberg, in commemorating Juneteenth Independence Day with the \nsubmission of S. Res. 231, which the Senate has just adopted, in \nrecognition of the end of slavery and to never forget even the worst \naspects of our Nation's history.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased that, S. Res. 231, a \nresolution recognizing historic Juneteenth Independence Day, has passed \nthe Senate.\n  June 19 is an ordinary day for many Americans, is a significant day \nfor those who know its history. Juneteenth Independence Day celebrates \nJune 19, 1865, when Union soldiers led by MG Gordon Granger arrived in \nGalveston, TX, with news that the Civil War had ended and that the \nenslaved were free.\n  Americans across the United States continue the tradition of \ncelebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as inspiration and \nencouragement for future generations.\n  The legislation recognizes the significance of Juneteenth \nIndependence Day and supports its continued celebration as an \nopportunity for the people of the United States to learn more about the \npast and to understand more fully the experiences that have shaped our \nnation.\n  As Americans, we must remember the lessons learned from slavery. \nJuneteenth is a day that all Americans, of all races, creeds, and \nethnic backgrounds, can celebrate freedom and the end of slavery in the \nUnited States.\n  I am pleased to recognize historic Juneteenth Independence Day and \nproud that the Senate has passed this important resolution.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating \nthereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 231) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 231\n\n       Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach frontier \n     areas of the United States, and in particular the \n     Southwestern States, for more than 2 years after President \n     Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, and \n     months after the conclusion of the Civil War;\n       Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led by Major \n     General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news \n     that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved were free;\n       Whereas African Americans who had been slaves in the \n     Southwest celebrated June 19, commonly known as ``Juneteenth \n     Independence Day'', as the anniversary of their emancipation;\n       Whereas African Americans from the Southwest continue the \n     tradition of celebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as \n     inspiration and encouragement for future generations;\n       Whereas, for more than 140 years, Juneteenth Independence \n     Day celebrations have been held to honor African American \n     freedom while encouraging self-development and respect for \n     all cultures;\n       Whereas, although Juneteenth Independence Day is beginning \n     to be recognized as a national, and even global, event, the \n     history behind the celebration should not be forgotten; and\n       Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by \n     former slaves remains an example for all people of the United \n     States, regardless of background, religion, or race: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes the historical significance of Juneteenth \n     Independence Day to the Nation;\n       (B) supports the continued celebration of Juneteenth \n     Independence Day to provide an opportunity for the people of \n     the United States to learn more about the past and to \n     understand better the experiences that have shaped the \n     Nation; and\n       (C) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     Juneteenth Independence Day with appropriate ceremonies, \n     activities, and programs; and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) history should be regarded as a means for understanding \n     the past and solving the challenges of the future; and\n       (B) the celebration of the end of slavery is an important \n     and enriching part of the history and heritage of the United \n     States.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Under the previous order, there will be up to \n2\\1/2\\ hours of debate with respect to amendment No. 1628, offered by \nthe Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, and amendment No. 1614, offered \nby the Senator from Montana, Mr. Tester, with the time equally divided \nand controlled between Senator Bunning, Senator Tester or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to speak to amendment No. 1614, \nsponsored by Senators Byrd, Rockefeller, Landrieu, Salazar, Webb, and \nmyself.\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\n  The Energy bill we have been debating is going to bring us greater \nenergy independence and clean up our energy supply to help combat \nclimate change.\n  This bill is clean and green and it will make great strides in \ndeveloping clean energy sources and increasing efficiency. But we must \nadmit we have done little in the bill to address America's largest \nenergy resource and also one of our largest polluters--coal.\n  Coal supplies over half of our electricity generation, it drives our \neconomy and manufacturing and can be turned into a liquid \ntransportation fuel to replace foreign oil. Coal is relatively cheap \nand easily accessible. We now have enough coal for 250 years if we keep \nusing it at the same rate we are using it now.\n  Not only are we going to keep using coal, but most energy experts \npredict we are going to use more of it into the future. We have to \nstart doing better when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions from coal.\n  I do not believe the Government has been providing the right \nincentives to move the coal industry in the right direction. The \namendment that I--and others I spoke of earlier--am offering today will \nprovide Government grants for engineering and design of coal-to-liquid \nand coal gasification facilities.\n  It will authorize direct loans for facilities if they reduce their \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent over the petroleum equivalent, \nwhich, by the way, is the same requirement we use for biofuels. To \nqualify, a facility must show that it can and will both capture and \nstore 75 percent of its carbon dioxide. We need these parameters \nbecause we need to start doing things better than we have done in the \npast if Government is going to be supporting these projects.\n  There has been a lot of discussion in the last couple of days about \ncoal-to-liquid fuels. I would rather get our energy from States such as \nMontana, Ohio, West Virginia, or Colorado than from the oil cartels in \nthe Middle East. Unfortunately, the production of coal to liquids \nwithout capturing carbon dioxide emits over twice the amount of carbon \ndioxide than does petroleum, and climate change is as big a threat as \nthe unstable countries where we buy our oil. When carbon is captured \nand safely stored, coal-to-liquid facilities and coal gasification \nplants can achieve carbon dioxide levels that are closer or better than \na petroleum equivalent. If you combine the coal with biomass at the \nsame facilities, you can reach emission levels that are far less than \npetroleum.\n  The National Mining Association recently ran an editorial in the New \nYork Times identifying the benefits of clean coal technologies and its \nimplications for national security. The editorial is on this chart. In \na nutshell, what Kraig Naasz, president and chief executive of the \nNational Mining Association, said was that a coal-to-liquid facility \nwith carbon capture and sequestration combined with the use of biomass \ncould achieve life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions 46 percent below a \npetroleum equivalent. That is good news indeed.\n  I believe our fuel sources are a national security concern, and we \nneed to explore all safe and clean energy options to help break our \naddiction to foreign oil. Coat-to-liquid fuel is a part of that \nequation, and this amendment makes coal cleaner than petroleum when it \ncomes to greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Climate change is an issue I take very seriously. I want to leave \nthis world for my children and grandchildren in as good of shape or \nbetter than my parents left it for me.\n  Climate change is real. Our oceans are rising, our glaciers are \nmelting, and wildly shifting weather patterns are causing more frequent \nhurricanes, dramatic snowstorms, and prolonged drought. I am a dryland \nfarmer, and I have spent my entire life on the same piece of ground in \nBig Sandy, MT. As a farmer, you notice every little detail about the \nweather--moisture, temperature, when the plants bud, when they are \nready for harvest. In recent years, something hasn't been right. The \nclimate we have today is not the one that was there when I was a kid. \nWe plant earlier than we used to, we harvest earlier, rain comes at \ndifferent times, and the summers have become so hot and dry in Montana \nthat the sky is filled with smoke from forest fires hundreds of miles \naway.\n  Steps can be taken to reverse the effects of climate change and \nimprove the energy options we have available. Coal is cheap, we have a \nlot of it, and I think we should use it. But we must learn lessons from \nhow we have developed coal in the past. The Department of Energy says \nthat there are 151 new or proposed coal powerplants on the way by 2030, \nand some of those are coal gasification facilities. I am committed to \nfinding ways to make the next generation of coal plants better than the \nlast.\n  This bill encourages research and development of carbon capture and \nstorage technologies. Carbon capture and storage may be our best option \nto reduce carbon emissions from coal. We even include a cost-share \nprovision for carbon capture equipment that I sponsored with Senator \nBingaman in the Energy Committee.\n  But we have done little to give industry the incentives to employ \nthese technologies on a large scale. Wall Street really has no interest \nin loaning money for clean coal facilities because there is no economic \nincentive to reduce emissions. This amendment provides direct loans for \n100 percent of the equipment used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nand up to 50 percent of the total project cost.\n  Coal gasification technology is our best opportunity to prove the \ncapture of CO2 on a massive scale and safely store it \nthrough an industrial process that gives us the products we need, such \nas fertilizers, plastics, electricity, and fuel. Carbon dioxide can be \ncaptured at a gasification facility, then compressed, piped away, and \nstored in geological formations, including oil and gas fields where \nthey can increase the production of petroleum or CO2 can be \nused in products that facilities produce, such as fertilizers, \nchemicals, plastics, and fuel.\n  The Syntroleum plant in North Dakota has been capturing their \nCO2 for 20 years and piping it 205 miles into Canada for \nenhanced oil recovery. They capture 5,000 tons of CO2 a day \nand sell the carbon to produce more oil. In Colorado, one company \nactually mines CO2 from carbon deposits in the ground and \npipes it to Texas for enhanced oil recovery, and, I should add, this is \ndone for profit.\n  The amendment being offered today is a technology driver to move this \nindustry into the next phase and help get the first few new generation \nfacilities on the ground.\n  Government should only provide backing to the best technologies to \nhelp spur a clean industry that can demonstrate an overall societal \nbenefit.\n  To be clear, industry will move forward with coal gasification \nprojects and coal-to-liquid projects regardless of congressional \nactions, and plants have already been announced. But this is our \nopportunity to encourage these facilities to be clean and push the \ndevelopment of carbon capture and storage on a commercial and \nindustrial scale.\n  Coal-to-liquid projects have been proposed for Illinois, Ohio, \nWyoming, Montana, North Dakota, West Virginia, and the list goes on. \nThese companies have proposed these projects without Government \nfinancing, but the emissions from these facilities are yet to be \ndetermined.\n  The timing of this Energy bill and this amendment is critical because \ndesigns could be modified to fit the parameters of this amendment, and \nwe can be assured that these projects move forward with the cleanest \ntechnology available. Industry will benefit if we set clear guidelines \nas to the standards we expect to be met for Government backing.\n  Luckily, we have the science to back up our goals. A recent study \nfrom the Idaho National Labs proves that coal to liquids, when produced \nwith carbon capture and biomass, can achieve life-cycle greenhouse gas \nreductions of over 40 percent from a petroleum equivalent. We see the \nbar graph with petroleum diesel being the baseline. If we look across \nat the fourth column, if we combine coal with 30 percent biomass to \nperform coal to liquids, we can see a tremendous reduction in \nCO2.\n\n  Coal gasification with carbon capture and biomass is a vast \nimprovement over our current use of coal. Congress is at a crucial \npoint where we can help drive these facilities toward the best\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\ntechnology available. This amendment is a challenge to industry, but it \nis a challenge that is technologically available and can and should be \nmet.\n  Rentech, one of the strongest advocates of coal-to-liquid technology, \nproved my point in front of the Senate Finance Committee last April \nwhen they showed the members of the committee the potential of the \ntechnology on which they are working. What they said was that they \nagree that as carbon capture reaches the levels we spell out in this \nbill, combined with biomass, coal to liquids is far better than what we \nare doing currently.\n  I believe this amendment will drive a new, clean, and green coal-to-\nliquids industry toward startup and help offset our foreign dependence \non imported oil. Besides fuel, it will make cheaper fertilizers, \nchemicals, and plastics.\n  Adopting this amendment will be a technology driver that is good for \nindustry and is good for this country. I urge this body to support \nclean and green coal development.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if it is in order or appropriate, I ask \nunanimous consent, to establish my position following Senator Byrd, \nwhen he is finished, that the Senator from New Mexico will be \nrecognized for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, during my half century of service in this \ngreat body, I have seen too many energy shortages and too many half-\nhearted efforts by the Federal Government to respond. A geopolitical \ncrisis erupts and oil prices rise. All too quickly, our economy is \ndestabilized. Our national security is undermined. Americans become \nalarmed. Politicians promise solutions. Once the crisis passes, oil \nprices decline, public attention fades, and nothing happens to cushion \nthe Nation from the next energy shock. All the while, our dependence on \nforeign oil grows with ever-worsening implications for our economic and \nnational security.\n  About 40 percent of the energy we use in the United States comes from \npetroleum. The majority of this oil is imported from chronically \nunstable countries. It is shocking to think that our transportation \nsystem and so many sectors of our economy are dependent on a constant \nflow of energy from these dangerous and politically unstable lands. The \nvery security of this great and powerful Nation is vulnerable to the \nwhims of fanatical despots. The well-being of our country is always in \nthreat of a government coup in Nigeria, a typhoon in the Persian Gulf, \nor a terrorist attack on oil shipments in the Middle East.\n  We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. In a speech I made more \nthan two decades ago in this Chamber, I warned the Reagan \nadministration against cutting back on our energy programs. I pointed \nout that there is no national security without energy security and that \nwe have neither as long as we are dependent on foreign oil. It seems as \nthough some things never change. As we should have learned too many \ntimes during the past quarter century, leaving the security of our \ncountry so dependent on the vagaries of the free market is too \nsimplistic, too unrealistic, and too dangerous.\n  Our dependency on foreign oil strikes at the very heart of our \nnational security. Indeed, oil dependence is the Achilles' heel of our \nArmed Forces. The Pentagon itself has pointed out that our military's \never-increasing reliance on oil makes its ability to respond to crises \naround the world ``unsustainable in the long term.'' The Air Force pays \nabout $5 billion per year for its fuel, with the Army and Navy close \nbehind. Even more troubling, the United States now spends an estimated \n$44 billion per year safeguarding oil supplies in the Persian Gulf.\n\n  The money we spend on foreign oil too often finds its way into the \npockets of terrorists determined to attack the United States. As former \nCIA Director James Woolsey put it, in buying foreign oil, ``we are \nfunding the rope for the hanging of ourselves.'' Saudi Arabia, Iran, \nand Sudan have experienced a boom in oil revenues as the price per \nbarrel of oil has gone through the roof. Reports are that some of these \nprofits have been used to finance training centers for terrorists, pay \nbounties to the families of suicide bombers, and buy weapons and \nexplosives for the groups attacking U.S. soldiers and marines. For \nyears now, we have spent hundreds of billions of dollars fighting \nterrorists while at the same time we have provided countless sums of \nmoney to our enemies through our foreign oil purchases. This is sheer \nmadness. It must end.\n  It is no longer acceptable for Congress to seek piecemeal, short-term \nsolutions that become irrelevant as soon as the price of oil declines. \nWe need a long-term strategic commitment to the development of clean, \ndomestic-based energy technologies. We must dedicate ourselves to the \ndeveloping of sources of energy that will move us away from oil \ndependence and provide better energy options. Chief among those must be \ncoal, our Nation's most abundant source of energy. The United States \nhas 27 percent of the world's coal reserves. We are the Saudi Arabia of \ncoal, and then some. Thirty-three States have recoverable coal \nreserves. This means 66 Senators have a vested interest in promoting \nthe use of coal. Our coal supplies are large enough to last for \ngenerations, fueling the electricity needs of our homes and our \nbusinesses. We don't have to ask someone else for this cheaper and \nabundant energy source; it is right here, like acres of diamonds, under \nour feet. It is there, there in the ground, for the taking. Coal can be \nburned cleaner and coal can be more efficiently burned today than at \nany time in our previous history. With the right kind of investments in \nclean coal technology, coal can become our lifeline. Coal can save us \nfrom foreign oil, from OPEC, from volatile summer gas prices, and from \na disastrous foreign policy that revolves around protecting our oil \ninterests abroad.\n  Through Federal funding, Federal research and development projects, \nand tax incentives, we have made great strides--great strides--both in \nincreasing the efficiency of our coal-fired powerplants and reducing \ntheir emissions. Even with our currently underfunded clean coal \ntechnology programs, we will continue to make progress.\n  I know that a vocal minority would have us believe differently. They \nare the oil and natural gas producers who try to convince the American \npublic that coal is not the answer. Don't believe it. No, don't believe \nit. They want Americans buying their more expensive oil and gas, not \ncheaper coal. They are interested in their profits and not the prices \nyou and I pay at the pump or for our home energy bills.\n  The vast majority of Americans already use the cheap electricity \nprovided by coal. They demand it. But with the proper support, coal \ncould be providing other forms of cheap energy. The American military \nrecognizes the hope that coal offers, which is why the Air Force is \nexperimenting with using coal-to-liquids technology to fuel their \naircraft. Coal has to be part, coal must be part of our energy strategy \nif we are ever, ever, ever to break our dependence on foreign oil. The \nAmerican military recognizes it, the American people recognize it, and \nit is time that the Congress recognized it.\n  For several months now, I have been engaged in serious discussions \nwith a bipartisan group of Senators to develop a program to promote the \nuse of coal for transportation fuels and as a feedstock for our \nchemical industry. I thank those Senators and their staffs for their \nhard work in an attempt to reach our own version of a grand compromise \non the future use of coal in this country. I particularly thank Senator \nBingaman and the majority leader for their assistance with this \nproposal.\n  Even though there are significant challenges to the development of a \ncoal-to-liquids industry in the United States, our dependence on \nforeign oil and the resulting cost to the country have created an \neconomic environment that is favorable--favorable--for the industry to \nblossom. With a combination of tax incentives, loan guarantees, and \nregulatory support, along with technology-driven advances in \nenvironmental protection, we can reduce the risks associated with the \nconstruction of coal-to-liquid plants and stimulate private investment. \nWe can and we must create a vibrant domestic marketplace for \nalternative fuels.\n  The added advantage of this proposal would be that the production of \nthis\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\nclean-burning fuel would provide opportunities to commercialize carbon \ncapture and storage technologies. I believe that carbon capture and \nstorage can help advance clean coal technologies, but we must \nprovide both considerable funding and the key Federal guidance to \nhasten the arrival--in the ground--of carbon capture and storage \nprojects that begin to implement the technology.\n\n  I hope my fellow Senators will stop, stop, stop and give serious \nthought to this proposal. I hope we have finally learned the lessons \nfrom the past, and that we will now seize the moment by the forelock.\n  Our Nation confronts an enormous challenge in breaking our dependence \non foreign oil. For all too many years, we have denied--we have \ndenied--the problem. We have delayed taking action. We have conducted \nendless studies--endless studies--and largely kicked the problem on \ndown the road. We have separated it along regional and political lines \nand done and said everything but solve the problem.\n  Of course, the Senate is performing its constitutional function by \ndebating these issues, and making sure the interests of the people and \nthe States we represent are being protected. When the debate is over, \nhowever, it is also the responsibility of the Senate to find a workable \nsolution. It is here that regional interests must blend into the \nnational interest.\n  We have studied the matter, we have debated the issues, we have \ntalked about the solutions, and now we must act. Now we must act. True \nenergy independence at a time when our Nation no longer is dependent on \nthe energy resources of unstable areas and rogue regimes will require \ngive and take from all sides. In fact, in this most significant \nnational quest, there can be no single winner, whether it be coal, \nwhether it be oil, whether it be natural gas, or any environmental \ninterest. If any one special interest wins, then the American people \nwill lose. The American people will win if, and only if, we put aside \nour parochial interests, our partisan politics, and our petty \ndifferences and work together and compromise together for the national \ngood. The time for bold action is here. Let us start to put American \ningenuity to work for the benefit of America's future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, is it appropriate for the Senator from \nNew Mexico to speak now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1628\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a few remarks as ranking member \nof the committee. I am going to speak first in favor of amendment 1628, \nthe Bunning amendment, with reference to coal to liquids. Later on \ntoday--later on today, Senator Byrd--and I don't say this because you \nneed to be on the floor or anything like that, but later in the day, \nwhen some other people have finished speaking in favor of this \namendment, I will speak against your amendment and be very specific and \nprecise as to why.\n  I do say to you and your very excellent staff that I think you will \nbe interested in my reasoning, because I am not trying to be vindictive \nor pick one over another, but I think your amendment, when we finish \ntalking about it, you ought to be worried about whether you have set \nstandards in it that will never commit coal to be turned to liquids.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope not.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think you have done that, by mistake or otherwise. \nThe environmental requirements are too high for it to be achieved.\n  So the money can be used for things other than coal to liquid. That \nis what it will go for over time, because you cannot achieve the \nenvironmental standards. I don't know how I can do it later, but I will \ntalk with you seriously about it.\n  For now I am going to speak to the Bunning amendment, and later I \nwill do that other one, and if I have to do it in writing, because of \nmy great admiration for Senator Byrd, I will write it up and show it to \nyou, because I do not think you are going to get coal to liquid the way \nsomeone has drawn the standards for you. I do not know who drew those.\n  I rise today, in the absence of Senator Bunning--I hope everyone in \nthe Senate and those who are wondering why this distinguished Senator, \nwho is so strongly in favor of this coal to liquids, is not here, let's \nmake sure everybody knows that what is going on right now is a very \nimportant aspect of this energy bill. It is the tax portion, and \nSenator Bunning is on the Finance Committee. They are writing the tax \nportion, Senator Byrd. So Senator Bunning can't be here because he is \nthere writing this giant tax provision that is going to be affixed to \nthis bill.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that the letter Senator Bunning and I \nreceived this morning in support of this amendment that we have be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Headwaters Incorporated,\n\n                                  South Jordan, UT, June 19, 2007.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jim Bunning,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Domenici and Bunning: Headwaters Incorporated \n     supports adding your coa1-to-liquid (CTL) transportation fuel \n     amendment to energy legislation currently being debated on \n     the Senate floor (H.R. 6).\n       Headwaters is a New York Stock Exchange company with deep \n     roots in CTL technologies. Our company has licensed direct \n     coal liquefaction technology to facilities currently under \n     construction in China and we are conducting feasibility and \n     engineering studies in The Philippines and India. In the \n     United States, we are actively developing a project in North \n     Dakota in concert with North American Coal Company and Great \n     River Energy. We are also conducting feasibility studies with \n     CONSOL Energy Inc. in several other states.\n       Your amendment strikes the appropriate balance between \n     enhancing our nation's energy security and advancing \n     technologies to deal with climate change. To accomplish the \n     greenhouse gas emissions standards required in your \n     amendment, CTL providers will utilize carbon capture and \n     storage technologies at a scale not previously deployed. This \n     will do much to develop capabilities that will be used by \n     many industries in the years to come.\n       It is time for America to keep more of its energy dollars \n     at home, creating jobs making clean fuels from America's most \n     abundant energy resource--coal. These fuels will work in our \n     existing distribution systems and vehicles and will create a \n     more secure bridge to the next generation of transportation \n     fuels.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 John N. Ward,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n                                   Marketing & Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now I would look to repeat once again my opposition to \nthe Tester-Bingaman amendment on coal to liquid fuels. I believe it \ndoes little to advance the domestic coal to liquid fuels industry, and \ncould, in fact, harm that effort. But I will return to the floor later \ntoday and speak to it in more detail.\n  I wish to provide some context for my colleagues as we move forward \nto vote this afternoon on the issue of coal to liquids, because it is \nso important for our country that we create a situation which will \ngenerate incentives so those who will invest money and try innovative \ntechnologies will do so for coal to liquid.\n  We have an abundance of coal. We have an abundance of need for \nliquefied coal. We have a lot of people who do not want to see this \nhappen because they are fearful of the environmental consequences of \nthis transition.\n  First, we must increase our national energy security by decreasing \nour reliance on foreign resources of crude oil. Second, we must ensure \nthat the fuels available to American consumers are affordable. Third, \nwe must seek to improve the environmental performance of the energy \nresources we consume.\n  I believe coal to liquid fuels will allow us to accomplish all three \ngoals, and that the Bunning amendment puts us on the right path to get \nthere. In terms of the opportunities for increased energy security that \nare created by coal to liquids, the case to be made is a convincing \none. Our country accounts for 26 percent of the world's proven \nreserves, 26 percent of the coal.\n  We have enough coal right here in America to meet our needs for more \nthan 200 years. In every authoritative forecast of domestic and world \nenergy consumption, coal use is projected to increase, not decrease. No \nmatter what people say, you know they don't want coal because it is not \nclean, every projection says there will be more coal used, not less, in \nthe next 10, 20, 30 years.\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\n  What we have to do is be sure that since we have so much in America, \nwe are pushing that and pursuing that with a hand on the accelerator, \nthat makes sure what we come out with is a fuel that is clean enough to \nsustain itself among the fuels we are permitted to use, where it is as \ngood as any we are promoting for the American people for their future.\n  Here in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, we often talk \nabout our Nation's increasing reliance on foreign sources of crude oil. \nWe have included provisions in this bill that represent significant \nprogress toward reversing this trend. I believe we should go further, \nhowever, and make better use of coal as our most abundant, secure, and \naffordable resource.\n  The facts in support of coal to liquid as a path to greater energy \nsecurity don't only rely on the sheer abundance of this resource within \nour borders. It is because of this secure supply, but also due to the \ncharacteristics of coal to liquids as a fuel that the Department of \nDefense has undertaken an aggressive program to test, certify, and \nultimately transition to meeting much of their demand with coal to \nliquid alternatives.\n  I want to repeat what I have just said about the fact that we are so \nabundantly blessed, and it is here and it is ours, and it is to be used \nby us. Because of this, the Department of Defense has undertaken an \naggressive program to certify, ultimately to test and certify, to meet \nmuch of their demand with coal to liquid alternatives.\n  Last year the Air Force went through over 3 billion gallons of \naviation fuel. That amount represents more than half of the fossil \nfuels consumed by the Federal Government. That is amazing. Half of all \nthe fossil fuels consumed by the Federal Government was the 3 billion \ngallons of aviation fuel.\n  The goal of the Air Force is to certify their entire fleet by 2010, \nwith a 50-50 mix of jet fuel with coal to liquid fuels and meet 50 \npercent of their demand for fuels with coal to liquids by the year \n2016.\n  We must be encouraging progress along these lines, and the Bunning \namendment is a step in the right direction. Coal is affordable. If we \nconsider historic price trends, based on nominal dollars per million \nBtu's between 1980 and 2005, the cost of petroleum fluctuated between \n$6 and $16; natural gas fluctuated between $2 and $10; retail \nelectricity fluctuated between $14 and $24; and coal between $1 and $3.\n  Is that not incredible? Now, if we can find a way through our \ntechnological advances and technological genius to make more coal \nusable, think of that, we will inject into this stream of usable \nresources that are used in the place of energy a fuel that is the \ncheapest and most stable fuel we have. I told it to you in incredible \nnumbers. These are accurate. Coal, between $1 and $3 during the same \nperiod that retail electricity has been $14 to $24. You got that, my \ngood friend from Montana? Incredible.\n  Petroleum fluctuated from $6 to $16, and here is that good old coal, \n$1 to $3. The problem is, we haven't figured out ways to use it for \nenough of the uses for which these energies I ticked off are used. Coal \nis secure. But it represents one of our most stable and affordable \nenergy sources.\n\n  It should be our policy to ensure that this feedstock shares an equal \nfooting with others that are available for production of alternative \nfuels. Of course, we must ensure that we continue to reduce the \nenvironmental impacts associated with energy resources we consume. \nHere, too, the ability of coal-to-liquid fuel to achieve this \nsignificant improvement is impressive. By virtue of the process coal \nmust undergo in producing a liquid fuel, nearly all of the criteria \npollutants are removed by virtue of the processes coal must undergo in \nthe process of liquid fuel. I am repeating it. Nearly all the criteria \npollutants are removed.\n  This represents a significant improvement relative to conventional \ndiesel and includes a reduction in unburned hydrocarbons, carbon \nmonoxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter, and others.\n  I wish to direct the attention of my colleagues to the chart behind \nme which represents an average of the findings on the national \nrenewable energy laboratories and other Government entities. It shows \nthe percentage reductions achieved in the categories I have mentioned, \nby using coal-to-liquid fuels instead of conventional diesel.\n  Fuels are virtually sulfur free and dramatically reduced the \nemissions of other harmful pollutants. There it shows it to you right \non the chart. Environmentally, what remains is a concern about the \nemissions of greenhouse gases. This too can be effectively addressed by \ncoal-feeding biomass, utilizing a plant's carbon dioxide for enhanced \noil recovery or through future efforts to achieve reliable and safe \ngeological sequestration.\n  Those seeking to build coal-to-liquid fuel plants believe they can \nmeet the same standard of 20 percent better than gasoline that is \nincluded in the underlying bill for ethanol. I believe no single one of \nthe priorities I laid out as important to the consideration of the \nfuels legislation should overshadow the other. Coal to liquid meets all \nthree priorities.\n  On this basis alone, I believe the Bunning amendment is the right \napproach. Now, some may ask, if this alternative fuel is such a good \nidea, why have we not already begun to produce it? The Department of \nEnergy has testified that as long as the price of oil remains above \nroughly $50 to $60 a barrel, the first few gallons of coal-to-liquid \noperations will be economically viable. So as long as energy remains at \nthat high price, from there, commercialization will further improve the \ncompetitiveness of coal-to-liquid fuels. It is a concern that oil-\nproducing nations will increase production to lower oil prices, thereby \nundercutting the viability of alternative fuel production. That has \ncreated an unwillingness in the private sector to finance these plans.\n  I believe the most proven approach to addressing concerns of \nalternative fuel developers is to provide a guaranteed market and \nassurances that the market for these fuels will remain present. This is \nwhat the Bunning amendment does. This is all it does. This is all we \nneed to do. Specifically, and starting in the year 2016, it will \nrequire that three-quarters of a billion gallons--that is all, three-\nquarters of a billion gallons--are produced a year. That gets us to a \nlevel of 6 billion gallons by 2022. Now, I would remind my colleagues \nthat biofuels are mandated at a level of 36 billion gallons that same \nyear under the base bill. We have required that coal-to-liquid fuels \nhave lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions that are at least 20 percent \nbetter than gasoline. That is how we make sure that greenhouse \nimplications are not something we need to worry about.\n  This is the same standard required of biofuels in the base text of \nthe legislation that is currently before the Senate. We have seen the \nutility of a mandate in the current success of ethanol. In fact, \ncurrently the use of ethanol has even exceeded the mandates set forth \nin the Energy Policy Act of 2005. I believe the time has come to embark \nupon a similar success story in coal-to-liquid fuels.\n  If the environmental obligations are the same as the mandate for \nbiofuels--and the coal-to-liquids mandate is one-sixth the size of a \nbiofuel mandate--there is no reasonable basis to vote no on the Bunning \namendment. The choice given by the amendment is coal from Wyoming, West \nVirginia, Connecticut, and North Dakota versus oil from the Middle East \nor Venezuela. The choice is an easy one. I encourage colleagues to vote \nfor amendment No. 1628. It is not a huge amount of production we are \ngoing to assure the use of, but it will push producers and inventors, \ntechnocrats and people with money that they will all be working toward \na new way to do it because by that point in time, they want to be able \nto say: Ours is ready. Please buy it. That is what the law says you are \nsupposed to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the two amendments before \nus. I have some grave concerns. I am afraid this Energy bill could \neasily turn into an antienergy bill. If it does, we will have \ndecreasing supplies of fuel and ever-increasing prices. I don't think \nthat is where we intend to go.\n  I rise to give strong support to amendment No. 1628 offered by my \ncolleagues, Senator Jim Bunning and ranking member Pete Domenici. The \namendment establishes a fuel mandate\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\nprogram for coal-to-liquid fuel that is identical to the renewable fuel \nstandard we are implementing with this legislation. I know originally \nthe two amendments had some similarities and were being worked on as \none with a bipartisan group. That is what we ought to do. But somehow \nit got polarized and shifted into two separate amendments. One could \nhave phased into the other and wound up with much stronger \nrequirements. That was where I was hoping it would go, on a phased-in \nbasis, so that we could actually have coal-to-liquid technology and \nthat infant industry could then grow into one that would meet the \nstrict standards that technologically cannot be met at the present \ntime.\n  If we discourage all development of coal to liquids, we will not have \nclean coal to liquids. We will not have an adequate fuel supply or we \nwill have a fuel supply that is very expensive, and that will curtail \nthe economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Governor of my State, Dave Freudenthal, who talks about a glidepath \nwe need to get the infant industry started and into place.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             The State of Wyoming,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                      Cheyenne, WY, June 18, 2007.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I want to commend you and your \n     committee for taking up the matter of Coal-to-Liquids \n     technology as part of the consideration of national energy \n     policy. As you know, if we can construct the proper policy \n     framework for this technology, the benefits are many. The \n     country will be able to make use of an abundant fuel source \n     to begin to mitigate our dependence on imported fuels. \n     Capital investment and job creation will also be a \n     significant benefit for America.\n       My view is that with the exception of operations in South \n     Africa, CTL is an emerging technology. Clearly not all the \n     design, engineering and performance issues are determined as \n     would be expected in the case of a mature industry. There is \n     much work to be done with respect to environmental behavior \n     and operational efficiency.\n       Given the emerging nature of this promising technology, it \n     seems prudent and appropriate to set goals that stretch the \n     technology, represent a step forward and would result in a \n     better environment. However, setting requirements that are \n     likely not achievable in the near term with the first plants \n     may only serve to discourage the kind of technical and \n     financial investment required to bring the CTL technology \n     forward to commercialization.\n       A `glide path' that would require continuous improvement of \n     environmental performance with a starting point better than \n     existing alternatives seems a reasonable position for the \n     first CTL plants. This would allow policy makers to keep the \n     ultimate targets intact but acknowledge the evolving nature \n     of the technology. It seems this would be a much better \n     signal to send to the country. This should serve to stimulate \n     rather than discourage the kind of market behavior on the \n     part of cleaner energy entrepreneurs and technologists we \n     need to help us solve these complex energy and environmental \n     challenges.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Best regards,\n                                                 Dave Freudenthal,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I have listened for the past week as my colleagues have \ndiscussed the importance of domestic fuels. They argue that it is \nessential for us to reduce our dependence on foreign energy barons and \nthat the mandate that this bill lays out for 36 billion gallons of \nbiofuels is an important step in being energy independent. I agree with \nmy colleagues and their assessment that we need to produce more \ndomestic fuel, and the amendment I am speaking in support of does just \nthat. By mandating that we use 6 billion gallons of fuel derived from \ncoal, we will use our Nation's most abundant energy source to help \nbreak America's addiction to oil.\n  Coal to liquids technologies are not new. The technology has been \naround since the 1940s. There is no question that it can be used today \nin transportation markets that currently exist. It can be transported \nin pipelines that currently exist. Because it comes from coal, our \nNation's most abundant energy source, it can be produced at home by \nAmerican workers without some of the international interference. Coal \nto liquid plants are being developed in China. They understand the need \nfor the economy to have the fuel to operate on. They are buying up \nresources. In Canada, they tried to buy resources in the United States. \nThey know the future of their country depends on having sufficient \nfuel, particularly for transportation.\n  Coal to liquid plants are already being developed in China. They are \nbeing developed in other major industrialized nations. But they are not \nbeing developed in the United States. I am concerned that as we sit on \nthe sidelines, other nations will take advantage of our inaction, and \nour economy will suffer. That is why I am speaking in support of the \namendment offered by my colleagues from Kentucky and New Mexico. The \namendment they have introduced is the right approach to moving this \nissue forward in a way that will truly help the coal to liquids \nindustry. In doing so, it will truly benefit the American people.\n  There is a competing proposal from my colleague from Montana that I \nwill discuss in a moment, but I first want to discuss why this is the \nright approach, if we are to spur investment in the coal to liquids \nindustry. Simply put, if our goal is to create a market for a new \nenergy source, mandates work. We have seen it with other current \nrenewable standards. Since passage of the RFS as part of the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005, we have seen a dramatic rise in the number of \nethanol plants that exist, and there is no sign that industry is \nslowing down. That was the mandate we placed. It is being met. We have \nan opportunity to do so today for coal to liquids. However, we will do \nso on a smaller scale, requiring just 6 billion gallons of coal-derived \nfuel as opposed to 36 billion gallons mandated for biofuels in the \nbill. We will do so with additional environmental standards.\n  Like the underlying legislation, we require the 20-percent life cycle \ngreenhouse gas reduction language. However, unlike the underlying bill, \nthe amendment requires coal to liquid plants to operate with technology \nto capture carbon dioxide emissions. In general, I am not a fan of \nmandates. I have struggled with this issue. However, if our goal is to \nreduce our Nation's dependence on foreign energy sources and to produce \nmore fuel domestically, the current renewable fuels mandate has proven \nthat it is an approach that works. In direct contrast to the success of \na mandate is the failure of the loan guarantee programs which have \nissued exactly zero loans almost 2 years after the program was created \nin the Energy Policy Act. The approach of the Senator from Montana of a \ndirect loan program is different than the approach taken in the Energy \nPolicy Act. Although that is the case, I am concerned that his \nlegislation will simply create another loan program that never happens. \nA direct loan program requires that the Federal Government loan \ntaxpayer money to private companies to move forward. In the very tight \nappropriations climate we are currently experiencing, my colleagues are \nkidding themselves if they think we will spend the kind of money it \ntakes to build one of these plants through a direct loan.\n  How do I know about that? There is one proposed in southern Wyoming. \nThe company is a coalition of companies to put the money together for \none of these plants. It is a huge refinery. That is what a coal to \nliquids plant is. It changes our low-sulfur coal into diesel, and that \nis what we are requiring trucks to use now, diesel without coal. It is \ngoing to be between the little town of Hannah and Medicine Bow. Hannah \nwas a coal mining town. The coal was deeper so it wasn't useful or \neconomical for them to mine it anymore. It shut down. People are there \nwith houses they can't sell and jobs they don't have. They are retired. \nBut this plant is coming into that area.\n  The reason it is coming to that area is, first, there is the coal \nresource but, more importantly, there is a pipeline there. This is one \nof the fuels, unlike ethanol, that can be put into a pipeline and \ntransported. They have already sold all of the fuel they can build. \nThey put $2 or $3 billion worth of money together to build what will be \nthe first refinery built in the United States in 30 years. It will \nsolve a huge economic problem in that part of the State. I have to say, \nthe requirements in the amendment of the Senator from Montana will \nprobably stop this because the technology isn't there. People\n\n[[Page S7852]]\n\naren't going to venture $2.3 billion on the possibility that the \ntechnology might be there. I would hope we would put some research \nmoney into technology on carbon sequestration and carbon capture. I \nhave encouraged the University of Wyoming to do that with some of the \nabandoned mine land money. But that is down the road and should be \nphased in so that plants like this can be built.\n  In addition to my concerns about the loan program, I am also \nconcerned that the amendment of the Senator from Montana sets forth \nenvironmental standards that are technologically unachievable. We have \ndevoted an entire title of this bill--title III--to the research and \ndevelopment of carbon sequestration technologies. I have faith that \nthis research will help us to advance carbon sequestration efforts, but \nI don't believe we are there yet. As such, the Tester amendment's \nrequirement for 75 percent sequestration--and it is not phased in--\nseems unreasonable. I am not a technical expert. I have spoken to the \npeople who are planning the coal to liquids facilities. None of the \ndevelopers I have questioned have suggested they can achieve the 75 \npercent mandated by the Tester amendment. Both of the Democratic and \nRepublican proposals will reduce greenhouse gases in a major way. Both \nof these amendments require a 20-percent improvement, but the \nDemocratic proposal goes too far and sets standards that aren't \ntechnologically achievable.\n  My colleagues are faced with a choice. The amendment offered by \nSenators Bunning and Domenici takes a proven approach of mandating that \nwe use a domestic fuel. It adds responsible and reasonable \nenvironmental standards, and it will work to spur development of a \ndomestic coal to liquids industry. I wish the bipartisan group could \nhave gotten together and actually worked out something, but there are \nsome other things playing in this whole process. Sometimes we get so \nwrapped up in making a political point that we wipe out progress for \nthe United States. I hope that something can be done on that yet, but \nwe will vote on two different amendments. The Bunning-Domenici one has \nthe potential for actually providing some facilities and additional \nfuels. If we truly want to see coal to liquids plants built in the \nUnited States, only one of the approaches before the Senate works. That \napproach is the one offered by Senators Bunning and Domenici. I hope \nall of us will support that amendment and see that coal to liquids and \nfuel independence happens.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nBunning coal to liquid fuel amendment. This was an amendment \ncosponsored and championed by our dear late friend, Senator Craig \nThomas. If we could adopt this amendment and pass it into law, I think \nit would be a fitting tribute to the memory of this very fine servant \nof the people of Wyoming and of the United States.\n  We have plenty of Members of the Senate who would like to reduce our \ninvolvement in the Middle East. Maybe they supported our gulf and Iraq \nwars; maybe they did not, but they would sure like us to reduce our \ncurrent involvement, and they certainly would like us not to have to go \nover there every time there is trouble. Count me in as one of that \nbroader group.\n  There is another group of Senators, and I would be included in those \nas well, that would like us to improve the environment by reducing \ngreenhouse gases. They support reducing the lifecycle greenhouse gases \nemitted during the production of fuels. Indeed, we are considering \nprovisions to require biofuels produce 20 percent less lifecycle \ngreenhouse gases during their production.\n  So I ask those Senators--all of you who support reducing our \ndependence on Middle Eastern oil, all of you who support requiring \nfuels to produce less greenhouse gases--please support the Bunning-\nDomenici coal to liquid fuel amendment that will do both.\n  Domestically produced fuel made from coal will reduce our dependence \non Middle Eastern oil. Every barrel of oil we produce from America is a \nbarrel of oil we do not need to import from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq \nor Venezuela. Every barrel of oil we produce from America will reduce \nour need by that much to intervene in local Middle Eastern disputes.\n  Domestically produced fuel made from coal will improve the \nenvironment. Coal to liquid fuel, with its sequestration of pollutants, \nwill be lower in acid rain-causing sulfur and soot-producing \nparticulate matter. The Bunning amendment will also cut greenhouse gas \nemissions compared to gasoline production by mandating 20 percent less \nlifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. No coal to liquid plant will \nreceive a cent of Government money unless it can meet this greenhouse \ngas reduction requirement.\n  Domestically produced fuel from coal will improve our health. Too \nmany children and elderly suffer from asthma, an acute condition caused \nby air pollution. Coal to liquid fuel is lower in ozone-causing \nnitrogen oxides, soot-producing particulate matter, as I mentioned, and \ntoxic emissions from volatile organic compounds.\n  Domestically produced fuel made from coal will improve the \nperformance of our military. Coal to liquid fuel provides significant \nperformance advantages for military jets and aircraft. The Air Force is \nmost interested in signing long-term supply contracts that will enable \nthem to provide a market for the clean coal to liquid fuel which is \nenvisioned in this amendment. CTL fuel burns at a lower temperature, \nburns cleaner, and performs better at both lower and higher \ntemperatures. That is good for our war fighters who need every \nadvantage they can get.\n  Domestically produced fuel made from coal is good for our existing \ninfrastructure. Coal to liquid fuel can go right into our existing \npipelines, gas tanks, and engines without any cause of problems. We \nwill not need new pipelines, new storage or new pumps as with biofuels.\n  Domestically produced fuel made from coal is also good for consumers. \nCoal to liquids offer long-term supply guarantees without the fear of \nsupply shocks from external forces in other countries. Do you ever \nwonder why gas prices jump up every time some Middle Eastern radical \nshoots off a rocket in his neighbor's territory? That would not happen \nto the fuel we are producing from coal to liquids.\n  Domestically produced fuel made from coal is also good for taxpayers. \nCoal to liquids offers the ability to lock in long-term price cut \nguarantees. I think all of us realize that Southwest Airlines used this \nlong-term fuel supply hedging to save billions of dollars and avoid \nbankruptcy. Other airlines lost millions and fell into bankruptcy \npaying for high-priced fuel on the spot market. At the same time, \nSouthwest produced profits in part from the savings from their long-\nterm contracts to buy fuel. We can use this same strategy to benefit \nall Americans with coal to liquids and specifically by supplying that \nfuel to the Air Force and other Government users. I would hope the \nother users of fuel would realize the advantage, but we can do \nsomething now to start that market and to assure that technology goes \ninto production.\n  So I urge my colleagues to give a hard look to the Bunning-Domenici \ncoal to liquid fuel standard amendment. I would say, I would add Craig \nThomas's name to that list as well. Sponsors have trimmed back the \namendment to require more modest and realistic amounts of CTL fuel. \nSponsors have also included the same 20-percent lifecycle greenhouse \ngas reduction mandate and a requirement for coal to liquid plants to \noperate with technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions.\n  We can use the carbon dioxide, so captured, to pump into previously \ndepleted oil wells to generate more production or we can pump it into \nsubstructures, geological formations, which will capture and keep that \nCO2 sequestered.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Bunning-Domenici amendment. Our \nfuture in terms of energy independence, our future in terms of a \ncleaner environment depends on it.\n\n[[Page S7853]]\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use 12 minutes \nof Senator Tester's allotted time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is the right subject, this issue of \nalternative fuels. I commend all my colleagues for being here to talk \nabout this important issue.\n  I have mentioned often on the floor of the Senate, we live on this \nlittle planet of ours, and on this planet we circle the Sun, and we \nhappen to live on a little patch on this planet called the United \nStates of America. A substantial amount of oil is used here. We use \none-fourth of all the oil that is pulled out of this planet every \nsingle day. About 84 million gallons of fuel is pulled out of this \nplanet every day, and we use one-fourth of it in this country.\n  Unfortunately, much of the resources--the oil resources--exist \nelsewhere. Over 60 percent of that which we use in oil comes from off \nour shores, much of it from very troubled parts of the world: Saudi \nArabia, Kuwait, Venezuela, Iraq, Iran, and so on. In a circumstance \nwhere we have such a prodigious appetite for energy--oil in this case--\nand so much of it exists off our shores, it makes us very vulnerable--\nextraordinarily vulnerable.\n  If tomorrow, God forbid, terrorists should somehow interfere with the \npipeline of oil to the United States of America, we would be flat on \nour back. Our economy would be flat on its back because we get up every \nsingle morning in this country and we pull the switch, we start the \nengine, we do all these things that heat the water for the shower and \nair-condition our home. We have such an unbelievable appetite for \nenergy.\n  With respect to oil itself, we are held hostage by having so much of \nit coming from off our shores. Therefore, the question is, how do we \nbecome less dependent or how do we become independent of the Saudis or \nthe Kuwaitis or others who have so much oil?\n  Is it a good thing for us to try to become independent? I think it \nis. So how do you do that? Well, you do that in a lot of ways, one of \nwhich--an important ``one of which''--is to develop renewable \nalternative fuels.\n  So we are talking about the biofuels. We are talking about ethanol. \nWe are talking about a lot of different issues--cellulosic ethanol. \nToday on the floor of the Senate, we now talk about coal to liquid. \nCoal to liquid means taking coal and producing from it diesel fuel. \nThat coal to diesel is another way of producing alternative fuels.\n  It is very important, however, for us, as we proceed down this road, \nto do this the right way. There is, perhaps, an easy way and a harder \nway to do it or a right way and a wrong way to do it, but all of us who \ncome here talking about alternative fuels, I think, are talking about \nthe right subject.\n  This issue of coal is very important. Coal is the most abundant \nresource that exists in this country. It is our most abundant. It is \nour most secure. It is here. It is the lowest cost American resource. \nIt is estimated we have over 600 billion barrels of oil equivalent in \ncoal. Compare that, for example, to the largest oil reserves in the \nworld, which are held by the Saudis, estimated at about 260 billion \nbarrels of oil. Again, the Saudis have the largest repository of oil we \nknow of, estimated at about 260 billion barrels. Our coal has an oil \nequivalent of about 600 billion barrels.\n  Well, the question is: How do we use coal? Because coal has a carbon \nfootprint, it has an impact on our environment. I am chairing the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee on Appropriations. In the accounts I am \nnow working on with my colleagues, I am going to put a great deal of \nmoney into clean power and into clean coal technology so we can unlock \nthe mysteries and find ways to continue to use our coal, our most \nabundant resource, without in any way injuring our environment. I \nbelieve we can do that. I am going to tell you in a minute an example \nin North Dakota that is occurring that holds great promise, in my \njudgment.\n  But we have a lot of experience in burning coal for electric \ngeneration to produce electricity. We have a good understanding of the \nchallenges we face as a result of that with respect to carbon reduction \nin those plants, the coal-fired electric generating plants. We also \nhave some experience turning coal into synthetic natural gas. The only \nplant in the United States in which lignite coal is taken out of the \nground--coal is extracted from the ground and put in a processing plant \nto turn coal into synthetic natural gas the only circumstance in the \ncountry where that occurs is on the prairies of North Dakota. It is \ninteresting that the coal gasification facility is really a technical \nmarvel--a technological marvel, I should say. It is producing synthetic \ngas in a way that is exceeding expectations. It produces very valuable \nbyproducts, and it does, in fact, produce CO2.\n\n  So in this coal gasification plant, with the production of \nCO2, which we don't want to admit in great quantities into \nthe atmosphere because of climate change, we have done something that \nis really pretty interesting. We capture 5,500 tons a day of \nCO2 in that plant, put it in a pipe, and in that pipeline it \nis transported 205 miles north into Canada, where it is invested into \nthe ground in Canadian oil wells to make marginal oil wells more \nproductive. So we have beneficial use of sequestration of \nCO2 by piping it to Canada and investing it into the ground \nto essentially make their oil wells more productive. It has sequestered \nabout 7 million tons of CO2 into the Weyburn Field since the \nstart of the project in the year 2000. It has doubled the field's oil \nrecovery rate and extended the life of the oilfield by 15 to 20 years. \nSo you talk about beneficial use of CO2--first of all, \ncapturing it, keeping it from escaping into the atmosphere, and second, \nusing it for beneficial use. I think this is the largest example--the \nlargest demonstration of that--in the entire world.\n  Now, the question before us today will be a couple of different \npresentations on coal to liquid. I support coal to liquid. I believe it \nis part of an alternative fuel strategy that makes sense for this \ncountry. But we come to an intersection with energy and climate change, \nenergy and the environment. It is an intersection a lot of people would \nprefer not to approach, but nonetheless we are there. We can't pretend \none doesn't exist. They both exist. They coexist. They have an impact \non each other. The question of how we do coal to liquids is a very \nimportant question in the context of how we continue to use our \nabundant coal resource.\n  Some say the most beneficial use of coal is coal to synthetic natural \ngas. I have just described how that is being done. Some say another \nbeneficial use of coal is coal to plastics. There are many ways and \nmany approaches to use coal for beneficial use at the same time as we \nprotect the environment.\n  We have examples in amendments being offered today of the requirement \nof not only life-cycle reductions in emissions--and I believe both of \nthe amendments have equivalent life-cycle reductions in emissions, but \nonly one has a carbon capture requirement, which I think, frankly, is \ngoing to be required as we move forward with coal to liquids. We might \ndebate about where that carbon capture requirement ought to be \nestablished, under what conditions can it be met, but I don't think \nthere is much choice that we, as we proceed with coal to liquids, \nestablish a carbon capture standard. I believe the Tester amendment \ndoes that in a way that says, I think for many of us, we fully support \ncoal to liquids. We also support all of the other technologies that \nprovide for the beneficial use of coal, which includes, as I have just \ndescribed, coal to plastics and coal to synthetic natural gas, and so \non. But as we proceed with coal to liquids, it is very important that \nwe capture and sequester CO2, just as we do in North Dakota \nwith this synthetic natural gas plant.\n  Let me also point out that we have other ways of using coal--biomass \nco-fed with coal to produce liquids. We can actually take \nCO2 out of the atmosphere with that process. The plants \nwould capture the CO2 as they grow, and that CO2 \nwould be captured in the gasification process, along with the \nCO2 from the coal. So it could be permanently sequestered in \nthat circumstance. As a result, the overall carbon footprint for coal \nbiomass to liquids would be better, for example, than with petroleum.\n  So there are so many different applications and different ways that I \nbelieve coal can play a very important\n\n[[Page S7854]]\n\nrole in this country's future. As I indicated, I am going to be adding \nsubstantial funding with respect to clean coal technology and the \nresearch that is necessary to unlock the capability, the scientific \ncapability, and technology to be able to continue to use our abundant \ncoal resources long into the future.\n  It makes little difference if we have the equivalent of 600 billion \nbarrels of oil in coal resources if we can't use them. To say we have \nreserves equivalent to 600 billion barrels of oil, if you can't use \nthat coal, it means very little to this country's future. I believe, \nwhen you take a look at the most abundant resource, we need to be able \nto use it, but I also understand and believe we need to be able to use \nit in circumstances where we can produce in the future a coal-fired \nelectric generating plant that is a zero-emission plant. I believe that \nis possible. Now, can we do it tomorrow? Probably not. But I believe \nthat through technology, we can accomplish these things.\n  The same is true with respect to coal to liquids. I don't believe the \ndebate among those of us who have spoken on this subject today is \nwhether coal to liquids makes sense. It will contribute as a part of \nour alternative fuels to make us less dependent on foreign sources of \noil, and that is something we should all aspire to have happen. But it \nwill also, as we proceed in this direction, require us to have carbon \ncapture and sequestration in a manner that is meaningful.\n  One of the amendments today will establish a 6-billion-gallon \nrequirement. I believe essentially the same amendment a couple of weeks \nago said it should be 21 billion barrels as a mandate or requirement. I \ndon't know where those numbers come from. I just believe, as I think \nmost who have spoken believe, that we have to move in the direction of \nmaking coal to liquid work in a way that is compatible with this \ncountry's environmental needs.\n  So I am going to support the Tester amendment. I hope that at the end \nof the day, we will have received a message here from the debate in \nthis Congress that says: Yes, alternative fuels make sense; coal to \nliquids makes sense; so, too, do carbon sequestration and carbon \ncapture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use Senator \nTester's time for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Employee Free Choice Act\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a moment on the \nEmployee Free Choice Act, the legislation we will be considering this \nweek and legislation which will, frankly, help to build the middle \nclass. That is something I know the Presiding Officer spoke about in \nPennsylvania often in the last year, as I did in Ohio.\n  We know what has happened to manufacturing jobs in this country, many \nof them good-paying union jobs. In my State, we have lost literally \nhundreds of thousands of them--more than 3 million in the last 5 years \nnationally. We know what has happened as profits and wages have gone up \nin this country--excuse me--as profits and top executive salaries have \ngone up. We know that for most Americans, their wages have been \nstagnant. Part of that is the decline of unionization. Poll after poll \nafter poll shows that most people in this country, if presented with \nthe opportunity, would like to join a union, but most are denied that \nopportunity because of the kind of workplace they are in oftentimes but \noftentimes simply because management--employers--is able to beat back \nany kind of unionization effort.\n  That is the importance of the Employee Free Choice Act. Let me \nillustrate by an example. The Presiding Officer and I sit on the \nAgriculture Committee together and one day back in February, our first \nmonth on the job--roughly the first month--we heard from a woman from \nsouthwest Ohio who came and testified on food stamps. The food stamp \nbenefit in this country on the average is $1 per person per meal. She \nand her son, as a result, get about $6 a day in food stamps. She works \nfull time. She is a single parent with a 9-year-old son. She is the \npresident of the local PTA of her son's school. She teaches Sunday \nschool, and she volunteers for the Cub Scouts for her son. She works \nfull time making about $9 an hour. She is a food stamp beneficiary. She \noccasionally makes her son pork chops, which he likes to eat once or \ntwice at the beginning of the month. During the first couple of weeks, \nshe takes him to a fast-food restaurant once or twice. Almost \ninvariably, the last couple of days of the month, she sits at the \nkitchen table with her son, just the two of them, and she says she \ndoesn't eat.\n  He says: Mom, what is wrong?\n  She says: I am just not feeling well today, son.\n  She has run out of money. It happens almost every month. She is \nplaying by the rules. She works hard. She is doing almost everything we \nask. She is involved in the community.\n  My belief is that, through talking to people like her, if she had the \nopportunity to join a union, she would see several things happen. She \nwould see a higher wage. She would be more likely to have health \ninsurance to build toward a pension. All the things everybody in this \ninstitution has, everyone who sits in the U.S. Senate--everyone who \nworks in this institution, on that side of the Capitol or on this side \nof the Capitol, has health care, has a decent wage, and has a decent \npension.\n  The single force that gives people an opportunity for health care, a \ndecent wage, and a decent pension is unionization. We know that. If you \ntrace the numbers of people joining unions and you draw a graph about \nwages in this country, the lines are almost parallel. We are a more \nproductive workforce than we have ever been. Yet wages have not kept up \nwith productivity. When you measure, for decades and decades in our \ncountry, as productivity went up, wages went up. But during the last \nfew years, as productivity has gone up sharply, wages have continued to \nremain stagnant. That is in large part because of the decline of \nunionization.\n  That is the importance of the Employee Free Choice Act. That is why \nit matters to our country. That is why it matters for building a strong \nmiddle class. That is why the Senate this week should pass the Employee \nFree Choice Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 today, there be \n60 minutes remaining for debate with respect to the Bunning and Tester \namendments, that the time be equally divided and controlled, and that \nthe remaining provisions of the previous order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Bunning, et al., \nfuel amendment No. 1628. Senator Hatch has asked to be listed as a \ncosponsor. I ask unanimous consent that he be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, for too long America has ignored its \nenergy security. Many of us can remember the energy crisis in the \n1970s. We were held ransom by a monopolistic oil cartel and forced to \nendure shortages, gas lines, and high prices. In the early 1980s, just \nas America began to invest in alternative fuels, the oil-producing \nstates of the world crashed prices to make new technology \nuncompetitive. During most of the last 25 years, we have enjoyed low \nprices and plentiful supplies. But we have had to pay a price. Today, \nwe find that America is addicted to oil.\n  September 11, 2001, and the hurricanes in the gulf region have shown \nthe\n\n[[Page S7855]]\n\nfragile state of our energy markets. Domestic disasters and terrorism \ncan send energy prices spiraling out of control. Our energy resources \nare stretched to the limit and small supply disruptions ripple \nthroughout the entire economy. I believe all Americans, as they see \ncontinued instability in the Middle East, China, and India, and \nsustained gasoline prices around $3.50, $4 a gallon, can see an energy \ncrisis on the horizon.\n  As you can see from the chart I have here, our production of energy \nhas almost stayed completely flat and will stay completely flat until \nabout 2025, unless we do something about it. On the other side, our \nconsumption continues to escalate. So the difference between the two is \nthe crisis at which we are now looking.\n  This year alone, we will send about $250 billion to foreign \ncountries--mostly in the Middle East--to buy oil, adding to the $7 \ntrillion we have already spent in the last few decades. America has \nbecome complacent and overdependent on imported oil. No matter what \nenergy prices are, we need to take responsibility for our reliance on \nimported energy and develop a secure, domestic fuel source.\n  I believe part of that effort should be developing coal-to-liquid \nfuels. America happens to be blessed with significant coal reserves. \nCoal powers our homes and businesses. Fifty-two percent of our \nelectricity is derived from coal. It has long been America's most \nabundant fuel resource and has driven our economic growth since the \nIndustrial Revolution. Coal-to-liquid technology lets America \ncapitalize on a domestic resource. Every dollar invested in coal-to-\nliquid production will stay in America, grow our economy, and create \njobs. By displacing payments to foreign oil companies with domestic \ninvestment, we will actually increase the amount of funding available \nfor other alternative fuels. It will lower energy prices for American \nfamilies, improve the environment, create thousands of jobs, and bring \nbillions of dollars in new investment to our local communities.\n  Many of you may be asking one question right now: If this technology \nis so great and could replace expensive imports from the Middle East, \nwhy hasn't it been done already?\n  The answer is simple: Costs and market uncertainty. A typical size \ncoal-to-liquid plant costs between $3 billion and $5 billion to \nconstruct. With complicated plans and environmental permits, a new \nplant could take 5 to 8 years to build. This is a challenge for even \nthe biggest risk takers on Wall Street. Raising the capital needed to \ndevelop a new technology is always difficult, but the multibillion \ndollar investment scale of a coal-to-liquid plant has made it nearly \nimpossible.\n  On top of this is the uncertainty of the price of oil. Yesterday, oil \nhit $69.09 cents a barrel--an all-time high. Soon we will be seeing $70 \nprices on a barrel of oil. We have seen this dramatic rise in the last \nfew years. But investors are concerned that oil prices could drop to \nthe low levels of the 1980s and make coal-to-liquid plants \nuncompetitive again.\n  But even if oil prices were to drop that low in the next few decades, \nI believe CTL would more than pay for itself by insulating us from \nsupply shocks and providing a secure domestic fuel source for our \nmilitary, businesses such as airlines and trucking, and the average \nAmerican car.\n  The challenge for America is to leverage the private investment \nrequired for these large, expensive plants. U.S. investors remember the \nlast time synthetic fuels were promoted in the 1970s, and remember the \nlosses they took as oil prices collapsed in the 1980s. The scale of \ninvestment, uncertainty of oil prices, and a complicated \nenvironmental permitting process have prevented the industry from \ntaking root in the United States.\n\n  We need to take aggressive steps now to ensure that America does not \ncontinue to face high heating and gasoline costs and rely so heavily on \nunstable and dangerous parts of the world for our energy. I believe the \nanswer is to provide Government support to get coal-to-liquid \ntechnology off the ground. At least it is one of the things we must \nconsider.\n  With modest initial investments, we can kick-start the industry and \nthen the Government will get out of the way and let the marketplace \ntake over. I would rather the Government not have any involvement in \ncoal-to-liquids, but this industry needs assistance because of the \nthreat of OPEC, oil tyrants like Hugo Chavez, and technology \nchallenges.\n  While these are legitimate challenges facing coal to liquid, another \nissue has become more and more prominent during this debate. In the \nlast few weeks, the environmental rhetoric has been strongly against \ncoal fuels. Unfortunately, too many people have repeated it without \nchecking the facts. The picture opponents of coal paint is far from the \ntruth about our fight for energy independence. It shows the same \nmisinformed biases found in anti-coal advertisements and environmental \nnewsletters.\n  I want to tell you clearly and without reservation that coal-to-\nliquid fuel will be a clean part of our energy future.\n  I want to show you another chart. While some may remember urban \ndiesel pollution problems, coal to liquid will be significantly cleaner \nthan existing fuels in terms of air pollutants such as sulfur, \nparticulate matter, nitrogen, and aromatics. Air Force tests, \nlaboratory tests, and environmental reports all show that coal-to-\nliquid fuels will reduce the air pollutants that pose a threat to human \nhealth.\n  As you can see when you compare diesel and well-to-wheel urban \nemissions, compared to low-sulfur, petroleum-based diesels, you can see \norganic compounds, carbon monoxide, pollutants, particulate matter, and \nSOX, all decreasing in the coal-to-liquid area. But all of \nthese improvements and the promise of energy security are wiped away by \nmisleading claims that coal to liquid would produce twice as many \ncarbon emissions as conventional fuel. That is not true.\n  The production of coal-to-liquid fuels does release carbon twice--\nonce during gasification and another when burned like conventional \nfuels in engines. But that does not mean coal-to-liquid plants have to \nrelease twice as much carbon emissions.\n  My amendment requires carbon capture--listen to this. I hope some \npeople in their offices are listening to this. My amendment requires \ncarbon capture, but recognizes that there are limits to this technology \ntoday. Carbon capture is only part of the emissions model. Nearly all \nof the developers we have worked with want to use biomass coal-blended \nfeedstock to achieve emissions reductions.\n  Believe me, I have studied coal to liquid extensively. Reports from \nthe EPA, DOE, Princeton University, and the Idaho National Laboratories \nhas shown the coal-to-liquids lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rate \nwill vary dramatically based on the technology, feedstocks, and process \nused. These researchers have shown that the coal-to-liquid process \ncould one day produce a fuel that is carbon neutral. I will repeat \nthat. These researchers have shown that the coal-to-liquid process \ncould one day produce a fuel that is carbon neutral--no carbon \nemissions. This is not pie-in-the-sky research. Using some of the same \nideas, a planned plant in Ohio--one that will need some Government \nsupport to get started--will produce coal-to-liquid diesel that has 46 \npercent less carbon emissions than diesel fuel made presently from \noil--46 percent less.\n\n  On chart 3, we show greenhouse gas emissions. This chart shows the \nlife cycle of greenhouse gas emissions of different kinds of fuel based \non the analysis of the Idaho National Lab. On the left, we have diesel \nfuel, coal-to-liquid fuels with no environmental technology, coal to \nliquid that uses carbon capture, and coal to liquid that uses carbon \ncapture and biomass. As we can see by the chart, coal to liquid can be \nvery clean. That is our goal.\n  For comparison, I included gasoline and ethanol blends on the right. \nIf we support coal to liquids and let the industry develop these carbon \ncapture and biomass technologies, we will reduce emissions more than \ncorn-based E85 and more than cellulosic E10. That is currently what \neverybody wants to do. E85 is the big savior. The new cellulosic \nethanol, E10, is the big savior. As we can see by this chart, that is \nnot true because the emissions at the end of the line with cellulosic \nE10 and corn E85 are all higher than the coal to liquids mixed with \nbiomass. That is the truth. Those are facts.\n\n[[Page S7856]]\n\n  The sector should be given time, just as everyone else, to develop \nthe best technology and not rely on Congress to pick it for them. That \nis why my coal-to-liquid fuel amendment sets the environmental standard \nfor coal to liquids at the same aggressive 20-percent life cycle \nreduction that Chairman Bingaman requires for biofuels. The very same \nreduction that Chairman Bingaman in his Energy bill requires of \nbiofuels is the one I have in this amendment. Every gallon of coal to \nliquids made with the help of my amendment would meet this standard and \nwould be a gallon of oil we do not have to buy from the Middle East.\n  While I have shown that limited Government support is necessary and \ncoal-to-liquid fuels will be as clean as biofuels, another reason to \nsupport coal-to-liquid fuels is national security.\n  I want my colleagues to look at this chart because this is the most \nimportant part of coal-to-liquid technology, and putting it on this \nEnergy bill.\n  The military is the largest single purchaser in this country, and the \nAir Force consumes 50 percent of this total. I have spoken many times \nwith the Secretary of the Air Force, and I am proud to say he has taken \nthe lead on developing this domestic resource.\n  Last year, the Air Force spent nearly $7 billion--$7 billion--alone \non aviation fuels, which was over budget by $1.6 billion. For every $1 \nchange in the price of a barrel of oil, it costs the Air Force about \n$60 million a year. That dramatic impact is 10 times worse for our \ncommercial airlines.\n  As we can see, if we do it the right way, we can produce enough of \nour aviation fuel from this technology with a change in the way the Air \nForce buys their fuels. If we change it from 5 to 20 years in terms of \nthe amount of time they can contract for, we can have this kind of \ndramatic impact for our military.\n  With this in mind, last summer, the Air Force tested jet fuel with a \n50-percent mix of Fischer-Tropsch fuel--that is the coal-to-liquid \nprocess--in a B-52 bomber. The results of these tests so far are \nnothing short of outstanding. We already knew these fuels are nearly \nzero in sulfur and very low in nitrogen oxide and particulate matter \nemissions, but we are learning very new benefits.\n  During these tests, the Air Force demonstrated this fuel we are \ntalking about burns significantly cleaner and burns significantly \ncooler than conventional jet fuel. These characteristics allow our jets \nto have a smaller radar profile and lower heat signature. And these \nadvantages translate into better mileage, reducing both fuel costs, as \nwell as greenhouse gas emissions.\n  In light of this successful assessment, the Air Force plans to test \nthis fuel in the C-17 cargo plane this year, and it is embracing the \ngoal of certifying the entire fleet of aircraft by 2016.\n  By that time, the Air Force intends to meet 50 percent of its annual \nfuel needs, more than 1.3 billion gallons, with Fischer-Tropsch fuel. \nCoal-to-liquid fuel will provide a safety net for our military to \nensure a stable fuel supply regardless of the global politics of oil, \nbut only if we build a domestic industry to make the fuel for them.\n  Let me turn to the two amendments we will consider today. I am asking \nthat my colleagues support the Bunning-Domenici amendment that I have \noffered with Senator Craig, Senator Enzi, Senator Martinez, and Senator \nHatch. Our amendment is the only amendment that will help create a \ndomestic coal-to-liquids industry, is a separate program that will not \ncompete with biofuels in any way, requires coal to liquids meet the \nsame 20 percent life cycle reduction of greenhouse gases that biofuels \nmust meet--the rest of this bill requires that--requires coat-to-liquid \nfacilities to capture carbon dioxide, and mandates only one-sixth as \nmuch fuel as the renewable fuel standard.\n  I am also urging my colleagues to oppose the Tester-Bingaman \namendment. This amendment is not--and I emphasize this--is not a coal-\nto-liquid amendment. It sets an irresponsible environmental standard \nand will just kick Government support for this fuel into the future.\n  Their amendment is opposed by 23 members of the coal-to-liquid \ncoalition, including industry, airlines, railroads, and others.\n  It sets strict technology mandates for emissions that will stifle \ninnovation and prevent nearly all domestic coal-to-liquid plants from \nmoving forward.\n  It limits the availability of the loan to 50 percent of the plant \ncost, making it less effective than the already existing DOE program \nthat we passed in 2005.\n  It will take years in DOE rulemaking before the first dollar is ever \nallocated for a plant.\n  In the greatest deception of all, it does not require coal to be used \nin the coal-to-liquid process.\n  Let me say that again so everybody understands. The biggest deception \nof all is that the Tester-Bingaman amendment does not even require coal \nto be used in the coal-to-liquid process.\n  I am committed to the coal-to-liquid fuel as a secure domestic and \nenvironmentally sound fuel. The Tester amendment looks at coal to \nliquids as an afterthought. I think my proposal should be adopted for \nany one of a dozen arguments that we have made for coal-to-liquid \nfuels. It will create jobs, bring down the price of fuel, bring down \nthe price of what we pay at the pump, fuel our military, but basically \ndisplace foreign oil, enhance our national security, add value to our \ncoal resources, and improve our environment.\n  But my final and perhaps most important point is that coal-to-liquid \nfuels deserve fair treatment. I ask that my colleagues look at what we \nhave done for biofuels in America and the benefits we have given to our \nfarmers. Communities throughout the Midwest are uniting to invest in \nethanol and biomass. Money from Wall Street is flowing into our rural \ncommunities, developing infrastructure and creating jobs. In many parts \nof America, I have seen new hope in agriculture and new ways for \nfarmers to realize greater values for their crops.\n  It all started with the ethanol fuel mandate. My amendment will \ncreate the exact same mandate for coal-to-liquid fuel with the same \nenvironmental standards. I think our coal communities deserve the same \nsupport we gave our farm community.\n  Will you tell the Governors of the Southern States, Pennsylvania, \nOhio, Illinois, North Dakota, Colorado, Nevada, and Montana that you \noppose their efforts to bring coal-to-liquid plants to their States?\n  Will you tell the men and women who serve as coal miners, \nconstruction workers, truckdrivers, train conductors, and plant \noperators that they deserve less support than our farmers?\n  Will you tell all Americans that you would rather keep buying oil \nfrom the Middle East instead of making fuel in America?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nremains on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 50 seconds--5-0 \nseconds--remaining and the majority side has 30 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized to speak for 10 minutes in support of the Tester amendment, \nfollowed by 10 minutes for Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Colorado \nis recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \namendment No. 1614, which is the amendment Senators Tester, Byrd, \nRockefeller, Bingaman, and I are cosponsoring today. Before I make my \nprepared remarks, let me make a couple of introductory remarks.\n  The work we are doing today here on the floor of the Senate is \nperhaps the most important work we could be doing, because how we move \nfrom our current chaos on energy here in America to the reality of \nenergy independence is the hallmark of the 21st century. It is an \nabsolute imperative for us to get to the kind of energy independence \nthat has been desired in this country for over 40 years and which has \nbeen the topic of much rhetoric and very little action. This is our \nopportunity, today and in the days ahead, as the Senate speaks out \nloudly and clearly about the importance of energy and how we will move \nforward in this world.\n\n[[Page S7857]]\n\n  From my perspective, I believe we have no choice. I believe the \ninescapable forces of our civilization today require us to do nothing \nless than to embrace this concept of a clean energy future with the \nsense of moral imperative President Carter spoke about over 30 years \nago. I believe there are three inescapable forces that are with us \ntoday.\n  First, there is national security. When we see the rockets that are \nraining down from Hezbollah and northern Israel, one has to ask, where \nis that money coming from that is funding those rockets; and where is \nthat money coming from that is funding 10,000 members of the militia? \nWe know it is coming from the $67 per barrel being paid today for oil \nthat is imported from those countries. Today, indeed, when one looks at \nthe fact that, for instance, in March it was 66, 67 percent of the oil \nwe use in America that was imported from foreign sources, our national \nsecurity requires us to make sure we move forward with this imperative \nbefore us today.\n  Secondly, there are environmental security issues in how we deal with \nclimate change. I think it is finally a reality here in America that \nour world needs to deal with the issue of climate change in a realistic \nway. We need to do it now. We cannot wait. Even the President of the \nUnited States, who appeared to be a person who didn't believe in global \nwarming, in his State of the Union speech as he addressed the Congress, \nsaid he wanted the Congress this year to address the issue of global \nwarming.\n  The third and inescapable force which should compel us to move \nforward on the issue of energy has to do, again, with the economics of \nour Nation and making sure we are not subject to the volatility we have \nseen so often in the past. That is why I come to the floor to speak on \nbehalf of the coal gasification amendment for which Senator Tester is \nthe lead sponsor. What we are proposing fits very well into making sure \nwe are adopting this clean energy future.\n  I am not against the development of coal. I know what coal is in the \nWest, in places such as Montana and other places, places such as my own \nState of Colorado, where the coal miners in the mines on the western \nslope know the importance of coal and the importance of clean energy. \nThe amendment we have introduced will help us reduce our independence \non foreign oil by making better use of our vast coal resources here at \nhome. Fuels, fertilizers, chemicals, and consumer products derived from \ncoal, if produced responsibly with coal gasification technology, can \nreplace much of the imported oil we use on a daily basis.\n  Coal is to the United States what oil is to Saudi Arabia. It is our \nmost abundant domestic energy resource. It produces more than 50 \npercent of our electricity. As a nation, we have enough coal to last \nmore than 200 years. Until recently, however, coal has not been a \nlegitimate replacement for oil. With old technologies, coal \ngasification resulted in high CO2 emissions, which caused \nglobal warming. Without carbon capture technology, CO2 \nemissions from liquid coal, a product of the coal gasification process, \nare twice that from conventional fuels. This poses an unacceptable risk \nto our environmental security. So as we try to deal with CO2 \nemissions, we ought not embrace a policy or technology that will \nincrease our problems with respect to CO2 emissions.\n  Fortunately, we have new technologies, and those new technologies \noffer us a way to use coal in our transportation sector and other \nsectors of our economy in an environmentally responsible manner. Not \nonly can we sequester the carbon produced in the gasification process, \nbut we are able to produce a wide range of materials that are currently \nbeing made from oil and natural gas, including diesel fuel, plastics, \nfertilizer, chemicals, and a wide range of household items.\n\n  Senator Tester and I and the other cosponsors of this amendment have \nincluded in this amendment a framework for how we proceed with coal \ngasification in a responsible manner. Our amendment has four main \ncomponents.\n  First, it provides $10 billion in direct loans for the construction \nof low emission coal gasification plants.\n  Secondly, our legislation will establish a grant program that will \nhelp spur construction of a new generation of coal gasification plants. \nThe grants will be up to $20 million for any one project or $200 \nmillion nationwide. They will be awarded to projects that use a variety \nof feedstocks such as coal and biomass and which have carbon emissions \nthat are 20 percent lower than conventional baseline emissions.\n  The third component of our amendment is a set of studies that will \nhelp us determine the opportunities that might be provided with greater \nuse of coal and moving forward with liquid production of coal. The \namendment commissions a study of the benefits of maintaining coal-to-\nliquid products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It also requires \nthe administrator of the EPA to examine the emissions of coal-based \nproducts that are used as vehicle and aviation fuel.\n  Fourth, the legislation also provides additional funding for the Air \nForce research lab to continue its development and testing of synthetic \nfuels for use in jets.\n  The amendment that Senator Tester, myself, and others are proposing \nis a reasoned way of making better use of our vast coal resources here \nat home. It recognizes that coal can replace much of the imported oil, \nbut it also creates a rigorous carbon emission standard for these new \ncoal gasification projects to meet in order to get Federal support. We \nsimply cannot afford to dump excess carbon into the atmosphere, and \nthis amendment ensures we won't.\n  I once again thank Chairman Bingaman and Senator Domenici for their \nleadership on the overall bill.\n  Before I conclude, I want to make a comment with respect to a \nstatement made on the other side with respect to a competing amendment. \nThe essence of the competing amendment is to say it is the end of the \nworld for coal if we don't adopt the amendment that is being proposed \nby my good friend from Kentucky. As I said earlier, we are not anti-\ncoal. Both of us who are sponsoring amendments are from coal-producing \nStates. We believe coal is very much an item that has to be in our \nportfolio in the future.\n  I have a letter, however, in which Dow Chemical says they are fully \nsupportive of Senator Tester's amendment, and one of the conclusions \nthey reach, in support of the amendment is that:\n\n       Dow Chemical believes the environmental standards in the \n     bill are achievable.\n\n  It says:\n\n       The requirement that 75 percent of the carbon dioxide \n     generated is captured will ensure that all companies prepare \n     for long-term CO2 management. This will help drive \n     action to make carbon capture and storage a reality sooner \n     than later.\n\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to join us in support of \namendment 1614 because it is the most responsible way to proceed as we \ndeal with energy independence as well as dealing with the issue of high \nemissions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority side has 20 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining, and on the minority side there are 50 seconds remaining.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nminority side be given an additional 5 minutes, and would note that \nSenator Domenici and Senator Craig are here to use that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will talk quickly in 2 minutes.\n  I come to support the Bunning-Domenici amendment of coal to liquids. \nIt is quite simple. I look at it in rather black-and-white terms. A \nvote for coal is a vote against Saudi Arabia. A vote for coal to \nliquids is a vote against Hugo Chavez. A vote of coal to liquids is a \nvote against Nigeria and for our own production.\n  The Senator from Colorado talks about America always laying the claim \nthat we are the Saudi Arabia of coal, except we are rapidly deciding we \nare not going to use it for anything. Now, if we are going to use it, \nand it is the great energy supply, then we have to make it cleaner, and \nthat is clearly the technology at hand.\n  One of the ways to do so, and not only to use it for transportation \nfuels, is to run it through the liquefication\n\n[[Page S7858]]\n\nprocess. And who is the expert in the field of testing it? The Idaho \nNational Laboratory, working with Baard Energy, looked at the Ohio \nprojects--46 percent cleaner. If you add biomass to it, 30 percent \nbiomass to sequester the carbon dioxide and the combined cycle \ncogeneration process, that is what you get.\n\n  Now, isn't that a technology worth passing on to China, which is the \nlargest emitter, or soon will be, producing more emission with less \neconomy of CO2 than the United States? I think it is time we \npushed all technologies, and if they are cleaner, they are better.\n  The argument here is they have to be perfect before we do them. I \nwould suggest that perfect may not be possible, but 50 percent cleaner \nor more is possible, and that is where we ought to go. That is where \nthe Bunning amendment takes us.\n  I tell you what I am going to do; I am going to vote for Senator \nBunning's amendment, and I am going to vote against Saudi Arabia.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think I have, what, 3 minutes \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 35 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much, Senator Larry Craig, for those \ncomments.\n  Now, let me say we have a similar situation to the one we had here in \nthe last 2 or 3 days on the 15-percent wind mandate--RPS. We have two \namendments out here, and all of a sudden we find out neither of them is \ngoing to have the votes. I am afraid what has happened here is we have \ntwo amendments and neither is going to get the votes if the Senate \ndoesn't consider the difference between these two bills and vote for \nthe one that is most apt to accomplish the purpose we set out in a \ncoal-to-liquid amendment.\n  The Tester-Bingaman amendment, No. 1614, in this Senator's opinion is \nonly a long shot that we are going to get a lot of incentives for coal \nto liquid. There is $10 billion in direct loans. That is nice for \neverybody. We are going to have $10 billion to loan, but it is loanable \non a number of things beyond coal to liquid. I predict the money is \ngoing to go to those other things because it is so hard to reach the \ncalibration required in this amendment of coal to liquid.\n  In the Bunning amendment, there is a long time to work on it, until \n2016, and a given amount of that liquid will be purchased and they can \nget ready for it to be purchased. But the standard is clearly \nachievable because it is the same 20 percent we are going to require of \nethanol and of the other programs we are achieving, and we are saying \ndo the same thing. They are not saying that in the Montana amendment--\ndo the same as we have done for the other fuels. I am afraid we are not \ngoing to get there and the money is going to get loaned for the wrong \nthings before we are finished. In competing between the two, both are \ngoing to die. I suggest that colleagues vote against the amendment of \nthe Senator from Montana and for the one of the Senator from Kentucky \nif you want to get coal to liquid started.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 20 minutes 15 seconds, and \nthe minority has 53 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will take 5 minutes. I know Senator \nTester is here and wishes to speak. I understand Senator Kerry and many \nothers wish to speak also.\n  The issue between the two amendments is what our focus should be, \nwhen we think about the future of coal, are we sure the best use of \ncoal and the best future for coal is in the developing of \ntransportation fuels? In my view, that is what the Bunning amendment \nconcludes.\n  The Tester amendment, to the contrary, takes a broader view of the \nfuture of coal. I believe we want to enable the development of many \npotential uses of coal that are both environmentally and economically \nsound. We should not be focused on commercializing in large-scale uses \nof coal that do not make good sense in the marketplace.\n  First, let me say a couple of things about the Bunning amendment.\n  There are currently no large-scale coal-to-liquid plants in the \nUnited States. The price tag of a typical plant is in the billions of \ndollars.\n  The Bunning amendment purports to require that coal-derived fuels be \n20 percent better than gasoline. But we have an apples-to-oranges \ncomparison here because coal-to-liquids plants will produce primarily \ndiesel fuel, not gasoline. The total greenhouse gas emissions from \ncoal-derived diesels are likely to be greater by about 150 percent than \nthe emissions from diesels that are powered from petroleum.\n  The Bunning amendment is technologically limiting, and such uses of \ncoal as conversion to chemicals, to plastics, and to fertilizer are not \npermitted to benefit from the Bunning amendment.\n  Coal-to-liquids products mandated by the Bunning amendment have very \nlarge water requirements. Water requirements are estimated to be about \n2 gallons for every gallon of coal-derived fuel produced. The Tester \namendment, by contrast, is much more broad in the beneficial uses coal \ncan be put to, whether to make fuels or fertilizers or plastics or \nchemicals.\n  There are industrial plants in the United States that do use coal \ncommercially as a feedstock for chemical products.\n  I have a letter from the president of Dow Chemical which I ask \nunanimous consent to be printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. He states as follows in that letter:\n\n       On behalf of Dow Chemical Company, I write to offer my \n     strongest support for Senator Tester's ``Coal Innovation'' \n     amendment.\n       Simply put, it will allow companies to build gasification \n     plants in the United States that run on coal, biomass and \n     other feedstocks, while helping to increase fuel and \n     feedstock diversity and demonstrate options for carbon \n     capture and storage. This will result in gasification plants \n     that are more efficient and help address climate change and \n     contribute to energy security.\n\n  Mr. President, I also have a letter that I want to have printed in \nthe Record at the end of my remarks from various unions--the AFL-CIO \nBuilding and Construction Trades Department, the Industrial Union, the \nUnited Mine Workers, various others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. They strongly endorse the Tester amendment. They \npreviously were part of a coal-to-liquids coalition which issued an \nearlier letter which has now been rescinded which spoke in favor of the \nBunning amendment and against the Tester amendment, and they say in \ntheir letter that they strongly support the Tester amendment.\n  Clearly, I think the Tester amendment gives us the best chance of \npromoting the use of coal to meet our energy needs in the future, and I \nstrongly support it and oppose the Bunning amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will do the same. I believe this is the right course for us \nto follow.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                     The Dow Chemical Company,\n\n                                 Midland, Michigan, June 18, 2007.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: On behalf of The Dow Chemical \n     Company, I write to offer my strongest support for Senator \n     Tester's ``Coal Innovation'' amendment to H.R. 6, the energy \n     bill pending before the Senate. Simply put, it will allow \n     companies to build gasification plants in the United States \n     that run on coal, biomass and other feedstocks, while helping \n     to increase fuel and feedstock diversity and demonstrate \n     options for carbon capture and storage. This will result in \n     gasification plants that are more efficient, help address \n     climate change and contribute to energy security.\n       Dow is excited by the prospect of this legislation being \n     enacted. As you know, Dow is one of the world's largest \n     chemical companies and is heavily reliant in the U.S. on \n     natural gas and oil as raw materials for the products we \n     manufacture. High and volatile prices for these inputs have \n     caused the company's energy bill to swell three-fold since \n     2002, reaching $22 billion last year, and have forced us to \n     look to other parts of the world for our growth.\n       In an effort to address this problem, and to help sustain \n     our operations here, we have expressed interest in utilizing \n     industrial gasification technology and in leading a \n     consortium in the U.S. to demonstrate it on a commercial \n     scale. A company like Dow could be a major purchaser of the \n     syngas and/or the naphtha that these plants produce. As you \n     know, the military also has a high interest in taking syngas-\n     based liquid fuels.\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\n       Dow would be able to make virtually all of the products we \n     currently make from natural gas liquids by substituting coal, \n     biomass or a combination thereof. The ability to manufacture \n     products like plastics, fibers and coatings would help to \n     optimize the carbon footprint of a project, since a portion \n     of the carbon would reside in finished goods that are not \n     burned. However, one major hurdle for any would-be plant \n     sponsor is the financing. The direct loans in the amendment \n     would go a long way toward helping to get these types of \n     plants built, and help provide, in the long run, a lower cost \n     alternative to oil and natural gas.\n       In addition, Dow believes that the environmental standards \n     in the bill are achievable. The requirement that 75% of the \n     carbon dioxide generated is captured will ensure that all \n     companies prepare for long-term CO2 management. This will \n     help drive action to make carbon capture and storage a \n     reality sooner rather than later.\n       Thank you for your and your staff's attention to this \n     issue, which is critical to American manufacturing, the \n     economy and our energy security. Please let us know if there \n     is any way we can be of assistance on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Andrew N. Liveris,\n     Chairman and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                                    June 18, 2007.\n       Dear Senator: On June 13, 2007 the Coal-to-Liquids (CTL) \n     Coalition sent you a letter purporting to have the support of \n     the undersigned labor unions and organizations. The CTL \n     Coalition did not clear this letter with us before sending \n     it. We regret that this letter created the mistaken \n     impression that our organizations had arrived at a position \n     on the issues addressed in the June 13 letter.\n       Unfortunately, this unauthorized correspondence has been \n     misconstrued to mean that our organizations oppose an \n     amendment that Senators Tester, Byrd, Rockefeller, Salazar, \n     and Bingaman are expected to offer later this week to the \n     Creating Long-Term Energy Alternatives for the Nation (CLEAN \n     Energy) Act of 2007 (H.R. 6).\n       On the contrary, we strongly urge your support for the \n     Tester-Byrd-Rockefeller-Salazar-Bingaman amendment to \n     establish a coal innovation direct loan program. This $10 \n     billion program would enable America to build successful \n     large-scale facilities to demonstrate carbon dioxide capture \n     for coal conversion technologies, which is essential to \n     guarantee the viability of coal into the future. The coal \n     innovation direct loan program would create thousands of U.S. \n     jobs in mining, construction, and operation.\n       We believe strongly that coal can be both an economically \n     and environmentally responsible choice for America's energy \n     security. To realize the potential of coal, America must make \n     significant investments to prove the new technologies vital \n     to its future. We therefore urge you to support the Tester-\n     Byrd-Rockefeller-Salazar-Bingaman amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n       AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department.\n       AFL-CIO Industrial Union Council.\n       International Brotherhood of Boilermakers.\n       International Union of Operating Engineers.\n       Laborers International Union of North America.\n       United Mine Workers of America.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to amendment \n1628, the Bunning amendment, for a number of reasons.\n  No. 1, this is a mandate to develop the gallonage from coal to \nliquids. I don't think it is the right direction to go. This \namendment--folks have been using apples and oranges to compare \ngreenhouse gases. The Bunning amendment says coal to liquids will be 20 \npercent better than gasoline, but coal to liquids does not produce \ngasoline-equivalent fuel, they produce the equivalent of diesel fuel, \nand that is 150 percent higher in greenhouse gas emissions than diesel \nproduced from petroleum.\n  The third thing, it is technology-limiting. Fuels produced from coal \nare only allowed under the Bunning amendment rather than articles such \nas fertilizer, chemicals, and plastics, as my amendment does.\n  Finally, there is no path to coal's future in a carbon-constrained \nworld with the Bunning amendment--no requirement to deal with the \ncarbon dioxide produced in the coal-to-liquids plants, no technology \nincentive to keep coal viable into the future, which we absolutely \nneed. If and when our greenhouse gases are regulated, these plants will \nnot be economic, and the cost to the consumers of the Bunning mandate \nwill soar.\n  I have seen many signs up today, placards, talking about how coal-to-\nliquid technology is automatically less than petroleum. That is not \ncorrect unless you have carbon capture. The Bunning amendment does not \nallow for carbon capture. My amendment does.\n  With that, I would certainly suggest and request that the body vote \nagainst the Bunning amendment and support the Tester amendment No. \n1614.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent to be permitted to speak for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have sought recognition to speak in favor of the \namendment which will be voted on later this afternoon which provides \nthat we would lift the antitrust exemption which is now held by the \nOPEC nations.\n  There have been judicial interpretations holding that the OPEC \ncountries have sovereign immunity from prosecution under the antitrust \nlaws, and it is my legal judgment that the limited judicial holdings in \nthis field are erroneous because there was a well-accepted exception to \nthe sovereign immunity doctrine where there is commercial activity \ninvolved. But in any event, there is no doubt that the Congress of the \nUnited States has the authority to legislate in the field, and I \nbelieve it would be very crucial to remove the antitrust exemption \nwhich the OPEC nations now have.\n  We have a crisis--a strong word but I think an accurate word--on \ngasoline prices today. The price of crude oil has been hovering around \n$65 a barrel. The American people are paying on average more than $3 a \ngallon for gasoline. Consumers are paying more for products because \nAmerican companies have to pay more to manufacture, and without going \ninto great detail, there is no doubt that there is a crisis in the \nfield.\n  This legislation has been acted on in the past--in the 109th Congress \nwhen I chaired the Judiciary Committee--and it has been reintroduced \nthis year. Senator Kohl is the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nAntitrust and has taken the lead, and we have a very impressive list of \nsponsors: Senator Leahy, Senator Grassley, Senator Biden, Senator \nCoburn, Senator Feingold, Senator Snowe, Senator Durbin, Senator Boxer, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Schumer, Senator Sanders, as well as my own \ncosponsorship of this legislation.\n\n  I have been interested in this subject for more than a decade because \nI think the antitrust exemption which they enjoy ought not to be. I \nwrote to President Clinton in his term in office--and received no \nanswer on the subject--a very lengthy letter which I put in the \nCongressional Record when I spoke on this amendment last week. I \nfollowed it up with a letter to President George Bush on the same \nsubject. We passed the amendment last year. As I say, it was dropped in \nconference. We are asking for a rollcall vote on it this time because \nthe practical realities are, if it gets a very strong vote--and I \nanticipate it will--it will have more stature when it gets to \nconference.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to eliminate the \nconspiracy, the concerted action where the OPEC nations get together in \na room, reduce supply, and that raises the price. This is an important \namendment, and it will contribute to reducing the price of gasoline at \nthe pump.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Roughly 9 minutes for the majority, and there \nis no time remaining for the minority.\n\n[[Page S7860]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator from Montana if \nhe wanted to use the remaining 9 minutes or some lesser amount of that. \nWe can go ahead and go to a vote whenever you are finished with your \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I just want to talk about my amendment, 1614, as long as \nwe have time to do that, very quickly recap it because I think it is \nimportant that we know the facts.\n  First of all, we have enough coal in this country, if it is used at \nthe current rate, to last us for 250 years. We need to develop it \nresponsibly. This amendment for coal to liquids will develop it \nresponsibly. What it does is it provides grants and loans for clean \ncoal technology. Let me tell you the parameters because some folks have \nsaid this can't be achieved.\n  In front of the Senate Finance Committee, it was testified that it is \nentirely capable, with the technology we have today, to have 85 percent \ncarbon capture. This amendment requires 75 percent carbon capture.\n  The National Mining Association said that with coal to liquids, \nadding some biomass with the coal, we could achieve 46 percent less in \nlife cycle greenhouse gases than comparable petroleum--46 percent less. \nThis amendment requires 20 percent less. This amendment is entirely \ndoable by the industry. If we want to develop our coal resources in a \nmanner that meets the needs of consumers as well as being able to \ndevelop our coal resources in a responsible way that would not trash \nthe environment when climate change is such a huge issue in the world, \nwe need to step forth and adopt this amendment.\n  I could go into the amendment further and talk about the potential of \nreplacing foreign oil. I could talk about how it is a win-win situation \nfor the country overall, as far as achieving energy independence, as we \npush this bill forward that deals with renewables such as biofuels and \nwind and solar and geothermal. The fact is, with this amendment there \nare no bogeymen. It is achievable by the industry, and it should be \nadopted if we are going to lead this country down the road of energy \nindependence, a road that will allow the climate change issue to be put \nto bed.\n  By the way, if we pass this amendment, I fully believe, with the two \npowerplants a month China is putting on board at 500 megawatts each, we \ncan also help lead China down a road to clean coal technology.\n  I would appreciate a ``yes'' vote on amendment 1614.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of my good \nfriend from Kentucky, Senator Bunning, and his amendment with the \nSenator from New Mexico to establish a program to help support and \npromote clean coal-to-liquid fuels. Focusing more on coal-to-liquid \nfuels will benefit our economy and our national security. Coal is a \nvital part of America's energy production, and coal is a vital part of \nKentucky's economy and history. The coal industry creates over 60,000 \njobs in my State, including approximately 15,000 coal miners. Over half \nthe country's electricity is generated by coal, and coal constitutes \nover 90 percent of America's fossil fuel resources. That means the coal \nwe can mine in this country alone would be enough to supply our Nation \nfor more than 250 years. What Saudi Arabia is to oil, America is to \ncoal. Therefore, it would be irresponsible of us, not to mention \ndownright foolish, not to invest in technology to take advantage of \nthis vital natural resource. That is why I thank my friend Senator \nBunning for his leadership on this issue.\n  Greater use of coal-to-liquid fuels will benefit the environment by \nreducing emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate \nmatter, and other pollutants as compared to conventional fuels. The \nBunning amendment also requires that coal-to-liquid fuels under this \nprogram reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent relative to \ngasoline. Greater use of coal-to-liquid fuels, which we can generate \nhere at home, will mean less dependence on foreign sources of oil. \nRight now America gets 60 percent of its oil from foreign countries, \nmany of which do not have our best interests at heart, as we certainly \nknow. Passing this amendment will mean greater energy independence and \nstrengthened national security. I commend my good friend and fellow \nSenator Jim Bunning, as well as Senator Domenici. Senator Bunning has \nbeen hard at work on this issue for a lengthy time. I thank him for his \ndedication to the coal producers and miners of Kentucky and America. \nThis amendment is the right thing to do for them, for our economy, and \nfor our national security.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 1628 offered by the Senator from Kentucky, \nMr. Bunning.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I strongly urge support for the \nTester-Byrd amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of the time to Senator Tester.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, what this amendment does is gives loans \nfor equipment to capture and sequester carbon from coal-to-liquid \ntechnology. It also allows for loans to construct the plant.\n  The Federal Government has the opportunity right now to push coal to \nliquids forward with some dollars. Also, what happens with this \namendment is--and these are entirely achievable parameters--75 percent \nof the carbon would be captured and sequestered, and it would be 20 \npercent less than life-cycle greenhouse gases from petroleum. It works \nfor this country in making us more energy independent and it\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\nworks for the global warming issue to make sure we get our hands \nwrapped around that and it is progress in the proper way for energy \ndevelopment.\n  It is endorsed by the AFL-CIO, the United Mining Association, and Dow \nChemical. This amendment is achievable, entirely achievable.\n  The industry testified in the Senate Finance Committee that they \ncould capture and sequester 85 percent. This amendment does it at 75 \npercent.\n  I encourage the adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I looked around and didn't see anyone \nelse, so I guess I will respond.\n  Fellow Senators, we defeated the best amendment to assure we would \nbring coal to liquid on board. Now what you have is an amendment that \nsays a $10 billion direct loan program--not any other kind of loan but \na direct loan--meaning the appropriators, without the White House, can \napprove in appropriations $10 billion. But the kicker is it does not \nhave to go for coal-to-liquid technology, it can go for a number of \ntechnologies, and if you can't reach it in coal, you will reach it in \nthe others. So you surely are voting for $10 billion in direct loans. \nYou are not assuring that you are going to get coal to liquid because \nthe standards are so high you may not be able to achieve them in the \ncoal to liquid.\n  That is enough for me. I thank you for giving me some time, and I \nurge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1614.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there is 30 minutes \nequally divided on the Kohl amendment. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise at this time with 13 cosponsors to \nurge all of my colleagues to support our bipartisan no-OPEC amendment \nto the Energy bill. This amendment will hold OPEC member nations to \naccount under U.S. antitrust law when they agree to limit supply or fix \nprices in violation of the most basic principles of free competition.\n  In addition to the 13 cosponsors of this amendment today, companion \nHouse legislation passed the other body last month by an overwhelming \n345-to-72 vote. This amendment will authorize the Justice Department, \nand only the Justice Department, to file suit against nations or other \nentities that participate in a conspiracy to limit supply or fix the \nprice of oil.\n  We have longed decried OPEC, but sadly no one in Government has yet \ntried to take any action. This amendment will, for the first time, \nestablish clearly and plainly that when a group of competing oil \nproducers, such as the OPEC nations, act together to restrict supply or \nto set prices, then they will be violating U.S. law.\n  As we consider the high price of gas, one fact has remained \nconsistent: the price of crude oil and, in turn, gasoline dances to the \ntune set by the OPEC members.\n  Referring to the 18-percent rise in worldwide crude oil prices since \nthe start of the year, OPEC's president commented:\n\n       We did have a bad situation at the beginning of the year, \n     but it is much better now.\n\n  The difference was OPEC's decision last fall to enforce combined \noutput cuts of 1.7 billion barrels of oil a day in order to drive up \nthe price of crude oil. Just last week, OPEC refused to add more oil \nsupply to the market despite the International Energy Agency's urgent \ncall for new supplies to meet rising demand.\n  While OPEC enjoys its newfound riches, the average American consumer \nsuffers every time he or she visits the gas pump or pays a home heating \nbill. Gas prices have now increased 71 cents a gallon just since the \nstart of the year, to a current national average of $3.01 per gallon, \nan increase of more than 30 percent.\n  The Federal Trade Commission has estimated that 85 percent of the \nvariability in the cost of gasoline is the result of changes in the \ncost of crude oil. If private companies engaged in such an \ninternational price-fixing conspiracy, there would be no question it \nwould be illegal. The actions of OPEC should be treated no differently \nbecause it is a conspiracy of nations.\n  The amendment will not authorize private lawsuits, but it will \nauthorize the Justice Department to file suit under the antitrust laws \nfor redress. It will always be at the discretion of the Justice \nDepartment and the President as to whether to take action against OPEC.\n  Our amendment will not require the Government to bring legal action \nagainst OPEC member nations. This decision will entirely remain in the \ndiscretion of the executive branch.\n  I believe the Senate should now join the 345 of our colleagues in the \nHouse and vote to support this legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, there is an old legal adage that says, \nhard cases make bad law. That seems to be the case here. No one likes \nOPEC. None of us like being put in a position of appearing to defend \nOPEC. But this amendment, in my opinion, would make bad law. The \nFramers of the Constitution wisely assigned responsibility for \nformulating foreign policy and conducting foreign relations to the \nPresident and to the Congress, not to the law courts.\n  Chief Justice Marshall said nearly two centuries ago:\n\n       The judiciary is not the department of the Government to \n     which the assertion of its interest against foreign powers is \n     confided. A question like this is more a political one than a \n     legal one.\n\n  There has been much talk in this Chamber over the years about the \nproper role of the judiciary. Nearly every time we are asked to confirm \na judicial nomination, we hear speeches given on the Senate floor about \nthe need for judges to confine themselves to the business of \ninterpreting the law, not making the law. And this is exactly what the \ncourts have done in this circumstance.\n  Here is a case where the courts have wisely recognized that OPEC's \npricing policies are not something that should be litigated in U.S. \ncourts but should instead be addressed by the political branches of the \nGovernment--the President, the executive branch, and the Congress. \nSenator Kohl's amendment would throw the issue of OPEC's\n\n[[Page S7862]]\n\noil prices back into our courts and force the courts to address those \nissues.\n  The amendment before us has its roots in a lawsuit filed by the labor \nunion nearly 30 years ago. The union at that time charged OPEC with \nprice fixing in violation of our antitrust laws.\n  The trial court dismissed the case on the ground that OPEC members \nare sovereign nations and are immune from suit. On appeal, the appeals \ncourt affirmed the dismissal, though for different reasons. It \ndismissed the suit under the act of State doctrine. In the court's \nwords:\n\n       The act of State doctrine declares a United States court \n     will not adjudicate a politically sensitive dispute which \n     would require the court to judge the legality of the \n     sovereign act of a foreign State.\n  Quoting the Supreme Court, the Court said:\n\n       Every sovereign State is bound to respect the independence \n     of every other sovereign State, and the courts of one country \n     will not sit in judgment on the acts of the government of \n     another done within its own territory.\n\n  Senator Kohl's amendment overturns the act of state doctrine, at \nleast so far as OPEC is concerned. It also creates a new offense under \nthe Sherman Act to get at OPEC, it waives sovereign immunity for this \nnew offense, and it amends the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to \ncover the new offense. In short, it sweeps away all of the legal \ndefenses OPEC members have against antitrust suits in our courts.\n  Adopting the amendment will undoubtedly be very popular, but it is \nalso very unwise. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals explained nearly \n30 years ago:\n\n       To participate adeptly in the global community, the United \n     States must speak with one voice and pursue a careful and \n     deliberate policy.\n\n  The President can do this, the court said; the judiciary cannot.\n  Here is another quote from that same decision:\n\n       When the courts engage in piecemeal adjudication of the \n     legality of the sovereign acts of states, they risk \n     disruption of our country's international diplomacy. The \n     executive may utilize protocol, economic sanction, \n     compromise, delay, and persuasion to achieve international \n     objectives. Ill-timed judicial decisions challenging the acts \n     of foreign states could nullify these tools and embarrass the \n     United States in the eyes of the world.\n\n  In this case--\n\n     the granting of any relief would in effect amount to an order \n     from a domestic court instructing a foreign sovereign to \n     alter its chosen means of allocating and profiting from its \n     own valuable natural resources. On the other hand, should the \n     court hold that OPEC's actions are legal, this would greatly \n     strengthen the bargaining hand of the OPEC nations in the \n     event that Congress or the executive chooses to condemn \n     OPEC's actions.\n\n  In addition, we here in the Senate ought to consider how enactment of \nthis amendment might affect our relations with OPEC members. What will \nbe the international repercussions when the United States starts \nawarding judgments against foreign nations and attaching their assets \nin this country? What sort of precedent will the amendment set in the \ninternational community? Will other nations start to view our trade \npolicies--such as our nuclear trade restrictions--as violations of \ntheir antitrust laws?\n  The Bush administration has offered us answers to some of these \nquestions. Its statement of administration policy on this bill, which \nwe are considering here in the Senate, says that:\n\n       The consequent targeting of foreign direct investment in \n     the United States as a source of damage awards would likely \n     spur retaliatory action against American interests in those \n     countries and lead to a reduction in oil available to U.S. \n     refiners. Not only would such a result substantially harm \n     U.S. interests abroad, it would discourage foreign investment \n     in the United States economy.\n\n  For these reasons, the administration concluded:\n\n       If a bill including such a provision is presented to the \n     President--\n\n  That is the bill we are considering right here on the Senate floor.\n\n     --his senior advisers will recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against the Kohl \namendment.\n  Madam President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8\\1/2\\ minutes in opposition, and \n11\\1/2\\ minutes in support.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I join Senator Kohl as a cosponsor of his \nNOPEC amendment and urge the Senate to adopt it. Under Senator Kohl's \nleadership, the NOPEC bill has passed unanimously out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee without amendment in four separate Congresses, \nunder both Democratic and Republican leadership.\n  The support for this legislation is both bipartisan and bicameral. \nThe House of Representatives recently passed NOPEC with 345 Members \nvoting for it.\n  NOPEC will simply hold accountable certain oil-producing nations for \ntheir collusive behavior that has artificially reduced the supply and \ninflated the price of fuel. Unless this amendment becomes law, \nconsumers across the Nation will continue to suffer.\n  The rise and fall of oil and gas prices has a direct impact on \nAmerican consumers and our economy. Last month, gas prices in the \nUnited States reached a near record high. While prices have come down \nslightly in recent weeks, that is no reason to condone anticompetitive \nconduct by foreign government cartels. American consumers should not be \nheld economic hostage to the whim of colluding, foreign governments.\n  The Associated Press recently reported the Iranian oil minister's \nannouncement that members of OPEC would not increase the supply of oil \ndespite reports that demand is on the rise. Without collusion, OPEC \nmembers would compete to serve that demand and prices at home would \nfall.\n  When entities engage in anticompetitive conduct that harms American \nconsumers, it is the responsibility of the Department of Justice to \ninvestigate and prosecute. It is wrong to let members of OPEC off the \nhook just because their anticompetitive practices come with the seal of \napproval of national governments. I am disappointed that the \nadministration does not share this view and has threatened a veto.\n  Americans deserve better, and it is time for Congress to act. We know \nthe oil cartel and Big Oil companies like things just the way they are, \nand why shouldn't they? They continue to break new records as they roll \nup huge profits taken from consumers' pockets.\n  I hope this Senate and this Congress will take the side of American \nconsumers, not the side of Status Quo, Incorporated. We cannot claim to \nbe energy independent while we permit foreign governments to manipulate \noil prices in an anticompetitive manner. I thank Senator Kohl for his \nleadership on this issue.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I yield several minutes to Senator \nLincoln.\n  I am sorry, did the Senator from Rhode Island wish to speak?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If I may, but it is to a different amendment. It is \nfor the Cardin amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, if we could complete the debate on \nthis amendment, and then if the Senator wishes to yield back time, we \ncould proceed to debate on the next amendment.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. That will be fine.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I will yield several minutes to Senator \nLincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1556\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin, \nSenator Kohl, for giving me a few moments.\n  My comments are on a slightly different topic today, and I appreciate \nmy colleague yielding to me. I filed an amendment, No. 1556, to the \nenergy legislation almost a week ago. Since that time, I have pleaded \nwith my colleagues to help reach an agreement where I could come to the \nfloor and offer this important amendment. I offered it several times \nlast week in the latter part of the week so it could be considered by \nthe Chamber and get an up-or-down vote on its merits. Unfortunately, I \nunderstand that certain colleagues are unwilling to lift their \nobjection to this amendment being considered on the floor under any \ncircumstances. So I come to the floor today to try to express some of \nmy frustrations in dealing with this bill and particularly my \namendment, not\n\n[[Page S7863]]\n\nonly for myself and many of my colleagues who are strongly in support \nof my amendment but also for the hard-working farm families across our \nNation.\n  The amendment I introduced with my good friend and colleague from New \nMexico, Senator Domenici, is quite simple. It is identical to the \nlegislation we cosponsored together last Congress and have reintroduced \nagain this year, which is S. 807. The bill already has 26 cosponsors in \nthe Senate and 121 cosponsors in the House. This amendment is \nparticularly timely and appropriate for the legislation we are \ncurrently considering in the Chamber today because there is a growing \nunderstanding in this countryside that without the clarification \nprovided by this amendment, requirements and liabilities under CERCLA, \na law designed to clean up toxic industrial pollutants, could be \nunfairly applied to America's farmers and ranchers of all sizes, of any \nsize, large or small. These are the very men and women who hold the \nfuture of renewable energy production in this country in their hands \nand in their production operations.\n  The underlying bill we will consider today would take steps to \npromote the use of biomass, and specifically animal manure, as an \nimportant and critical source of renewable energy. It is widely known \nthat farmers are beginning to use their excess manure for energy \ngeneration already, through methane digesters and other innovative \ntechnologies that are developing on a day-to-day basis. The expanded \nuse of animal manure for energy production not only promotes our \nNation's energy independence, it is also a way to control the \nunavoidable supply of manure and litter from livestock production in an \nenvironmentally friendly manner while adding economic value for our \nfarm families and our rural communities.\n  This is a win-win situation for our Nation and especially for \nAmerican agriculture. Yet as this Chamber stands ready to incentivize \nthese innovative practices and spur the growth of alternative \ntechnologies to manage this waste, pending lawsuits threaten the entire \nviability of this emerging industry, not to mention the viability of \nthe hard-working farm families across our country.\n  We should not stand by and allow a situation where farmers or those \nwho are transporting manure for energy production or other purposes are \nhandling a hazardous waste subject to CERCLA's strict and punitive \nliability provisions.\n  It is worth noting that CERCLA section 101(14) specifically excludes \npetroleum. Here we are, looking to lessen our independence on foreign \noil and petroleum products, yet they are exempt from CERCLA. We are \nlooking at the possibility of agricultural by-products being included \nin CERCLA under the definition of hazardous waste substances but \npetroleum releases are not subject to CERCLA reporting and liability \nprovisions. Why is it these same liability provisions should apply to \nour Nation's farmers and ranchers, and particularly our dairy farmers? \nFarmers and ranchers have always been responsible stewards of the land, \nmaking great strides to preserve a healthy environment for their food \nproduction but also for their families and communities. Keep in mind \nthat agricultural operations are already regulated under the Clean \nWater and the Clean Air Acts, as well as other Federal and State \nenvironmental laws. The larger size operations are subject to \nmanagement practices. These are the appropriate regulatory tools to \nmanage the environmental impacts of agriculture in this country, and \nany farmer will tell you that our U.S. producers are already subject to \nmuch greater scrutiny in this area than their foreign competitors. That \nis one reason why Americans continue to enjoy the safest food supply in \nthe world, produced right here at home by our Nation's farm families, \nworking as hard as they possibly can to not only produce that safe food \nand fiber but to do it in a way that is respectful of the environment \nunder the regulations we put upon them. The last thing we need to do is \nstand by and allow policies that encourage the outsourcing of food \nproduction in this country.\n  On that note, it is my view that Congress never intended for CERCLA \nto apply to agriculture in the first place. In fact, the idea of \nincluding animal agriculture under CERCLA was never raised during the \nfirst two decades of this law's existence. If normal animal manure is \nfound by the courts to be a hazardous substance under CERCLA, then \nvirtually every farming operation in the country could be potentially \nexposed to severe liability and penalties under the law. Clearly, \nCongress never intended such an outcome, and we should take the \nnecessary steps by taking up and passing my amendment to ensure that \nthe courts clearly understand what our congressional intent is. We \nshould not jeopardize American agriculture by allowing courts to impose \nCERCLA liability on farmers for their traditional farming practices, \nincluding the use of manure as a beneficial fertilizer or an emerging \nfeedstock for renewable energy production. This would be most \nunfortunate.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at this and be aware. I will continue \nmy efforts to clarify that CERCLA liability does not apply to \nagriculture, to our livestock, to our ranches and our dairy farms, \nmaking sure that agriculture in this country can continue to do what it \nhas always done, and that is to produce a safe, abundant, and \naffordable food supply under the regulations we provide them.\n  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for yielding, and I yield back his \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I believe we have 8 minutes remaining \nin opposition, and I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1519\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, before the Senator from Arkansas leaves the \nfloor, I wish to say I associate myself with her remarks as they \npertain to both subjects, and in particular CERCLA, in which we both \nshare a common interest. We have to get something done; we both know \nit. Those who are not letting us have a chance at getting a vote will \nfind out sooner or later we are going to get a vote, and what is fair \nand reasonable will prevail. We are going to work hard to see that is \ndone sooner rather than later.\n  Having said that, I want to talk about the No-OPEC amendment that \nwould permit legal action to be brought in U.S. courts by the \nDepartment of Justice on alleged price-fixing and other anticompetitive \nbehavior affecting petroleum product pricing, production, and \ndistribution by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting \nCountries--OPEC.\n  While I can see at some level how this idea appeals to our sense of \nfairness and our frustration about oil prices, I must oppose this \namendment and join with my chairman, because it is reality, not \nsentiment, that counts in public policy. The reality is this amendment \nwould be unenforceable. OPEC producers would simply decide not to sell \noil to us any longer. One-third of the oil used in the United States \nevery day comes from an OPEC member. They would suffer the loss of some \nprofits, but our entire economy could come to a grinding halt.\n  Another problem I have with the amendment is it is a major change in \ninternational law that has potential applications beyond the oil \nsector. The sovereignty of nations is put into question by this \namendment. I know of no instance when the United States Government sued \na foreign government.\n  I think if this amendment passes, we can expect a jittery oil market \nto become even more nervous. We can expect that. In reality, that means \nhigher prices. We can expect less transparency from OPEC. In reality, \nthat means higher prices. We can also expect less cooperation from OPEC \nin the future, and I think that, too, will lead to higher prices.\n  I believe this amendment should fail, but obviously, looking at the \npast and looking at the propensity of Senators to vote on this \namendment without looking at the realities of it, I am not too hopeful. \nNonetheless, that is the extent of my remarks.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes in opposition and about \n3\\1/2\\ in favor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I think the Senator from Wisconsin \nshould be given the chance to conclude\n\n[[Page S7864]]\n\nhis remarks or close the argument. I will yield back the time in \nopposition and allow Senator Kohl to use whatever additional times he \nwants. Then we can close the debate on this amendment and proceed to \nthe next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I believe the arguments set forth by the \nadministration, as well as those on the floor today in opposition to \nthis bill, are without merit. For example, we disagree that it would \nharm U.S. interests overseas.\n  The Justice Department has taken action to sue many foreign cartels \nthat have engaged in price fixing, including, for example, the \ninternational vitamin cartel. There has been no retaliation against \nU.S. business interests abroad.\n  Only 11 Nations in the world are members of the OPEC oil cartel. \nThere would be no reason for any other Nation to retaliate against the \nUnited States for attempting to enforce this legislation. The idea that \nOPEC could strongly discourage investment in the U.S. economy is \nlikewise speculative and without basis. The existence of strong U.S. \nantitrust laws for over a century, laws that are already reaching \nforeign conduct affecting the U.S. markets, has not discouraged \ninvestment in the United States.\n  Further, and this is enormously important, this legislation does not \nrequire the administration to do anything. It simply gives them the \nauthority to bring action in court against the OPEC oil cartel. It \nseems to me the legislation would have a constructive effect in \nbringing notice to the OPEC oil cartel that we do have recourse, should \nit be necessary, to move against them in retaliation of their fixing \nprices of oil at unreasonably high levels.\n  That is why I believe this legislation should be passed by this body \nas it was passed by the House of Representatives.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think Senator Bingaman yielded our time back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. There will now be 30 \nminutes of debate on the Thune amendment. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I see Senator Whitehouse is waiting to \nspeak on the Cardin amendment. Senator Thune is agreeable to letting \nhim speak for 3 minutes or so on that before beginning discussion on \nthe Thune amendment. So I ask unanimous consent that that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized for 3 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1610\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank Senators Bingaman and Thune for their \ncourtesy. I am here today to express my support for an amendment \nsponsored by my colleague, Senator Cardin, regarding State approval for \nliquefied natural gas terminals. I am a cosponsor of this important \nbipartisan amendment with Senators Mikulski, Snowe, Dodd, Kerry, \nKennedy, Boxer, Lieberman, and my senior Senator, Jack Reed of Rhode \nIsland.\n  Our country is grappling with a serious and difficult question: how \nto meet our growing energy needs without depleting our natural \nresources, threatening our environment or endangering our people.\n  I strongly support the work of Senators Boxer and Bingaman, with many \nof our colleagues, to take a significant step forward in our use of \nalternative and renewable fuels. But as we develop these new and \nemerging fuel sources, we must take great care to balance our need for \nenergy with other imperatives.\n  Liquefied natural gas is rapidly assuming a larger share of the \noverall natural gas market. Over 40 new LNG terminals are now proposed \nfor construction, many of which are planned near heavily populated \nareas or environmentally sensitive coastal areas. Unfortunately, in \ntheir haste to expand this market, the LNG industry and the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission have dismissed the risks this poses to \npublic safety and the environment. I am particularly concerned about a \nproposed LNG terminal in Fall River, MA, a town of nearly 100,000 \npeople, barely over the State line from Rhode Island.\n  This is Rhode Island's treasured Narragansett Bay. The Bay is used, \nparticularly on beautiful summer days such as today, for commercial and \nrecreational boating and fishing. Tens of thousands of Rhode Islanders \nlive along its shores, and our Bay is in many ways the economic heart, \nas well as the environmental and recreational heart, of our ocean \nState.\n  Now, to reach the LNG facility proposed for Fall River, LNG tankers \nwould have to navigate 21 nautical miles through Narragansett Bay, \npassing directly by the homes and businesses of 64,000 Rhode Island \nresidents. Along the way, tankers would pass under four heavily \ntrafficked bridges and execute what the Coast Guard itself recently \ndescribed as extremely challenging navigational maneuvers, as many as \n130 times per year.\n  Moreover, the tanker requires a security zone around it as it \nproceeds through the Bay. Here is the tanker. This is the size of the \nsecurity zone it requires, completely occupying the east passage going \nup through Narragansett Bay between Newport and Jamestown. It would \ndisplace all recreational boaters and other cargo boats and disrupt \nbridge traffic as it transits.\n  The residents of my State of Rhode Island have spoken loudly and in \nlarge numbers against the LNG terminal proposed for Fall River. I have \nheard their deep concern about the environmental and security risks \nposed by LNG tankers passing so close to their homes and communities. \nYet their voices have not been heard adequately in the current process \nfor permitting LNG terminals.\n  This amendment would help correct this flaw and give all States and \ncommunities the seat at the table they deserve, by requiring the \nconcurrence of affected States for permits to build liquefied natural \ngas terminals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1609\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I rise today in support of my amendment \nto create clean energy corridors, which will greatly enhance our grid \nsystem to transmit clean and renewable energy.\n  Much of the debate in this Energy bill has focused on renewable \nenergy. How much renewable energy should we use? How should it be \nproduced? Who should be required to use it? However, this debate has \noverlooked a key component in this argument, which is, how do we \ntransport this energy from areas with high concentrations of renewable \nresources to areas with high demand for electrical power?\n  Oftentimes, clean, renewable sources of power are located in rural \nareas with low demand for electricity and limited capacity to transmit \nlarge amounts of power long distances. At the other end of the \nspectrum, States with larger urban areas are passing State laws that \nrequire the use of renewable energy. In many cases, it is more \neconomical to import that energy from other areas of the country.\n  It is critical that we create the infrastructure to allow that \nmovement of energy to happen. I have to point to this chart to \nillustrate exactly how my State of South Dakota serves as a prime \nexample of this dilemma. In South Dakota, we are blessed to have \nabundant sources of wind. In fact, according to the U.S. Department of \nEnergy, South Dakota has enough wind to produce 566 gigawatts of \nelectric power from wind, which is the equivalent of 55 percent of the \nNation's electricity demand.\n  I will refer to the chart. If you look at these red areas and the \npink areas, the purple areas around the country, all these different \ncolors demonstrate varying amounts of wind energy.\n  Of course, as you can see, South Dakota and North Dakota, Minnesota, \nIowa, have enormous amounts of wind energy available. Although South \nDakota has an abundant source of wind, this renewable resource is \ndramatically underdeveloped in my State.\n  In fact, we have less than one-tenth the wind energy production of \nour neighboring States, even though our wind resources are far \nsuperior. The fundamental problem is we don't have the population \nmarkets to use large amounts of wind power within my State's borders.\n\n[[Page S7865]]\n\n  More importantly, we lack the transmission capacity to carry wind \npower from rural areas in South Dakota to urban areas in other areas of \nthe country. This amendment includes simple provisions that would \nsignificantly improve transmission development for renewable sources of \nenergy.\n  First, this amendment would direct the Department of Energy to \nidentify areas with transmission constraints that increase costs to \nconsumers, limit resource options to serve load growth or limit access \nto sources of clean, renewable energy, such as wind, solar, geothermal \nenergy, and biomass.\n  Upon completion of this study, after verifying all alternatives and \npublic comments, the Department of Energy could then designate these \nareas as ``National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors.''\n  These corridors, which enjoyed broad bipartisan support as part of \nthe Energy Policy Act of 2005, are important tools for transmission \ndevelopment. Under current law, these corridors are targeted toward \nareas experiencing heavy grid congestion. My amendment would expand the \ndesignation of these corridors to include access to clean, renewable \nsources of energy.\n  This amendment also directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \nto establish regulations that allow public utilities to allocate and \nrecover costs associated with building the additional transmission \ninfrastructure for wind and other forms of renewable energy. It ensures \nthat rates associated with this development are reasonable, just, and \nnondiscriminatory.\n  By overcoming some of the inherent obstacles associated with \ntransmitting renewable energy long distances, I believe this amendment \npromotes clean, renewable sources of energy in a commonsense fashion.\n  This amendment will serve as the blueprint for the 21st century grid \nby facilitating the national scale designation and construction of \nclean energy corridors that will enable the delivery of clean, \nsustainable, reliable power to consumers across this country.\n  As I have met with people from the industry, as I have traveled my \nState, as I have talked with those who invest in energy projects, it is \nclear that this is one of the issues that presents a major obstacle to \nwind energy development in this country. This amendment helps address \nthat by creating and opening these corridors, clean energy corridors \nthat would allow clean green wind energy to make it from areas where it \nis in abundance, places such as the State of South Dakota, to places in \nthe country that desperately need affordable power.\n  So I hope my colleagues in the Senate will support this amendment and \ndo something that will significantly address and further the production \nof wind energy and affordable electricity to America's consumers.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I wish to say to the Senator, I \ncongratulate you on this amendment, the scope of the amendment and the \nrationale. It is something we need. From my standpoint, I am in favor \nof it. It will not require a rollcall vote. Hopefully, we can dispose \nof your amendment very shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, Senator Thune's amendment makes a \nmajor change in a provision of the Federal Power Act that governs the \nsiting of electric transmission lines. Until 2 years ago, the siting of \nelectric transmission lines was under the exclusive control of the \nStates. The Federal Power Act gave neither the Secretary of Energy nor \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the authority to site \ntransmission lines.\n  The States tended to make their siting decisions in the best \ninterests of their citizens, not necessarily in the best interests of \nthe citizens of neighboring or even distant States that might benefit \nby the long distance transmission of electricity.\n  Two years ago, in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which I worked on \nwith Senator Domenici, which amended the Federal Power Act to provide \nwhat is called the Federal backstop siting authority. Specifically, we \ndirected the Secretary of Energy to conduct a comprehensive national \nstudy of electric transmission congestion once every 3 years.\n  We then authorized the Secretary to designate, based on the study, \nany geographic areas experiencing electric transmission congestion as \n``national interest electric transmission corridors.'' The Secretary \ncompleted the first congestion study last August, and he has begun \nproceedings to designate the first national interest corridors.\n  Designation of an area as a national interest corridor is likely to \nhave serious consequences. Under the law we passed 2 years ago, a \nutility that wants to build an electric transmission line within the \ncorridor can apply to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for a \npermit, and the Commission can approve construction of the transmission \nline without the permission of or even over the objections of the \nState. Once the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issues the utility \na permit, the utility can then go into Federal court and exercise the \nFederal Government's power of eminent domain and take private property \nto erect the transmission line.\n  I have heard speeches in the time I have served in the Senate from \nmany of my colleagues about their concern over the exercise of the \npower of eminent domain. The passage of the Thune amendment \nsubstantially increases the likelihood that authority, that power of \neminent domain, will be exercised against private property rights. \nGiving Federal officials and private utilities these powers was a major \nchange in Federal law and a major departure from past practice. \nNonetheless, we believed the step was warranted to ensure that the \nnational interest in a national electric grid was protected. We \nbelieved that entrusting the Secretary of Energy with the task of \nstudying congestion on a national basis and allowing the Secretary to \ndesignate only those areas which affected the national interest would \nprevent abuse of this Federal eminent domain authority.\n  Even though this authority is less than 2 years old, no corridors \nhave yet been designated, no construction permits have been issued, and \nno private property has been taken. The authority is already, however, \nproving very controversial. There is major opposition to the use of \nthis authority just west of here in northern Virginia and in other \nareas of the country. There has been talk of repealing the authority.\n  The Thune amendment will only add to the controversy. It makes a \nfundamental change in the current authority. The Thune amendment says \nthat ``the Secretary may designate additional corridors . . . upon the \napplication by an interested person.'' So even though the Secretary of \nEnergy did not find that a particular area presented congestion \nconcerns of national interest in conducting his congestion study last \nyear and even though the Secretary of Energy did not see fit to propose \nan area as a national interest corridor, a utility that would like to \nmake use of the Federal eminent domain authority to take private \nproperty can apply to the Secretary and the Secretary could then \ndesignate the area as a corridor under this new authority. This, as one \nof the authors of the provision we put in law in 2005, is a major \nexpansion of that authority, and it is an unwarranted expansion.\n  In addition, the Thune amendment contains additional provisions on \nrates and recovery of costs which direct the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to issue new rules setting transmission rates for the \nrecovery of the cost of transmission lines in national interest \ncorridors. Frankly, I am not entirely sure what the purpose of these \nprovisions are. I am not sure how these provisions affect the \nratemaking authority the Commission already exercises under the Federal \nPower Act. They are either redundant or unnecessary or else they \nauthorize the Commission to set up a new rulemaking standard that will \napply in national interest corridors different from the standard the \nCommission applies elsewhere.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. We should give the \nprogram we created in the Energy Policy Act just 2 years ago a chance \nto work before we dramatically expand it in ways that are not entirely \nclear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S7866]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, because our very economic security is \ndependent on the availability of electricity, our Nation must reinforce \nits electric power transmission system.\n  In the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress sought to establish \nnational interest electric transmission corridors to make America's \nelectricity grid more secure by ensuring there is enough capacity in \nessential areas.\n  In EPAct, we directed the Energy Department to identify regions where \nelectricity reliability is threatened by transmission congestion and to \ndesignate national corridors. Congress further provided FERC with \n``backstop siting'' authority for the construction of transmission \nfacilities if the states involved are unable or unwilling to do so.\n  Just recently, DOE unveiled the following two draft corridor \ndesignations: the Mid-Atlantic Area National Corridor, which runs from \nNew York to Northern Virginia; and the Southwest Area National \nCorridor, which includes counties in southern California, western \nArizona, and southern Nevada.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Thune would authorize the Energy \nDepartment, in designating national corridors, to consider transmission \nconstraints or congestion that increases costs to consumers; limits \nresource options to serve load growth; or limits access to sources of \nclean energy, such as wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass.\n  Now we just had a debate on the Senate floor last week on the use of \nrenewable energy sources. We all support the increased use of renewable \nenergy sources but there is often heated opposition to the siting of \ntransmission facilities. This is not in the national interest.\n  I don't see how you can support a mandate for more renewable energy \nsources but then oppose the designation of national corridors to get \nthe transmission built that is needed to move these renewable energy \nsources to market.\n  Yet as we consider this amendment to expand the work we began in the \nEnergy Policy Act of 2005, there are those in the House that are \nattempting to block the needed funding to implement the national \ncorridors designations out of NIMBY concerns. Again, such attempts are \nnot in the national interest.\n  The siting provision in EPAct literally provides a light at the end \nof the tunnel for parts of the country where the electricity grid is at \nrisk due to congestion.\n  The Thune amendment simply seeks to allow national corridor \ndesignations to ensure the necessary transmission to access clean \nsources of energy like wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Thune amendment.\n  I congratulate Senator Thune for his amendment because it is just a \nrational extension and expansion of what we did in the Energy Policy \nAct. I happened to be part of that Energy Policy Act. As a matter of \nfact, I think I can say that for years before we got together and \nSenator Bingaman and I were carrying it, we couldn't get it through. \nBut we did get it through. I believe we got it through because it was \nhigh time the United States decided that for most matters we could \nstand on States rights, but every now and then something percolated up \nthat demanded that we take a serious look at a greater interest of the \nFederal Government.\n  That is all we are talking about here. If the development of our \nelectric grid ran into situations where you couldn't go through because \nof the obstinacy of a State to your moving from one State to another or \none property owner had a transmission line totally locked up, you could \nback that up with the Federal Government ending up saying: It has to go \nbecause it is a big national interest. You are just kind of \npiggybacking on that national interest already found in that law as we \npassed it. Therefore, I believe it is appropriate that we pass this \namendment tonight.\n  I yield back any time I have. I wonder if Senator Bingaman would so \nwe could vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Before I yield back my time, I thank both Senators from \nNew Mexico. They have both been great leaders on the energy issue.\n  The 2005 Energy Act was a landmark accomplishment in the Congress. It \nset a lot of new policy with regard to energy and moved us in a \ndirection that gets us less dependent upon foreign sources of energy \nand more energy independent, which I think is what this debate is all \nabout.\n  I argue with respect to this amendment that it builds upon the work \nwe did in 2005. In fact, that amendment that was talked about in 2005 \nwhich deals with those areas which are experiencing heavy grid \ncongestion--this simply expands that designation to those corridors to \ninclude access to clean, renewable sources of energy, which I believe \nis what a part of this debate is all about; that is, how do we take \nenergy sources in this country, make them more available to people \nacross the country, and lessen the dependence on foreign sources of \nenergy?\n  I use my State as a prime example. There are lots of different \nregulatory bodies, whether it is the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, the Western Area Power Administration, the Midwest \nIndependent System Operators, whether it is the Public Utilities \nCommission of the State of South Dakota, there is a balkanization of \nnetworks out there that has evolved over time that has created these \nbarriers in the grid to getting power from where it is generated, where \nit is produced, to where it is needed. My State is a good example of \nthat. On the border of South Dakota, we have what is called a pancaking \nproblem where there is a stacking of fees that makes it difficult to \nget wind generated in South Dakota across State lines into other areas \nthat could benefit from it.\n  This is fairly straightforward and consistent with the good work that \nwas done in the Energy bill in 2005. It doesn't in any way undermine or \ncontradict that but complements it in a way that is consistent with \nwhat our priorities should be and what our objectives are in terms of \nenergy policy.\n  I appreciate the comments of both of my colleagues from New Mexico, \nand I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I yield back any additional time \nremaining in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1609.\n  The amendment (No. 1609) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1610\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there remains 11\\1/\n2\\ minutes in support of and 15 minutes in opposition to amendment No. \n1610 offered by the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The amendment I am proposing with Senators Mikulski, Snowe, Dodd, \nKerry, Reed, Kennedy, Whitehouse, Boxer, and Lieberman would restore \nthe authority of our State and local governments to protect the \nenvironment and ensure public safety with respect to the siting of \nliquefied natural gas--LNG--terminals within their States. This measure \nsimply gives our States a say as to whether these kinds of facilities \nshould be built within their boundaries and, if so, the exact location.\n  It amends the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. Under that law, the \nArmy Corps of Engineers, acting for the Secretary of the Army, is \nresponsible for issuing permits to anyone who wants to build a \nstructure in and above waters of the United States. These are often \ncalled section 10 permits because that is where the provision is found \nin the Rivers and Harbors Act.\n  I wish to clarify, we are not changing the authority of the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission. Their authority to site is not changed by \nthis amendment. What we are doing is requiring the Army Corps to work \nwith our States before they issue their permits under the Rivers and \nHarbors Act. This is not about stopping LNG plants from being sited. \nToday, there are six in our country. One is located in my State of \nMaryland in the right location. This amendment is about siting\n\n[[Page S7867]]\n\nLNG plants where they should be sited and having confidence in \nfederalism and in our States. Our States will act responsibly, but they \nshould be consulted before LNG plants are sited. That is what this \namendment will do. We want to make sure they are located in the right \nlocations.\n  My colleague from Rhode Island pointed out pretty vividly the \nconcerns he has about a site up in the New England area. AES Sparrows \nPoint LNG and Mid-Atlantic Express have proposed building a new \nterminal near a densely populated area of Baltimore. That is the wrong \nlocation for an LNG plant. If we had consultation and working with the \nStates, we would be able to site these facilities without the risk that \nthey will be located in areas where they should not be. That is what \nthe amendment is about. In our area, our congressional delegation, \nGovernor O'Malley, Baltimore County Executive Jim Smith, and other \nlocal officials have all come out against this particular location \nbecause of the risk to the community, because of the risk to the \nenvironment.\n  This amendment is very simple. It requires the Army Corps to work \nwith our States before an LNG license could be issued under section 10 \npermits. It is the right way for federalism to work. We should take \nadvantage of each State's unique understanding of the issues it faces \nand make sure that expertise is considered in a meaningful way. That is \nwhy the Coastal States Organization supports this amendment. They \nbelieve it is the right sharing of how LNG plants should be sited.\n  I urge my colleagues to respect federalism. Respect the goodwill of \nour States. Respect the fact that we want LNG facilities and terminals \nto be located, but we want them to be located in the right location.\n  I yield my colleague from Maryland 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank my colleague.\n  I understand this is his first amendment that will be voted on in the \nSenate. I am proud to stand with him as he stands up for Maryland and \nalso stands up for the fact that when we are talking about the siting \nof an LNG facility, those who are the most affected should have the \nmost to say, which means the State in which it is being located. I \nsupport this amendment because it is also the right public policy and \nbecause it is the right public policy for Maryland.\n  I am absolutely opposed to a new LNG facility in Sparrows Point, MD. \nAs the senior Senator from Maryland, I will do all I can to protect the \npeople of Baltimore and to protect the Port of Baltimore. I oppose this \nLNG facility because of my fears and frustrations. I worry about a \nterrorist attack. I worry about an accident with ghoulish consequences. \nThis is a national security issue and a community security issue, not \njust an energy or a budget issue.\n  These concerns are not mine alone. According to a GAO report, \nscientists and engineers have raised enormous concern about the \npotential hazard of an accident or an attack on LNG facilities. GAO \nsays we don't know about the impact of an LNG accident on public \nsafety. We are talking about possible injury and death. How can anyone \nmake a decision on LNG without knowing the decision on public safety?\n  This is why I support this amendment. This amendment gives States and \ncommunities a stronger voice by making sure the Army Corps of Engineers \ngets the approval of the affected State before giving permits for \nconstruction for an LNG facility. That means the Governor can say: \n``Hold on a minute; this is not good for my State,'' or, ``Hold on a \nminute; it is good for my State.''\n\n  We cannot let a Federal agency rubberstamp plans for an LNG facility. \nI am committed to promoting America's energy independence, but it must \nnot compromise our national security or our neighborhood security. I \nwant to make sure we know the consequence of what happens when an LNG \nfacility comes to a geographic area. What can be done and should be \ndone to review and control the plants, the docks, the ships, the crews?\n  I do not want permits issued and foreign-flagged tankers coming to \nour ports until we know key answers. I do not want permits authored by \nFederal agencies when our States are adamantly opposed and they are not \ninvolved in the decision making. Many States will welcome it. Some \nStates will raise questions as we have.\n  It is my responsibility as a Senator to make sure we ask the right \nquestions to protect the American people. But, most of all, we want to \ngive the people most affected something to say.\n  We worry about this second LNG facility in Sparrows Point. It is 50 \nmiles up the Chesapeake Bay. These tankers will have to pass under the \nBay Bridge. My Governor is worried about the impact on the Port of \nBaltimore, and the people are worried about the impact on the \ncommunity.\n  My colleague says we have another facility, and it was in the right \nplace. Well, I am not sure it was in the right place. They built this \nLNG facility 3 miles away from a nuclear powerplant--3 miles away from \na nuclear powerplant--but it got closed in the 1980s when the market \nwent down. But guess what. FERC issued a permit to reopen Cove Point in \na different part of the State 1 month after 9/11, and they did not ask \nabout security concerns. It took this Senator--and then my colleague, \nSenator Sarbanes, and I--demanding the Department of Homeland Security \nget involved, demanding the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to say: Is it \nOK to have an LNG facility down the street? I had to force the Coast \nGuard to look at it from a security standpoint rather than just an \nenvironmental standpoint.\n  I worry about the rockfish in the bay, but I worry about the people \nwho eat the rockfish in the bay, meaning my constituents. We finally \ngot the reviews we needed and we moved ahead with the permit. Let me \ntell you, I am on the side of safety, and I believe the safest thing is \nto make sure the Governor has a chance to comment with the Corps and to \nhave an expressed impact on this permit facility.\n  I think the Senator's policy is a wise one; it is a prudent one. It \nis narrowly crafted. I ask my colleagues to adopt the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do we have in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, I want to take 5 minutes and yield the rest of it \nto Senator Bingaman. But I do want to make a point that this country is \ngoing to need large amounts of natural gas over the next 15, 20, 30 \nyears. One source is probably going to be LNG, liquefied natural gas. \nIt is terribly important for our country that we have this available \nwhen we need it, and if the price is right that we be able to locate \nsites that serve the United States.\n  Now, frankly, when we passed the Energy Policy Act, there were three \nor four things that were very much on the minds of those who wanted to \ndeliver energy to the United States. I say to my new friend, the new \nSenator from Maryland, one of those at that particular time happened to \nbe liquefied natural gas and those around the world who were trying to \nfigure out whether the United States was going to be a place where they \ncould sell liquefied natural gas or was it going to be a place where \nthey could be held up forever.\n  We had to decide, as we worked through this very gigantic, gargantuan \nbill, what we were going to do about the concern on the part of the LNG \nmarket that if you left the law as it was, every State's Governor would \nhave a veto power, and in some instances mayors would have veto power \nover an LNG site. We decided that would not work.\n  Now, we did not take away everyone's power. As a matter of fact, we \nencouraged cooperation. We encouraged the involvement of the States and \nthe local governments with the LNG company, and we said only when you \nget to the point where you cannot reach agreement does the Federal \nGovernment step in, and then they backstop it and make a determination, \nthrough FERC, what is in the interest of our Nation, what is fair, and \nwhat is right.\n  Frankly, I don't know the facts about the Maryland plant, and I do \nnot believe we need to know them on the floor of the Senate, nor do the \nSenators. What we need to know is we have a good law now on the books \nthat\n\n[[Page S7868]]\n\ngives involvement and participation to everyone who ought to have that, \nbut it does not give a Governor veto power over the site.\n  I correct any implications or direct statements by my good friend, \nthe new Senator from Maryland. There is no question the amendment which \nthey offer seeks veto power on the part of the Governor, gives the \nultimate control to the Governor of the State as to what happens to an \napplication. I do not believe that is what we wanted when we \noverwhelmingly--as the occupant of the chair has said so many times--in \na bipartisan manner passed the Energy Policy Act.\n  I do not think we intended the first time we had a problem that \nsomebody would come to the floor and change that wonderful law that was \nclear as could be, that when it came to locating LNG plants, we were \nnot going to revert back to where we were and take the power away from \nFERC, the Federal agency in charge, and reinvest it in the Governor of \nthe State.\n  We all know how this happens. People get disgruntled about a site, \nthey go to the Governor, we immediately have a political tussle, and, \nall of a sudden, the Governor, talking to 500, 600, 700 people at a \nmeeting, cannot get out of it, and that puts the Governor in the \nposition where he has to say: I am not going to let that happen.\n  We saw that over the years. We saw it in other areas. We were bold \nenough in that Energy Act to change that situation, not only when it \ncame to this kind of LNG siting but we also changed it--just a while \nago we were talking about it as it pertained to the grid--the occupant \nof the chair might recall, where we said, if the grid gets clogged up, \nwhere you cannot get things done, we are going to actually put power in \nthe Federal Government to use its public powers to take that gorging \nand dislodge it through eminent domain.\n  We did that, and we did other things, all in the interest of what we \nknew was true; that you ultimately had to let energy sources and energy \ngrids and energy plants--you had to let the Federal Government have the \nlast say, especially where arbitrariness on the part of the local unit \nwas entering the picture and they wanted their way, their way under all \ncircumstances.\n  I thank the Chair for being aware that I am over a moment or so, but \nI am now finished and have left most of the time for Senator Bingaman \nbecause I think he will do a good job, and maybe we will not have to \nhave a vote. But if we do, I urge Senators not to change the law they \njust voted for 77 strong. Do not change it the first time we get an \namendment of this nature coming before us. Leave it there for a try. \nLet it get tried. It is going to work. It is not going to hurt anybody.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am sympathetic to the concerns of my \ncolleagues from Maryland, but I also rise to oppose their amendment.\n  Just 2 years ago, the Senate approved the Energy Policy Act of 2005 \nwhich contains this comprehensive approach to the siting of liquefied \nnatural gas receiving terminals. In that bill, Congress gave FERC, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, the jurisdiction to approve the \nsiting of LNG terminals that are located on shore.\n  FERC acts as the lead agency for NEPA compliance and also as a safety \nregulator. The combined NEPA and permitting process set forth in that \nlegislation, EPAct 2005, fully recognizes the role of other Federal \nagencies and the role of State agencies acting under delegated Federal \nauthority.\n  A project developer is not able to move forward unless all relevant \npermits are granted. FERC has addressed State concerns related to other \nLNG facilities through conditions placed on its approval certificate \nand it has denied a certificate due to safety concerns. So it is clear \nFERC is taking this authority and responsibility very seriously.\n  Moreover, this EPAct 2005 legislation also mandated the consideration \nof State concerns in the NEPA prefiling process which occurs very early \nin the siting process. The Governor of the affected State has a direct \nrole in that process.\n  The Senators from Maryland describe their amendment as ``not \naffecting FERC authority,'' but the amendment would essentially trump \nFERC's authority to site the entire facility.\n  As my colleagues know, LNG is imported. It is delivered to this \ncountry by ship. Therefore, an absolutely essential piece of the LNG \nreceiving facility is a place for the ship to moor and to unload its \ncargo; that is, a dock that is constructed in the navigable waters of \nthe United States. The Senators' amendment would allow a Governor of an \naffected State--and there is a very broad definition of which States \nare affected; in fact, any State within 15 miles of the terminal would \nbe an affected State under their definition--it would allow the \nGovernor of an affected State to block the Corps' permit, Army Corps of \nEngineers' permit. Obviously, there is no point in building a terminal \nif the ship is not permitted to get near it.\n  Finally, all of us are aware of the high price of natural gas and the \npressure that puts on electricity prices, home heating prices, and on \nthe viability of domestic industries that rely on natural gas. The \nEnergy Information Administration estimates that by 2030 the United \nStates will need almost 21 billion cubic feet per day of regasified LNG \nto meet a total estimated demand of about 81 billion cubic feet per \nday. This means LNG will account for over 25 percent of our natural gas \nsupply. We need a workable process to assure we have adequate capacity \nto meet this need.\n  So, Mr. President, for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on this amendment.\n  I know the Senator from Maryland wishes, I assume, to use the \nremainder of his time or to conclude his argument. Following that, I \nwill yield back the remaining time in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me thank both of my friends from New \nMexico for their leadership on this bill. They have brought forward a \ngood bill--a bill that I am proud to support and a bill that I hope \nwill be strengthened by the amendment process and that will allow us to \nbecome energy independent because we need to for national security \nreasons, for economic reasons, and for environmental reasons.\n  But it is important that we get it right and that LNG facilities and \nterminals be placed in the right locations. My friend from New Mexico \nsays this is a veto power by the State. It is not veto power by the \nState, no more so than you think FERC today has dictatorial powers on \nsiting LNG plants. What my amendment is trying to do is to make sure \nour States work with the Federal Government and with our Federal \nagencies on appropriately siting LNG facilities. That is how federalism \nshould work.\n  I have confidence in my Governor. He was elected by the people of \nMaryland. He is going to do the right thing. He makes tough decisions. \nWe make tough decisions. But we should work together because that is \nthe way we are going to be able to get the type of energy policy in \nthis country that will achieve all three objectives, and that is \nsecurity for energy independence, economic security, and environmental \nsecurity for this country.\n  We need to engage our States. We should. This amendment does not \nchange the law that was passed 2 years ago. FERC power remains the \nsame. It amends the Rivers and Harbors Act dealing with the Army Corps \nof Engineers. That is what it should be; they should be consulting and \nworking with the States before they issue their permits. This is a real \nproblem. There are dozens of applications pending today. We will be \nable to site LNG plants, but let's site them in the right location. \nLet's not site them, as my friend from Rhode Island said, in a very \nsensitive part of Massachusetts or Rhode Island that literally would \nblock recreational use and endanger communities. Let's not site them in \na place right next to downtown Baltimore, which we know is going to \npresent a risk--not just an accidental risk but a terrorist target. \nThat is not where we should site LNG plants.\n  So we can get it right. We can get our energy policy right. I urge my \ncolleagues to respect federalism, respect the fact that the States and \nthe Federal Government should be working together on the energy \npolicies of this\n\n[[Page S7869]]\n\ncountry so we truly become energy independent for the right reasons. I \nurge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Feinstein be \nadded as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1520, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nNo. 1520 be made the pending amendment for the purposes of modifying \nit, and I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment as modified is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 255.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1519\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 1519 offered by the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me and our 13 \ncosponsors in voting in favor of our OPEC amendment. This amendment \nwill declare price fixing by the OPEC oil cartel illegal under our \nantitrust laws and will give our Government a much needed weapon to \ncombat the illegal actions of the OPEC cartel that harms consumers \nevery time they visit the gas pump.\n  Contrary to the fears of the opponents of this amendment, this \namendment will not harm either our foreign relations or foreign \ninvestment in the United States. Enforcement of NOPEC is reserved \nexclusively to the Justice Department. Should the administration deem \nit imprudent to take action against NOPEC, then it need not do so. It \nis long past time for us to have the ability, should our Government \ndecide to do so, to take legal action to fight back against the OPEC \nconspiracy on behalf of American consumers.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join 345 House Members who last month \nvoted in huge numbers in favor of NOPEC.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, since I don't see anyone else here, let \nme speak in opposition to the amendment.\n  This is one of these feel-good amendments where you can tell your \nconstituents you struck a blow for freedom by outlawing OPEC.\n  The truth is, this is terrible precedent for us to say we are going \nto drag foreign governments into our court system and allow them to be \nsued for antitrust violations. We have always stopped short of doing \nthis. The precedent would be terrible because obviously they would do \nthe same thing with us. If we can bring foreign governments into our \ncourts and subject them to penalties here, they can bring our \nGovernment into their courts and do the same thing. The courts have \nstayed away from these issues. These are diplomatic issues and \npolitical issues the courts should stay out of.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the Kohl amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S7870]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 1610, offered by the \nSenator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin.\n  Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this amendment would restore the authority \nof State and local governments to protect the environment and ensure \npublic safety with respect to siting of liquefied natural gas, LNG \nterminals. This measure simply gives our States a say in whether these \nkinds of facilities, LNG facilities, should be built within their \nboundaries and, if so, their exact location.\n  The amendment does not eliminate FERC's siting authority. It doesn't \namend the FERC statute at all. It amends the Army Corps' permitting \nstatute and requires that the Army Corps work with our States in siting \nLNG facilities.\n  The amendment is common sense, one that engages our States as \npartners in serious decisionmaking authority as to where an LNG plant \nshould be located. This bill is all about securing America's future \nthrough energy independence. We need to work with our States. It should \nbe federalism. We should respect the authorities of our States and the \nsincerity of our Governors, and this bill restores that type of balance \nso that the States are involved in protecting the environment at the \nlocation of LNG facilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment does not just allow the \nStates to participate in the decision; this amendment would give the \nStates the ability to veto the issuance of any permit to the Army Corps \nof Engineers to build a terminal and would, in that way, cut us off \nfrom needed access to international supplies of liquefied natural gas, \nLNG. We are going to be more and more dependent upon these liquefied \nnatural gas supplies from overseas. We need to have these terminals \nconstructed. We have a provision in existing law that gives us good \nprocesses for including the States, but it is important that we not \nchange existing law.\n  Senator Domenici, did you wish to speak?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say that I wholeheartedly \nagree with Senator Bingaman. Just 2\\1/2\\ years ago, we decided we \nneeded LNG so much in the future that we wanted an orderly process that \ndid not give the Governors of each State the right to veto. This one is \neven broader. This gives Governors a 15-mile radius around the \nopportunity to veto.\n  I don't think we should change the law so quickly. I think we should \nleave it alone for a few years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.

I \nnote while there is objection, I will talk about it until we get the \nobjection cleared. This is a Finance Committee amendment passed out of \ncommittee. It is very straightforward. We have a copy. The Senator from \nWyoming objected?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I think the objection was on the basis that \nwe just got the file. We haven't looked at it at all.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. You will have time to look at it. We are not going to \nvote on it for a while. You will have lots of time to look at it. You \nwill have time to look at it, believe me. This is a formality. It is \ngood to bring it up now so we move the process along so the Senator and \nother Senators have time to look at it.\n  Mr. ENZI. I have no objection to someone talking on it, but I would \nlike to take a look at it, whatever it is.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I inform the Senator I am only asking the amendment be \nbrought up. There will be plenty of time. In fact, the Senator could \nspeak as long as he wants and other Senators could speak as long as \nthey want as we look at the amendment.\n  The ordinary course is the amendment is brought up. This has been \nfully vetted in the Finance Committee. Senators on both sides of the \naisle passed it by a vote of 15 to 5. Members on the Republican side \nvoted for it in committee.\n  I hope we can at least get the amendment up, and then we can work the \nusual Senate will.\n  Mr. ENZI. Apparently, there are objections on our side. I have no \nobjection to you going ahead and speaking to it, but they want to look \nat the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside so I may offer an amendment \nincorporating the Finance Committee-reported energy tax package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1704\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1704.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Schumer, \n     Ms. Cantwell and Mr. Salazar, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1704 to amendment No. 1502.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nGrassley, Bingaman, Lincoln, Wyden, Schumer, Cantwell, and Salazar be \nadded as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a long statement here which I am \nnot going to read. Essentially this is the Finance Committee amendment. \nIt goes a long way to help create incentives for renewables and for \ncarbon sequestration, which is so important. It is a $20-billion-plus \namendment over 10 years. It is fully offset. It is all paid for. It \npassed out of the Finance Committee by a vote of 15 to 5 earlier today. \nWe spent a lot of time on this amendment and I think it is one of which \nthe Senate can be very proud.\n  Basically, we are building on the strong foundation we already have \nwith respect to tax incentives in our country. We continue our \ncommitment to clean energy and renewables. We extend existing tax \nincentives for solar power, wind power, fuel cells, and energy-\nefficient homes and buildings. We create a tax incentive for \ntransmission projects related to renewable energy projects and provide \nmore than $3.6 billion over 10 years for renewable energy bonds. I \nmight say this will benefit all of the States and also is of particular \ninterest to my home State of Montana, and I know also to the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  But we are going further than all that. We are also trying to extend \nthe frontier in three areas that are critical to our Nation's energy \nfuture. One is cellulosic ethanol. We give significant incentives for \ncellulosic ethanol development; hybrid cars, significant incentives for \nthe purchase of hybrid cars as well as plug-ins for hybrids; and third, \ncarbon sequestration.\n  We propose a $1.11 per gallon tax credit for up to 60 million gallons \nof cellulosic fuel produced from sawgrass, agricultural wastes, and \nother biomass.\n  Hybrid cars provide an opportunity to make transportation cleaner--\nhigh-mileage cars with almost no emissions. I think it is worth \nexploring. The amendment calls for a new credit for plug-in vehicles \nfor $2,500 to $7,500.\n  We are also trying to take advantage of the vast reserves of coal we \nhave in our country. We clearly also have great concerns about global \nwarming. I think it is imperative that we use our coal to help meet our \nenergy needs, but we also have to prevent carbon dioxide from escaping \ninto the atmosphere.\n  There are various provisions here with respect to carbon \nsequestration. It depends upon whether it is known as a clean coal \nfacility, but we use tax credits provided in this mark, which must \ncapture and sequester at least 65 percent of its carbon dioxide \nemissions. That is with respect to power that is used to generate \nelectricity. The utility industry tells us we can't go higher than 65 \npercent sequestration or captured sequestration for the utility \nindustry. But we are going higher in other areas, and one is the coal-\nto-liquids sequestration. We extend the current 50-cent rate for coal-\nto-liquids to the year 2012. We also provide for a 75-percent capture \nof carbon for coal to liquids. This provision generated some \ncontroversy in the committee--some wanted it much higher, some wanted \nit lower. We felt that 72 percent is a pretty good compromise and a \ngood place to begin.\n  I will also add that we provide 50 percent bonus depreciation for new \ndedicated pipelines that will be used to transport carbon dioxide from \nan industrial source to a geological formation for permanent disposal.\n  There are many other provisions in this amendment which I will not \nmention, except to say that this is a very great addition to the \nunderlying package. We are turning the corner here. We are enacting \nlegislation which will help move America away from the past and more \ntoward the future. The future is renewable energies, alternative \nenergies. It is conservation provisions which we also have in this \nbill. It is utilizing our coal reserves in the same way; that is, \nmaking sure the carbon is sufficiently captured. It is all paid for, \nand it is paid for by closing some loopholes in the coal and gas \nindustry and also by repealing the reduction for section 199 for the \nmajor oil companies. This applies only to the five majors.\n  We also propose a tax on gulf oil production. Some will say: Gee, \naren't we discouraging domestic production by doing that in America \nwith those provisions? But I must point out that since section 199 was \nenacted several years ago, the actual domestic production in the United \nStates has declined. A few years ago when that provision was enacted, \nthe price of gasoline was much lower than it is now. It is much higher \ntoday. In addition to that, the projected profits for the oil and gas \nindustry for the next 10 years are projected to be $1 trillion. If you \nlook at the profits, if you look at how much gasoline prices have \nrisen, and if you look at the decline in domestic production in this \ncountry over the last several years, even with those very high profits, \nit is pretty clear this offset will\n\n[[Page S7872]]\n\nnot in any way diminish our prospects of domestic production and will \nnot cause gasoline prices to increase. In fact, there is a study by the \nJoint Tax Committee which makes that very point; namely, since these \nprovisions were put into effect a couple or 3 years ago, domestic \nproduction has not increased. It has not helped increase domestic \nproduction in the United States. Actually, domestic production has \ndecreased.\n  So we feel this is a good package. It is paid for properly. It passed \nthe committee by a vote of 15 to 5. I recommend this Finance Committee \npackage to the full Senate. We will work our will on it over the next \nseveral days, but I think it is an excellent start.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a previous order.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, who is the next person to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 8 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7872-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7872-S7873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK EXTENSION ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it was just a few days ago when we heard the \nnews that we had lost our dear friend and colleague, Senator Craig \nThomas. We lowered our flags and joined together as a family to say \ngoodbye to someone who fought for what he believed in and worked to the \nend to make Wyoming and the West better places to live.\n  Craig is now gone, but the work he began lives on. That is why I am \npleased to offer an amendment to S. 277, the Grand Teton National Park \nExtension Act of 2007. My amendment builds on the work begun by Craig \nand the efforts of Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member Domenici who \nworked so hard to shepherd this bill through the legislative process. \nIn addition, I also thank Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader \nMcConnell for bringing this bill to the floor so we can make one of \nCraig's legislative goals a reality.\n  It is no surprise that Craig worked so hard to develop, draft, and \nintroduce this legislation. No one understood the needs of Wyoming and \nthe West better than he did. Craig was a cowboy from the top of his hat \nto the tip of his boots. There was nothing he enjoyed more than riding \na horse through our national forests and spending time in the great \noutdoors.\n  Craig's love for the wide open spaces of our State led him to \nintroduce the Grand Teton National Park Extension Act of 2007. When it \nis signed into law, it will allow the Secretary of the Interior to \naccept the donation of approximately 50 acres of private land that will \nbe added to Grand Teton National Park. In addition to Craig, we have \nthe Halpin family to thank for their generosity. It will truly be a \ngift enjoyed by the people of Wyoming and the West, and the whole \ncountry, by all who come to visit our national parks every year.\n  When that land is added to Grand Teton National Park, it will have \nanother little addition to it. That addition is to rename the visitors \ncenter the Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center. It will provide \nthe people with a place to stop and visit during their trips to Grand \nTeton where they can learn about the history of the park and the life \nof Craig Thomas. I cannot think of a better way to remember Craig's \nlife than to share it with all who benefitted from his many years of \nhard work and public service.\n  Craig dedicated his life to protecting and preserving our State's \nnatural resources, especially our parks. He was a tireless and true \nadvocate for those important and precious facilities, and he fought for \ntheir protection when he served as chairman and later as ranking member \nof the National Park Subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Craig had a proud history on the committee and in the Senate as he \nconstantly and consistently advocated for the best administration and \nmanagement of our park system. He authored legislation that provided \ncritical funding and mandated management reforms that were necessary to \nkeep our parks pristine and ensure they would be available for future \ngenerations to enjoy. He worked with all of his colleagues, regardless \nof their party affiliation, to increase funding for our parks so they \ncould better deal with the maintenance backlog that exists. Now that he \nis gone, our parks have lost one of their best friends.\n  Renaming the visitors center will ensure Craig's legacy will continue \nand never be forgotten. As noted in a letter by the Grand Teton \nNational Park Foundation:\n\n       Senator Thomas championed this project since 1997. His \n     leadership in securing an $8 million appropriation inspired \n     the Foundation to raise $13.6 million in private funds for \n     the project.\n\n  For his efforts on this and so many issues of importance to our \nnational park system, the Grand Teton National Park Foundation supports \nthe naming of the center after Senator Thomas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of their letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Grand Teton National\n\n\n                                              Park Foundation,\n\n                                         Moose, WY, June 12, 2007.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of the Board of the Grand \n     Teton National Park Foundation I am writing to endorse the \n     idea of naming the new Visitor Center in Grand Teton National \n     Park after the late Senator Craig Thomas.\n       Senator Thomas loved the national parks and was a tireless \n     advocate for them. The beautiful Grand Teton Discovery and \n     Visitor Center which will open this summer is a model public/\n     private partnership. Senator Thomas championed this project \n     since 1997. His leadership in securing an $8 million \n     appropriation inspired the Foundation to raise $13.6 million \n     in private funds for the project.\n       The ribbon cutting on August 11th will be a special day for \n     everyone who has been involved with this project. It will \n     also be a very sad day because Senator Thomas will not be \n     there with us to celebrate the culmination of years of work.\n       Feel free to contact me if you require any additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Leslie Mattson-Emerson,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the newly \nconstructed Grand Teton Visitors Center is August 11, 2007. It will be \na day that will be long remembered by all who come to honor the memory \nof one of the park's greatest champions. By passing this legislation, \nwe are making that day possible and ensuring that those who attend that \nspecial ceremony will be the first to enjoy all the Craig Thomas \nDiscovery and Visitor Center will have to offer. This is an honor which \nI know would have pleased Craig and made him very proud. I can also see \nhim riding tall in the saddle of a horse, taking it all in under the \nbrim of his favorite cowboy hat.\n  Naming the visitors center for Craig Thomas will also mean a great \ndeal to everyone who knew and loved him. It will be a tribute to a \nspecial American that will last for a long time to come. Many years \nfrom today, when people come to the park and stop by the visitors \ncenter that bears his name, they will know that Craig Thomas was so \nmany things in life--a marine, a Senator, a rancher, and a dedicated \nfather and husband. But most of all, they will know Craig loved Wyoming \nand the West and fought with everything he had to maintain our precious \nresources.\n  I always said God saved some of his best handiwork for Wyoming. We \nare fortunate that he also gave us the best champion to fight to \nprotect and preserve it all.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration Calendar No. 41, S. 277.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 277) to modify the boundaries of Grand Teton \n     National Park to include certain land within the GT Park \n     Subdivision, and other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Enzi \namendment at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read \na third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S7873]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1709) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To designate the Grand Teton Discovery and Visitor Center as \n           the ``Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center'')\n\n       Strike section 4 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary \n     such sums as are necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for \nbringing forward this bill on behalf of Senator Thomas, who was such a \nforce in this Chamber and especially a force on behalf of his State. It \nis a very appropriate thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7873-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7873-S7877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CREATING LONG-TERM ENERGY ALTERNATIVES FOR THE NATION ACT OF 2007--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to talk about an amendment I wish to \noffer--I will offer it later--relative to\n\n[[Page S7874]]\n\nthe tax package that was just introduced relative to this Energy bill.\n  Today, for those of us who live on the east coast, we would like to \nbe able to buy ethanol at a reasonable price. In fact, we would like to \nbe able to buy ethanol at all. The problem is, for ethanol to be \nshipped to the east coast, it has to go through pipelines. \nTransportation by truck or tank car is not viable, and thus ethanol, \nbecause of its components, cannot be shipped and is not stable in going \nthrough pipelines. So the east coast really does not have too many \noptions for purchasing ethanol.\n  One option is to buy it from the Caribbean countries that produce it \nor from Brazil. Unfortunately, there is a tariff in place on Brazilian \nethanol which amounts to 54 cents a gallon. That is a tariff which \nthose of us on the east coast are subjected to and the effect of which \nis the price of ethanol is arbitrarily overstated.\n  This tariff was put in place quite a while ago and was put in during \na period when the production of ethanol was not commercially viable \nbecause the cost of oil was still very low and when corn production was \nnot oriented toward ethanol production. So this tariff was put in \npurely as a protective tariff for the purpose of allowing the corn \nindustry in the Midwest to be successful in developing ethanol--at \nleast that is the representation.\n  However, that position no longer has viability. The simple fact is \nthat the corn industry in the Midwest is doing extraordinarily well \nbecause not only is it still a major feedstock for most of the \ntraditional animal use to which it is applied, but it is also being \nused aggressively for the production of ethanol. In fact, we are \nlooking at about 7 billion gallons of ethanol being produced this year.\n  Under this bill, for the purpose of gasoline replacement, it will be \nrequired that we have 36 billion gallons produced by the year 2022. So \nwe are putting in place mandates which will absolutely require an \nexpansion in the use of ethanol of dramatic proportions, which we \nshould, and which will therefore raise the ship of the production of \nethanol by the use of corn in the Midwest or sugar beets in the \nNorthern Plains States as a form of producing ethanol. Therefore, they \nshould not be concerned about the threat or the potential threat or the \nalleged threat of having ethanol come into this country from other \nproducers in the Western Hemisphere, such as Brazil, because that is \nnot going to affect their price and it is not going to affect their \nproduction capability.\n  Secondly, we still have in place in this bill and under the \nagricultural bills which we passed in the Senate a $3 billion annual \nsubsidy for corn production--a $3 billion annual subsidy. The irony is \nwe are subsidizing a product which is now extraordinarily productive \nand which has great viability--corn production--and, in fact, the cost \nof which has gone up so much that we are hearing complaints from many \nof the various farm communities, such as cattle producers who need \ncorn, because the price has gone up so much as a result of the demand \nfor corn. But at the same time, we are making it virtually impossible, \nbecause of the protective attitude of the Midwest on the issue of corn \nproduction for ethanol, to bring into the Northeast and into the \nEastern States ethanol at a viable price and at a competitive price.\n  Our goal basically as an economy should be to get ourselves off oil, \nto move away from oil, and to move to ethanol production, which is the \nmost efficient and cost competitive.\n  So the Northeast and the Eastern States should be allowed to purchase \nethanol from Brazil without this arbitrary tariff that was put in place \nmany years ago and continues.\n  In addition, if you just want to look at it on the basis of \npurchasing an overseas product--and some will argue this is just going \nto underwrite the foreign production of an energy source, ethanol, in \nBrazil--you can make that argument, but as a practical matter, if you \nmake that argument, you have to ask yourself, would you rather buy \nethanol from Brazil or oil from Venezuela because essentially the \nchoice is just about that stark. You can buy your ethanol from Brazil \nor you can buy Venezuelan oil.\n  By making Brazilian ethanol more competitive and taking off this \narbitrary 54-cents-a-gallon increase, which people from the East have \nto pay, you will actually make ethanol a more viable product in the \nEast and thus reduce our reliance, for example, on Venezuelan oil or, \nfor that matter, Middle Eastern oil. I personally would rather be \nbuying ethanol from a country such as Brazil than buying oil from the \nMiddle East or from Venezuela.\n  So the arguments for eliminating this tariff are myriad. They are \nthat we should be purchasing ethanol at the most competitive price, \nthat the Northeast and the East cannot purchase Midwestern ethanol \nanyway at a competitive value because it cannot be shipped by pipeline \nbecause it is so combustible.\n\n  The original concept of protecting corn producers in the Midwest no \nlonger has viability in light of the fact that we have mandated an \nethanol usage in this country that is going to absorb just about every \nounce of corn produced, and we see corn prices are already at \nextraordinarily high price and that has put a lot of pressure as a \nfeedstock commodity on various other industries, such as cattle \nproduction; and that it makes no sense in light of the $3 billion \nsubsidy which we already have in place for corn to require people in \nthe Northeast--who are paying that subsidy, by the way, through their \ntaxes--to also have to pay an inflated price for ethanol which is \nproduced in Brazil. If we are going to choose to use overseas sources \nof energy, which we are going to have to on the east coast, at least \nfor the foreseeable future, why wouldn't we choose ethanol produced in \nBrazil over oil produced in the Middle East or Venezuela?\n  In addition, there is another argument, which is that if the Midwest \nis so concerned about having this tariff in place, they seem to be \ncutting off their nose to spite their face because the practical matter \nis that the more ethanol that is used on the east coast where the \npopulation of this country is concentrated to a large degree, the more \nthe east coast will become dependent on ethanol, and when we get over \nthis hurdle of moving ethanol through pipelines or other ways of moving \nit from the Midwest to suppliers and producers, we will see there is a \ndemand that has been created, and at that point we will have a \ncompetitive commodity, one presumes, with the Brazilian ethanol.\n  There is no logic to continuing this arbitrary tax on people from the \nNortheast and the East relative to the price on ethanol, a 54-cent-per-\ngallon tax. It should be repealed, and therefore I will be offering an \namendment to repeal this tariff.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlaska is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n         Thirtieth Anniversary of the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise this evening to acknowledge the \n30th anniversary of the first drop of oil passing through the Trans-\nAlaska Oil Pipeline. This is truly an engineering marvel which is a \ncentral component of the transportation of oil from the largest single \ndomestic source in America's history--Prudhoe Bay--to the rest of the \nUnited States, where it powers industry and provides jobs to this day.\n  Alaska has been called a lot of different things, some not too \ncomplimentary, unfortunately. You may remember the term ``Seward's \nfolly.'' This was after the United States approved the purchase of \nAlaska from Russia in 1867 which got the State of Alaska, the \nterritory, for $7.2 million. ``Seward's folly'' was a reference to \nSecretary of State William Seward, who was an advocate for the \npurchase.\n  Alaskans themselves dubbed it ``Seward's icebox,'' reflecting the \nsentiment Americans had toward our supposedly barren, dark, ice-covered \nland. But we soon recognized there was far more than just dark, barren, \nempty land. It was not an icebox but instead a lush, resource-rich, and \nstunningly beautiful land.\n  Gold was discovered in the 1890s, and black gold, or oil, was \ndiscovered about 75 years later. While oil is often viewed in a \nnegative context these days, the fact remains that this black gold has \nenabled America to grow into the economic power it is today.\n  Alaskan oil, quite honestly, could not have been found in a more \ninconvenient place. Prudhoe Bay, which is\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\nthe location of the massive 1968 discovery, contained oil in ground \nthat was permanently frozen up to 1,000 feet deep in the northernmost \nsection of the State with three mountain ranges between it and the \nnearest ice-free port.\n  Seven oil companies got together to discuss how they might move the \noil to the lower 48 States. There were several options that were \nproposed at the time. One of them was a water route that would use \nlarge ice-breaking tankers--essentially plowing through the ice--to get \nthe oil down to the lower 48 market. A second option was a water route \nusing submarines. A combined land and water system with a Trans-Alaska \nPipeline and shipments from a southern Alaskan port was the third \noption and the option that was considered to be most feasible for \nseveral different reasons from the technical, the economic, and the \nlegal issues that surrounded it.\n\n  The third option, this Trans-Alaska Pipeline, raised so many concerns \nand so many problems that for many it seemed an impossible task. The \nsouthern two-thirds of the proposed route was the most seismically \nactive area in North America. This was the location of the very famous \n1964 earthquake centered out of Valdez. The southern portion also \ncontains a very high avalanche threat. Permafrost, which is the \npermanently frozen ground, runs about half the length of that pipeline \nroute. You will find permafrost in that area. These all presented an \nunprecedented engineering challenge. The pipe would have to span a \ndistance greater than the distance between Oregon and Mexico or, to put \nit in perspective as to where we are here, it would be the equivalent \ndistance of going from this Capitol in Washington, DC, all the way \nsouth to Orlando, FL. That is the distance our Trans-Alaska Pipeline \ncovers today.\n  Also, keep in mind we are not only talking about an incredibly long \n800-mile pipe, but it is a stretch of land that includes thousands of \nrivers, three mountain ranges, and we have air temperatures ranging \nfrom minus 80 degrees below in the wintertime to a positive 95 degrees \nin the summer. So the challenges that faced the Nation as they looked \nto this engineering feat were quite incredible.\n  There were also political obstacles that were pretty steep. \nEnvironmental concerns, which, quite honestly, mirror the modern-day \ndebate over oil development in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, resulted in a 50-50 Senate tie on the vote for the \npipeline's approval. Vice President Spiro Agnew cast the tie-breaking \naffirmative vote in this Chamber about 34 years ago.\n  It took 38 months, billions of the final $8 billion pricetag, and \n1,347 State and Federal permits later for the construction to begin on \none of the most ambitious engineering endeavors in the history of the \nworld. During construction, thousands of would-be job seekers flocked \nto Alaska, and those workers battled the cold in the winter that caused \nthe equipment to freeze up, and in the summer they battled sunken bogs \nwhen digging the concrete supports that allow the pipeline to shift in \norder to deal with the temperature changes and the seismic activity. \nThey solved problems such as installing the pipe in both Atigun Pass \nand Thompson Pass, incredibly steep terrain just outside the southern \nterminus in Valdez. The terrain is so steep there that workers had to \nbe tethered to the peaks by cables to keep them from falling down the \nslopes.\n  Mr. President, I think I have probably used my 5 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Along the way, those working on this pipeline made major engineering \nadvances, learning how to insulate the pipe and how to keep the \npermafrost ground frozen so that the pipe didn't sink out of site. When \nthe project was completed in 1977, 3 years after construction started, \nwe had a new domestic supply of oil made available to the United \nStates--the single largest domestic source it has ever had.\n  On average, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline--we call it TAPS--now sees just \nover 800,000 barrels of oil pass through it each day. This is 231,000 \nbarrels per hour and 22,000 gallons per minute. So, in other words, in \nthe time I have been standing to address you, Mr. President, it has \ntransported about 100,000 gallons of crude.\n  At peak production, TAPS provided the United States with about 2 \nmillion barrels of oil a day, or 30 percent more than Saudi Arabia does \ntoday, and nearly as much oil as the entire Persian Gulf provides our \ncountry today. And Alaskan oil, unlike Middle Eastern oil, does not \ncome from unstable regimes, does not hinder our foreign policy options \nby bonding us and our allies to such regimes, and is not at risk of \nbeing cut off due to instability. We have been a stable domestic \nsupplier of the oil needs of the United States for over 30 years.\n  The pipeline has turned out to be a much better deal than originally \nanticipated. The dire predictions of environmental disaster have been \nproven false. There have been minor spills, we acknowledge, but the \nenvironment and the wildlife have been unaffected by the Trans-Alaska \nPipeline. Our caribou numbers have actually grown along the pipeline \narea, with estimates of up to sixfold in terms of the herd. Moose and \nbear have not been affected, and little oil has been added to the \nenvironment. All land spills have been completely cleaned up.\n  Additionally, while Prudhoe Bay was originally forecast to contain 9 \nbillion barrels of recoverable oil, we will actually recover twice that \nmuch, about 18 billion barrels, by the time that field is depleted.\n  We recognize the days of abundant Prudhoe Bay oil are dwindling. We \nhave produced about 15 billion barrels of oil, leaving only about 3 \nbillion barrels remaining to recover. Output has fallen by more than 7 \npercent a year recently. According to the Energy Information \nAdministration, Prudhoe Bay production will be down to 270,000 barrels \nper day by 2030, a level so low that the pipeline likely will not be \nable to function in winter's cold and may become inoperable. That could \n``shut-in'' billions of barrels of future heavy oil deposits in the \nGreater Prudhoe Bay area and perhaps hamper oil recoveries from \nelsewhere in northern Alaska and the OCS off the State's coast.\n  In the meantime, U.S. oil imports have grown to account for 58 \npercent of our current net oil consumption. Twenty years from now, that \nnumber is forecasted to climb to 68 percent.\n  So I ask my colleagues and the American people, as we remember today \nwhat Alaska and the Trans-Alaska Pipeline system has given to our \ncountry, to consider also what Alaska could provide for America's \nfuture. The decision truly lies in the hands of Congress.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak out of \nturn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Employee Free Choice Act\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, historians who take a clear-eyed look at \nthe last 30 years will tell you, and in particular economists will tell \nyou, productivity has been rising, our economy has been expanding, and \nthe workers responsible for our Nation's prosperity have not reaped \nanywhere near their share of the benefits which they have earned.\n  In 2005, the real median household income in America was down almost \n3 percent from the median income in 2000. That is understanding that \nproductivity has sharply increased among American workers. In Ohio, \nmedian income was down almost 10 percent. Meanwhile, the average CEO \nmakes 411 times more than the average worker. As recently as 1990, the \naverage CEO made 107 times more; so from 107 times more than the \naverage worker in 1990 to now, 411 times more than the average worker.\n  Let me explain it another way. In the Agriculture Committee a couple \nof months ago, a young woman in her mid-thirties, with a 9-year-old \nson, came and testified about food stamps. The average food stamp \nbeneficiary in our country gets about $1 per meal per person. She and \nher son got about $6 a day for food stamps. She works full time at a \n$9-an-hour job. She has no health care benefits. She gets a food stamp \nbenefit. She is president of the local PTA at her son's school. She \nvolunteers to teach Sunday school. And\n\n[[Page S7876]]\n\nshe is active in the Cub Scouts for her son. She works, as I said, full \ntime, making $9 an hour, and gets a small food stamp benefit.\n  She says at the beginning of the month she serves her son porkchops a \ncouple of times, and as the month goes on she takes him to a fast food \nrestaurant once or twice, but by the last couple of days of the month \nshe sits at the kitchen table with her son and doesn't eat. Her son \nasks her what is wrong, and she says she's just not feeling well. She \nsimply runs out of money at the end of the month. This is somebody \nplaying by the rules.\n  Later in the day, on the Banking Committee, a committee on which I \nsit with the Presiding Officer from New Jersey, Secretary Paulson was \ntestifying, the Secretary of the Treasury, and I told him the story of \nthis lady from Middletown, OH.\n  He said: Senator, you have to understand we have had 2\\1/2\\, 3 \npercent economic growth in the last year. Things in our country are \ngoing well.\n  Yes, things are going well in terms of profits for corporations. \nThings are going well in terms of top executives. But too often they \nreally aren't. Just look at this chart from 1946 to 1973. Economic \nopportunities for poor and working families grew. The incomes of the \ncountry's workers are divided. The lowest 20 percent, second lowest, \nmiddle, and then the top 20, top 40 percent, and the top 20 percent \nhere. Families who worked hard and played by the rules had a real \nchance of getting ahead. You can see those from 1947 to 1973, the \nlowest 20 percent of our wage earners had the highest growth in income; \nthose who made the most had the lowest. So we are seeing all boats \nrise--boats rising a little faster for those in the lowest incomes.\n  Beginning in about 1973 and through to 2000, workers at the bottom \nand in the middle began to share less and less of the wealth they \ncreated. Even though their productivity was going up, their wealth \ndidn't, their wages didn't. Economic growth flattened out for those \nsame families. You can see there is still economic growth at the lowest \n20, 40, 60 percent, but the fastest growth in incomes was in the top 20 \npercent. That was in 2000.\n  As the economic pie got bigger, the slice for most Americans got \nsmaller. Here you can see the most devastating news of all in the last \n4, 5, 6 years. The only people who had economic growth in this country \nwere the top 1 percent. These are the five quintiles. The top 1 percent \nare the only ones who had economic growth, and those at the bottom fell \nthe furthest and further behind.\n  Historians will also say that in 2006 the middle class spoke up and \nsent a message to Congress demanding change. This Congress raised the \nminimum wage for the first time in a decade. This Congress is fighting \nfor fair trade like never before. And I speak today, Mr. President, in \nsupport of the Employee Free Choice Act, which goes to the heart of the \nplight of working families to reap the benefits of the productivity \nthey created, to provide a home and health care and pensions for \nthemselves and a college education for their kids.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act is a historic step for working families. \nIt would give workers the right to organize so they can fight for fair \nwages and decent benefits. The efforts of labor organizers more than \n100 years ago finally led to the progress made seven decades ago with \nthe signing of the Wagner Act. The rights that became law then ensured \nfair pay and decent working conditions.\n  But more and more employers chose to flout the law by intimidating \nworkers and suppressing union activities. All across Ohio, I talk with \nworkers who have tried to form a union and who share with me the \ntactics taken by some employers--not all but some employers--to prevent \nworkers from organizing.\n  I talked with Bill Lawthorn from Macomb, OH. Bill and his coworkers \nwanted a union so workers would be treated with the respect and dignity \nall laborers deserve. They hoped with the union they would get fair and \ndecent wages, a decent retirement plan, and decent health care \nbenefits. According to Bill, the company responded with threats, with \nintimidation, and harassment.\n  Bill said the company threatened to fire him even if the campaign for \nthe union failed. The union lost the election, and the day after, Bill, \nin fact, was fired. Since then, various labor boards have held the \ncompany's actions were illegal. Bill has not been reinstated, though, \nor seen 1 cent of backpay, even though his firing was illegal. That is \nwhy we need the Employee Free Choice Act.\n  Despite the struggle, despite doing odd jobs to pay the bills and \nrelying on friends, family, and neighbors, Bill says, if he had the \nchance to do it all over again, he would do everything exactly the same \nbecause he knew he was right. It was the right thing to do, he said, \nand the Employee Free Choice Act is the right thing to do.\n  In 2005 alone, 31,000 employees were awarded backpay by a very \nconservative pro-business National Labor Relations Board due to \nretaliatory firings and unfair labor practices. I repeat, 31,000 \nemployees were given backpay because, according to the National Labor \nRelations Board, they were fired illegally and unfairly.\n  Many companies decide to fire union supporters. Even if employees \nlater successfully prove their case, the penalties all too often are an \ninsufficient deterrent. These practices must end. The Employee Free \nChoice Act is the first step.\n\n  For the first time in our history, our sons and daughters do not have \nthe opportunities their moms and dads had. A son, in 1994, earned 5 \npercent higher wages than his dad did in 1964. You can see how wages \nwent up in that generation. But in 2004, a son's wages were down 12 \npercent from what his father made in 1974. You can see, too many kids \nare pessimistic about their futures.\n  We cannot continue this course. Unions are an agent for change. \nHistory will show that this Congress responded to the ever-increasing \ngap between the haves and have-nots. Fair trade, fair wages and \nbenefits, the right to join a union--all three are basic to a society \nwhere work is rewarded and worker intimidation is not tolerated. \nMajority Leader Reid is committed to moving forward on fair trade \nissues, on fair wages and fair benefits issues, as we already have, and \nequally importantly, the right to join a union.\n  The Employee Free Choice Act is a major step for working families. I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I first would like to express my \nappreciation to the distinguished Senator from Ohio for his advocacy \nfor better trade policy for our country. I also appreciate his graphic \nillustration of what is happening in our country now, when sons are \nmaking less than their fathers.\n  It is difficult to comprehend, but that is the position in which we \nfind ourselves, so we need a better trade policy, and we certainly need \nto pass the card check and Employees Free Choice Act.\n  I appreciate the statement of the Senator from Ohio and his constant \nadvocacy for a better trade policy.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I voted in support of the NOPEC \namendment to H.R. 6, which was offered by my colleague, Senator Herbert \nKohl. The amendment seeks to prevent OPEC nations from continuing to \nconspire to limit the supply of oil and to drive up America's already \nexorbitant energy costs. While I recognize that this is not a perfect \npiece of legislation, and that it may require the addition of certain \nclarifying provisions to ascertain its applicability in particular \ncircumstances, I believe that it is a fine first step toward finally \nholding OPEC accountable for its actions. The time is long overdue for \nAmerica's working families to send OPEC the message that West \nVirginians in particular will no longer be content to sit quietly by \nthe side of the road, watching OPEC drive our gas and home heating \nprices to ever higher levels. This amendment is meant to send a \nsignal--a signal to OPEC nations that the American people are not going \nto take it anymore. We will no longer be held hostage to OPEC's self-\nserving energy policies, which line their pockets, at the expense of \nour pocketbooks.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be very brief, but I do want to say \nthat I have been in the Senate now for a number of years, with \nRepublican leaders and Democratic leaders, Democratic majorities and \nRepublican majorities,\n\n[[Page S7877]]\n\nand never have we had a situation like we have had this past 6 months. \nWe have to move to cloture on virtually everything--everything. I am \ngoing to file, now, tonight, four cloture motions. Never have we had to \ndo this before.\n  It is common practice, and has been for all the time we have been a \nSenate, that, because you are dealing with the House, you are offering \na substitute amendment that takes place with the Senate bill. Without \ngoing into a lot of detail, we rarely in the past had to file cloture \non not only the substitute but also the underlying bill. We have to do \nit on virtually everything. We have never had to file cloture on every \nmotion to proceed. That is what we are having to do now. It is a \ntremendous waste of the time of the Senate and of the country, but that \nis what we have to do. That is what I am going to do tonight.\n  It is going to become apparent, and is to some people, and some \nwriting is taking place on it now, that we had to file so many cloture \nmotions. It is because we have on almost every occasion had to file \ncloture on everything. It is a struggle to get legislation here to the \nfloor. The minority's goal, the Republicans' No. 1 goal, I guess, at \nthis time is to see that we don't get anything done. But in spite of \nthat, we have been able to get a lot done. It has been difficult. It \nhas been slogging. It has been slow.\n  We have a list of things we have been able to accomplish, with which \nI think the country should be very happy--minimum wage; we have been \nable to get disaster relief for farmers for the first time in 3 years; \nwe passed a balanced budget amendment; we funded the Government with a \ncontinuing resolution. We have been able to do a number of things. \nThere is no need to run through the entire list tonight other than to \nsay it is too bad it has been so difficult to get those things done. We \nare very close to being able to finish the conference on the lobbying \nethics reform; 9/11--I spoke to Senator Lieberman earlier this evening, \nthat is basically all done.\n  We have a difficult schedule. Why? Because of having to jump through \nevery procedural hoop. It would be different if we were doing it \nbecause of people who didn't like immigration. I understand that. But \nwe are doing it on everything we bring through the Senate.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Parliamentarian shows the Senator from New \nJersey is to be recognized for up to 10 minutes and then the senior \nSenator from New York for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Employee \nFree Choice Act, of which I am proud to be an original cosponsor. This \nbill will level the playing field for workers seeking a voice at work \nand ensure they have the freedom to choose to join a union without \ncoercion. I applaud Senator Kennedy for his passion to move this bill \nforward and his relentless fight to improve and uphold the rights of \nworkers.\n  Some may ask why this change is needed. They may think that in 2007, \nin this great democratic Nation, the right of an employee to seek \nrepresentation in their workplace is alive and well. It should be. But \nthe fact is, under current law, there are loopholes that have\n\n[[Page S7878]]\n\nbeen exploited, tactics that have been utilized, and actions taken \nagainst employees that have undermined the basic rights to which \nemployees should be entitled.\n  We have a chart that shows the number of workers facing roadblocks \ntrying to form a union. From start to finish, workers often face \nroadblock after roadblock in trying to seek union representation. \nActive union workers are fired; employers challenge and file appeals \nwith the NLRB; and employers can simply stall the process and prevent \nit from moving forward.\n  We cannot ignore that there are some concerted and disturbing efforts \nthat have tainted what should be a fair process. In that process, \nemployees are fired in roughly one quarter of all private-sector \norganizing efforts. One in five workers who openly advocate for a union \nduring an election campaign is fired.\n  In 2005 alone, some 30,000 workers experienced some form of \ndiscrimination for their participation in an organizing effort, \nresulting in lost wages or lost jobs. And, in an increasingly common \ntrend, a vast majority of private employers are hiring union-busting \nconsultants to fight unionization drives.\n  Clearly, existing law has not been enough to deter these types of \ntactics. The Employee Free Choice Act would close loopholes that have \nallowed employers to abuse the labor process without repercussion, and \nit would beef up the penalties for violation. Part of the problem is \nthat under current law, there is not a strong enough incentive to \nfollow the law.\n  While employers face stiff penalties for firing an employee based on \nrace, gender, or disability, they face minimal penalties for firing an \nemployee for union organizing.\n  In addition to enacting stronger penalties, this legislation would \nessentially enforce the steps that are supposed to take place, but \noften do not. A key part of this bill is that it will bring people to \nthe table. It would ensure that when employees make their voices heard, \nthe process moves forward. This is not forcing the hand of employers or \nemployees, but it simply ensures that negotiations that are supposed to \ntake place will take place.\n  Currently, employees can agree to join a union, but then the process \nis dragged out for months or years. This is not the spirit of the law. \nThe Employee Free Choice Act will restore that spirit and uphold the \nmeaning of the rights employees are supposed to have.\n  Improving the rights of workers is not just about fairness--it is \nalso about equity. We know that workers who have a voice at work have \nbetter benefits and are able to provide a higher quality of life for \ntheir families. When nearly half of all Americans report having just \n``enough to get by,'' it should be obvious that we need to take action \nto improve the economic standing of many of our workers.\n  The fact is, union membership means higher wages. According to the \nDepartment of Labor, union workers earn 30 percent higher weekly \nearnings than non-union workers--that is an average of $191 dollars per \nweek, or more than $9,000 per year.\n  This is especially true for minorities. Latinos represented by unions \ntypically earn median wages that are 46 percent higher than non-\nunionized Latinos. Women and African-Americans typically earn more than \n30 percent higher median wages when they are unionized. By opening the \ndoor for more workers to seek union representation, we are helping \nensure a pathway to fairness and hopefully, a pathway to a better \nquality of life.\n  Hardworking Americans deserve the chance that this bill provides. \nThey deserve a strong law that will not allow employers to skirt its \nmeaning; a law that will protect their decisions and ensure their \nvoices will be heard.\n  That is why I support this bill. I believe a majority of voices \nshould be upheld and I believe that our workplaces should be the very \nbest they can be for our Nation's workers.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Employee Free Choice Act to \nprotect and enforce the rights of any worker to freely join a union; \nfree from intimidation, free from back-door tactics, free from fear of \nretribution. That is a right. That is a right that no worker in America \nshould be denied.\n  I hope we will have the support of our colleagues when this comes to \na vote on the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to first speak briefly about the \nEmployee Free Choice Act, which is a very important piece of \nlegislation. In fact, I introduced the original bill 4 years ago, \nworked hard to persuade many of my colleagues in the labor movement \nthat this should be a top priority. I am so glad it is. I wish to \nsalute the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, who has taken \nleadership on this issue. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the \nbill.\n  Let me say this: Before the union movement in America, we had a few \nwealthy people and a lot of poor people and not much of a middle class. \nThe great thing about the union movement is it created a middle class. \nThrough struggles of laboring men and women from about 1870 to 1960, \nAmerica became a country that was about 30 or 35 percent unionized.\n  What that meant was that wages rose, benefits rose, health care rose, \nand America was a prosperous country. Without a middle class, America \nwould not have prospered. Then, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, many \nemployers who wished to prevent unions or beat back unions found new \nways to basically thwart what was the original thrust of the NLRB, \nwhich was to freely allow men and women to organize.\n  They hired lawyers. There are law firms with hundreds of people whose \nwhole job is to prevent unionization. They basically succeeded. So as \nold industries closed, new industries that have as much reason to \norganize did not. Factories closed, office towers came about, but the \nunion jobs did not follow from the factories to the office towers, with \nthe exception of the public sector.\n  So now we are in this situation where fewer than 10 percent of \nAmerican workers are organized. That hurts America. That means that men \nand women are not able to bargain collectively for rights. When you \ntalk about declining wages of the middle class, when you talk about \ndeclining health benefits of the middle class, one--not the only but \none of the reasons is we do not have unions.\n  Fewer and fewer Americans are organized. What the legislation does, \nwhat the Employee Free Choice Act does, is very simply restore the \nbalance so it would be as easy to organize a factory in an office tower \nin 2007 as it was to organize a factory in the 1930s or 1940s or 1950s.\n  To show you the law works, Canada has basically the same economic \nstructure as America. Canada is over 30 percent organized and America \nis 8 percent organized. One reason, they have a law such as the \nEmployee Free Choice Act which allows a majority of employees to sign a \ncard and then a union takes effect.\n  One of the great problems in the new America is income inequality. \nThe top 1 percent of America represents 9 percent of the income in \n1980, 16 percent in 2001, and now it is over 20 percent by the latest \nstatistics. One of the many ways to overcome that inequality is to make \nit a little easier for people to organize.\n  So I think this legislation is extremely important to the basic \nfabric of America. If we want middle-class people to continue to have \nwage growth and benefit growth, unions are basically essential. So I am \nproud to support this legislation.\n  I understand there are employers who fight it tooth and nail. I have \nseen some of the ads. There is one today in one of the papers, \nparticularly vicious, with a picture of a union leader and then of two \ndictators. I thought it was the kind of cheap shot we shouldn't see in \nthis country.\n  The bottom line is simple. This legislation is vital to the health, \neconomic health of working men and women and vital to keeping a middle \nclass in America and not reverting to the old days, when you had very \nfew wealthy people and a large number of struggling people. I support \nthe legislation.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 1604, 1605, 1606, and 1656 to H.R. 6\n\n  Second, I would like to speak about amendments 1604, 1605, 1606, and \n1656, amendments I will be offering to H.R. 6. I am not going to offer \nthem tonight because none of my colleagues from\n\n[[Page S7879]]\n\nthe opposing side are here. But they are important.\n  This is an energy bill that is vital to the country. We all want to \ncurb the emission of CO2, we want to curb our dependence on \nforeign oil, and we want to bring down the prices of gasoline, \nelectricity, and all the other commodities that are petroleum \ndependent. There has been a great deal of talk and focus on alternative \nfuels. That is very good. But alternative fuels are the ``sizzle'' and \nconservation is the ``steak'' when it comes to reducing our dependence \non oil and particularly foreign oil\n  It costs about a quarter as much to conserve as it does to create an \nalternative. So these amendments are very simple. I wish to thank the \nFinance Committee, first, for drafting a provision that will take \nbillions of dollars in tax breaks and other benefits from the oil \nindustry to create new, improved incentives to promote solar power and \nwind power and cellulosic ethanol.\n  But we also have to do energy efficiency. You do not have to be \nThomas Edison to know that better energy efficiency is a win-win for \nAmerican families. The Federal Government, thus far, has failed to take \nthe lead in promoting commercializing or deploying energy efficiency \ntechnologies despite their cost-effectiveness and reliability.\n  Unlike the development of cutting new alternative and renewable fuel \nsources, we do not have to wait for new technologies to reap the \nbenefits of energy efficiency in our homes. An excellent example is our \nlargest State in population, California. Over the past 30 years, it has \ndemonstrated significant efficiency gains that can be achieved through \nvarious energy efficiency measures, especially by increasing the \nefficiency of utilities, buildings, and appliances.\n  With these measures, California has generated more than 20 percent of \nenergy savings since 1975. California's energy use, per capita, is \nsimilar to many countries in Europe because they did this 30 years ago. \nSo if California can do it, so can America.\n  The four amendments I have mentioned, one on buildings, two on \nappliances, and one on electric generation, take the California \nlegislation and basically apply it to America. I am going to discuss \neach.\n  The first amendment will create a national energy efficiency resource \nstandard that would require utilities to achieve a small percentage of \nenergy savings every year based on their annual sales.\n\n  Under my amendment, utilities can generate energy savings through a \nvariety of ways, including helping their customers save energy through \nenergy-efficient programs, improving energy efficiency in their own \ndistribution systems or credit trading.\n  Energy savings requirements are phased in in small increments each \nyear, which will give the utilities enough time to boost their energy \nsavings program.\n  This is not a new idea. Many States already successfully have \nimplemented EERS standards--not only California but Colorado, \nConnecticut, Hawaii, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, \nVirginia, and Washington.\n  Several States, including my State of New York, as well as New \nJersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, and North Carolina, are actively \nworking to implement the standard. Since the States are moving forward \non this standard, it makes sense for Congress to create a national \nstandard so all Americans can reap the benefit of increased energy \nsavings.\n  According to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, by \n2020 a national EERS will reduce peak electric demand by 130,000 \nmegawatts, saving enough to power 40 million households and reduce \nCO2 emissions by more than 300 million metric tons. That is \nequivalent to taking 70 million cars off the road. Is that not \nincredible? By simply requiring our utilities to be efficient, it is \nequivalent to taking 70 million cars off the road. I hope we are going \nto do it. It would save U.S. consumers $26 billion from their utility \nbills. So this is a huge amendment that can do a great deal.\n  Now, my second amendment deals with buildings. Buildings account for \n37 percent of the total energy used in the United States and two-thirds \nof the electricity. We all focus on cars. We are going to have a fight \non CAFE standards. But buildings are as important as cars in producing \nefficiency. There is much less controversy and we can get it done more \neasily.\n  California has demonstrated that significant energy gains can be \nachieved through State building codes that are well designed and \nimplemented. But despite the great savings made by California, many \nStates have inadequate State building codes or none at all.\n  Again, the Federal Government has lagged behind the States in setting \naggressive energy saving building codes. Under my amendment, commercial \nand residential building codes will be required to meet specific energy \nuse targets. Both must be 30 percent more efficient by 2015 and 50 \npercent more efficient by 2022.\n  States will be deemed compliant once they adopt an acceptable code \nand as long as 90 percent of all new buildings comply with the States's \ncode. Even if a State is not in compliance, each city that meets the \ncriteria will be in compliance.\n  I wish to salute the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, for taking \nthe lead in imposing such standards on the city of New York.\n  Finally, my amendment will authorize funding for technical \nassistance, training, and to help States ensure they are in compliance \nwith these energy-efficient targets. Again, according to the Alliance \nto Save Energy, this amendment--listen to this--could save our country \n5 percent of its total energy use. That simple amendment, done now in \nCalifornia, could be done here--5 percent of our total energy use. It \nwould save consumers $50 billion a year and reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions by an equivalent of taking another 70 million cars off the \nroad. So it is obvious we should do these things.\n  Finally, the amendments on appliances. Again, California took the \nlead in improving energy efficiency standards for appliances. However, \nFederal law has restricted the ability of States in favor of lower \nFederal standards that, in many cases, have languished at DOE. For \nexample, earlier this year, the GAO found that DOE had missed 34 out \nof--guess how many--34--34 out of 34--Congressionally set deadlines for \nreviewing and updating appliance and equipment standards.\n  GAO found that delays on four of the overdue standards will cost \nconsumers $28 billion in energy savings by 2030. In addition, even when \nDOE finally gets around to setting the new standards, these standards \nfail to meet the very real energy needs of our country.\n  My amendment also fixes these problems in the bill. First, they will \nstrengthen the process through which the States can apply to DOE to set \nhigher standards for appliances that are currently regulated by the \nFederal Government; second, to restore authority for efficiency \nstandards--that is the second amendment--to the States when DOE misses \nlegal deadlines for setting or revising standards.\n  My amendment states that if DOE misses legal deadlines for setting up \nupdated efficiency standards, States may create higher standards that \nallow them to address their energy needs more effectively.\n  By cutting our energy use through these energy efficiency measures, \nwhile also increasing the use of clean, renewable alternative fuels, we \ncan make a huge difference and begin to address our energy \nproblems, from ending our dependence on unstable foreign sources of oil \nto helping consumers lower their rising energy bills. I urge adoption \nof these four commonsense efficiency measures and look forward to \nworking with the managers of the bill as we go forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7879-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, when the United States went to war with \nIraq in 2003, a number of observers feared that a massive humanitarian \ncrisis could occur if a smooth transition was not successful. Despite \nthe quick collapse of Saddam Hussein's\n\n[[Page S7880]]\n\ndictatorship, the heroic performance of our servicemembers, and the \npredictions of some in the administration, the transition was far from \nsmooth. Nonetheless, we did not initially see a humanitarian emergency \nin Iraq.\n  Four years later, however, this emergency is now unfolding in the \ncruelest of ways. With Iraq enmeshed in civil war, the relentless \nviolence has displaced numerous civilians not only within Iraq but \noutside of it as well.\n  There are a range of possible factors behind the current situation: \nas the war is increasingly defined by its sectarian nature, the growing \npotential for neighborhoods to be ``cleansed'' by one ethnicity or \nanother may accelerate displacement patterns; the overall increase in \nviolence that occurred following the golden dome shrine bombing of \nFebruary 2006 may have served as a catalyst that changed the face of \nthe war and the tactics of those fighting it.\n  Regardless of the reasons, the results are clear--millions of Iraqis \nhave been forced from their homes because of entrenched fear and \nrampant violence. Basic survival needs such as food, clean water, \nshelter, sanitation, and health care are in short supply. The \ngovernment infrastructure has collapsed--if it ever truly existed--\ntaking with it the communities it served.\n  The U.N. High Commission for Refugees estimates that there are nearly \n2 million displaced people within Iraq and close to 2.5 million seeking \nrefuge in neighboring countries. In total, that is almost 4.5 million \npeople, Mr. President, 4.5 million individuals or approximately 13 \npercent of the total Iraqi population. Many of these individuals are \nfrom Iraq's shattered middle class and will be critical to rebuilding \nthe country. But who can say where they will be when that time comes \nand whether they will be willing or able to contribute to that process.\n  The United States has admitted only a small number of Iraqi refugees \nsince the beginning of the war. According to the State Department, \nthere have been just 687 Iraqi refugees admitted to the United States \nsince the war began in 2003. We have a particular responsibility to \nprovide aid and safe haven for Iraqis whose lives are threatened \nbecause they worked for us.\n  Fortunately, many neighboring countries have been willing to step up \nto the plate and allow those Iraqis fleeing their homeland to seek \ntemporary shelter despite the fact that many of their needs are \nstraining the already weak and overburdened social services. Indeed, \nmost of Iraq's neighbors are unable to provide adequate assistance to \nthose living within their borders, citizens and refugees alike. The \nintroduction of more than 2 million additional people into these \nalready precarious environments could tip the balance in the wrong \ndirection.\n  This humanitarian disaster is emblematic of this administration's \npoor planning when it comes to virtually every aspect of the war in \nIraq. The administration's failure to respond adequately to the needs \nof these refugees and displaced people will have dramatic consequences \nfor regional and global stability. We still have a chance to reverse \ncourse in Iraq, however, to refocus our strategy, and regain our \ncredibility so we can work with the international community and resolve \nthis crisis appropriately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7880-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Specialist Adam Herold\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

He retired in 1977 as a first sergeant for the 9th Field \nMaintenance Squadron at Beale Air Force Base in Marysville, CA. After \nhis retirement from the U.S. Air Force, Mr. Simmons remained in \nMarysville and began a long career of service to his community.\n  Bill Simmons used the leadership skills he gained in the Air Force \nand began his career with Yuba County as a group counselor in the \njuvenile probation system.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating the 2006-2007 National Hockey League champions, the \nAnaheim Ducks. The Anaheim Ducks demonstrated remarkable skill, \nteamwork, and determination in becoming the first California hockey \nteam to win the prestigious Stanley Cup.\n  The 2006 to 2007 season will be remembered as a truly landmark season \nfor the Anaheim Ducks. During the course of the season, the Ducks \nplayed in the franchise's 1000th regular season game and recorded their \n1000th point after a much-deserved 4 to 2 victory on March 11, 2007. \nThe Ducks began their season in fine form as they set an NHL record by \nremaining undefeated in regulation play for the first 16 games of the \nseason. The Ducks used a high-octane offense and a stout defense to \nachieve the first 100-point season and the first Pacific Division title \nin the franchise's history. Throughout the season, the Ducks were a \nmodel of hard work, dedication and consistency.\n  Under the leadership of a dedicated management and coaching staff and \nwith contributions from an outstanding roster of seasoned veterans and \npromising young players, the Ducks defeated the Minnesota Wild, the \nVancouver Canucks, and the Detroit Red Wings in their usual spirited \nfashion en route to winning the Western Conference title. In the \nfinals, the Ducks triumphed over the Ottawa Senators in a fiercely \ncontested series that ensured the oldest and most famous trophy in all \nof North American professional sports, the Stanley Cup, will finally \nmake its way to California for the first time.\n  It is my pleasure to congratulate all the hard working members of the \nDucks organization who worked tirelessly to bring so much joy and pride \nto the people of Orange County and to the State of California. Their \nsuccesses are considerable, and I salute their accomplishments. As the \nAnaheim Ducks and their fans celebrate their first Stanley Cup victory, \nI congratulate them on a truly remarkable and memorable season and wish \nthem more success in future seasons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7881-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      125TH ANNIVERSARY OF LaMOURE\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it was 125 years ago that pioneers \ncreated the city of LaMoure, ND.\n  LaMoure and its surrounding territory got off to an unexpectedly \nstrong start due to the work of a fellow named MAJ H.T. Elliott. He was \nemployed by a real estate firm whose financial fortunes depended upon \nthe prosperity and success of homesteaders and town builders in the \nLaMoure area.\n  To ensure that region boomed, Major Elliott was sent to the nearest \nrailroad station to meet incoming emigrants. If they appeared to be \nbright, industrious, honest folks with adequate financial resources, \nElliott directed them to the region around LaMoure. But if they were of \na suspect type, Elliott sent them off in the opposite direction.\n  Elliott himself was the county's first citizen but had the misfortune \nto establish the town of Grand Rapids which immediately found itself in \na fight with LaMoure over which should be the county seat. When Grand \nRapids lost that election, LaMoure's citizens armed themselves and \ntrooped across country in the dead of night to seize the governmental \nrecords.\n  They were met at Grand Rapids by barricaded doors and rifles \nbristling from the courthouse windows. But with the aid of a battering \nram, they smashed their way in and the Grand Rapids defenders slipped \naway. LaMoure had its first triumph.\n  There have been many more since then--some headline making like State \nchampionship sports teams, installation of a Coast Guard radar site \nserving mariners and pilots all around the globe, a national award as \nan All-America City, home to U.S. Senator Milton Young.\n  But many more of its successes never garnered headlines. They were \nthe quiet but meaningful stories of strong families, vibrant \nbusinesses, prosperous farms, good kids, and the warmth of citizens who \ncared about each other.\n  LaMoure is both a wellspring and a repository of what is best about \nAmerica--old-fashioned values of honesty, decency, hard work, faith, \nand family. Its foundation is solid, and its people will continue to \ncreate a community where dreams are turned into reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7881-3", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7881-S7882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      125TH ANNIVERSARY OF RUTLAND\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it was 125 years ago that pioneers \nin Dakota Territory created the community that is now Rutland, ND. \nThose pioneers included hopeful immigrants from Norway, Sweden, \nGermany, Ireland, Poland, England, and Scotland, seeking new homesteads \non the unbroken prairie; hard-driving businessmen and railroad workers \nfrom the Eastern States finding opportunity on America's frontier; and \nthe Wahpeton-Sisseton band of the Dakota people, adapting to changing \ntimes and preserving ancient traditions as their world changed around \nthem.\n  These pioneers built a solid foundation of family, faith, and \neducation for their community, establishing farm homes, churches, and \nschools first. When the Great Northern Railway built its line through \nthe territory, the community was given its name in honor of Rutland, \nVT, the hometown of many of the pioneer railroaders. The green hills of \nthe Coteau de Prairie south of the town, reminded them of their home in \nthe Green Mountains.\n  In those early years, the pioneers of the Rutland community endured \ndrought, harsh winters, and economic exploitation, but their faith, \nindependent spirit, and cooperative attitude carried them through the \ntough times and made the good times better. It has been said that \nRutland could be renamed Phoenix because, like that mythical bird, the \ncity's business district has twice risen from the ashes of devastating \nfires to rebuild better and stronger each time. One of the business \nbuildings destroyed by the second fire, back in 1941, was a unique \ncombination of economic enterprises, perhaps a forerunner of today's \nmegamalls. The second floor was a hotel, providing rest and refuge for \nweary travelers, while three businesses occupied the ground floor: In \nthe front was a harness and shoe repair shop, keeping Rutland folks \neither afoot or on horseback, and they always knew which; at the center \nof the building was a cream station, where farm produce including \nchickens, eggs, cream, and butter was bought and sold; and at the rear \nof the building was a funeral parlor, which had a double life as an \nillicit gambling casino, when a paying customer was not laid out in \nsomber repose. That building and those businesses went up in smoke many \nyears ago, but this week, another new business, the Rutland General \nStore, has opened its doors on Rutland's Main Street, showing that the \nspirit of optimism that inspired our pioneer ancestors is still alive \nand thriving in the community they built. The optimism and patriotism \nof Rutland citizens is reflected in the fact that men and women from \nthe community have served in the Nation's military service in every \nconflict from the Civil War to the current engagements in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Over the past 125 years, Rutland has been noted for many \naccomplishments: The home of one of North Dakota's outstanding amateur \nbaseball teams, the Rutland Roosters; the Rutland Rockets and Sargent \nCentral Cadets High School sports teams always tough and usually \nvictorious; location of the Tewaukon National Wildlife Refuge, \nconserving and preserving our Nation's natural heritage; an award as a \nNational Bicentennial Community in 1976; an award as a North Dakota \nCentennial Community in 1989; home to Obed Wyum, a national leader in \nthe establishment of rural electric and rural telephone cooperatives; \nand making it\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n\ninto the ``Guinness Book of World Records'' with the world's largest \nhamburger, a 3,591-pound whopper, as part of the community's centennial \ncelebration in 1982.\n  But many more of Rutland's successes never garnered headlines. They \nwere the quiet but meaningful stories of strong families, vibrant \nbusinesses, prosperous farms, good kids, and the warmth of citizens who \ncared about each other.\n  Rutland is both a wellspring and a repository of what is best about \nAmerica--old-fashioned values of honesty, decency, hard work, faith, \nand family. Its foundation is solid, and its people will continue to \ncreate a community where dreams are turned into reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7882-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FORT ABERCROMBIE\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of North Dakota's oldest \ncommunities celebrates its anniversary this week. Abercrombie and the \nnearby fort after which it is named date their origins back 150 years.\n  Fort Abercrombie is famous for having been the site of one of the \nmost prolonged battles in the American West between Native Americans \nand U.S. soldiers. Fresh from their triumphs in a Minnesota uprising, \nDakota warriors quickly moved to secure their gains by attacking the \nlast military post between the decimated, burning white settlements and \nthe wide open Great Plains.\n  The defenders of the fort were in a desperate pinch. The fort had no \nprotective palisade and little else in the way of defense, it was \nseveral hundred miles from the nearest help, and, worst of all, rifle \nammunition was critically low.\n  For a month the soldiers, and the citizens who had rushed to the \nprotection of the fort, held off Little Crow's warriors. What saved \nthem was the discovery that the metal balls with which the fort's \ncannon shells were packed were identical to what their rifles required \nfor ammunition.\n  Fort Abercrombie has a storied history. Military trails radiated out \nto Fort Wadsworth, Fort Ransom, and Fort Totten. It was here that wagon \ntrains embarked for Montana's gold fields, that the 1870 peace treaty \nbetween 900 Dakota and Chippewa delegates was signed, that oxcart \ncaravans from Canada to the Twin Cities overnighted.\n  Fort Abercrombie is quiet now but houses a handsome State park and \nhistorical center. The adjacent community, however, continues to hum. \nIn 1936, an observer called it ``an enterprising, live, wide-awake \ncommunity.'' That is still an honest description, especially this \nweekend.\n  A street dance, military ball, school reunion, parades, wagon train, \nhistory tours, and a multitude of other events will fill the days. \nAlthough I expect the activity will be as intensive as it was in 1862, \nit will not be as desperate. Instead, it will be a classic festival of \nsmall town America--one of remembrance and homecoming, of neighbors and \nfamily, of heritage and pride. I send its citizens birthday greetings \nand a salute for its proud and singular history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7882-2", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL VETERANS WHEELCHAIR GAMES\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

The National Veterans Wheelchair Games is a great sporting \nevent, and it is also a chance for athletes to develop lasting \nfriendships with other veterans who have faced and overcome similar \nobstacles.\n  I thank the Clement J.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the memory \nof Jeff Erlanger, an extraordinary person who was a prominent member of \nthe Madison community, a family friend, and an inspiration to me and \neveryone lucky enough to know him.\n  To understand what a positive force Jeff was in people's lives, I \nwill quote something he said in an ad he did for Wisconsin Public \nTelevision a few years ago: ``It doesn't matter what I can't do--what \nmatters is what I can do.'' Those are words that everyone should live \nby, but Jeff, who was a quadriplegic, really did live by them. He never \ndwelled on the many challenges he faced; instead, he focused on helping \nothers, making tremendous contributions of time and effort to a wide \narray of organizations.\n  He served on the Economic Development Commission, as chairman of the \nCommission on People with Disabilities, and as chairman of the board of \nthe Community Living Alliance, as well as many other positions. Among \nhis accomplishments was his successful push for the accessible taxicab \nservice that exists in Madison today. He also ran for the Madison City \nCouncil in 2002. Jeff's commitment to public service says volumes about \nthe kind of person he was and why his passing is such a loss for the \nMadison community.\n  Jeff used his personal experience to inspire others, visiting \nclassrooms to talk about living with a disability, and appearing on \n``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' at the age of 10. He became good friends \nwith Fred Rogers, speaking both at Rogers' induction to the Television \nAcademy Hall of Fame and at a memorial service when Rogers passed away \nin 2003.\n  Throughout his adulthood, he continued to make life-changing \nconnections with people he met. Incredibly, he saved the life of a \nBoston woman he was talking with online, calling both AOL and the \nBoston police after she told him she had cut her wrists but wouldn't \ntell him what her last name was or where she lived. They tracked the \nwoman down and rushed her to an emergency room. It is just one amazing \nstory from a truly amazing life.\n  I am proud to say that Jeff was an intern in my office. He was also a \ndear friend to members of my family. He meant so much to so many \npeople, both those he knew, those he inspired through his appearances, \nand those he helped through his life of community service. I am deeply \nsaddened by his passing, and my thoughts are with his parents, his \nfamily, and his friends. Jeff left behind a wonderful legacy, of hope, \nenthusiasm, and caring, and that is something everyone who knew him can \ncherish.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7882-4", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7882-S7883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL EMERSON N. GARDNER JR.\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a marine \nofficer from my home State of Maryland, LTG Emerson N. Gardner, Jr., \nnow serving as the Deputy Commandant for Programs and Resources, \nHeadquarters, United States Marine Corps, as he prepares to leave this \nposition for one of even greater importance.\n  The position of Deputy Commandant for Programs and Resources is one \nof the most demanding and important jobs within Marine Corps \nHeadquarters. For the past 2 years, as Deputy Commandant, Lieutenant \nGeneral Gardner has been responsible for planning, programming, \nbudgeting and executing total appropriations in excess of\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\n$100 billion. He has led the effort to ensure that the Marine Corps had \nthe resources they needed for success in the current conflict and \nprepared to answer the nation's call in the future.\n  While Lieutenant General Gardner is responsible for many critical \nissues, he has been a champion in protecting our forces deployed to \nIraq and Afghanistan. He has been a particularly strong advocate for \nthe mine resistant ambush protected family of vehicles, or MRAP. These \nvehicles have the possibility of drastically reducing American \ncasualties caused by improvised explosive devices and Lieutenant \nGeneral Gardner has been leading the effort to secure support for them. \nLieutenant General Gardner has taken the time to educate, encourage, \nguide--and when necessary to cajole and prod--decisionmakers and action \nofficers wherever necessary to accelerate the fielding of MRAP \nvehicles. Throughout this process, he has been everywhere and involved \nin every aspect of the MRAP program. So ardent has Lieutenant General \nGardner been in support of this life saving program, that he has become \nknown within Headquarters Marine Corps and throughout the Pentagon as \n``Mr. MRAP.''\n  I know that a grateful nation shares my admiration for Lieutenant \nGeneral Gardner an indomitable leader whose tireless efforts have \ndirectly contributed to the timely delivery of MRAP vehicles to \ntheater.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe emergency declared with respect to the accumulation of a large \nvolume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the \nRussian Federation is to continue beyond June 21, 2007.\n  It remains a major national security goal of the United States to \nensure that fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons \npursuant to various arms control and disarmament agreements is \ndedicated to peaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and \nprotected from diversion to activities of proliferation concern. The \naccumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in \nthe territory of the Russian Federation continues to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of \nthe United States. For this reason, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to \nthe accumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material \nin the territory of the Russian Federation and maintain in force these \nemergency authorities to respond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada urging Congress to allow certain proceeds \n     from the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998 \n     to be used for Nevada's state parks; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, in 1998, Congress passed the Southern Nevada \n     Public Land Management Act of 1998, Public Law 105-263, which \n     allows the Secretary of the Interior to sell certain federal \n     lands in Clark County, Nevada, for possible development and \n     authorizes use of the proceeds to acquire, conserve and \n     protect environmentally sensitive lands in the State of \n     Nevada; and\n       Whereas, under the provisions of the Act, 5 percent of the \n     profits from sales of the land is allocated to help fund \n     education, 10 percent is allocated for water and airport \n     infrastructure projects and the remaining 85 percent is \n     deposited into a special account for disbursement; and\n       Whereas, the money in the special account is specified for \n     certain capital improvement projects, including projects at \n     Lake Mead, Red Rock Canyon, the Desert National Wildlife \n     Refuge and other federally managed recreational areas, the \n     development of parks, trails and a multispecies habitat \n     conservation plan in and around Clark County, the acquisition \n     of environmentally sensitive lands, and restoration and \n     conservation of the Lake Tahoe Basin; and\n       Whereas, since the first auction of land in 1999, this Act \n     has generated approximately $3 billion, $2.5 billion of which \n     has been disbursed from the special account; and\n       Whereas, although the money distributed pursuant to the Act \n     has been used for the enhancement and conservation of many \n     federally managed areas in Nevada, there are numerous state \n     parks in Nevada which could also benefit from this money; and\n       Whereas, with the growing popularity of the many rural \n     recreational and historic sites in Nevada, it is vital that \n     Nevada's state parks be maintained and preserved for the \n     continued enjoyment of the residents of Nevada and its \n     tourists; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     jointly, That the members of the Nevada Legislature urge \n     Congress to amend the Southern Nevada Public Land Management \n     Act of 1998 to authorize the State of Nevada to use a portion \n     of the money in the special account for the improvement and \n     preservation of Nevada's state parks; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     the Secretary of the Interior and each member of the Nevada \n     Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-132.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Maine urging Congress to fully appropriate the \n     money for radioactive waste management; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, a nuclear-powered electric generation facility was \n     located in Maine at Wiscasset's Bailey Point; and\n       Whereas, spent nuclear fuel and greater-than-class-C, high-\n     level radioactive waste is currently being stored in Maine in \n     dry casks 300 yards from the coastal tide of the Sheepscot \n     River, at only 21 feet above sea level; and\n       Whereas, dry cask storage is now being required at the \n     Maine Yankee interim storage site well after the expiration \n     of its license to produce electricity; and\n       Whereas, continued storage of high-level radioactive spent \n     nuclear fuel and greater-than-class-C, high-level waste in \n     dry casks at the Wiscasset site is not in the best interests \n     of the citizens of that community, nor of the State of Maine; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 \n     established a national policy that the Federal Government is \n     responsible for safe, permanent disposal in a geologic \n     repository of all high-level radioactive waste, including \n     spent nuclear fuel from commercial power reactors and \n     greater-than-class-C waste, as well as military nuclear \n     waste; and\n       Whereas, the 109th Congress failed to enact a budget for \n     the nuclear waste disposal program for the current fiscal \n     year and took no action on proposed legislation to reform the \n     federal Nuclear Waste Fund to provide more reliable financing \n     of the repository program; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Accountability for Nuclear Waste \n     Storage Act of 2007 (S. 784) has been introduced in this \n     Congress, requiring the Federal Government to assume legal \n     ownership of all spent nuclear fuel in the country; and\n       Whereas, the ratepayers of nuclear energy, including Maine, \n     have paid an estimated $19,000,000,000 into the federal \n     Nuclear Waste Fund for the proper disposal of nuclear waste \n     since 1983, and the ratepayers of nuclear energy pay into the \n     Nuclear Waste Fund at least $750,000,000 each year for the \n     purpose of a national repository; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Energy now affirms \n     it cannot initiate retrieval of repository waste for disposal \n     any sooner than 2017 at the very earliest, 19 years past the \n     federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 statutory mandate \n     date for initiating retrieval, and the Department of Energy's \n     Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management will need \n     full funding to submit a construction application to the \n     United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission by June 2008; and\n       Whereas, the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     requires a minimum of 3 years to review such an application; \n     and\n       Whereas, in order to meet the 2008 license application \n     milestone, the President's budget for fiscal year 2008 \n     requests $202,500,000 from the Nuclear Waste Fund and \n     $292,000,000 from the Defense Nuclear Waste Disposal \n     appropriation to achieve these goals; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the United States Congress fully appropriate the \n     $494,500,000 budget request for the civilian radioactive \n     waste management program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Congress should enact legislation that will \n     ensure repository appropriations to match annual Nuclear \n     Waste Fund fee revenue collected from ratepayers for this \n     specific purpose, and ensuring the future availability of any \n     and all surplus for its intended purpose; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of Maine \n     opposes the proposed Federal Accountability for Nuclear Waste \n     Storage Act of 2007 and any proposal for the Federal \n     Government to take title to spent nuclear fuel in this State \n     if the effect of such an action would be that spent nuclear \n     fuel would be kept in Maine without any protection from its \n     long-term effects on the State's population and from acts of \n     intrusion that would endanger the State's environmental and \n     economic well-being; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary\n\n[[Page S7886]]\n\n     of State, be transmitted to the Honorable George W.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey urging Congress to enact the Military \n     Death Benefit Improvement Act of 2005; to the Committee on \n     Armed Services.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 126\n\n       Whereas, the bill before Congress known as the Military \n     Death Benefit Improvement Act of 2005 proposes to increase \n     the military death gratuity from $12,000 to $100,000; and\n       Whereas, the military death gratuity is money provided \n     within 72 hours to assist with the immediate financial needs \n     of families of service members who are killed while on active \n     duty; and\n       Whereas, this legislation would apply not only to those who \n     are currently serving on active duty in the military, but \n     would also be applied retroactively to all active duty \n     service members who have died since September 11, 2001; and\n       Whereas, the current military death gratuity of $12,000 is \n     woefully inadequate to compensate families who have made the \n     ultimate sacrifice; and\n       Whereas, in the face of the great emotional hardship caused \n     by the loss of a loved one, the families of our brave \n     servicemen and women should not also be faced with financial \n     hardship; and\n       Whereas, the passage of the Military Death Benefit \n     Improvement Act of 2005 will send a message to all men and \n     women in uniform that their government and their country \n     recognize and appreciate their service and sacrifice; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. This House strongly supports an increase in the military \n     death gratuity from $12,000 to $100,000, and urges the \n     President and Congress to enact legislation (H.R. 292 and S. \n     44) implementing this policy.\n       2.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey expressing strong opposition to the \n     surge of U.S. troops in Iraq; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                      Assembly Resolution No. 246\n\n       Whereas, President George W. Bush announced in January that \n     he would send more United States armed forces to Iraq and \n     extend the duty of many such troops already in that country \n     in an effort to end the sectarian violence that has engulfed \n     that nation and to provide stability to the new Iraqi \n     government; and\n       Whereas, the United States has already committed 132,000 \n     armed forces personnel to that country and plans to escalate \n     troop levels by 21,500 for a total of 153,500, at a cost of \n     $5.6 billion; and\n       Whereas, the president's ``surge'' comes at a time when a \n     substantial majority of the American public have expressed \n     opposition to the war, in general, and his plan to expand it, \n     in particular; and\n       Whereas, the president's plan is also opposed by members of \n     Congress, including many who are members of the same \n     political party as the president, who believe that the United \n     States is ultimately responsible for the civil war gripping \n     Iraq; and\n       Whereas, many family members of service personnel fighting \n     in Iraq are already deeply concerned about their loved ones' \n     safety and are disappointed that the tour of many such \n     soldiers will be extended by at least several months; and\n       Whereas, to date, the global war on terror, of which the \n     war in Iraq is a part, has already had a significant impact \n     on service men and women from New Jersey and their families, \n     with over 6,000 State Army and Air National Guard and Reserve \n     troops deployed and 83 service personnel killed and many more \n     injured; and\n       Whereas, the surge will effect 159 members of the New \n     Jersey National Guard currently in Iraq, so that instead of \n     returning in March or April, members of the 117th \n     Reconnaissance Surveillance Target Acquisition Unit and the \n     250th Brigade Support Battalion will now be returning in July \n     or August; and\n       Whereas, it is clear to this House that sending more troops \n     to Iraq will result in the death of more American service \n     personnel but will do little to end the civil war in Iraq or \n     bring lasting peace to the Iraqi people and stability to \n     their new government; and\n       Whereas, despite this House's opposition to President \n     Bush's action, it strongly and unequivocally supports the \n     brave men and women in all branches of the Armed Forces of \n     the United States who are currently in Iraq, those service \n     personnel who will be sent to that county as a part of the \n     surge and the families of such troops who remain at home \n     concerned about their loved ones in the war zone; and\n       Whereas, it is therefore fitting and proper for this House \n     to express its strong opposition to President Bush's surge in \n     United States troops in Iraq; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey.\n       1.

A bill to provide for 2 programs to authorize the use of \nleave by caregivers for family members of certain individuals \nperforming military service, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that \nshould, and could, have been law 1 year ago, the Military Family \nSupport Act. This bill provides modest but significant relief for the \nfamilies of the brave American soldiers deployed overseas. I was \ndisappointed that, after passing the Senate last year as an amendment \nto the fiscal year 2007 Defense Department authorization bill, this \nprovision was removed in conference. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by Senator Casey.\n  As part of the predeployment process, military personnel with \ndependent children or other dependent family members designate a \ncaregiver for their dependents. Dependents may be children, elderly \nparents, an ill sibling; anyone who requires care. These caregivers act \nin the deployed personnel's place to provide care during the period of \ndeployment. The caregiver could be a spouse, parent, sibling, or other \nresponsible adult who is capable of caring, and willing to care, for \nthe dependents in question.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, the Military Family Support \nAct, would create two programs to provide additional leave options for \npersons who have been designated as caregivers. The bill would require \nthe Office of Personnel Management, OPM, to create a program under \nwhich Federal employees who are designated as caregivers could use \naccrued annual or sick leave, leave bank benefits, and other leave \navailable to them under title 5 for purposes directly relating to or \nresulting from their designation as a caregiver.\n  The second program would be administered by the Department of Labor \nfor private sector employees. The Department would create a voluntary \nprogram, allowing private sector companies to create similar programs \nfor their employees. Many companies across the country are already \nworking with employees to provide support when an employee or a family \nmember of an employee is called to active duty. I commend these \ncompanies for their compassion and understanding, and I hope that this \nprogram would expand such options to more workers.\n  Lastly, this bill would require a report from the Government \nAccountability Office evaluating both the OPM and voluntary private \nsector program. If the report demonstrates that the program has helped \nmilitary families, which I believe it will, Congress may act to expand \nthe programs or make them permanent.\n  I want to be clear that the legislation I am introducing today \nspecifically exempts Family Medical Leave Act leave from the types of \nleave that can be used by designated caregivers under this legislation. \nLast Congress, I introduced legislation to expand the FMLA to cover \nleave for designated caregivers. That legislation, however, met with \nopposition from some Members who object to the FMLA itself. While I \ncontinue to believe that this opposition is misguided and that family \nmembers of deployed servicemembers should be able to take leave under \nthe FMLA, I have drafted this compromise measure to address those \nconcerns.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by the National Military Family \nAssociation, the National Partnership for Women and Families, and the \nMilitary Officers Association of America.\n  In small towns and big cities all over this country, family members \nof deployed servicemembers are struggling to care for their children \nwithout their spouses' help. In addition, many servicemembers care for \nelderly parents and this responsibility often falls to a sibling or \nspouse when that servicemember is deployed abroad. While we may not be \nable to promise the safe return of each one of these brave men and \nwomen, we can provide this modest relief to their families here at \nhome. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I yield the \nfloor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1649\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Family Support Act \n     of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Russ Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: The National Military Family \n     Association (NMFA) is the only national organization whose \n     sole focus is the military family and whose goal is to \n     influence the development and implementation of policies that \n     will improve the lives of the families of the Army, Navy, Air \n     Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and the Commissioned Corps \n     of the Public Health Service and the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration. For more than 35 years, its staff \n     and volunteers, comprised mostly of military family members, \n     have built a reputation for being the leading experts on \n     military family issues.\n       On behalf of NMFA and the families it serves, we commend \n     you on your leadership in sponsoring the ``Military Family \n     Support Act of 2007''. Authorizing federal employees who have \n     been designated ``caregivers'' by the Armed Forces to use \n     their previously earned leave time in a more flexible manner \n     helps to alleviate some of the stress caregivers experience \n     during a deployment. NMFA also applauds the inclusion of a \n     provision that instructs the Department of Labor to solicit \n     private businesses to voluntarily offer more accommodating \n     leave time to employees affected by a service member's \n     deployment overseas.\n       NMFA has heard from many families about the difficulty of \n     balancing family obligations with job requirements when a \n     close family member is deployed. Suddenly, they are single \n     parents or, in the case of grandparents, assuming the new \n     responsibility of caring for grandchildren. The days leading \n     up to a deployment can be filled with pre-deployment \n     briefings and putting legal affairs in order. Families also \n     need the opportunity to spend precious time together prior to \n     a long separation. The need is no less when the service \n     member returns. Reintegration and transition requires \n     training not only for the service member but for the family \n     as well in order to be most effective.\n       Military families, especially those of deployed service \n     members, are called upon to make extraordinary sacrifices. \n     This amendment offers families some breathing room as they \n     adjust to this time of separation.\n       Thank you for your support and interest in military \n     families. If NMFA can be of any assistance to you in other \n     areas concerning military families, please contact Jessica \n     Perdew in the Government Relations Department at 703-931-6632 \n     or by e-mail at\n     jessica.perdew@nmfa.org.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Tanna K.

This \n     important legislation would allow federal employees to take \n     job-protected leave to address family caregiving needs caused \n     by the deployment of a family member and would authorize a \n     similar voluntary project for the private sector to be \n     administered by the Department of Labor. We applaud your \n     leadership on this issue.\n       The National Partnership for Women & Families is a non-\n     profit, non-partisan advocacy organization dedicated to \n     promoting fairness in the workplace, access to quality\n\n[[Page S7892]]\n\n     health care and policies that help women and men meet the \n     demands of work and family. We are proud to have led the \n     coalition that helped enact the Family and Medical Leave Act \n     (FMLA), which has helped over 60 million workers take time \n     off from work to welcome a new child or deal with an acute \n     medical need.\n       But there is more to be done to support America's families, \n     including the 40 percent of workers who today cannot access \n     the FMLA. This legislation will close a critical gap in the \n     FMLA by addressing the specific needs of families with active \n     military members, and could not come at a more critical time \n     in the lives of our military families. Its passage will give \n     them time to prepare, logistically and mentally, before or \n     during a loved one's departure for active duty--without fear \n     of losing a much needed job.\n       We thank you for supporting our troops by helping to ensure \n     their families are cared for in times of need.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Debra L. Ness,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Smith, Mr. Biden, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1651. A bill to assist certain Iraqis who have worked directly \nwith, or are threatened by their association with, the United States, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, because of the war in Iraq, more than 2 \nmillion Iraqis have been internally displaced in their own country, and \n2 million other Iraqis are in neighboring countries throughout the \nregion, primarily Jordan and Syria.\n  The humanitarian needs of the refugees and internally displaced \nIraqis are immense. If their needs are not quickly and adequately met, \nthese populations could become a fertile recruiting ground for \nterrorists.\n  Iraqi refugees are also a significant financial burden on countries \nin the region. As the Iraq Study Group concluded, if the refugee crisis \n``is not addressed, Iraq and the region could be further \ndestabilized.''\n  Many Iraqis who have worked in critical positions in direct support \nof the U.S. Government in Iraq have been killed or injured in reprisals \nfor their support of our effort. Many more Iraqis associated with the \nUnited States have fled their country in fear of being killed or \ninjured.\n  Clearly, we cannot resettle all of Iraq's refugees in the United \nStates, but we have a fundamental obligation to help the vast number of \nIraqis displaced in Iraq and throughout the region by the war and the \nassociated chaos, especially those who have supported America's efforts \nin Iraq.\n  In April 2007, Assistant Secretary of State Ellen Sauerbray said the \nUnited States ``could resettle up to 25,000 Iraqi refugees this year.'' \nIn May 2007, Under Secretary Paula Dobriansky said, ``We are committed \nto honoring our moral debt to those Iraqis who have provided assistance \nto the United States military and embassy.'' On June 8, Secretary Rice \nsaid ``the people that I'm most worried about in the near term are the \npeople who've worked with us who might be subject to recrimination and \nreprisal. And we're trying to step up our efforts on their behalf.''\n  It is essential for the United States to develop a comprehensive and \neffective approach to meet the rapidly growing needs of Iraq's refugees \nand internally displaced persons, especially those who are associated \nwith the United States.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senators Smith, Biden, \nHagel, Leahy, Levin, and Lieberman seeks to accomplish these goals.\n  First, the legislation would create a special category of applicants \nfor refugee status in Iraq. Those eligible for this program, a P-2 \ncategory for refugees of special humanitarian concern, would be the \nIraqis most closely associated with the United States. Iraqis who \nqualify would be those, 1. who have been employed by or worked directly \nwith the U.S. Government in Iraq; or, 2. who were employed in Iraq by a \nmedia or nongovernmental organization based in the United States or by \nan organization or entity that has received a grant from, or entered \ninto a cooperative agreement or contract with, the U.S. Government; or, \n3. who are spouses, children, sons, daughters, siblings and parents of \nthose who worked for or with us; or, 4. who are members of religious or \nminority communities and have close family members in the U.S.\n  Those eligible would not have to be referred to our Government by the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or a U.S. Embassy. All \napplicants, however, would need to demonstrate a well-founded fear of \npersecution. Applicants would be required to go through recently \napproved extensive security screening.\n  P-2 visas for these refugees would come out of the overall authorized \nadmissions number for the refugee program, currently established at \n70,000. That figure is determined every year by the President in close \nconsultation with the Congress.\n  In addition to the new P-2 category of refugee applications, the \nlegislation would expand the current U.S. Government program which \nprovides special immigrant visas only to Iraqi and Afghan translators \nand interpreters. Those eligible for the expanded special immigrant \nvisa program are Iraqis who have been employed by or worked directly \nwith the United States for 1 year in the aggregate since 2003, and need \nnot have served as a translator or interpreter for the military or \nDepartment of State.\n  Applicants for SIV visas would not need to demonstrate a well-founded \nfear of persecution, but they would need to meet security requirements, \ndemonstrate that they provided faithful service to our Government, and \nprovide a recommendation or evaluation. The Secretary of State would be \nrequired to provide applicants with protection or immediate removal \nfrom Iraq if they are in immediate danger. Five thousand of these visas \nwould be available yearly for 5 years.\n  Importantly, our legislation requires the Secretary of State to \nestablish a program for processing P-2 refugees and SIV applicants in \nIraq and in countries in the region. The Secretary would be required to \nreport to the Congress within 60 days on plans to establish this \nprogram. Currently, there is no mechanism for applying for refugee \nstatus in Iraq. Those fleeing persecution and seeking refugee status \nmust find their way to Jordan or Syria, locate an official from the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and then be referred to \nthe U.S. Government by the United Nations. Because of the growing \nviolence and risk for those associated with the United States, we need \nto find a way to address this problem for Iraqis inside Iraq. Our bill \ndoes not eliminate the referral system through the United Nations, or \nany other existing system, but it does create an essential mechanism \nfor direct applications in country.\n  To oversee the implementation of this new program, the Secretary of \nState would be required to establish in the Embassy in Baghdad a \nMinister Counselor for Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons. This \nsenior official would be responsible for overseeing the in-country \nprocessing of P-2 refugee and special immigrant visa applicants, and \nwould have authority to refer them directly to the U.S. refugee \nresettlement program.\n\n  A parallel position would be created in the American embassies in \nEgypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria to oversee the application process of \nP-2 refugees of special humanitarian concern. SIV applicants would work \nthrough regular consular channels in embassies in those countries.\n  Recognizing that the United States can only resettle a small number \nof the most vulnerable refugees within our borders, the Secretary of \nState would be required to consult with other countries about \nresettlement of refugee populations, develop mechanisms in countries \nwith significant populations of displaced Iraqis to ensure the \nrefugees' well-being and safety, and provide assistance to the \ncountries in doing so.\n  In addition, the legislation would allow Iraqis denied asylum after \nMarch 2003 based on changed conditions to file a new petition with an \nimmigration judge to reopen their cases. Those denied asylum, for \nexample, on the grounds that Saddam Hussein is no longer in power and \nthe United States is committed to building democracy in Iraq should be \npermitted to make their case again before a judge.\n  After 90 days, and annually thereafter, the President would be \nrequired to submit an unclassified report to\n\n[[Page S7893]]\n\nCongress with a classified annex if necessary, assessing the financial, \nsecurity, personnel, considerations and resources necessary to \nestablish the programs required in the act. After 90 days, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security would be required to submit a report to \nCongress outlining plans to expedite processing of Iraqi refugees, \nincluding a temporary expansion of the Refugee Corps, and plans to \nenhance existing systems for conducting background and security checks \nfor Iraqis applying through the program.\n  More than 5 years ago, Arthur Helton, perhaps this country's \nstaunchest advocate for the rights of refugees wrote, ``Refugees matter \n. . . for a wide variety of reasons . . . Refugees are a product of \nhumanity's worst instincts--the willingness of some persons to oppress \nothers--as well as some of its best instincts--the willingness of many \nto assist and protect the helpless . . . In personal terms, we care \nabout refugees because of the seed of fear that lurks in all of us that \ncan be stated so simply: it could be me.''\n  A year later, Arthur Helton gave his life for his beliefs. He was \nkilled in Baghdad in 2003 while meeting with U.N. Special Envoy Sergio \nVieira de Mello when a bomb destroyed the U.N. headquarters in Iraq.\n  But his words resonate today, especially when we consider the very \nhuman cost of the war in Iraq, and its tragic effect on the millions of \nIraqis, men, women, and children, who have fled their homes and their \ncountry to escape the violence of a nation at war with itself.\n  America has a special obligation to keep faith with the Iraqis who \nnow have a bulls-eye on their back because of their association with \nour Government.\n  At a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee in January, chilling \ntestimony was presented about the dangers Iraqis face because of their \nassociation with America.\n  One Iraqi, Sami, was a translator for U.S. and Coalition forces and \nwho now lives in the United States. He said, ``I too, have been \ntargeted for my death. My name was listed on the doors of several \nmosques calling for my death. Supposed friends of mine saw my name on \nthe list and turned on me because they believed I was traitor . . . In \nJune 2006, I learned that I had been granted special status. As a \nresult, today I live free from the fear of persecution and threats to \nmy life that I faced on a daily basis in Iraq. My hope is that all \nbrave Iraqis who worked and braved so much will have the same chance as \nI have had to live in freedom.''\n\n  Another Iraqi, John, worked as a water service man for U.S. troops. \nHe said, ``My wife, my six children and myself fled Iraq after \nterrorist groups targeted me and my family because I aided the \nAmericans by supplying water to their service camps.''\n  Ken Bacon, president of Refugees International, summed it up well \nwhen he said, ``There is a large group of Iraqis who have risked their \nlives to support the United States . . . people are sacrificing their \nlives to help the United States.''\n  The legislation has been endorsed by organizations including Refugees \nInternational, Refugee Council USA which encompasses Amnesty \nInternational USA, Arab-American and Chaldean Council, Chaldean \nFederation of America, Church World Service/Immigration and Refugee \nProgram, Episcopal Migration Ministries, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, \nHuman Rights First, International Rescue Committee, Jesuit Refugee \nService/USA, Jubilee Campaign USA, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee \nServices, Migration & Refugee Services/United States Conference of \nCatholic Bishops, Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, U.S. Committee \nfor Refugees and Immigrants, Women's Commission for Refugee Women and \nChildren, and WorId Relief, the International Rescue Committee, and the \nPEN American center.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in order to keep the \nfaith with those many brave Iraqis whose lives are in jeopardy because \nof their association with our forces in Iraq.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters of suport be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Refugee Council USA,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of a diverse coalition of \n     human rights, faith-based and refugee advocacy organizations \n     around the country, we write to express our support for your \n     legislation addressing the Iraqi refugee crisis unfolding in \n     the Middle East Region.\n       As you know over two million refugees from Iraq are \n     struggling to survive ound the region, and an additional two \n     million are displaced within the country. Forced to flee \n     because they practice a disfavored religion, were born into a \n     marginalized minority, or agreed to work in support of the \n     U.S. government, many of these refugees have no access to \n     housing, health care or education. Although many of the \n     refugees had temporary permission to remain in Jordan or \n     Syria, they have now overstayed their visas to avoid \n     desperate conditions back in Iraq. These refugees live in \n     constant fear of being forcibly returned to Iraq, where they \n     face death threats and further persecution. Many have already \n     lost spouses, children and siblings to kidnappings and \n     executions.\n       Although aware of this crisis, the United States has thus \n     far failed to take the meaningful steps necessary to provide \n     protection to these refugees and internally displaced \n     persons. Your legislation is a welcome step in addressing the \n     pressing protection needs of Iraqis.\n       Of particular concern to the United States are the men, \n     women and children who face targeted persecution from \n     insurgents due to their association with U.S. coalition \n     forces--individuals who served as translators, drivers, \n     doctors, and other contractors and employees of the United \n     States, U.S. allies, and international NGOs serving in the \n     region. The United States has a responsibility to provide \n     protection for individuals who have put their lives on the \n     line for the United States and who are consequently facing \n     persecution due to this association. Your legislation commits \n     the U.S. government to provide support and protection to \n     Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons in the \n     rygion. In doing so it recognizes our nation's longstanding \n     tradition of extending protection to people who are targeted \n     because of their political opinions, ethnicity, or religion, \n     among other reasons. As a result, we stand in support of this \n     important effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               C.

Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy, I am writing to endorse your \n     legislation to address the rapidly escalating crisis of Iraqi \n     refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). We applaud \n     your bold effort to provide a comprehensive framework to meet \n     the growing needs of Iraq's two million internally displaced \n     and the two million refugees in the region.\n       Refugees International believes that the United States has \n     a special obligation to Iraqi refugees. This is the fastest \n     growing refugee crisis in the world, and your legislation \n     will bring greatly needed change in American policy, which \n     has been too slow in its response to this humanitarian \n     crisis. Currently, the Office of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that near two \n     million Iraqis have fled their homes and moved to other parts \n     of Iraq to escape sectarian conflict, political reprisals and \n     the insecurity that is increasingly prevalent in south and \n     central Iraq. In addition, UNHCR estimates that another 2.2 \n     million Iraqis have left the country to find refuge \n     throughout the Middle East.\n       While Syria and Jordan have been generous to refugees and \n     deserve international\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\n     recognition for accepting them in large numbers, the burdens \n     of the large refugee population are an increasing strain on \n     their societies and economies. It is clear that the rapidly \n     escalating refugee and IDP populations are not only grave \n     humanitarian concern, but also a security concern for the \n     region. The Iraq Study Group. among others, highlighted the \n     destabilizing effect the escalating refugee crisis may have, \n     and called upon the United States to take the lead in \n     providing assistance to the refugees.\n       Your legislation is a greatly needed effort to address this \n     crisis and ensure that the United States take the lead in \n     accepting responsibility for providing safety and security \n     for greater numbers of Iraqi refugees and IDPs. It is \n     abundantly clear that we need to create a P-2 category for \n     Iraqis closely associated with our effort in Iraq. Likewise, \n     the expansion of the Special Immigrant Visa program keeps \n     faith with those who have worked most closely with our \n     government. The bill's requirement for in country processing \n     of refugees is absolutely essential to enable persons with \n     credible fears of persecution to more effectively and \n     expeditiously begin the process of seeking refugee status in \n     Iraq.\n       Refugees International is presently conducting its third \n     mission to Iraq and the region since last November and has \n     found that the refugees are increasingly dispirited and \n     desperate for assistance. We will strongly encourage the \n     Senate to approve your legislation as an essential step to \n     address this growing crisis and allow the U.S. to fulfill its \n     share of the responsibility for assistance and protection for \n     Iraqi refugees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Ken H. Bacon,\n      President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               International Rescue Committee,\n\n                                       New York, NY, June 6, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted: On behalf of the International Rescue Committee \n     (IRC). I write in support of the legislation you are \n     introducing today to address the critical issue of Iraqi \n     refugees and internally displaced persons.\n       As you know, the Iraqi refugee crisis represents the \n     greatest displacement of people in the Middle East in nearly \n     60 years, with more than two million Iraqis living as \n     refugees in neighboring countries and another two million \n     internally displaced within their own borders. To date, the \n     U.S. response has failed to reflect the magnitude of the \n     crisis.\n       As both an international aid organization and a U.S. \n     refugee resettlement agency, the IRC has long advocated for a \n     comprehensive U.S. response to the Iraqi refugee crisis that \n     addresses the essential components of humanitarian \n     assistance, protection in the region, and the admission to \n     the U.S. of vulnerable Iraqis. Your legislation takes such a \n     comprehensive approach.\n       We believe strongly in a humanitarian aid package that \n     addresses the shelter, health, nutrition, education, and \n     general protection needs of both the refugees and the \n     internally displaced. We also support increased opportunities \n     for the admission to the United States of Iraqis at risk \n     because of association with Americans or because they are \n     from religious, ethnic, minority, or other communities at \n     special risk. While admission to the United States as \n     refugees or special immigrants will be available to only a \n     small fraction of vulnerable Iraqis, these options will save \n     lives and will help convince host countries to keep their \n     doors open.\n       We thank you for your continued leadership in U.S. refugee \n     protection, and we look forward to working with you to help \n     ensure the enactment of this critical legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     George Rupp.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          PEN American Center,\n\n                                                    June 11, 2007.\n     Senator Edward Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy, We are writing on behalf of the 3,400 \n     members of PEN American Center to express our continuing \n     gratitude for your efforts to address the Iraqi refugee \n     crisis, and to offer our strong support for the Refugee \n     Crisis in Iraq Act.\n       PEN American Center is the largest of 144 centers of \n     International PEN, the worldwide association of writers that \n     strives to protect writers and freedom of expression and \n     promote the free exchange of literature and ideas around the \n     globe. In keeping with this mission, for nearly two years PEN \n     has been working to resettle Iraqi translators, journalists, \n     and writers who have been targeted for death and forced into \n     hiding in Iraq or neighboring countries for their efforts \n     build a safe, free, and open society in Iraq. Thanks largely \n     to our colleagues at Norwegian PEN, a handful of these men \n     and women and their families have found safe havens in \n     northern Europe. But to date, despite the extreme sacrifices \n     so many Iraqis made to help Americans navigate the political \n     and social realities of their country and encourage their \n     fellow citizens to reject violence and extremism and support \n     a pluralistic Iraq, we have not yet successfully assisted a \n     single one of our colleagues in reaching the United States.\n       In recent months, as the world has come to recognize the \n     magnitude of the refugee crisis in Iraq, the United States \n     government has taken some important steps to open the way for \n     a limited number of Iraqi refugees to be resettled in this \n     country. With assistance from the U.S. Department of State, a \n     small number of those on whose behalf PEN has been working \n     have been screened by the United Nations High Commission for \n     Refugees in Syria and referred to the United States for \n     resettlement. But the process is complicated, protracted, and \n     at times hostile. Forbidden from working in Syria, they have \n     exhausted their financial resources long before the process \n     will be completed, and those who had the closest associations \n     with Coalition Forces and U.S. contractors have found that \n     the stigma of ``collaborators'' has followed them across the \n     border. Even so, these are the extremely fortunate few. No \n     avenue whatsoever exists for their counterparts still in Iraq \n     to seek refugee resettlement or relief. Even translators who \n     served honorably as interpreters for U.S. forces, sustained \n     serious combat wounds, survived assassination attempts, and \n     live in constant fear they will be recognized and killed have \n     no access to refugee processing inside Iraq.\n       The Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act directly addresses several \n     of these glaring inadequacies in our country's current \n     approach to the Iraqi refugee crisis. Taking particular note \n     of the United States' obligation to those who worked with and \n     are therefore endangered by their association with U.S.-based \n     organizations and institutions, it significantly expands the \n     numbers of Iraqis to be resettled in the United States and \n     creates direct, efficient mechanisms for Iraqis to petition \n     for resettlement. It expands and streamlines the Special \n     Immigrant visa program for Iraqi and Afghan translators and \n     interpreters, and creates a new P-2 visa category for Iraqi \n     refugees of special humanitarian concern, a category that \n     includes Iraqi writers, journalists, and media workers who \n     worked with and for U.S.-based media organizations in Iraq. \n     Perhaps most significantly, it requires the United States to \n     establish direct visa processing outside the UNHCR system in \n     neighboring countries and, for the first time, inside Iraq. \n     We strongly support these proposals.\n       How history views the United States' intervention in Iraq \n     will be colored in part by how we respond to the needs of \n     those who took great risks to try to build a new Iraq and who \n     fear for their lives as a result. PEN is grateful for your \n     leadership in pressing the United States to act on its \n     responsibilities to the growing number of Iraqi refugees, and \n     we are honored to endorse this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Francine Prose,\n                                                        President.\n                                                      Larry Siems,\n     Director,\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Human Rights First\n\n                                                    June 14, 2007.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I write to express Human Rights \n     First's support of your bipartisan legislation, ``The Refugee \n     Crisis in Iraq Act.'' By extending a lifeline to some of \n     Iraq's most vulnerable refugees and displaced people, your \n     bill would begin to fulfill the moral obligation of the \n     United States to protect Iraqi refugees and provide critical \n     assistance to countries that are already sheltering so many \n     Iraqis in the region. We urge swift passage of this important \n     legislation.\n       Historically, the United States has led the world in \n     efforts to protect and resettle vulnerable refugees, \n     admitting more than 2.6 million refugees since 1975. In the \n     closing days of the Vietnam War, the United States airlifted \n     more than 131,000 Vietnamese whose close ties to the U.S. \n     effort put them at risk of persecution. In 1999, the United \n     States resettled 14,000 Kosovars whose ethnicity made them \n     vulnerable to persecution.\n       The United States is justifiably proud of this strong \n     tradition of providing refuge to the persecuted and \n     assistance to those displaced by war. Yet the \n     administration's response to the Iraqi refugee situation \n     fails utterly to match the scale and urgency of the current \n     crisis. As we mark World Refugee Day next week, the United \n     States will have resettled only 272 Iraqi refugees here since \n     2006.\n       This must change. Since 2003, more than 2.2 million Iraqis \n     have fled violence and persecution in their homeland. Many \n     have been targeted because of their work for the United \n     States or with U.S. organizations. Others have been targeted \n     because of their ethnicity or religion. Those who have fled \n     to Jordan and Syria are living in dire conditions. Many are \n     at risk of exploitation, detention, and deportation. They \n     lack access to medical treatment, education for their \n     children, food, and a means of supporting their families. As \n     this crisis grows, the protection of refugees, the \n     institution of asylum, and the stability of the region are \n     all at risk.\n       With every day, the situation of Iraqi refugees in the \n     region and of those displaced inside Iraq grows more urgent. \n     It is past time for the United States to lead the \n     international community in addressing this crisis in a \n     comprehensive manner. The United States should begin by \n     swiftly providing safe haven to those at risk because of \n     their work with the United States or with U.S. organizations. \n     In addition, the United States should create an ambitious and \n     aggressive resettlement program to take in other refugees who \n     have been forced to flee from Iraq. Finally, the United \n     States must significantly increase aid to countries in the \n     region that now play host to millions of refugees, in\n\n[[Page S7895]]\n\n     order to ensure adequate care for these refugees and to \n     encourage these neighboring countries to continue to provide \n     asylum to those who flee in search of refuge.\n       We believe the United States has a moral obligation to \n     provide a meaningful solution to the Iraqi refugee crisis. \n     Your bill is a vital step towards addressing this growing and \n     complex crisis. As always, we are grateful for your \n     leadership on this issue, and we look forward to working with \n     you to ensure swift passage of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Elisa Massimino,\n                           Director of the Washington, DC, Office.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kennedy, \nSmith, Levin, Hagel, Biden, and Lieberman to introduce this important \nlegislation. In January of this year, the Judiciary Committee held a \nhearing to examine the plight of Iraq's refugees, during which we heard \nfrom the State Department, the United Nations High Commissioner for \nRefugees, nongovernmental organizations and individuals, and Iraqi \ncitizens who had been targeted for assisting the United States. This \nhearing brought the enormity of the Iraq refugee situation into sharp \nfocus and made clear that we must do more to address this crisis and \nprovide assistance especially to those Iraqis who have assisted the \nUnited States with its mission. If enacted, this bill would help the \nUnited States fulfill the promises it has made to the people of Iraq.\n  In February of this year, the Bush administration announced that \n7,000 Iraqi refugees would be permitted to enter the United States in \n2007. Over the last 8 months, however, only 70 Iraqis have been allowed \ninto the United States as refugees. Each year there are 20,000 \nunallocated slots for refugees that could be applied to Iraq, and an \nadditional 5,000 for the Middle East. Yet the Department of Homeland \nSecurity has admitted approximately 700 Iraqis since the war began in \n2003. We have an obligation to do better than this when an estimated 4 \nmillion Iraqis have been displaced within Iraq or have fled the country \ndue to our involvement there. And we have a special obligation to do \nall we can for those Iraqis who have made tremendous sacrifices on \nbehalf of the United States and who continue to live under the threat \nof torture and death.\n  Refugees International has called the Iraq refugee crisis the fastest \ngrowing refugee crisis in the world. It is estimated that nearly 2 \nmillion Iraqis have been internally displaced, while another 2 million \nhave fled the country, with little more than they could carry. With \nthis bill, we show our commitment not to repeat the tragic and immoral \nmistake from the Vietnam era and leave friends without refuge and \nsubject to violent reprisals.\n  The United States has an obligation to the people of Iraq, and \nespecially to those who have assisted the American military in its \nefforts there. When an Iraqi man or woman makes the choice to help the \nUnited States--whether as an interpreter or in some other role--and \nputs his or her life on the line, the United States bears a special \nresponsibility to do what it can to reciprocate the loyalty that so \nmany Iraqis have shown us.\n  The bill we introduce today will create a new P2 category for \nRefugees of Special Humanitarian Concern. Individuals who have assisted \nthe United States, or who have worked for a company, NGO, or other \nentity that has received a grant or contract from the U.S. Government \nwould be eligible for status as a refugee of special humanitarian \nconcern. In order to implement this new program, the legislation would \ndirect the establishment of consular processing facilities in Iraq to \nexpedite the resettlement process for those Iraqis and their immediate \nfamilies who qualify under the bill for special relief.\n  The bill also sets up a special immigrant visa category for \nindividuals who have worked as interpreters or translators for the \nUnited States for an aggregate of 1 year between 2003 and the present. \nThis new program would augment current efforts to provide protection \nfor those individuals who have assisted the United States by providing \ninterpreter or translation services.\n  The legislation would also direct the Secretary of State to establish \nan office of Minister Counselor in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. This \noffice would be responsible for overseeing the new programs set up \nunder this bill, and would be the primary point of contact for eligible \nindividuals seeking protection. This official would also have the \nauthority to refer individuals directly to the United States Refugee \nResettlement Program. Additionally, parallel Minister Counselor offices \nwould be established in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon to effectuate \nthe P2 refugee program.\n  The Secretary of State would also be required to work with other \nnations currently hosting Iraqi refugees in order to provide support \nand to help ensure the safety and well-being of Iraqis located in \ncountries surrounding Iraq. The legislation would also allow Iraqis who \napplied for asylum in the United States after 2003, and who were denied \nbased on changed country conditions due to the overthrow of Saddam \nHussein, to have those denials reviewed due to the continuing violence \nand dangerous conditions in the country. This change will allow our \nlaws to reflect the current reality in Iraq.\n  This legislation will help provide some relief to the brave men and \nwomen who have assisted the United States in Iraq, and will help renew \nthe commitment of the United States to the cause of protecting those \nwho turn to us for help. I hope all Senators can join with us in \nsupport of the bill we introduce today.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL:\n  S. 1654. A bill to prohibit the sale or provision of caller ID \nspoofing services; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would \nprohibit the sale or provision of caller ID spoofing services. This \nbill would enact a legislative proposal that was made by the Justice \nDepartment in a letter to members of this committee. To facilitate \ncommentary on this bill, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill and a letter from the Justice Department be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1654\n\n       Section 1040 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by amending subsection (a) to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Offense.--Whoever, using any means or facility of \n     interstate or foreign commerce--\n       (1) knowingly generates, transmits, or causes to be \n     generated or transmitted--\n       (i) false caller ID information with intent wrongfully to \n     obtain anything of value; or\n       (ii) caller ID information pertaining to an actual person \n     or other entity without that person's or entity's consent and \n     with intent to deceive any person or other entity about the \n     identity of the caller; or\n       (2) knowingly offers, sells, or makes available a service \n     that enables users to modify, generate, or transmit false or \n     misleading caller ID information; or\n\n     attempts or conspires to do so, shall be punished as provided \n     in subsection (b).''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f) Exceptions.--Paragraph (a)(2) does not prohibit \n     offering, selling, or making available any such service that \n     transmits, in the signaling data with each call, (1) \n     information sufficient to indicate to the recipient's \n     telephone carrier that the caller ID information is not \n     accurate, (2) if available, the originating telephone number \n     or other information identifying the origin of the call, and \n     (3) the identity of the provider of the service that enabled \n     the user to modify, generate, or transmit the chosen caller \n     ID information.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 25, 2007.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Department of Justice appreciates \n     the opportunity to provide further comment on H.R. 740, the \n     ``Preventing Harassment Through Outbound Number Enforcement \n     Act'' (``PHONE Act of 2007''). The PHONE Act of 2007 was \n     passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on March 21, 2007 \n     and referred to the Senate, where consideration of the bill \n     is currently pending before the Judiciary Committee. It is \n     the Department's understanding that a substitute amendment \n     will be offered during the Senate Judiciary Committee's \n     consideration of this legislation. This letter reflects DOJ's \n     views toward the amended version of this bill.\n       As the Department noted in its original comments on the \n     PHONE Act submitted to Chairman Conyers on February 5, 2007, \n     we support Congressional action to give law enforcement \n     better tools to protect our citizens and our country from \n     identity thieves, stalkers, and other criminals. In the \n     February 5th letter, the Department of Justice made a number \n     of recommendations to strengthen the bill, many of which were \n     adopted. Those changes have made the PHONE Act a more \n     effective tool for combating threats such as identity theft, \n     preying on the elderly, and the thwarting of important, time-\n     sensitive investigations.\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\n       Although the PHONE Act is an important step toward \n     addressing caller ID spoofing, the problem needs a solution \n     that addresses not only users of caller ID spoofing, but also \n     the services that make this capability to deceive widely \n     available to the public. Several services today offer users \n     the ability to manipulate information transmitted with a \n     telephone call in order to cause a number of the caller's \n     choosing to appear on the call recipient's caller ID display. \n     Using such a service can be as easy as calling a toll-free \n     number and entering calling card information.\n       As the Department has described in its testimony before the \n     House of Representatives Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \n     and Homeland Security on the PHONE Act, the widespread \n     availability of caller ID spoofing services poses several \n     problems. First, the recipient of a spoofed call is led to \n     believe that he or she has received the call from someone who \n     did not actually place the call. Numerous such incidents have \n     been reported, including examples of SWAT teams being misled \n     into raiding innocent persons' houses based on 911 calls that \n     incorrectly appeared to have come from the innocent person's \n     home (a practice known as ``SWATting''), businesses being \n     tricked into revealing personal data about the person whose \n     number is spoofed (i.e., enabling ``pretexting''), and \n     harassing calls being placed using the phone number of a \n     political candidate in order to anger voters against that \n     candidate.\n       The PHONE Act does not currently address these caller ID \n     spoofing services that make it easy for anyone with a \n     telephone to spoof caller ID. Simply criminalizing the use of \n     spoofing capabilities for criminal or fraudulent purposes \n     would not sufficiently diminish the availability of spoofing \n     services. Because the use of caller ID spoofing is \n     particularly hard to investigate and to prosecute, to address \n     this problem effectively, Congress should also address the \n     providers who make this capability widely available.\n       We have included recommended edits to section 2 of the bill \n     in order to address caller ID spoofing services that do not \n     at least notify call recipients that the caller ID \n     information has been modified (attached hereto as Appendix \n     A). We also suggest that Congress consider whether this \n     legislation should contain an explicit exemption for entities \n     complying with existing Federal regulations such as the \n     Telemarketing Sales Rule that allow the substitution of \n     caller ID information for limited purposes.\n       The Department appreciates the Committee's leadership in \n     ensuring that our country's laws meet this new challenge. \n     Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the bill and for \n     your continuing support.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the presentation of these views from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program. If we may be of \n     additional assistance, please do not hesitate to contact this \n     office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Richard A. Hertling,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Byrd):\n  S. 1655. A bill to establish improved mandatory standards to protect \nminers during emergencies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last year, the Nation was stunned by the \nterrible tragedies at the Sago, Alma, and Darby mines. Those disasters \nexposed the many failures in our laws on mine safety and mine health, \nand made clear that it is essential to bring these protections into the \nmodern world.\n  Last year, Congress came together to take a vital step toward \nprotecting the Nation's miners with the passage of the MINER Act, which \naddressed critical lapses in mine safety and accident response, but \nadvances in scientific research and technological development show us \nthat there is much more to be done. In part through the new scrutiny \nthat is taking place under the MINER Act, we have learned a great deal \nmore about what puts miners in danger and how to prevent it.\n  We need to begin to address these other pressing safety and health \nneeds. That is why today I am introducing the Miner Health and Safety \nEnhancement Act of 2007.\n  There is much we can do in the area of mine safety emergencies to \nincrease miners' chances of survival, and this legislation encourages \nthe development of technologies to do so. It requires stronger seal \nbarriers to protect miners from explosions in hazardous mining areas. \nIt also requires mine companies to adopt more sophisticated \ncommunications technology to stay in touch with miners underground, and \nto install rescue chambers to protect miners in the event of an \nexplosion or fire.\n  The bill does more to eliminate dangerous conditions in mines before \nthey harm miners, by banning the unsafe practice of ventilating mines \nin the same passageway as coal-dust laden conveyor belts. This \npractice, unfortunately, has been approved by the Bush administration, \nand it contributed to the tragic fire at Alma mine last year.\n  Other reforms are essential as well. Establishing a national call \ncenter can quickly coordinate emergency information and enhance mine \nrescue and recovery operations. To see that accident investigations are \nobjective and thorough, the legislation requires an independent \ninvestigation to be conducted if miners or their families ask for one.\n  Successful prevention depends also on the willingness of miners to \ntell the truth about their working conditions. Safeguards are needed to \nallow them to speak out about on-the-job hazards without fearing for \ntheir jobs. The bill establishes an independent ombudsman, so miners' \nsafety complaints can be heard and fully addressed, without \njeopardizing miners who blow the whistle on job hazards.\n  Tragically, we continue to see miners developing symptoms of black \nlung disease and other deadly respiratory illnesses of the past. To \nprotect them, the bill requires operators to provide miners with \npersonal dust monitors developed and certified by the National \nInstitute of Occupational Safety and Health. To make underground air \nsafer, the bill adopts the Institute's levels for exposure to coal \ndust, silica dust, and other air contaminants. It also adopts the \nhigher OSHA standard for asbestos. We cannot continue to allow miners \nto work without the protection of these important health standards.\n  Mining is an essential industry, and the nation's miners deserve the \nsafest possible working conditions. We have a responsibility to see \nthat our mine safety laws make our mines the safest and healthiest in \nthe world. America's miners deserve no less. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Mine Health and Safety Enhancement Act of 2007.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Miner Health \nand Safety Enhancement Act of 2007.\n  It is critical that the Congress continue to review the statutory \nsafeguards for our Nation's coal miners. I want to do everything I can \nto encourage that effort.\n  Given reports recently about alarmingly aggressive cases of black \nlung around southern West Virginia, the Congress ought to seriously \nconsider new standards for dust monitoring and control. I also support \nthe bill's language requiring the installation of atmospheric \nmonitoring systems in underground coal mines and requiring the Mine \nSafety and Health Administration, MSHA, to randomly test emergency \nbreathing devices every 6 months.\n  I also very much support provisions in the bill that would clarify \nthe intentions of the MINER Act and require the Department of Labor to \nissue regulations mandating the installation of refuge chambers and \nrestricting the use of belt-air ventilation.\n  These are all good initiatives and something that the Congress should \nbe advocating to ensure safer working conditions for miners. \nNevertheless, I do have reservations about some of the provisions in \nthe Miner Health and Safety Enhancement Act, which I hope can be \naddressed before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, \nHELP, Committee takes any action on this legislation.\n  The MINER Act that the Congress passed last year set a deadline \nrequiring coal operators to install wireless emergency communications \nand tracking equipment by June 2009. In order to meet this deadline, \nthe Congress appropriated $23 million through the fiscal year 2008 for \nNIOSH to expedite its research of emergency communications and \ntracking.\n  It is important that the Congress adhere closely to that schedule. To \nsuddenly rewrite it, mandating the installation of technologies before \nNIOSH has completed its research, could undermine the intentions of the \nMINER Act and complicate the efforts of MSHA and the Congress to ensure \ntimely compliance. Let us not revisit timelines that have already been \nresolved and where implementation has already begun. It is better for \nthe Congress to hold operators to the schedule outlined in the MINER \nAct and to allow NIOSH to perform the critical research that has \nalready been mandated and funded.\n  The Congress should continue to exercise its oversight function to \nensure rapid implementation of the MINER\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n\nAct and also to review non-MINER Act priorities to ensure statutory \nsafeguards are adequate. I proudly join the sponsors of this bill in \nthat endeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1656. A bill to authorize loans for renewable energy systems and \nenergy efficiency projects under the Express Loan Program of the Small \nBusiness Administration; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today with Senator Kerry to \nintroduce the Small Business Energy Efficiency Act of 2007. The energy \ndebate now underway in this body is a positive initial step for our \ncountry, but it is only a first step. Frankly, America must become more \ninnovative and invest in infrastructure that provides a lifetime of \nsavings, both for its citizens and our global neighbors.\n  This year the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, of which I am the Ranking Member, has paid particular \nattention to the effects of climate change and escalating fuel costs on \nsmall businesses, and the role America's entrepreneurs can play in \naffecting change in these areas. Chairman Kerry and I have already \ndevoted two hearings during the 110th Congress to these subjects. \nClearly, rising gas prices and global warming are having a devastating \naffect on the health of small business in this country.\n  As we all know, small business is the backbone of our Nation's \neconomy. As the leading Republican on the Small Business Committee and \nas a longstanding steward of the environment, I firmly believe that \nsmall business has a pivotal role to play in finding a solution to \nglobal climate change. According to a recent survey conducted by the \nNational Small Business Association, 75 percent of small businesses \nbelieve that energy efficiency can make a significant contribution to \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. And yet, only 33 percent of those \nhad successfully invested in energy efficiency programs for their \nbusinesses.\n  We need to significantly improve energy efficiency investment by \nsmall businesses. To that end, our measure will ensure that the SBA \ncompletes its requirements under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Within \n90 days of enactment, the SBA, through a final rulemaking, would be \nrequired to complete all of its requirements under the Energy Policy \nAct, including setting up a Energy Clearinghouse that builds on the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program.\n  Our bill would also create the position of Assistant Administrator \nfor Small Business Energy Policy within the SBA. The duties of this \nposition include: 1. the oversight and administration the Small \nBusiness Energy Clearinghouse Program; and 2. the promotion of energy \nefficiency efforts and the reduction of energy costs for small \nbusinesses.\n  It would also create a Small Business Energy Efficiency Pilot Grant \nProgram. This pilot, competitive grant program would be administered \nthrough the national network of Small Business Development Centers, \nSBDCs, which would provide ``energy audits'' to small businesses to \nenhance their energy efficiency practices, as well as providing access \nto information and resources on energy efficiency practices. These \npractices would include ``on-bill financing'' options.\n  Our bill would also encourage innovation in energy efficiency. \nFederal agencies shall give priority to Small Business Innovation \nResearch, SBIR, and Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR, program \nsolicitations by small businesses that participate in or conduct energy \nefficiency or renewable energy system research and development. The SBA \nwill issue guidelines to assist Federal agencies and departments in \ndetermining whether priority has been given.\n  Finally, our bill would make the SBA's Express Loan Program available \nto small businesses who wish to purchase renewable energy systems or \nmake energy efficiency improvements to their existing businesses. I \nfirmly believe that the SBA Express Loan will be an attractive option \nto small business owners looking to make their businesses more energy \nefficient and environmentally sound because of the program's quick \nturnaround time and the ability of participating lenders to use their \nown forms and procedures for approval. Furthermore, lenders and \nborrowers can negotiate the interest rate, which can result in more \nfavorable terms for a small business owner. The Express Program is the \nmost widely used of SBA's loan products, representing 69 percent of all \nloans made. In fact, the SBA Express lender network is made up of \nalmost 2,000 financial institutions nationwide.\n  Many small businesses are already leading the charge in combating \nglobal warming. For instance, in my home state of Maine, Oakhurst \nDairy, an 86-year-old business, recently announced that it has \nconverted its fleet of over 100 trucks and trailers to a bio-diesel \nfuel blend. Oakhurst's President Stanley Bennett sent me a letter \nstating: ``We firmly believe that doing the right thing environmentally \nis almost always the right thing to do for your business.'' It is my \nhope that our bill will spur more small firms to make the same \ninvestment in the environment and their businesses.\n  As we engage in this debate, we must remain mindful that potential \nsolutions must fully consider the economic realities facing small \nbusinesses. According to the SBA Office of Advocacy, compliance with \nenvironmental regulations costs 364 percent more in small businesses \nthan in larger businesses. So, in developing solutions Senator Kerry \nand I have worked to ensure that small businesses possess a range of \ncost-effective alternatives and have avoided a one-sized-fits-all \napproach.\n  In conclusion, this bipartisan measure will enable small businesses \nto play a leading role in combating global climate change. Assisting \nsmall firms in this regard will not only help the environment, but will \nalso significantly lower the energy costs for cash-strapped small \nbusinesses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1657. A bill to establish a small business energy efficiency \nprogram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in March of this year, I convened a hearing \nin the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to look at what \nsmall businesses can do to confront global warming. In February, the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change put forward a report that has \nbeen referred to as ``the smoking gun'' on global warming, written by \nmore than 600 scientists, reviewed by another 600 experts, and edited \nby officials from 154 governments, the report provides indisputable \nevidence that the ice caps are melting, the sea level is rising, and \nthe earth's surface is heating up at an alarming and potentially \ncatastrophic rate.\n  Senator Snowe and I have worked together on a number of initiatives \nto combat global warming, including introducing the Global Warming \nReduction Act of 2007, an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by \n65 percent by the year 2050. Today, we continue this partnership as \nchairman and ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship by introducing the Small Business Energy Efficiency \nAct of 2007.\n  There are nearly 26 million small businesses in this country, nearly \n26 million business owners that are focused on keeping their doors open \nand putting food on the table for their families. And while climate \nchange and national energy security sometimes seem like distant threats \ncompared to rising health care costs and staying competitive in an \nincreasingly global economy, small business owners are telling us that \nenergy costs are indeed a concern. The National Small Business \nAssociation recently conducted a poll of its members, asking how energy \nprices affected their business decisions. Seventy-five percent said \nthat energy prices had at least a moderate effect on their businesses, \nwith roughly the same number saying that reducing energy costs would \nincrease their profitability. Despite these numbers, only 33 percent \nhave invested in energy efficient programs.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that small businesses \nconsume roughly 30 percent of the commercial energy consumed in this \ncountry, that is roughly 2 trillion kBtu of\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\nenergy per year, and it is costing small business concerns \napproximately $29 million a year. Through efforts to increase energy \nefficiency, small businesses can contribute to America's energy \nsecurity, help to combat global warming, and add to their bottom line \nall at the same time.\n  The Small Business Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 seeks to assist \nsmall business owners in doing all of these things. First, the bill \nrequires the Small Business Administration, SBA, to implement an energy \nefficiency program that was mandated in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. To \ndate, the SBA has dragged its feet in implementing a program that could \nhelp small business owners to become more energy efficient. \nAdministrator Preston should implement this important program today, \nand this bill directs him to do so.\n  Second, the bill establishes a program to increase energy efficiency \nthrough energy audits at Small Business Development Centers, SBDCs. The \nPennsylvania SBDC currently operates a similar program, and has \nsuccessfully assisted hundreds of businesses to become more energy \nefficient. As a result of the program, six of the eight winners of the \n2006 ENERGY STAR Small Business Awards given by the EPA went to \nPennsylvania businesses. This program should be replicated so that \nsmall businesses across the country have the same opportunity to cut \nenergy costs through the efficiency measures.\n  In addition, this bill authorizes the Administrator to guarantee on-\nbill financing agreements between businesses and utility companies, to \ncover a utility company's risk in entering into such an agreement. The \nfederal government should encourage utility companies to pursue these \nagreements with businesses, where an electric utility will cover the \nup-front costs of implementing energy efficiency measures, and a \nbusiness will repay these costs through the savings realized in their \nenergy bill.\n  This bill also encourages telecommuting through a pilot program at \nSBA. The Administrator is authorized to establish a program that \nproduces educational materials and performs outreach to small \nbusinesses on the benefits of telecommuting.\n  Finally, the bill encourages increased innovation by providing a \npriority status within the SBIR and STTR programs that ensures high \npriority be given to small business concerns participating in energy \nefficiency or renewable energy system research and development \nprojects.\n  As a Nation, we have much to do to secure our future energy supply \nand to solve the international crisis that is global warming. This bill \nrepresents one step in that process--to engage our small business \nowners in this effort, and to assist them in becoming more aware of \nwhat is possible. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I \nthank Senator Snowe for her work in this area.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1657\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Small \n     Business Energy Efficiency Act of 2007''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) Small business concerns represent roughly 50 percent of \n     the economy of the United States, employing 50 percent of all \n     private sector employees, and producing more than 50 percent \n     of nonfarm private gross domestic product.\n       (2) The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that, \n     based on data from the 2003 Commercial Buildings Energy \n     Consumption Survey of the Department of Energy, small \n     business concerns consume roughly 2,000,000,000,000 kBtu of \n     energy per year, costing small business concerns \n     approximately $29,000,000,000.\n       (3) The Environmental Protection Agency estimate does not \n     include additional energy that is used by small business \n     concerns located outside of commercial buildings, such as \n     home-based small business concerns. Additional, peer-reviewed \n     research studies must be conducted to assess the amount of \n     energy consumed by small business concerns.\n       (4) A recent survey conducted by the National Small \n     Business Association revealed that 75 percent of small \n     business concerns believe that energy efficiency can make a \n     significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas \n     emissions. And yet, only 33 percent of those small business \n     concerns had successfully invested in energy efficiency \n     programs for their businesses.\n       (5) Small business concerns have demonstrated that they are \n     capable of achieving realistic energy consumption reductions \n     of 30 percent as a result of implementing the recommendations \n     of targeted energy audits. These reductions have been \n     demonstrated by clients of the Pennsylvania Small Business \n     Development Centers and are supported by the national \n     experience of the ENERGY STAR Small Business program of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency.\n       (6) Small business concerns are a source for the \n     technological innovations at the heart of the effort to find \n     a solution to the challenge of climate change and to \n     establish energy independence for the United States.\n       (7) On-bill financing arrangements, involving small \n     business concerns, utilities, banks, and certified energy \n     efficiency professionals, have demonstrated success in \n     reducing energy usage by small business concerns across the \n     country, and greater use of on-bill financing agreements \n     should be encouraged.\n       (8) Telecommuting represents an established method for \n     reducing fuel consumption, and information regarding the \n     benefits of telecommuting should be made available to owners \n     of small business concerns.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to \nprovide protection for child custody arrangements for parents who are \nmembers of the Armed Forces deployed in support of a contingency \noperation; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about several of the \npersonal problems currently being experienced by some military families \ndue to the deployment of one or both parents and to introduce three \npieces of legislation, the language of which is included in the \nrecently passed House of Representatives Defense authorization bill, \nwhich are designed to help alleviate those problems.\n  But first, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the fathers \nand mothers, husbands and wives, sisters and brothers, and the sons and \ndaughters of our Nation, who in these very tumultuous and dangerous \ntimes have volunteered to join our Armed Forces and serve our country \naround the world. In December 1776, another of the tumultuous times for \nour Nation, Thomas Paine wrote ``These are the times that try men's \nsouls: The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this \ncrisis, shrink from the service of his country; but he that stands it \nnow, deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.'' Our modern day \nPatriots, who are now serving in the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air \nForce and Coast Guard, also heard and answered our country's call and \nthey surely deserve the love and thanks of our Nation.\n  In some cases, while a military parent is deployed overseas, courts \nhave overturned custody arrangements of their child or children; this \nwhile the deployed military custodial parent was unable to appear \nbefore the court. The first piece of legislation, S. 1658, would \nprovide protection of child custody arrangements for Armed Forces \nparents who are deployed in contingency operations. The legislation \nstates that if a motion for change of custody of a child of a \nservicemember is filed while the servicemember is deployed in support \nof a contingency operation, no court may enter an order modifying or \namending any previous judgment or order, or issue a new order that \nchanges the child custody arrangement that existed as of the deployment \ndate. An exception is allowed whereby the court may enter a temporary \ncustody order if there is clear and convincing evidence that it is in \nthe best interest of the child. Additionally, if a motion for the \nchange of custody of the child of a servicemember who was deployed in \nsupport of a contingency operation is filed after the end of the \ndeployment, no court may consider the absence of the servicemember by \nreason of that deployment in determining the best interest of the \nchild.\n  The second piece of legislation, S. 1659, is intended to preclude \nsome of the tension and anxiety that a child may suffer from the \nsimultaneous deployment of both parents, as well as the grief that \nwould result if both those parents were to lose their lives while \nsimultaneously deployed. This bill would provide a limitation on \nsimultaneous deployment to combat zones of dual-military couples who \nhave minor dependents. It states that in the case of a member of the \nArmed Forces with minor dependents who has a spouse who is also a \nmember of the Armed Forces, and the spouse is deployed in an area for \nwhich imminent danger pay is authorized, the member may request a \ndeferment of a deployment to such an area until the spouse returns from \nsuch deployment.\n  And the third piece of legislation, S. 1660, would initiate studies \nthat could hopefully lead to improved support services for families of \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserve who are undergoing \ndeployment. This legislation would direct the Secretary of Defense to \nconduct a study of possible methods to enhance support services for \nchildren of members of the National Guard and Reserve who are deployed. \nAdditionally, the legislation would require the Pentagon to carry out a \nstudy on establishment of a program on family-to-family support for \nfamilies of deployed members of the National Guard and Reserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my fellow Senators consider these bills.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1661. A bill to communicate United States travel policies and \nimprove marketing and other activities designed to increase travel in \nthe United States from abroad; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with \nSenators Stevens and Inouye, the Travel Promotion Act of 2007. We seek \nwith this bill to increase travel to the United States and rebuild the \ncountry's place in the global travel market. After 9/11, the number of \noverseas travelers to the United States decreased dramatically and has \nstill not recovered. Travel and tourism are a crucial part of our \nexport industry, but other countries have gained market share to our \ndetriment. Foreign travelers are going elsewhere.\n  The absence of federal leadership in travel promotion has resulted in \nStates having to step in to fill that void. An example is the effort \nmade by my home State of North Dakota, where tourism is the State's \nsecond largest industry, with visitors spending $3.36 billion in 2004. \nThe investment that North Dakota made to encourage travel and tourism \nhas reaped enormous benefits, with the State getting a return of \ninvestment of almost $82 for each dollar spent on travel promotion.\n  While States have made inroads to attracting travelers, the lack of a \ncoordinated federal campaign creates a comparative disadvantage with \ncountries that have centralized ministries or offices to encourage \ninternational travel to their countries. The example of North Dakota \nshould be a lesson for the entire country. The United States offers \nunique and diverse destinations for travelers--a small investment in \nnational coordination has the potential to create a significant \nwindfall for our economy.\n  The Travel Promotion Act of 2007 will promote travel to the U.S., \nincluding areas not traditionally visited, highlighting the United \nStates as a premier travel destination. The bill\n\n[[Page S7901]]\n\nwill improve communication of United States travel policies and \nperceptions of the process. Negative perceptions can often deter \nforeigners from traveling to the United States. Our communities will \nbenefit from growth of this multi-billion dollar industry. With an \nincrease in visitors they will experience an increase in jobs and \nexpansion of local economies.\n  The bill initiates a nationally coordinated travel promotion campaign \nestablished in a public-private partnership to increase international \ntravel to the United States. It creates a Corporation for Travel \nPromotion, an independent, nonprofit corporation, to run the travel \npromotion campaign. The program will be funded equally by a small fee \npaid by foreign travelers visiting the U.S. and matching contributions \nfrom the travel industry.\n  This is a great country, and we should welcome visitors to our shores \nto meet our people and experience our culture. I thank the Chair and \nVice-Chair of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nfor joining with me to develop this campaign and promote travel to our \nNation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1661\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TRAVEL PROMOTION FUND FEES.\n\n       If a fully automated electronic traveler authorization \n     system to collect basic biographical information in order to \n     determine, in advance of travel, the eligibility of an alien \n     to travel to the United States is implemented, the United \n     States Government may charge a fee to an applicant for the \n     use of the system. The amount of any such fee initially shall \n     be at least $10, plus such amounts as may be necessary to \n     cover the cost of operating such a system, but may be reduced \n     thereafter if that amount is not necessary to ensure that the \n     Corporation is fully funded.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, the travel and tourism industry is a \ndriving force for our Nation's economy. In 2006, the industry generated \na $7.3 billion trade surplus. In 2006, international receipts for \ntravel-related tourism spending reached $107.8 billion. Travel and \ntourism supported 8.3 million American jobs in 2006, of which 1.1 \nmillion were supported by international travel and tourism. In Hawaii, \ntourism is the largest industry bringing in approximately $12 billion \nannually, $4 billion of which derives from international visitor \nspending.\n  International tourism brings more than economic returns. \nInternational travelers who visit our country can advance our standing \noverseas. Studies have shown that, after visiting the United States and \ninteracting with Americans, 74 percent of visitors have a more \nfavorable opinion of our country.\n  In recent years, overseas travel to the United States has suffered. \nIn the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack, the United \nStates made a number of necessary changes in the visa and entry \nprocesses to improve security, but some of those changes have confused \nand deterred visitors from even the friendliest countries. Many in the \ntravel industry have continued to express concerns about the perception \nthat the U.S. entry process is unnecessarily antagonistic.\n  In order to strengthen our competitiveness and recover lost \ninternational market share, we must improve and better explain the \nprocess for travelers coming to America. The world needs to know that \nthe United States welcomes business and leisure travelers.\n  In addressing these concerns, and in recognizing the benefits of \ntravel promotion, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Dorgan \nand Vice Chairman Stevens, in introducing the Travel Promotion Act of \n2007. The bill establishes a nonprofit, independent corporation charged \nwith reaching out to potential international travelers, clarifying the \nease of travel to America, and encouraging them to visit. As experts \nhave testified in hearings before the Commerce Committee, a unified \neffort to promote tourism to all areas of the United States is \nnecessary and cannot be achieved by the industry alone.\n  The proposed corporation will be run by 14 board members, appointed \nby the Secretary of Commerce, who represent all aspects of the travel \nindustry, including State tourism boards, hotels, and airlines, as well \nas the Federal Government. A small fee collected from international \ntravelers to the United States will help fund the corporation, but its \ncosts will be truly shared with industry. In order to receive the funds \ncollected by the Government, the corporation will need to raise \nmatching funds from the travel industry. By working together, the \nFederal and State governments and business will be able to revitalize \nthe travel industry and make America a stronger and more welcoming \ndestination.\n  In most developed countries, the minister of tourism is one of the \nmost powerful and important positions in the government. For too long, \nour Government has relegated travel and tourism to a second tier \nstatus. The bill seeks to improve that status by creating an Under \nSecretary of Commerce for Travel Promotion who would work with the \nState Department and the Department of Homeland Security, as well as \nthe corporation, to improve travel promotion efforts and the entry \nprocess for international travelers.\n  The travel and tourism industry helps drive the U.S. economy. The \nTravel Promotion Act of 2007 will enhance our competitiveness while \nimproving our image abroad, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1662. A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to \nreauthorize the venture capital program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation with my \ncolleague, Senator Snowe, to increase access to venture capital for \nsmall businesses. This type of financing is essential to grow a \ncompany, but it's hard to come by, particularly for start-up firms. The \nSmall Business Administration, SBA, has played an important role in \nfilling this gap for almost 50 years with the Small Business Investment \nCompany, SBIC, program.\n  Since the SBIC program's inception in 1958, SBIC firms have invested \n$48 billion in more than 100,000 small businesses. For fiscal year 2006 \nalone, 30 percent of all SBIC investment dollars went to companies that \nhad been in business for two years or less. Overall in that year, SBIC \nfinancing supported more than 2,000 small businesses which employed a \ntotal of 286,000 Americans.\n  Many extremely successful companies that received their start from \nSBIC financing are now household names: Intel, Federal Express, Jenny \nCraig, and Outback Steakhouse are all SBIC success stories. Companies \nreceiving SBIC financing have also consistently appeared on a variety \nof prominent business lists, including Inc. 500, BusinessWeek's ``Hot \nGrowth Companies'' and ``Hot Growth Hall of Fame,'' Fortune magazine's \n``Best Companies to Work For'' and ``Most Admired Companies,'' and the \nFSB 100.\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\nAnd they provide tens of thousands of jobs and contribute significantly \nto our Federal and local tax bases, paying back the investment many \ntimes over.\n  Given the important contribution SBIC funds have made to our economy, \nour bill reauthorizes the SBIC program for another 3 years, through \n2010, ensuring the continued availability of this important small \nbusiness financing tool. Additionally, the legislation simplifies the \nprogram's regulations to attract new investors and allow existing \ninvestors to increase their involvement. These provisions will ensure \nthat dependable capital is available for small businesses for years to \ncome.\n  Entrepreneurs may start out small, but the contribution they make to \nour economy is huge--and particularly important in underserved \ncommunities. This legislation will also increase the leverage cap for \nsmall businesses owned by women and minorities as well as those located \nin low-income areas. It will simplify existing incentives for investing \nin the smallest businesses in order to give every entrepreneur a \nfighting chance. Finally, we have included a provision which ensures \nthat SBICs licensed under the participating securities program will be \nable to easily make follow-up investments in successful companies.\n  Small businesses are responsible for more than two-thirds of all new \njobs in America. They employ more than half of the private sector work \nforce, and pump over $900 billion into the economy annually. As small \nbusiness owners are living the American dream, they should be able to \ncount on the government to help create an environment where they can do \nwhat they do best: innovate, compete, and create good jobs for \nAmericans.\n  I thank Senator Snowe for joining me in introducing this bill, and I \nask my colleagues to support it when it comes before the full Senate \nfor consideration. Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1662\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Venture \n     Capital Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.\n\n       Section 20 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 note) \n     is amended by inserting after subsection (e) the following:\n       (1) the terms ``Administration'' and ``Administrator'' mean \n     the Small Business Administration and the Administrator \n     thereof, respectively;\n       (2) the term ``low-income geographic area'' has the same \n     meaning as in section 351 of the Small Business Investment \n     Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 689), as amended by this Act;\n       (3) the term ``New Markets Venture Capital company'' has \n     the same meaning as in section 351 of the Small Business \n     Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 689); and\n       (4) the term ``New Markets Venture Capital Program'' means \n     the program under part B of title III of the Small Business \n     Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 689 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to join with \nChairman Kerry in introducing the ``Small Business Venture Capital Act \nof 2007,'' a bill to reauthorize and improve the Small Business \nAdministration's (SBA) Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) \nProgram. I am deeply committed to supporting our nation's small \nbusinesses by increasing their access to capital. Small businesses \nemploy more than half (57 percent) of the total private-sector \nworkforce and are responsible for the creation of more than two-thirds \nof all new jobs. Clearly, increasing investments in small businesses is \ncrucial to our on-going economic success.\n  This bill, a product of genuine bipartisan negotiation, will reform \nand enhance the SBIC program, which is so\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\nvital to fostering innovation, growth, and job creation in small \nbusinesses throughout our country. SBICs are privately owned and \nmanaged venture capital investment companies that are licensed and \nregulated by the SBA. SBICs use their own capital, combined with funds \nborrowed from other private investors and supported by an SBA \nguarantee, to make equity and debt investments in qualifying small \nbusinesses. The SBA shares in the profits of SBICs. The structure of \nthe program is unique and has been a model for similar public-private \npartnerships around the world.\n  The program has been successful in mobilizing private venture capital \ninvestment and leveraging private investment with additional funds \nsupported by SBA guarantees. According to the SBA's annual reports to \nCongress, the SBIC program has provided billions in financing to small \nbusinesses since its inception. For example, companies like Staples, \nFedEx, Outback Steakhouse, America Online, Costco, Apple Computers, and \nIntel have all received SBIC investments at one time in their history.\n  Each year, financing brought about by the SBIC program allows small \nbusinesses to create or retain tens of thousands of jobs. For example, \nduring Fiscal Year 2006, the SBIC program invested $2.987 billion in \n2,121 small businesses. Of these, 40 percent were located in \ngovernment-designated Low and Moderate Income (LMI) areas of the \ncounty. Those LMI-district companies received $669 million of the total \ndollars invested by SBICs in 2006. Since its beginning in 1958, the \nSBIC program has provided approximately $48 billion of long-term debt \nand equity capital to more than 100,000 small businesses. In fact, in \nmy home State of Maine, SBICs invested nearly $21 million during FY \n2006.\n  A key proposal in this bill is a technical change made to simplify \nthe maximum leverage limits contained in the current statute. Under \ncurrent law, the maximum leverage cap or the maximum amount of \ngovernment-guaranteed capital an SBIC can control for Fiscal Year 2007, \nis $127.2 million for any one SBIC or for multiple SBICs controlled by \nthe same management team. The cap increases automatically on an annual \nbasis by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The \nproblem with current law is that because the leverage cap applies to a \nwhole family of SBICs, it is often impossible for a successful SBIC to \noperate a second or third fund due to a lack of available leverage. \nAdditional leverage would remedy this issue. Accordingly, the bill \nincreases the leverage cap for anyone fund to $150 million, and the cap \nfor multiple funds held under one management team to $225 million.\n  Furthermore, this bill will increase leverage available for \ninvestment in minority- and women-owned businesses, which are having \ntrouble accessing SBIC dollars. In Fiscal Year 2004, minority-owned \nfirms received 5.2 percent of financing dollars. Women-owned businesses \nobtained just 2.2 percent of financing dollars. To try to increase \nfinancing available to such small businesses, the bill increases \nleverage limits to $175 million for a single fund and $250 million for \na group of funds held under an SBIC license if the SBIC certifies that \nat least 50 percent of its investments are made in companies that are \nowned by either women or minorities, or are located in a low-income \ngeographic area.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Too much is \nat stake for small businesses, and the economy as a whole, to allow \nthis critical legislation to languish. Failing to advance this bill \nwould diminish our chances for innovation, and stifle the \nentrepreneurial opportunities this program has and will continue to \nproduce.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1663. A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to \nreauthorize the New Markets Venture Capital Program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in addition to introducing a bill to \nreauthorize the Small Business Investment Company, SBIC, program, \nSenator Snowe and I are introducing a bill to extend the New Markets \nVenture Capital, NMVC, program. The Securing Equity for the Economic \nDevelopment of Low Income Areas Act of 2007, or the SEED Act, is \nimportant to states like Massachusetts and Maine.\n  Both of our States are home to pioneers in the field of development \nventure capital, which uses the discipline of traditional venture \ninvesting to focus on economic development in low-income areas. We know \nthe benefits of this type of investment and believe the model should be \nexpanded to other parts of the country.\n  Our support is not new. In my case, I was the sponsor of the \nCommunity Development and Venture Capital Act of 1999, which created \nthe New Markets Venture Capital program. Its purpose was to stimulate \neconomic development through public-private partnerships that invest \nventure capital in smaller businesses located in impoverished rural and \nurban areas or that employ low-income people.\n  Both innovative and fiscally sound, this program was built on two of \nthe Small Business Administration's most popular programs. It developed \na financial structure similar to that of the successful Small Business \nInvestment Company, SBIC, program, mentioned earlier, while also \nincorporating a technical assistance component similar to that of SBA's \nmicroloan program.\n  However, unlike the SBIC program, which focuses on small businesses \nwith high-growth potential, the New Markets Venture Capital program \nfocuses on small businesses that show promise of both financial and \nsocial returns--what is referred to as a ``double bottom line.'' These \nbusinesses have special needs, and they tend to want intensive, ongoing \nfinancial, management and marketing assistance, be higher risk, and \nneed longer periods to pay back money than SBIC investments. However, \nthey more than balance out the equation by providing good, stable jobs \nand creating wealth in our neediest communities.\n  Unfortunately, the program expired in 2006, and it has been operating \nunder temporary authority since then. The SEED Act seeks to \nreauthorize, expand, and improve this important program.\n  First, the bill will reauthorize the program for the next 3 years \nuntil 2010, making it possible for the SBA to license up to 20 more New \nMarkets Venture Capital funds. Those funds will have the potential to \ninvest $250 million in small businesses in low-income areas, by \nleveraging $150 million in debentures. Building on experiences with \nthis program and the Rural Business Investment Company Program, which \nproved the matching requirement unreasonable and inefficient, the bill \nchanges the operational assistance grants so that firms can get up to \n$1 million in funding in order to provide the companies they invest in \nwith management assistance services. This support is absolutely \nnecessary to make their business a success. Also important to making \nfuture funds successful, we have clarified that new markets venture \ncapital companies have two years to raise their private capital. The \ncommittee has been troubled by the Agency's interpretation of the NMVC \nstatute, which they viewed as giving SBA the authority to choose how \nmuch time it can give conditionally approved NMVCs to raise private-\nsector matching money. The chosen time frames were unreasonable and not \nwhat Congress intended. This bill clarifies that they get the full 2 \nyears to raise the money. The bill also establishes an office of new \nmarkets venture capital so that there are resources devoted to its \nmanagement and oversight, something lacking in past years. And to try \nto expand the reach of development capital in other parts of the \ncountry, the bill requires the SBA, to the extent practicable, to try \nand license funds in each of the Agency's ten regions, so that there is \ndiversity. And it requires the SBA, to the extent practicable, to try \nand license a fund that focuses on investments in small manufacturers, \nas a way to help stem the loss of manufacturing in this country.\n  On behalf of the Nation's small businesses and entrepreneurs, I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important legislation. Mr. President, I \nask that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7906]]\n\n                                S. 1663\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to join with \nChairman Kerry in introducing the Securing Equity for the Economic \nDevelopment of Low Income Areas Act of 2007, a bill to reauthorize the \nNew Markets Venture Capital, NMVC, Program. The NMVC program \nspecializes in providing investment dollars to small businesses in \nunderserved, low-wealth urban and rural communities.\n  Selected by the SBA through a competitive process, NMVC companies are \nprivately owned and managed for-profit entities. They use their own \nprivate capital plus debentures obtained at favorable rates with SBA \nguarantees for investing. In addition, they provide technical \nassistance to the low-income enterprises in which they invest or intend \nto invest, by using private resources matched by the SBA in the form of \noperational assistance grants. While the Consolidated Appropriations \nAct of 2001, which established the program, contemplated 15 NMVC \ncompanies, unfortunately, only six NMVC companies have received final \napproval.\n  Despite the shortfall in the final numbers of approved companies, the \nNMVC program has achieved some remarkable success since Congress \ncreated it in 2000. According to the Community Development Venture \nCapital Alliance, as of March 31, 2006, the six NMVC companies had \ninvested more than $13.4 million of capital into 29 small businesses. \nNot only have the NMVC Companies brought investment dollars to \nunderinvested areas, but they have also created or maintained 1,626 \njobs in low-income communities.\n  Although the statistics I have just cited pertain to the entire \nNation, I want to share an example of how the NMVC program has been a \ntremendous benefit to my home State of Maine. In 2003, Mike Cote \npurchased Look's Canning Company in Whiting, ME, which had become one \nof the last of what had been dozens of canneries along Maine's coast. \nAfter changing the canning company's name to Look's Gourmet Food \nCompany, Mike worked with Wiscasset, Maine, based Coastal Enterprises, \nInc., a New Markets Venture Capital Company, to help grow the business. \nLook's Gourmet Food Company is now thriving by selling all-natural, \nhigh-quality, shelf-stable seafood products under the ``Bar Harbor T'' \nand ``Atlantic T'' brands all over the country. As Look's took off, it \nwas able to create 18 new jobs with benefits in Maine's Washington \nCounty. That's no small feat for a company doing business in a county \nthat had a 9.1 percent unemployment rate in February, the highest in \nMaine and more than double the national average. The bill introduced \ntoday will go a long way to assisting many low-income communities \nacross America.\n  Other than reauthorizing the NMVC Program, this bill will make other \nchanges to ensure the program is given the full opportunity to achieve \nits full potential. For example, the bill will\n\n[[Page S7907]]\n\nconform the definition of ``low-income geographic area'' used in the \nNMVC program to the definition of a ``low-income community'' as defined \nby the New Markets Tax Credit, NMTC, program. This amendment is \nbeneficial because many investors participate in both the NMVC and NMTC \nprograms, and a uniform definition between the two programs would \nimprove coordination between the two programs. This change would allow \nNMVC companies to invest in businesses that benefit a low-income \npopulation, as well as businesses located in low-income census tracts. \nThis flexibility to serve low income ``targeted populations'' would be \nparticularly important for NMVC companies operating in states like \nMaine which have large rural areas with dispersed populations. \nAdditionally, the bill ensures that all existing NMVC companies can \ntake advantage of the amended targeting for investments made with the \ncapital they have already raised.\n  The entrepreneurial spirit of our 26 million small businesses dates \nback to our Nation's founding. Small businesses are the cornerstone of \neconomic growth and job creation, and it is critical that we support \nthe NMVC program that enables aspiring entrepreneurs to obtain the \ncrucial financing dollars they need to start and grow their businesses. \nAs ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have long fought to ensure the success and vitality \nof our country's small business sector. An investment in small business \nis an investment in the long-term economic prosperity of America, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support this vital legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7907-1", "month": "06", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7907-S7908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 239--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nADMINISTRATION SHOULD RIGOROUSLY ENFORCE THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES \nTO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND GREATLY IMPROVE BORDER \n                                SECURITY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. DeMint, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Grassley, and \nMr. Vitter) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

estimated 40 percent of the estimated 12,000,000 \n     to 20,000,000 illegal immigrants in the United States have \n     overstayed their nonimmigrant visas;\n       Whereas the implementation of the

to accept the Mexican matricula \n     consular card as valid identification for the purpose of \n     opening bank accounts encourages illegal immigrants to remain \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas Federal Bureau of Investigation officials have \n     testified under oath that the matricula consular card ``is \n     not a reliable form of identification, due to the \n     nonexistence of any means of verifying the true identity of \n     the card holder'' and because the card is so vulnerable to \n     fraud and forgery ``there are 2 major criminal threats posed \n     by the

issue any final \n     orders to employers for hiring illegal immigrants;\n       Whereas in 2005, the Administration issued only 10 such \n     final orders;\n       Whereas not enforcing employer

immigrants in violation of section \n     505 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n     Responsibility Act of 1996;\n       Whereas such a policy unfairly burdens United States \n     citizens because there are fewer places for legal residents \n     in those colleges or universities and out-of-State students \n     pay higher tuition than the tuition charged to illegal \n

international border between the \n     United States and Mexico;\n       Whereas, as of June 2007, there are only 27,500 detention \n     beds for holding illegal immigrants, which is 15,944 less \n     than the number Congress required be in use by the end of \n     fiscal year 2007 under section 5204 of the Intelligence \n     Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004;\n       Whereas additional detention beds would help ensure that \n     all criminal aliens and individuals apprehended while \n     crossing the border illegally are detained prior to \n     prosecution and deportation;\n       Whereas, as of June 2007, there are only 5,571 immigration \n     investigators, which is less than the number Congress \n     required be in place by the end of fiscal year 2007 under \n     section 5203 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004;\n       Whereas additional investigators would help ensure that \n     sufficient worksite enforcement is performed to impose \n     employer sanctions on those who hire illegal immigrants;\n       Whereas the Secure Fence Act of 2006 requires that more \n     than 700 miles of fencing be built along the international \n     border between the United States and Mexico;\n       Whereas as of June 5, 2007, only 87 miles of fencing \n     exists, even though such fencing helps deter illegal border \n     crossing;\n       Whereas the Department of Homeland Security may use \n     expedited removal procedures for any illegal immigrants who \n     have not been admitted or paroled into the United States and \n     who have not affirmatively shown that they have been inside \n     the United States for 2 years;\n       Whereas the Department of Homeland Security only uses \n     expedited removal procedures for illegal immigrants who are \n     apprehended within 100 miles of the United States border and \n     within 14 days of entry to the Unites States even though \n     wider use of expedited removal would help decrease the number \n     of appeals of removal orders which clog the Federal court \n     system;\n       Whereas the current Immigration Violators File in the \n     National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database is being \n     underutilized and could be expanded so that State and local \n     law enforcement could help locate the more than 600,000 alien \n     absconders living in the United States; and\n       Whereas the current illegal immigration crisis is a direct \n     result of this and previous Administrations failing to \n     enforce or adequately enforce at least 8 immigration laws \n     passed by Congress and enacted by the current and previous \n     Administrations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate believes that--\n       (1) the Administration should--\n       (A) implement the entry and exit portions of the United \n     States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-\n     VISIT) as required under the Illegal Immigration Reform and \n     Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996;\n       (B) reverse the United States Treasury Department decision \n     to allow financial institutions to accept the Mexican \n     matricula consular cards as valid identification for the \n     purpose of opening bank accounts;\n       (C) enforce legally binding affidavits of support signed by \n     sponsors of immigrants;\n       (D) end the practice of catching illegal immigrants at the \n     border and returning them without prosecution;\n       (E) enforce the employer sanctions contained in the \n     Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.\n       (F) enforce section 505 of the Illegal Immigration Reform \n     and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which prohibits in-\n     State college tuition for illegal immigrants.\n       (G) require prosecution of anyone caught smuggling \n     immigrants across the border regardless of how many \n     immigrants are being smuggled.\n       (H) increase the number of full time border patrol agents \n     by at least 1,306 by the end of\n\n[[Page S7908]]\n\n     fiscal year 2007, as authorized by the Intelligence Reform \n     and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004;\n       (I) increase the number of detention beds for illegal \n     immigrants by at least 15,944 by the end of fiscal year 2007, \n     as authorized under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004;\n       (J) increase the number of full time immigration \n     investigators by at least 1,600 by the end of fiscal year \n     2007, as authorized by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \n     Prevention Act of 2004;\n       (K) comply with the Secure Fence Act of 2006 by building \n     over 700 miles of fencing along the international border \n     between the United States and Mexico;\n       (L) increase the use of expedited removal procedures for \n     all illegal immigrants eligible for removal under United \n     States immigration laws; and\n       (M) expand the Immigration Violators File in the NCIC \n     database to include information on aliens with final orders \n     of removal, aliens with expired voluntary departure \n     agreements, aliens whom Federal immigration officers have \n     confirmed are unlawfully present, and aliens whose visas have \n     been revoked; and\n       (2) taking the steps set forth in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) will lead to a substantial reduction in illegal \n     immigration; and\n       (B) will greatly improve the border security of the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/06/19/senate-section/article/S7908-1",

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) domestic production of crude oil is in sharp decline;\n       (2) more than 60 percent of the oil consumed in the United \n     States is imported;\n       (3) traditional sources of foreign oil supply, including \n     the Middle East, are facing terrorism, armed conflicts, \n     instability, and political uncertainty, which increase the \n     vulnerability and threaten the security of the oil imports on \n     which the United States has become so dependent;\n       (4) crude oil production in Alaska, a major source of \n     domestic oil for the United States has decreased from \n     approximately 2,000,000 barrels a day in 1991 to \n     approximately 800,000 barrels a day in 2007;\n       (5) the approximately 1,500,000-acre Coastal Plain area of \n     the 19,000,000-acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is \n     projected to contain--\n       (A) a median of 10,400,000,000 barrels of oil; and\n       (B) very large reserves of natural gas;\n       (6) there are legislative measures pending in Congress to \n     designate all or a portion of the Coastal Plain as a \n     wilderness, which would prevent the large crude oil and \n     natural gas reserves of the Coastal Plain from being used as \n     a strategic petroleum reserve; and\n       (7) the proposed designation of the Coastal Plain as \n     wilderness is contrary to the critically important interests \n     of the security and energy policy of the United States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to designate the public land of the Coastal Plain area \n     of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a strategic \n     petroleum reserve;\n       (2) to ensure that the reserves of crude oil and natural \n     gas in the Coastal Plain are ready, but not actually made \n     available until authorized by Act of Congress, for commercial \n     production; and\n       (3) in recognition of the long lead times in Alaska \n     associated with the transition from expressions of industry \n     interest in leasing, exploration, and development of crude \n     oil and natural gas to the actual leasing, exploration, and \n     development, to authorize seismic and exploration activities \n     in the Coastal Plain so that production of crude oil and \n     natural gas can proceed in the Coastal Plain if Congress \n     determines, after the date of enactment of this Act, that \n     production of oil and natural gas in the Coastal Plain is \n     necessary based on--\n       (A) the need for domestic oil; and\n       (B) political uncertainties and instability in major \n     producing regions of the world.\n\n     SEC. 803.

CONVENTION ON SUPPLEMENTARY COMPENSATION FOR \n                   NUCLEAR DAMAGE CONTINGENT COST ALLOCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. \n     2210) (commonly known as the ``Price-Anderson Act'')--\n       (i) provides a predictable legal framework necessary for \n     nuclear projects; and\n       (ii) ensures prompt and equitable compensation in the event \n     of a nuclear incident in the United States;\n       (B) section 170 of that Act, in effect, provides operators \n     of nuclear powerplants with insurance for damage arising out \n     of a nuclear incident and funds the insurance primarily \n     through the assessment of a retrospective premium from each \n     operator after the occurrence of a nuclear incident;\n       (C) the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for \n     Nuclear Damage, done at Vienna on September 12, 1997, will \n     establish a global system--\n       (i) to provide a predictable legal framework necessary for \n     nuclear energy projects; and\n       (ii) to ensure prompt and equitable compensation in the \n     event of a nuclear incident;\n       (D) the Convention benefits United States nuclear suppliers \n     that face potentially unlimited liability for a nuclear \n     incidents outside the coverage of section 170 of the Atomic \n     Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) by replacing a \n     potentially open-ended liability with a predictable liability \n     regime that, in effect, provides nuclear suppliers with \n     insurance for damage arising out of such an incident;\n       (E) the Convention also benefits United States nuclear \n     facility operators that may be publicly liable for a Price-\n     Anderson incident by providing an additional early source for \n     a Price-Anderson incident by providing an additional early \n     source of funds to compensate damage arising out of the \n     Price-Anderson incident;\n       (F) the combined operation of the Convention, section 170 \n     of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210), and this \n     section will augment the quantity of assured funds available \n     for victims in a wider variety of nuclear incidents while \n     reducing the potential liability of United States suppliers \n     without increasing potential costs to United States \n     operators;\n       (G) the cost of those benefits is the obligation of the \n     United States to contribute to the supplementary compensation \n     fund established by the Convention;\n       (H) any such contribution should be funded in a manner that \n     neither upsets settled expectations based on the liability \n     regime established under section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act \n     of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) nor shifts to Federal taxpayers \n     liability risks for nuclear incidents at foreign \n     installations;\n       (I) with respect to a Price-Anderson incident, funds \n     already available under section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act \n     of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2210) should be used;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 137, H.R. 1429, the \nHead Start authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1429) to reauthorize the Head Start Act, to \n     improve program quality, to expand access, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the Senate's action on this \nimportant legislation, the Head Start for School Readiness Act.\n  I commend Senator Enzi, Senator Dodd, and Senator Alexander for their \nbipartisan cooperation on this legislation, and I thank all the \nSenators on the HELP Committee for their contributions to improving \nHead Start to meet today's challenges. We began this process four years \nago. Today, our bipartisan efforts have resulted in the strengthening \nof a 42 year old program that has been a lifeline of support for \nmillions of low-income children preparing for school and for life.\n  Since the War on Poverty, Head Start has delivered the assistance \nneeded to enable disadvantaged children to arrive at school, ready to \nlearn. Its comprehensive services provide balanced meals for children, \nsupport visits to the doctor and dentist, and teach young children \nimportant learning and social skills. It helps families with the \ngreatest needs get on their feet, and encourages parents to participate \nactively in their child's early development.\n  Years of evaluation have demonstrated that Head Start works. A \nFederal survey found that Head Start children make both academic and \nsocial gains under the program, and that these gains continue when \nchildren enter kindergarten. Once Head Start children complete their \nkindergarten year, they are near the national average of 100 in key \nareas, with scores of 93 in vocabulary, 96 in early writing, and 92 in \nearly math.\n  Over the years, we've also learned more about how Head Start can be \nimproved. This reauthorization applies that knowledge to make \nmodifications in the program, and it will enable Head Start to be even \nmore effective in the years ahead.\n  In this legislation, we expand Head Start to include thousands of \nlow-income children who are not yet served by the program. We provide \nfor better coordination of Head Start with State programs for low-\nincome children. We strengthen Head Start's focus on critical early \nlearning skills and school readiness. We enhance the educational goals \nfor Head Start teachers. We preserve the community-based structure of \nthe program to ensure that the needs of local neighborhoods and their \nchildren are the top priority. We also provide greater accountability \nfor the program, including new policies to provide improved monitoring \nvisits and guarantee that programs with deficiencies receive needed \nattention and support.\n  To strengthen Head Start, we must begin by providing more resources \nfor it. Child poverty is on the rise again and the need for Head Start \nis greater than ever. Today, less than 50 percent of children eligible \nfor Head Start participate in the program. Hundreds of thousands of 3- \nand 4-year-olds are left out because of inadequate funding. Early Head \nStart serves only 3 percent of eligible infants and toddlers. It is \nshameful that 97 percent of the children eligible for Early Head Start \nhave no access to it. This legislation expands access to Head Start to \nserve as many infants, toddlers, and preschool children and their \nfamilies as possible.\n  The bill establishes goals to increase funding and expand the program \nto provide nearly $8 billion worth of services by 2010. These funding \nlevels are essential to carry out the essential reforms in the \nlegislation and to serve thousands of additional children and families.\n  In 1994, we enacted Early Head Start to benefit infants, toddlers, \nand their families. It has worked ever since. Early Head Start children \nhave larger vocabularies, lower levels of aggressive behavior, and \nhigher levels of sustained attention than children not enrolled in the \nprogram. Early Head Start parents are more likely to play with their \nchildren and read to them. These activities increase a child's desire \nto learn and strengthen a family's commitment to education. Our bill \ndoubles the size of Early Head Start over the course of the \nauthorization, and includes a commitment to serve 56,000 additional \nchildren.\n  The bill also establishes a Head Start Collaboration Office in every \nState to improve support for Head Start children, to align Head Start \nwith kindergarten classrooms, and to strengthen its local partnerships \nwith other agencies. These offices will work hand in hand with the Head \nStart network of training and technical assistance to support grantees \nin meeting the goals of preparing children for school.\n  I'm especially pleased that the bill provides the blueprint needed to \nupgrade and strengthen other early childhood education programs and \nservices in the states. The bill provides an active role for states in \ncoordinating early childhood education and development programs, and \ndesignates an Early Care and Education Council in each state to \nundertake the activities essential to developing a comprehensive system \nfor the nation's youngest children. The councils will conduct an \ninventory of children's needs, develop plans for data collection, \nsupport early childhood educators, review and upgrade early learning \nstandards, and make recommendations on technical assistance and \ntraining. For States ready to move forward and implement their \nstatewide plan, the legislation offers $100 million to support \nincentive grants for States to implement these important efforts.\n  Over the past four decades, Head Start has developed quality and \nperformance standards to guarantee a full range of services, so that \nchildren are educated in the basics about letters, numbers, and books, \nand are also healthy, well-fed, and supported in stable and nurturing \nrelationships. Head\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\nStart is already a model program, but we can enhance its quality even \nmore.\n\n  The bill strengthens literacy efforts currently underway in Head \nStart programs. We know the key to future reading success is to get \nyoung children excited about letters and books and numbers. The bill \nemphasizes language and literacy, by enhancing the literacy training \nrequired of Head Start teachers, continuing to promote parent literacy, \nand working to put more books into Head Start classrooms and into \nchildren's homes.\n  In addition, we make a commitment in the bill to upgrade all of the \neducational components of Head Start, and ensure that the services are \naligned with expectations for children's kindergarten year and continue \nto be driven by the effective Head Start Child Outcomes Framework.\n  At the heart of Head Start's success are its teachers and staff. They \nare caring, committed leaders who know the children they serve and are \ndedicated to improving their lives. They help children learn to \nidentify letters of the alphabet and arrange the pieces of puzzles. \nThey teach them to brush their teeth, wash their hands, make friends \nand follow rules. Yet their salary is only half the salary of \nkindergarten teachers, and the turnover is high, about 11 percent a \nyear.\n  Because teacher quality is directly related to a child's outcome, our \nbill establishes a goal to ensure that every Head Start teacher earns \nan A.A. degree, and that half earn their B.A. degree by the next time \nCongress revisits the program. Head Start teachers and staff are the \ngreatest resource for children and families in the program, and \ninvesting in their development must be a priority. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to match these ambitious goals with the \nfunding needed to make them a reality.\n  Our legislation also gives local Head Start programs greater \nauthority to assess the needs of families in their communities and \ndefine the services necessary to meet those needs. We've lifted the \neligibility requirements under the program, so that families living \nbelow 130 percent of the Federal poverty rate can qualify and \nparticipate in Head Start. Yet we still prioritize services to children \nwho need them the most. If programs determine that a greater share of \ninfants and toddlers need services, our bill allows them to apply to \nthe Secretary to convert and expand services to our youngest children. \nIf programs identify a need to provide full-day or full-year care for \nchildren and families, they can take steps to do this as well.\n  Accountability is a cornerstone of excellence in education and should \nstart early. Head Start should be accountable for its commitment to \nprovide safe and healthy learning environments, to support each child's \nindividual pattern of development and learning, to cement community \npartnerships in services for children, and to involve parents in their \nchild's growth.\n  Head Start reviews are already among the most extensive in the field. \nOur bill takes a further step to improve this process by ensuring that \nmonitoring results and feedback are available to programs and used for \ntheir improvement. We also take steps to address programs with serious \ndeficiencies, and ensure that substantial problems in programs do not \nlanguish at the expense of children. If a local program is unable to \nmeet Head Start's high standards of quality, others should step in. \nEvery Head Start child deserves to develop and learn in a high-quality \nprogram.\n  Our bill also takes an important step to suspend the Head Start \nNational Reporting System. Four years ago, many of us insisted that \ninstead of rushing forward with a national test of hundreds of \nthousands of children, Head Start would be better served if plans were \ndeveloped more deliberately to ensure an appropriate means to gather \nand report child outcomes in programs. That appeal was ignored, and the \nAdministration proceeded with an assessment--without sufficient \nauthorization or oversight from Congress--that was later proven flawed \nand inconsistent with professional standards for testing and \nmeasurement.\n  This legislation requires that the assessments used in Head Start \nmust be held to the highest standard. Head Start's measures must be \nvalid and reliable, fair to children from all backgrounds, balanced in \nwhat they assess, and sufficient to reflect the development of the \nwhole child. We've called on the National Academy of Sciences to survey \nand study the state of assessments and outcomes appropriate for young \nchildren in environments like Head Start. Their study will be of great \nvalue as we consider how best to move forward in Head Start and other \nearly childhood settings.\n  Finally, the bill maintains the essential Federal-to-local structure \nof Head Start, and rejects other proposals that would dilute this \nimportant focus. Head Start's design enables it to tailor its services \nto meet local community needs. Head Start's regulations guarantee a \nuniversal standard of quality across all programs. Yet each program is \nunique and specifically adapted to its children and families. The focus \non local neighborhoods and their children must always be at the heart \nof Head Start.\n  One of our highest priorities in Congress is to expand educational \nopportunities for every American. In this age of globalization, every \ncitizen deserves a chance to acquire the educational skills needed to \ncompete in the modem economy. This process starts early--it begins at \nbirth and continues throughout the early years, long before children \nenter kindergarten.\n  The Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007 will keep Head Start \non its successful path, and enable this vital program to continue to \nthrive and improve. I look forward to swift passage of this legislation \nin the Senate, and a productive Conference with the House on the \nimportant reforms in this bill.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleagues \nin supporting the Head Start for School Readiness Act, which \nreauthorizes this critically important program to help prepare our most \ndisadvantaged young children to attend school. We have worked hard to \nbring this bipartisan bill to the floor, and I particularly thank \nSenators Kennedy, Enzi, and Alexander for their leadership on this \nissue.\n  For more than 40 years, Head Start provided comprehensive early \nchildhood development services to low-income children, creating an \nimportant bridge to kindergarten and beyond.\n  Head Start addresses the comprehensive needs of children and their \nfamilies by offering not only academic opportunities, but also supports \nfor health, nutrition, social skills, and more. More than 900,000 \nchildren across the Nation, including nearly 9,000 children in \nConnecticut, depend on Head Start to support their social, emotional, \nphysical, and cognitive development. Head Start is the foundation for a \nlifetime of learning for many of our most vulnerable children, and this \nreauthorization provides for continued success, while also \nstrengthening the program.\n  Among the many improvements in this legislation, of great importance \nis the expanded access to Head Start for more disadvantaged children. \nIn Connecticut and other States where the cost of living is \nparticularly high, many poor families aren't able to enroll their \nchildren in Head Start because they earn incomes just above the poverty \nlevel. This reauthorization allows programs to serve families with \nincomes up to 130 percent of the Federal poverty level, and expands \nopportunities for children of migrant families, Indian children, \nhomeless children, foster children, as well as additional infants and \ntoddler in Early Head Start programs.\n  Currently, only half of all eligible children are served in Head \nStart, and fewer than 5 percent are served in Early Head Start. Head \nStart programs are also facing tremendous increases in operating costs, \nincluding transportation, health care premiums, facilities maintenance, \nand training for staff; yet Head Start has essentially been flatfunded \nfor years. This legislation authorizes an increase from $6.9 billion in \nthe current fiscal year, to $7.3 billion in fiscal year 2008, $7.5 \nbillion in fiscal year 2009, and $7.9 billion in fiscal year 2010, \nwhich will begin to meet the needs of Head Start children and allow for \nmore enrollment opportunities. However, we must also acknowledge that \nwe still have far to go before we provide adequate resources to this \ninvaluable program.\n\n[[Page S7998]]\n\n  We know that children struggle when their families are not involved \nin their education; and that parents play the most important role in \nensuring the success of their children. This legislation encourages a \nhigh level of family involvement, maintains the integral participation \nof parents in the day-to-day operations of the programs, and offers \nfamily members key roles as decisionmakers.\n  I am pleased that this bill also improves program accountability by \nfurther clarifying governance responsibilities and enhancing teacher \nquality expectations. While we establish goals for improving \neducational standards for staff, we acknowledge that current resources \nmay not adequately support staff to pursue additional training, nor \nprovide enough for increased wages; therefore, we do not make these \nstandards mandatory.\n  Head Start must continue to maintain a core and integral role in our \nbroader early childhood care and education systems as we expand our \nefforts to improve early education across this country. The legislation \nencourages greater collaboration and coordination with other early \nchildhood development programs.\n  Passing the Head Start for School Readiness Act today is an important \nstep forward to improve opportunities for low-income children. Nothing \nreduces poverty like learning, and Head Start gives children what they \nneed to learn early. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nsee that this important legislation becomes law.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of Chairman \nKennedy regarding the State advisory councils on early childhood \neducation and care included in S. 556, the Head Start for School \nReadiness Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, S. 556 affirms the active role that \nStates have in coordinating their system of early childhood education \nprograms, and encourages States to enhance that role to increase the \nquality of programs available to young children. The act designates an \nearly care and education council in each State for the purposes of \nconducting an inventory of children's needs and exploring the \navailability of prekindergarten opportunities; exploring areas for \ncollaboration and coordination across programs; developing plans for \ndata collection and to support the professional development of early \nchildhood educators; and providing for the review and upgrading of \nState early learning standards. For those States prepared and \ninterested in moving forward with a statewide plan encompassing these \nactivities, S. 556 provides for one-time incentive grants to further \ndevelop and implement these important efforts.\n  S. 556 also permit States to designate an existing entity to serve as \nthe State advisory council on early childhood education and care, if \nsuch entity includes representation consistent with members mentioned \nin the act.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the chairman for his explanation of these \nprovisions. I am concerned, however, that it may not be practical for \nStates with existing advisory councils to reconfigure their membership \nto reflect all of the individuals mentioned in the Head Start bill. In \nmy home State of Washington, we are leading the way on early childhood \ncoordination and reform with the establishment in 2005 of Governor \nGregoire's cabinet-level Department of Early Learning and the Early \nLearning Council, which became the Early Learning Advisory Council. The \ncouncil is working hard to make sure early learning programs in my \nState are aligned and are providing high quality services. However, I \nwant to make sure that the council is not unduly burdened for being a \nleader, and that it will not have to reconstitute its membership. I ask \nthe chairman for his commitment to work with me as this bill is \nconsidered in conference with the House, to further resolve this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I agree and would be happy to work with you on this \nissue. S. 556 directs Governors to designate specific individuals as \nmembers of the State advisory council to the maximum extent possible. \nWhile some members may need to be added by States to their existing \ncouncils in order to meet the goals of this legislation, I agree fully \nthat Governors will need some flexibility in this function. Therefore, \nI support grant additional discretion as they consider the makeup and \nfunction of their existing councils in relation to the roles and \nresponsibilities under this Act.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I share Senator Murray's concerns and \nappreciate the commitment to working with us on this issue.\n  S. 556 also includes specific responsibilities of the State advisory \ncouncil regarding early childhood activities, professional development \nand opportunities for coordination and collaboration. My State of \nConnecticut has been a leader in promoting the coordination and \nimprovement of early learning opportunities for young children and has \nsuccessfully carried out activities that complement the \nresponsibilities under this act. Connecticut's Early Childhood \nEducation Cabinet, which includes many of the members required by the \nHead Start Act, already advises the State on policy and on initiatives \nto meet early childhood goals, conducts statewide evaluations of the \nschool readiness programs, and promotes collaboration and consistency \nof quality services.\n  Is it the intention that States would be required to abandon the \nprogress made with their existing efforts and begin new initiatives to \nfulfill their responsibilities under S. 556?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the Senator's inquiry on this important \npoint. That is not my intention, and S. 556 does not stipulate any \nrequirements for States to conduct new efforts concerning their \nassessment of children's needs, opportunities for collaboration and \ncoordination, the establishment of a unified data system, professional \ndevelopment activities, or other efforts described under the \nresponsibilities of the State Advisory Council in this legislation. My \nown State of Massachusetts has also been a leader in carrying out \nseveral of these efforts through our own State Department of Early Care \nand Education.\n  Preexisting and current efforts in States to improve and enhance the \nquality of early childhood education programs would certainly help \nfulfill and count toward the responsibilities stipulated by the Head \nStart for School Readiness Act.\n  I ask Senator Enzi if he agrees with this point.\n  Mr. ENZI. I do agree with the chairman and would be happy to join \nhim, Senator Dodd, and Senator Murray in further clarifying these \npoints as the conference committee considers S. 556 and begins its work \non the reauthorization of the Head Start Act.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my colleagues for their work with me on these \nissues, and I commend them for their leadership on the important \nreforms in this bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the substitute amendment at \nthe desk be considered and agreed to and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table; that the bill, as amended, be read three times, \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the \nSenate insist upon its amendment, request a conference with the House \non the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees on the part of the Senate; and that the HELP \nCommittee be appointed as conferees, with the above occurring without \nfurther intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
