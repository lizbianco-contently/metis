Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 12:30 p.m. During the period of morning \nbusiness, Senators will be permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach. The first 30 minutes will be controlled by the Republicans and \nthe second 30 minutes will be controlled by the majority.\n  At 12:30, the Senate will recess until the hour of 2:15. Upon \nreconvening at 2:15, the Senate will resume debate on the motion to \nproceed to S. 184. The cloture vote will occur at 2:30, with the time \nuntil then equally divided and controlled between the two leaders and \ntheir designees.\n  As I indicated yesterday prior to the Senate adjourning, the \nRepublican leader and I have had discussions about the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations legislation, and while the time has been set for the \ncloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 184, we will continue our \ndiscussions to ascertain whether we can vitiate that cloture vote. If \nwe are able to do that, we would switch to S. 4, which is the Homeland \nSecurity-reported matter reported by Chairman Lieberman and Ranking \nMember Collins.\n  I would say, as I said last night, whichever vehicle comes to the \nfloor--I would hope we could speed things up by 30 hours by doing S. \n4--we need to get to this legislation. I had indicated prior to the \nrecess, and indicate today, it is open to amendment. I, in fact, even \nhave the first Democratic Senator who wants to offer an amendment. I am \nsure the minority has a lot of amendments they want to offer.\n\n\n                    9/11 commission recommendations\n\n  Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the body letters \nSenator McConnell and I received. They are dated yesterday. The letter \nto me states:\n\n       It has been exactly 14 years since the first attack on the \n     World Trade Center; over 5 years since the terrorist attacks \n     of 9/11; and over 2 years since the 9/11 Commission released \n     a blueprint for strengthening America's security. The pace of \n     Congressional response to these wake-up calls has been \n     glacial.\n\n  Now, I am not going to read the other three paragraphs of this letter \nother than to say this letter is signed by different groups--widows and \norphans--Carol Ashley, representing a group called VOICES of September \n11th, who is the mother of Janice, who was killed in that 9/11 \noccurrence; Beverly Eckert, representing a group called Families of \nSeptember 11, and who is the widow of Sean Rooney, who was 50; Mary \nFetchet, the founding director and president of VOICES of September \n11th, who is the mother of Brad, who was 24, who was killed in the \nincident; and Carie Lemack, the cofounder and president of Families of \nSeptember 11, who is the daughter of Judy Larocque, who was 50 years \nold, who died in that terrorist attack.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2238]]\n\n\n                                                February 26, 2007.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: It has been exactly 14 years since the \n     first attack on the World Trade Center; over 5 years since \n     the terrorist attacks of 9/11; and over 2 years since the 9/\n     11 Commission released a blueprint for strengthening \n     America's security. The pace of Congressional response to \n     these wake-up calls has been glacial.\n       The House of Representatives has validated its commitment \n     to improving national security by passing H.R.1. When S. 4 \n     goes to conference, its provisions must match or surpass the \n     strength and comprehensiveness of H.R.l. Failure to act \n     ratchets up the danger for America. The longer critical \n     security issues remain unresolved, the more time and options \n     the terrorists have.\n       S. 4 should be a clean bill, limited to implementing the \n     remaining 9/11 Commission recommendations. This legislation \n     is far too important to be politicized by the introduction of \n     non-germane, controversial amendments and debate, \n     particularly those relating to Iraq. Attention to both issues \n     is critically important. As such, each deserves separate \n     deliberation.\n       We urge you to act now to protect America by passing stand-\n     alone, comprehensive security legislation under S. 4 based on \n     the 9/11 Commission blueprint without complications regarding \n     Iraq. The legacy of those whose lives have been taken by \n     terrorists on American soil is in your hands. Prove to the \n     families of those killed in 1993 and 2001, and to all \n     Americans, that this is a new day in Washington, and that \n     safety and security will finally take precedence over special \n     interest groups and politics.\n           Respectfully,\n     Carol Ashley,\n       Mother of Janice, 25, VOICES of September 11th.\n     Beverly Eckert,\n       Widow of Sean Rooney, 50, Families of September 11.\n     Mary Fetchet,\n       Mother of Brad, 24, Founding Director and President, VOICES \n     of September 11th.\n     Carie Lemack,\n       Daughter of Judy Larocque, 50, Co-founder and President, \n     Families of September 11.\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the distinguished Republican leader and \npeople on his side of the aisle, if people are concerned about going to \nS. 4 because of not being allowed to offer amendments, I have stated \npublicly--and I understand because there were no amendments on the \ncontinuing resolution--and I will state again, I appreciate very much \nthe cooperation of the Republicans. Even though there were no \namendments, this was an issue this Congress, this Senate had to \ncomplete. None of the Members of the body here are responsible for what \ntook place prior to this Congress. The 110th Congress is our \nresponsibility, and that is why I am very happy the Democrats and \nRepublicans joined together and got the continuing resolution passed. \nWe were able to work our way through the contentious matters we had \ndealing with the Iraq war. I stated at the time we were doing that the \n9/11 legislation will be subject to amendments.\n  Senator McConnell and I are working our way through this issue to \ndetermine when the next debate will take place regarding Iraq. I hope \nit can be done on an agreement between the two of us. We are working on \nthat. But I do say, don't anyone suggest the 9/11 legislation will not \nbe open to amendment; it will be. We are going to work our way through \nthat. There will not be cloture filed on this legislation until--\nhopefully, it won't have to be done. I think this is a piece of \nlegislation for which it would not be necessary. There certainly will \nnot be anything in the next 10 days. We will take a look at it.\n  I will work in conjunction with the distinguished Republican leader \nto find out if cloture ever has to be filed on the 9/11 bill. But I \nwould hope we could gain this extra 30 hours and move to it right away. \nWe could get the opening statements out of the way and some amendments \noffered today.\n  I had a leadership meeting at 9 o'clock this morning. I told the \nSenators there they better be ready for some votes Friday, that we are \nnot going to be finished by 10 o'clock Friday morning. We have to \nfinish this bill and finish it in a way that is appropriate.\n  So we have a lot of work to do. When we finish the 9/11 legislation, \nwe have stem cells, we have the budget, we have the supplemental during \nthis work period. We have a lot to do. We will need the cooperation of \nboth sides.\n  I spoke out here last night, and I did my utmost to lay out the \nfacts. We have been able to get a lot done this last work period. It \nwas a long work period. We were able to do some good things. We were \nable to pass the most comprehensive ethics and lobbying reform in the \nhistory of the country. We passed minimum wage legislation for the \nfirst time in 10 years. We got the country's financial house in order \nby completing that. We have done some good work. As I said last night, \nit has been done on a bipartisan basis. We have worked together. So I \nhope we can continue to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2238-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I indicated to my good friend, the \nmajority leader, yesterday, and I now reiterate publicly, our desire to \ngo to the measure reported by the Committee on Homeland Security. I \nthink we will be able to work that out in the next few hours. We have \nalso had a good conversation about how to structure a debate on Iraq to \nfollow the 9/11 bill. There are a number of important amendments that \nMembers on this side of the aisle want to offer to the 9/11 bill.\n  The majority leader has indicated there will be no desire on his \npart, and reiterated it here this morning, to prevent any of those \namendments from being acted upon. So we expect a freewheeling, Senate-\nstyle debate on the\n9/11 bill in which a number of important amendments related to the \nmeasure are offered. I think we will be able to work out a way to go \nforward in the next few hours that will accommodate our mutual desire \nto have the right bill before the Senate regarding 9/11, and, \nhopefully, sometime shortly thereafter some kind of agreement to \nstructure the debate on Iraq in a way that will be mutually acceptable \nto both sides of the aisle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, finally, let me say this. I have had a \nnumber of people come to me during the last several days. In fact, I \ngot a call in Nevada. The House is having 2 weeks during the Easter \nrecess. The Senate is going to have 1 week. Everyone should understand \nthat. We are going to work--we cannot move as fast as the House. We \nhave rules here that simply do not allow that. While we would all like \nto be able to go home and spend time in our respective States, that \nwill not happen. We are going to have only a 1-week recess for Easter.\n  I would say during the rest of the year there are no set times. I \nhave been as forewarning as possible to the distinguished Republican \nleader, telling him of the days we would not have votes, days we would \nhave votes. I am going to do my very best not to have surprises in the \nschedule. One of the surprises we will not have is 2 weeks for the \nEaster break. We are going to have to work through that. Up until \nAugust, I am hopeful and confident we can get our work done. But the \nAugust recess is a long one, and everyone should understand that is not \nautomatic. We have to get our work done or we may have to shorten that \nalso.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to \nexpress my concerns about the growing politicalization of the debate \nover the war in Iraq. The reason I am concerned is because I think the \nrevolving door of resolutions we have seen emanating from Washington, \nDC, has caused confusion. Now, I would be happy if the confusion were \nlimited to our enemies. But, unfortunately, I think that confusion \nextends to our allies and perhaps even to the troops who are now \nserving in that war-torn country.\n  I do not believe that confusion is called for; rather, clarity is \nwhat we ought to be producing here. But this revolving door of \nresolutions being produced by those primarily on the other side of the \naisle has seemed to contribute to our inability to speak with one voice \non the one subject where we ought to be speaking with one voice; that \nis, our Nation's security. We ought not to be playing politics of any \nkind when talking about the lives of our troops or the resolutions \nwhich might have the unintended consequence of undermining their morale \nor causing our friends and allies confusion as to whether we are \nwilling to stay the course in this battle of wills. This is a battle of \nwills.\n\n  If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle feel so strongly--as \nsome of them clearly do--about the conflict in Iraq, then I believe \nthey have an obligation to cut off funding. We have at least two \nSenators who have offered those kinds of resolutions--Senator Dodd and \nSenator Feingold. I would put it this way: If my colleagues really \nbelieve all is lost in Iraq and there is no possible way to succeed, \nthen I think Senators could justly reach the conclusion that the only \nmoral decision would be to deny funding to send them into harm's way. \nBut instead what we see is an uncontrollable desire to tinker with our \nmilitary operations, deciding in some cases what individual Members of \nCongress think should be done on the ground and then on the other hand \nwhat kind of decisions ought to be left to commanders. I suggest to my \ncolleagues that strategy will lead us nowhere. Congress should not be \ninvolved in micromanaging the day-to-day tactics of military commanders \non the ground. Our Constitution provides for a single Commander in \nChief, not 535 chieftains who can make tactical decisions about \nsomething as sensitive and challenging as war operations in Iraq.\n  We have heard there are between 5,000 and 6,000 members of al-Qaida \nin Iraq, primarily in Anbar Province. It makes no sense to me for us to \npull out our troops until we have defeated those terrorists. Certainly, \nI disagree with those who say we ought to pull out our troops before we \nare able to stabilize Iraq in a way that it can sustain itself, defend \nitself, and govern itself because I think we know what will happen if \nIraq becomes just another failed state in the Middle East, particularly \nwith those 5,000 to 6,000 members of al-Qaida present in Iraq: It will \nbecome another Afghanistan.\n  As we all know, when the Soviet Union left Afghanistan, Afghanistan \nbecame a failed state, giving rise to the Taliban and al-Qaida in Iraq, \nthe likes of Osama bin Laden among them. Of course, it was because they \nhad a safe haven in Afghanistan that they could then plot and plan and \ntrain and recruit and finance their terrorist operations, and it allows \nthem the safety and convenience to plan an attack against the United \nStates, which they did on September 11, 2001.\n  Of course, we know, because they have told us, that one of al-Qaida's \nmajor goals in Iraq is to increase sectarian violence between the \nSunnis and the Shias. Al-Qaida cannot defeat us on the battlefield; we \nknow that and they know that. The only way they can prevail is if we \ngive up, if we pull our combat troops out of Iraq until al-Qaida is no \nlonger a threat there. We know that Sunni extremists, including al-\nQaida, want to create a civil war that will tear the country apart. The \nonly way al-Qaida will be successful in doing that is if we allow them \nto do so.\n  We need to let our military do the job in Iraq. We can't pretend to \nbe able to make the best decisions from here in Washington, DC, about \nwhat kinds of tactics are likely or reasonably calculated to be \nsuccessful several thousand miles away.\n  As recently as Sunday, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee appeared on a weekend talk show. I would like to read a \nlittle bit of the questions and answers which were produced from that \ninteraction because I think it demonstrates exactly the kind of \nconfusion I am talking about that I think ill-serves our troops and \nill-serves our Nation during a time of war.\n  The question was this:\n\n       Will you set a goal for withdrawing combat troops?\n\n  Senator Levin says:\n\n       We would. We would follow basically the pattern that was \n     set or proposed by the Iraq Study Group, which was to set a \n     goal for the removal of combat troops, as you put it \n     correctly, by March of next year.\n\n  Mr. Russert:\n\n       So how many troops would that be by March of next year \n     would be taken out?\n\n  Mr. Levin said:\n\n       We don't have a specific number, nor did the study group, \n     but it would be most. There would be a limited number of \n     troops that would be left.\n\n  Mr. Russert said:\n\n       So out of 150,000, we would take out how many?\n\n  Mr. Levin:\n\n       I would say most.\n\n  Mr. Russert:\n\n       What would be left behind?\n\n  Senator Levin said:\n\n       It would be a limited number, which would--\n\n  Mr. Russert said:\n\n       Ten thousand, 20,000?\n\n  Senator Levin said:\n\n       I don't want to put a specific number on it because that \n     really should be left to the commanders to decide how many \n     would be needed to carry out these limited functions.\n\n  I think this brief Q-and-A demonstrates the kind of confusion that \noccurs when Members of the Senate, notwithstanding their best \nintentions, tinker with tactical decisions made with fighting a war \nseveral thousand miles away.\n  We know the power Congress has under our Constitution, and if, in \nfact, there are those, as I said earlier, who believe that all is lost, \nthen I believe the only appropriate action to take would be for those \npeople who hold that belief to try to bring a resolution to the floor \nthat would cut off funding for this ill-fated, in their view, conflict. \nBut my colleagues can't have it both ways. On the one hand, they can't \nsay we should leave it to our commanders in the field to determine the \nnumber of troops, and yet when General Petraeus says he needs 21,500 \ntroops to fight the terrorists in Iraq, these same individuals would \ntell him: No, you can't have them.\n  This is a question and answer from the nomination hearing for GEN \nDavid Petraeus.\n  Senator McCain asked him:\n\n       Suppose we send you over there to your new job, General, \n     only we tell you that you can't have any additional troops. \n     Can you get your job done?\n\n  General Petraeus said:\n\n       No, sir.\n\n  The kind of confusion I think we have seen emanating from Capitol \nHill is directly related to the revolving door of resolutions we have \nseen since the beginning of the year.\n  First, there was the Biden resolution. Senator Reid, the \ndistinguished majority leader, said, ``Tomorrow the Senate will proceed \nto S. Con. Res. 2, the bipartisan Iraq resolution.'' He said that\n\n[[Page S2240]]\n\non January 31, 2007. Then Senator Reid said later the same day, ``There \nwill be a bipartisan group of Senators who believe the more appropriate \nmatter is the Warner resolution.''\n  So first we had the Biden resolution, then we had the Warner \nresolution, and then there was the Levin resolution. Senator Reid said, \non January 31, 2007, ``In my caucus there was near unanimity for the \nLevin resolution.'' Then--I mentioned this a moment ago--there are \nthose such as Senator Feingold who said: ``I oppose the weak Warner-\nLevin resolution as currently written because it misunderstands the \nsituation in Iraq and shortchanges our national security interests.'' \nHe said that on February 1.\n  Then there was the Reid-Pelosi resolution. This was the one on which \nthe majority leader said, ``I think it is so much more direct. We \nsupport the troops. We are opposed to the surge. Perfect.'' He was \nasked this question: I was asking you why you prefer the House \nresolution to move forward. This is the press asking the majority \nleader. He said, ``I think it is so much more direct. We support the \ntroops. We are opposed to the surge. Perfect.'' That is the majority \nleader on February 13, 2007.\n  Then one of the Democratic candidates for President, Senator Chris \nDodd of Connecticut, made this observation, and I happen to think he is \nexactly right. He said: ``We have a sense of Senate resolution on \nasparagus. They don't mean a whole lot.''\n  Well, I have heard a lot from my constituents back in Texas who just \nwonder what in the world are we doing here in Washington debating a \nseries of nonbinding resolutions. Senator Dodd has it exactly right. To \nshow the dignity of these nonbinding resolutions, we even have a Senate \nresolution on asparagus. It is demeaning and inappropriate, in my view, \nfor us to be talking in those kinds of terms when it comes to something \nas serious as Iraq.\n  Then there was the Murtha plan, named after Representative Jack \nMurtha, the Democrat from Pennsylvania. This is Representative Murtha's \nplan. He said:\n\n       They won't be able to continue. They won't be able to do \n     the deployment.\n\n  This is his plan.\n\n       They won't have the equipment, they won't have the \n     training, and they won't be able to do the work. There is no \n     question in my mind. We have analyzed this and we have come \n     to the conclusion that it can't be done.\n\n  So this is what the Democrats in the House have had to offer in terms \nof resolutions: Let's not vote to cut off funding, but let's tie our \ntroops in so much redtape and deny them the ability to be successful \nwith the new plan the President has proposed in Iraq. That was on \nFebruary 15.\n  Representative Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee, I think tagged \nit right, tagged Representative Murtha's plan correctly. He said on \nMurtha's clumsy strategy:\n\n       Congress has no business micromanaging a war, cutting off \n     funding or even conditioning these funds.\n\n  That was what Representative Jim Cooper said on February 23 in the \nWashington Post.\n  Congressman Chet Edwards from my State of Texas, another Democrat, \nsaid:\n\n       If you strictly limit a commander's ability to rotate \n     troops in and out of Iraq, that kind of inflexibility could \n     put some missions and some troops at risk.\n\n  He said that on February 23 in the Washington Post.\n  The latest resolution, the Biden-Levin proposal, was described by \nSenator Joe Biden of Delaware, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee in the Senate, another Democrat candidate for President: \n``And that resolution can be simply entitled: Revoke the \nauthorization.''\n  What he is talking about is revoking the authorization of the use of \nmilitary force that Congress passed in 2001. He is talking about, in \n2007, going back to 2001 and revoking the original authorization for \nuse of military force that has resulted in 130,000 American troops \ncurrently in Iraq.\n  Senator Biden said this:\n\n       The next best step is to revoke the authorization the \n     United States Congress gave to the President to go to war in \n     the first place.\n\n  He said that in Des Moines, IA, on February 17.\n  Senator Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, a \nDemocrat of Michigan, said:\n\n       We should limit the mission. One thought is that we should \n     limit the mission to a support mission. In other words, an \n     anti-terrorist mission to go after al-Qaida in Iraq, to \n     support and train the Iraqi Army, to protect our own \n     diplomatic personnel and other personnel in Iraq.\n\n  So Senator Levin's proposal would be to limit the mission, to put \nconditions on our troops and on the rules of engagement that would deny \nthem the ability to be successful, if they were otherwise able to be \nsuccessful. He said that on September 19.\n  Representative Chet Edwards, again of Texas, a Democrat, I think \nnailed it. He said:\n\n       I think Congress begins to skate on thin ice when we start \n     to micromanage troop deployment and rotation.\n\n  He said that on February 23, 2007.\n  Then there are other resolutions by other candidates for President.\n  The Senator from Illinois, Mr. Obama, on his resolution said:\n\n       The time for waiting in Iraq is over. The days of our open-\n     ended commitment must come to a close. The need to bring this \n     war to an end is here, and that is why today I am introducing \n     the Iraq War Deescalation Act of 2007.\n\n  That was on January 30, 2007. He wanted to cap troops who could be \ndeployed into Iraq and opposed the President's plan.\n  Then Senator Clinton, on her proposal, said:\n\n       I don't want to defund our troops, I am against that, but I \n     want to defund Iraqi troops.\n\n  Just remember, a moment ago Senator Levin in his resolution said he \nwanted to train and equip the Iraqis, and now Senator Clinton says she \nwants to defund the Iraqi troops. She said:\n\n       I want to defund the private security going for the Iraqi \n     government if they don't meet these certain requirements.\n\n  She said that on FOX News, a special report with Brit Hume on January \n18, 2007.\n  I could go on and on. I know the Senator from Florida is here and \nwants to speak on the same topic. But the plethora of resolutions that \nseem to be emanating from the other side of the aisle can't do anything \nbut engender confusion about our aims in Iraq and in the Middle East, \nnot only for our troops who put themselves in harm's way but for Iraqis \nwho have allied themselves with us, who have helped us. I would think \nthat out of the new majority, at least there ought to be a consensus on \nwhat it is we ought to be doing there, that we ought not to be leaving \nour troops with any doubt in their minds about our commitment to \nsupport them. We ought not to be leaving any of our friends in Iraq, \nwho have allied themselves with us by helping us, to doubt, wondering \nwhether we would pull our troops out precipitously and leave them \nexposed to a huge humanitarian crisis and a huge ethnic cleansing by \nthe violence that would ensue.\n\n  My hope is we will give this new plan a chance. As the Iraq Study \nGroup said, they believe they could support a surge, under appropriate \nconditions, on page 73 in that report--a bipartisan report of a group \nwho have been given great weight in Congress. They have studied the \nissue and made recommendations to the President. The President has \nconsulted broadly with a large number of people, military experts, \npeople on both sides of the aisle, and has come up with not only a new \ncommander but a new plan, and we have a new Secretary of Defense.\n  I fail to understand, and I cannot understand, why it is there are so \nmany people who are determined to see that plan be unsuccessful by not \nproviding the troops, by not providing the funding, and by tying our \ntroops' hands with redtape, in terms of the rules of engagement and the \nconditions under which they fight.\n  Mr. President, I ask our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nwork with us and come up with some plan that can have the support of \nthe Members of Congress. As I said, it used to be that differences \nbetween political parties stopped at the water's edge, particularly on \na matter so important as our national security. A confusing message is \nsent by these revolving-door resolutions that are mutually \ncontradictory and inconsistent and do nothing to help us win the war \nthere, to stabilize Iraq, and to bring our troops home as fast as we \ncan.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2241]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I follow the remarks of my colleague \nfrom Texas regarding the situation in Iraq and our own situation as it \nrelates to that effort. I wish to pick up on what he said, which is \nthat for so long in the history of our Nation, politics ended at the \nwater's edge. I wish we could go back to the days when we would look at \nour troops fighting overseas in an effort as significant as this is--\nthe current war against radical Islam--as something that could unite us \nall as Americans, where we might shed party labels and also shed \npersonal political ambition.\n  I cannot help but notice, as the Senator from Texas was recounting \nall of the various plans that have been proposed from the other side, \nthat most of them seemed to come from those labeled as a Presidential \ncandidate. It seems everybody tried to have a different nuance on yet \nanother micromanaging strategy to satisfy their personal political \ngoals.\n  So how do we serve our national interests best? We should not be \nfighting a war from the political landscape of Washington. That is a \nrecipe for defeat. We should follow the strategy of General Petraeus, \nwho is in the field, who is the allied commander of our troops in Iraq, \nwho does believe the current strategy we are following is one that has \na reasonable chance for success. There is no guarantee, but it has a \nreasonable chance for success. That strategy has now been unfolding for \nseveral days. There has been a change on the ground. It is a strategy I \nknow many forget, but it has multiprongs to it. It is not just the \nmilitary reinforcements over Baghdad and the Iraqi forces taking the \nlead in Baghdad with our support, but it also has a political and an \neconomic component. The political component--and I had to look for it \nbecause it was not on the front page--was that the Iraqi Cabinet \napproved yesterday an oil-sharing agreement for their country, which \nnow goes to the Iraqi Parliament for their approval. That is one of the \nkey cornerstones of beginning to achieve a political settlement--\nreaching an accord on the sharing of oil revenue--so there can be a \nsense of nationhood, so there can be a coming together of the different \nfactions within Iraq. It is a very important component of a political \nsettlement. I know other settlements are being added to the military \nand, at the same time, we understand some of those folks we would not \nwant to be partners with. There are elements from the old Baathist Army \nthat can be incorporated. Most of these are Sunnis, which is leading to \na greater sense of confidence in the Sunni population. We see shifting \nand changing on the ground. We see that al-Sadr is taking a slightly \ndifferent approach. He is anti-American, but at the same time the \nstreets of Baghdad seem to be a tad quieter.\n  We have a long way to go, but we are making some progress. I believe \nit is important we note even the small measures of progress. I know our \ntroops on the ground, our brave men and women fighting in Iraq, do \nnotice these changes and understand they make a difference in the lives \nof the Iraqis. When our men and women who volunteer to serve our Nation \nare deployed and they go into battle, they should never for a moment \nhave any hesitation in their minds or wonder whether they will have the \ntools they need to successfully perform their mission while defending \nthemselves and the civilians they are working to protect.\n\n  The concept of opposing the war but supporting our troops seems \nuntenable, when part of that same plan is one that will not allow \nreinforcements into battle, will not allow the equipment necessary, and \nhas been described as a slow-bleed strategy. That kind of a strategy \naccomplishes nothing toward victory, and it does damage our troops, \ntheir morale and their mission.\n  Our President is the Commander in Chief. He is the leader of our \nNation's military. Congress voted to authorize the President under the \npresent circumstances. Resolutions in Washington of all flavors and \nvarieties might make for good politics, but they do not make good sense \nas a military policy and a strategy for success. We only have one \nCommander in Chief at a time. Our Nation only has one Commander in \nChief, and to micromanage our troops in the field is not what was ever \nintended by the constitutional responsibilities that divide the powers \nwithin our Government.\n  My colleague from Texas talked about Chairman Levin's comments. He \nmade other comments in that interview. This was Sunday on ``Meet The \nPress.'' He said:\n\n       We are trying to tie the hands of the President and his \n     policy.\n\n  I will repeat that:\n\n       We are trying to tie the hands of the President and his \n     policy. We are trying to change the policy. And if someone \n     wants to call that ``tying the hands'' instead of changing \n     policy, yes, the President needs a check and balance.\n\n  I don't think that is a check and balance that was envisioned by our \nConstitution and Founding Fathers--tying the hands of the Commander in \nChief in a time of war, while our troops are deployed and are shedding \nblood in battle. That is not what our Constitution ever intended.\n  Is it appropriate for Congress to tie the hands of the Commander in \nChief in a time of war? I would say no. I believe most Floridians would \nagree with that--that this is not the time to tie the hands of the \nCommander in Chief. Should we keep the Commander in Chief from \nreinforcing our troops? In the judgment of military leaders, such as \nGeneral Petraeus, the reinforcements are necessary, needed, and they \nare part of what will give us an opportunity for success. Should we \nkeep the Commander in Chief from reinforcing these troops? The answer \nto that is also no. Under article I, section 8, of the Constitution, \nwith regard to the Armed Forces, Congress is given the power of the \npurse and only the power of the purse. We have the responsibility to \nfully provide funding for our military forces, especially when they are \nat war and in harm's way, defending our Nation.\n  So what is the President's role in all of this? Article II, section \n2, of the Constitution says the President is the ``Commander in Chief \nof the Army and Navy of the United States.'' He has command over the \nArmed Forces. He has the power and authority to deploy troops. He has \nthe power and authority to direct military campaigns during wartime. \nFor the Congress to tie the President's hands is not the right thing to \ndo. It is outside the scope of what the Congress is supposed to do. \nThis is not the checks and balances intended by our Founding Fathers. \nIn a time of war, the Congress should only support our President, try \nto unite behind our troops and unite behind our effort. Our job is not \nto micromanage the handling of a war.\n  Another theory that has been advanced is we should continue to fight \nal-Qaida but not be involved in a civil war. I have not understood how \nwe can have a strategy in a place that is as complex as Iraq is today \nto fight against one set of insurgents and not against another. We do \nknow that a chaotic Iraq would be nothing but a haven for al-Qaida. We \nknow that al-Qaida is resurging and reorganizing; our recent \nintelligence reports indicate that. Nothing would be more appealing or \npleasing to them than to, first of all, validate their strategy, which \nis to create such an uproar in American politics through the deaths of \nour men and women in uniform and to end the resolve of our Nation so we \nwould not continue to be steadfast in our resolve. This has been their \navowed and professed strategy.\n  I believe for us to do anything other than continue forward in this \nhopeful effort for a victorious outcome would be nothing short of \ngiving in to al-Qaida's strategy--their professed strategy. There is \nonly one option, which has to do with the funding of our troops. I go \nback to the Gregg resolution. Senator Gregg had a resolution, and it \nwas simply that we would support our troops. Our troops are in battle; \nwe are in a time of war. This Congress sent them into battle by \nallowing the President to have the authority to do so. So at this time, \nthe only resolution that I think is appropriate is the Gregg \nresolution, which has been discussed but not debated on the floor of \nthe Senate. I look forward to an opportunity to have a full debate on \nthat resolution. Hopefully, the leadership will allow it to come to the \nfloor for a full debate and a vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the\n\n[[Page S2242]]\n\nnext 30 minutes will be under the control of the majority leader or his \ndesignee.\n  The Democratic whip is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2242-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2242-S2244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am glad we are discussing this issue. I \nam glad we are on the floor of the Senate to discuss the war in Iraq. I \nthink this is an issue that is being discussed across America--over \ncoffee pots in offices, in doughnut shops in the morning, at schools, \nin living rooms, and in churches. Everybody is thinking about this war, \nas they should. Those of us who are fortunate enough to live in the \nsafety of America know full well that we have over 130,000 of our best \nand bravest sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, husbands and \nwives, risking their lives at this very moment in Iraq.\n  I have listened carefully to my colleagues from the other side of the \naisle as they have come to the floor, including the last two, Senator \nCornyn of Texas and Senator Martinez of Florida. I have the highest \nrespect for both of my colleagues. I count them as friends. I work with \nthem on many issues. I respectfully disagree with them on their views \non this war.\n  Senator Cornyn mentioned earlier he felt there should be a consensus \namong Democrats about what to do with this war, that if we have 50 or \n51 Members on the floor, we ought to have a point of view. I say to the \nSenator from Texas that there are some things we agree on, on this side \nof the aisle. For example, when there was a vote 10 or 11 days ago on \nwhether we should escalate the number of troops we are sending to Iraq, \nwhether we should follow the President's proposed plan to send anywhere \nfrom 21,000 to 48,000 more soldiers into harm's way, 49 of 50 Democrats \nvoted no.\n  We were joined by seven Republicans who crossed the aisle. Is there a \nconsensus on the Democratic side on the President's plan? Yes. And it \nisn't just a consensus on the Democratic side; it is a consensus across \nthe Nation.\n  This morning's Washington Post on the front page has the disclosure \nof an ABC News poll. Some 53 percent of the American people think it is \ntime for a deadline for withdrawing forces from Iraq, and an \noverwhelming majority think the President's strategy is wrong.\n  To argue that the Democrats don't have a consensus position is not an \naccurate statement. It does not reflect what occurred in a vote that \njust took place a few days ago.\n  I am also troubled by the continuing reference to support of our \ntroops. May I put that to rest for just a moment. Twenty-three of us in \nthe Senate voted against this war in Iraq--1 Republican and 22 \nDemocrats. But I will tell you, Mr. President, when the President came \nand then asked for funds to support our troops in Iraq, this Senator, \nand the overwhelming majority of those of us who oppose the policy, \ngave the President every penny he asked for. Our thinking was very \nclear: Though we may disagree with the policy, we can't put the burden \nof what we consider bad policy on the backs of our soldiers. We cannot \nshortchange them in any way in battle, even if we disagree with the \nbattle plan of the Commander in Chief. So I voted not for $1 billion, \nnot for $100 billion, but hundreds of billions of dollars for this war \nthat I think is the wrong war. Why? Quite simply, if it were my son or \ndaughter in uniform in this war risking his life, I would want him to \nhave everything necessary to be safe and to come back home safely.\n  So, yes, we support our troops. Whether we disagree with this foreign \npolicy or agree with it, Members of the Senate support our troops. But \none cannot overlook the obvious. When it comes to the support of our \ntroops, it goes way beyond a speech on the floor of the Senate.\n  On Sunday, February 18, Dana Priest and Anne Hull of the Washington \nPost wrote an article which has seared the conscious of America. It was \npart of a series about a military hospital, Walter Reed. I visited that \nhospital many times to visit our soldiers, marines, airmen, and sailors \nwho were in recovery. I have been so impressed with the men and women, \nthe medical professionals who perform medical miracles for these men \nand women who come home injured from the wars.\n  I listen to the soldiers and their families, and they are so grateful \nfor what they have received at Walter Reed. As the article says at one \npoint, Walter Reed has always been viewed as ``a surgical hospital that \nshines as the crown jewel of military medicine.'' And so it should be. \nOur men and women in uniform who have made the sacrifice deserve the \nvery best.\n  If that were the message of this series in the Washington Post, it \nwouldn't have been noted or remembered by anyone because it would have \nbeen repeating the obvious. But, sadly, this series tells us something \ndifferent.\n  Just a few minutes' drive away from where we are meeting in this \nSenate Chamber, at Walter Reed Hospital, there are buildings which are \nin deplorable condition. There are veterans and soldiers who are being \ntreated in ways that are absolutely unacceptable. Let me quote a few \nwords from this series in the Washington Post describing one of the \nbuildings at Walter Reed Hospital:\n\n        . . . [P]art of the wall is torn and hangs in the air, \n     weighted down with black mold. . . . Signs of neglect are \n     everywhere: mouse droppings, belly-up cockroaches, stained \n     carpet, cheap mattresses.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The common perception of Walter Reed is as a surgical \n     hospital that shines as the crown jewel of military medicine. \n     But 5\\1/2\\ years of sustained combat have transformed the \n     venerable 113-acre institution into something else entirely--\n     a holding ground for physically and psychologically damaged \n     outpatients. Almost 700 of them--the majority soldiers, but \n     some Marines--have been released from hospital beds but still \n     need treatment or are awaiting bureaucratic decisions before \n     being discharged or returned to active duty.\n       They suffer from brain injuries, severed arms and legs, \n     organ and back damage, and various degrees of post-traumatic \n     stress. Their legions have grown so exponentially--they \n     outnumber hospital patients at Walter Reed 17 to 1--that they \n     take up every available bed on post and spill into dozens of \n     nearby hotels and apartments leased by the Army. The average \n     stay is 10 months, but some have been stuck there for as long \n     as two years.\n       Disengaged clerks, unqualified platoon sergeants and \n     overworked case managers fumble with simple needs: feeding \n     soldiers' families who are close to poverty, replacing a \n     uniform ripped off by medics in the desert sand or helping a \n     brain-damaged soldier remember his next appointment.\n\n  Here is a quote from Marine SGT Ryan Groves, 26 years old, an amputee \nwho lived at Walter Reed for 16 months. Here is what he says:\n\n       We've done our duty. We fought the war. We came home \n     wounded. Fine. But whoever the people are back here who are \n     supposed to give us the easy transition should be doing it. . \n     . . We don't know what to do. The people who are supposed to \n     know don't have the answers. It's a nonstop process of \n     stalling.\n\n  Walter Reed Hospital, the crown jewel of medical care for our \nsoldiers who are giving everything in Iraq.\n  So now let's ask the question: Who is working to support our troops? \nWho is working at Walter Reed to support our troops? Rhetoric is easy \non the floor of the Senate, but for these troops and for the families, \nit will take more than words of loyalty and respect.\n  I can recall when this debate started. As a Senator, I faced the \ntoughest vote any Senator can face--a vote on a war. You know at the \nend of the day, if you go forward with the war, people will die--not \njust the enemy but our brave soldiers, as well as many innocent people. \nIt is the kind of vote that costs you sleep, and it should.\n  I remember it so well. It was October 11, 2002, within weeks of the \nelection. We had been subjected to a steady barrage of statements from \nthe President and the administration about why this war was necessary. \nWe had been told of weapons of mass destruction which not only \nthreatened the region but even threatened the United States. We had \nbeen told of a ruthless dictator in Saddam Hussein who had gassed and \nkilled his own innocent people. We had been told there was a connection \nbetween Saddam Hussein and the terrible events of 9/11 in the United \nStates. We had been told even of nuclear weapons and the possibility of \nmushroom-shaped clouds if we didn't respond, and quickly, in Iraq.\n  But what we were told turned out not to be true. What we were told as \nthe reason for the war turned out to be wrong. I was a member of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, and I sat behind closed doors at \nconfidential hearings and heard disputed evidence about\n\n[[Page S2243]]\n\nstatements being made by the administration. I was sworn to secrecy. I \ncouldn't walk outside the room and say: Wait a minute, this morning's \nheadline about mushroom-shaped clouds is about nuclear weapons that \neven this administration is not agreed on. I couldn't say it because of \nmy oath of loyalty to make certain I didn't disclose classified \ninformation. But I knew when it came time to vote that giving the \nPresident the authority to start this war was a bad decision, and that \nis why I voted against it. I think it was the worst foreign policy \ndecision in my time in Congress. It is one that will haunt us for years \nto come.\n  Iraq has not become the last battle in the war on terrorism. Sadly, \nit has become a proving ground, a testing ground, a preparation place \nfor training even more terrorists. Those are not my conclusions; those \nare the conclusions of our intelligence agencies.\n  When I listen to the Members on the other side say what we need to do \nin Iraq is send more Americans into that battleground, I ask myself: To \nwhat end? We were asked to do several things by this President, and we \ndid them and did them well. We deposed that dictator, dug him out of a \nhole in the ground and held him accountable in the courts of his own \nnation. We searched high and low for weapons of mass destruction to \ndestroy and could find none. We gave to the Iraqi people a chance for a \nfree election, something they never had in their history. Our soldiers \nstood guard at the polling places so the Iraqi people could finally \nhave their own voice and their own future. We let them choose their own \nleaders. We let their leaders form their own Government. We gave them \nmore opportunities at the cost of American lives, American blood, and \nAmerican treasure than any nation has ever given to Iraq in its \nhistory. We have achieved those things. We should be proud of those \nsuccesses. But, unfortunately, despite all we have done, the Iraqis \nhave not faced their own political responsibilities. After all of the \nyears, after all of the money, after all of the training, and all of \nthe time, they still don't have a police force that can stand up and \ndefend the people of Iraq in the streets of Baghdad. If there is a \nthreat of terrorism anywhere in the world, it isn't the army that has \nthe major responsibility, it is the police force.\n  What do we know of the Iraqi police force in this surge, in this \nescalation? The press report over the weekend was troubling. We are \nsending American soldiers into the meanest streets and toughest \nneighborhoods of Baghdad where death is at every corner, death is at \nevery door. They are searching these houses to try to find the \ninsurgents who are causing the civil war. They are looking for weapons. \nThey are looking for evidence of these bombs that are being set off and \nblowing through our humvees and armored vehicles, killing and disabling \nour soldiers. That is what our American soldiers are doing now, house \nby house, street by street, in this dangerous part of Baghdad, and they \nare accompanied by Iraqi policemen.\n  It sounds like a good thing until one hears the details. The details \nare that the Iraqi police are preceding American soldiers to the homes, \nwarning the people in the homes to hide their weapons because the \nAmericans are right behind them. We know this because our translators \nare telling our soldiers the Iraqi police are not helping. The Iraqi \npolice are trying to cover up the insurgents' tracks.\n  So one wonders why some of us believe it is time for the American \nsoldiers to start to come home? I think it is past time, it is long \noverdue. It is time for the Iraqis to stand up and defend their own \ncountry, to put their lives on the line, the lives of their policemen \nand their soldiers, to make the political decisions that need to be \nmade that Iraq can someday stand on its own. As long as the Iraqis \nbelieve they can dial 9-1-1 and order up American soldiers to come and \nstand and fight and die in their streets, they will not accept their \nown responsibility for their own future.\n  Those on the other side say give this plan a chance. I regret to say \nwe have given this plan a chance three different times. This is the \nfourth time the Bush administration has proposed sending more American \ntroops in for a surge to end the war. I think there is reason to be \nskeptical, particularly when it is at the risk of more American lives.\n  Incidentally, when they make reference to the Iraq Study Group, this \nbipartisan group headed by former Secretary of State James Baker and \nformer Congressman Lee Hamilton, when they talk about their proposal \nfor a surge or escalation of troops, they forget to add the one \nimportant or two important elements: That was part of a surge in \ndiplomacy, something this administration is loath to enter into. See, \nthey believe we should be sitting down as a nation with nations in the \nregion and trying to work out some stable resolution to this conflict \nin Iraq. The Bush administration has been reluctant to do that, but the \nstudy group called for it and, yes, they did call for the possibility \nof a surge in troops but only if we are bringing our troops out as of \nthe end of March in 2008. They had a definite timetable for the removal \nof most American troops from this theater. The other side doesn't talk \nabout that point, and certainly the President doesn't either.\n  One of the Senators came to the floor and said those of us who are \ncritical of the President's policy are micromanaging the war. Somebody \nneeds to manage this war. Somebody needs to manage a war which, as of \nthis morning, has claimed 3,154 American lives.\n\n  We have been losing about three American soldiers every single day \nwhile we have been debating this war. I looked through this morning's \nlist of soldiers, and I watch it on the newscast, and it is \nheartbreaking:\n\n       Specialist Christopher Boone, 34 years old, of Augusta, \n     Georgia; Sergeant Richard L. Ford, 40 years old, of East \n     Hartford, Connecticut; Specialist Louis Kim, 19 years old, of \n     West Covina, California; Staff Sergeant David R. Berry, 37 \n     years old, Wichita, Kansas; PFC Travis Buford, 23 years old, \n     Galveston, Texas; Staff Sergeant Joshua Hager, 29 years old, \n     of Broomfield, Colorado; and PFC Rowan D. Walter, 25, of \n     Winnetka, California.\n\n  That is this morning's list. Sadly, every morning there is a list.\n  If there is a sense of impatience on this side of the aisle, if there \nis a sense of impatience across this land, it is because we know each \nand every one of those lives is so valuable to their families and to \nevery single one of us. We want the day to come when soon these \nsoldiers who are serving us so nobly and gallantly in Iraq can come \nhome safely to the hero's welcome they deserve for serving their \ncountry so well.\n  Those of us who question this policy are being criticized because we \nare trying to micromanage this war. I wish I could. I wish I had the \npower. I do have the power, as a Senator, to speak up on this floor, to \nappeal to my colleagues to stand up, to ask them on a bipartisan basis \nto reach a compromise which will start to bring these troops home.\n  It is true we only have one Commander in Chief, but we also only have \none constitution, and the Constitution makes it clear that the \nPresident, despite all of his power, doesn't have all the power in this \ntown or this Nation. His power is shared, shared with the American \npeople through their elected representatives in Congress, and that \npower gives us the authority to stand and debate.\n  Much has been said about Senator Carl Levin, who spoke on a \ntelevision show, ``Meet the Press,'' this last Sunday. I watched that \nshow, and I couldn't have been prouder of my colleague from Michigan. I \nrespect Carl Levin so much. As chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, he takes his job so seriously. I don't know of a more \nconscientious Member, carefully weighing every word of every bill, \ntrying to make the right judgment not just for the moment but for the \nNation. When he spoke on that bill about reauthorizing, about \nquestioning the authority given to the President in October of 2002, I \nthink he was right. I know what that resolution said. We passed it in \nOctober of 2002. It addressed two challenges and two threats that no \nlonger exist. There is no Saddam Hussein and there were no weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  I think it is appropriate that we address this issue again and that \nwe try to decide what we are going to do to move forward; first, \nrevoking any authority given in a previous resolution that no longer \nexists; and, second, carefully defining the way we will bring our \ntroops home, making certain we understand the assignments and \nresponsibilities they will have into the future.\n\n[[Page S2244]]\n\n  This is an awesome responsibility to discuss this war, to debate it \non the floor of the Senate, and to do it in a constructive and positive \nway. I sincerely hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \nthose who are loyal to the President and those who are loyal to the \nPresident's policy, will encourage this debate, that they won't stop us \nwith procedural obstacles, that they will allow the Senate to speak, to \ndebate, and to express its will. We have tried before unsuccessfully, \nbut we are going to try again. I believe this is an extremely important \npriority, perhaps the highest we face.\n  Having said that, the first bill that is likely to come up tomorrow, \nmaybe later today, is on the 9/11 Commission recommendations. The 9/11 \nCommission, my colleagues will recall, was an effort to assess \nAmerica's vulnerabilities after the attack on 9/11. That commission \npublished a report that was widely read and applauded because of the \nleadership of Republican Governor Kean of New Jersey and Congressman \nLee Hamilton, a Democrat of Indiana. They cochaired a panel, a very \ndistinguished bipartisan panel, which came up with recommendations to \nmake America safer.\n  Some several years later, we have not lived up to their \nrecommendations and we haven't carried out their agenda. There is much \nwe can do to make this country safer and we want to move immediately to \nconsidering their recommendations and implementing them, whether it is \nport security, whether it is a communication system in Illinois or \nother States that allows the police, firefighters, first responders, \nand the medical community to communicate quickly in the midst of an \nemergency, whether it is a matter of mass evacuation drills, which I \nhave been asking for and which are included in this legislation. There \nare many things we can do, and specific things.\n  There are many who think we should move immediately to the debate on \nthe war. We are only going to postpone it long enough to discuss these \n9/11 Commission recommendations. The families of the survivors of 9/11 \nhave appealed to us to make this a high priority. For that reason, and \nfor that reason only, we may set aside the Iraq debate for a few days \nbut not indefinitely. This debate needs to take place for the very \nsimple reason that as we debate on the floor of the Senate, \nunfortunately, our sons and daughters are still in peril in Iraq. They \nare still caught in the crossfire of a civil war, and we are still \nlosing too many good American lives every single day because of this \nconfrontation taking place in Iraq.\n  In the meantime, we will be stepping forward to do something about \nWalter Reed Hospital, but we won't stop there. Walter Reed has to meet \nits obligation not just for inpatients, where they do a magnificent, an \nexcellent job, but for those who are outpatients as well. We have to \ntake this issue to the veterans hospitals and we have to ask the hard \nquestions about whether the veterans of this war and all of our wars \nare being treated with the dignity and respect and care they deserve.\n  I salute the Washington Post and those who wrote these articles. I am \nsure they will receive recognition for bringing this to our attention. \nThis will be a clear example and a clear opportunity for those of us \nwho stand on the floor and give speeches about supporting our troops to \nprove we mean it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join many \nof our colleagues in honoring one of our colleagues who celebrated a \nvery special birthday last week; Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts \nturned 75. He was congratulated and applauded and heralded throughout \nthese last few days on that milestone. I have come to the floor to give \na few brief remarks in honor of this tremendous achievement because it \nhas been 75 years well lived, in dedication to this country.\n  He has been an inspiration to me and to many of us in the Senate. His \nenergy, his commitment to his work, his constant thinking about new \napproaches and innovation is a testament to his presence and his \nservice in the Senate.\n  I also wish to acknowledge that, at first, coming to the Senate I \nfelt very close to the Senator. Mr. President, you would appreciate \nthis because you are from a large Catholic family yourself. Senator \nKennedy was raised some years before I was but in a similar kind of \nsituation, in a large and loving Catholic family, with strong parents \nand a real focus on community service and service to the family. That \nis apparent in his work. His Catholic upbringing and his deep religious \nbeliefs are reflected in the teachings of the Catholic Church, about \nthinking not of yourself but of others, of service, of sacrifice. Many \npeople talk about religious values, and I am getting somewhat skeptical \nthe more I hear people talk. I am never skeptical of Senator Kennedy \nbecause he actually lives the values he preaches. Sometimes some of the \ngreatest things I see him do are not evident to the camera. I would \nlike to share one of them. I could give plenty of examples.\n  Many people might be surprised to know that not only is Senator \nKennedy a champion of education, but he actually, for over 2 years, \ntook time out of what is an extraordinarily busy and hectic Senate \nschedule to tutor a child, teaching him how to read. How would I know \nthis? Because, on occasion, I had the great honor of sitting next to \nhim in the library down the street, where I was trying to keep up with \nhim and thinking if Senator Kennedy can carve an hour out of his \nschedule, certainly I could try to do that as a freshman Senator. \nNeedless to say, I could never keep up with the schedule. But I watched \nhim and observed him one-on-one with a child no more than 10 years old, \npatiently teaching him how to read. The next year it was a little girl.\n  One particular day, he even had the foresight or kindness to bring \nhis pet bunny from home. He has many pets--Splash the dog, being one, \nand Sonny. He brought his pet rabbit to the school, to the joy of the \nchildren perhaps to encourage them to read about animals, which is a \ngood way to get kids interested in reading, to actually show them. He \nknew this instinctively. Maybe that is because of the family he is from \nor because of the kind of guy he is. He is an extraordinary and a very \ndifferent kind of Senator. I have been inspired by him, and I am \nconfident our colleagues have been as well.\n  I also wish to acknowledge the tremendous partner he has in Victoria \nReggie Kennedy, a daughter of Louisiana. I have watched this couple \ngrow in love and support of one another. I think they are a model for \ncouples who are in public office. We could not find a better couple, in \nterms of their commitment to each other, to this body, to the Nation, \nand to the State of Massachusetts and, when they have extra time, to \nLouisiana. That was brought home when we experienced the last two \nhurricanes, Katrina and Rita. As you know, they struck our State in the \nlatter part of the year 2005.\n  These storms were of historic proportion. It was hard to describe the \ndamage--which I still struggle with trying to describe to this body. \nBut there was one Senator to whom I did not have to take too long to \ndescribe the damage, and that was Senator Kennedy, who got it \nimmediately, perhaps because he has walked through south Louisiana with \nVicki Reggie, his wife; perhaps he just has a big heart and great mind \nthat can grasp situations fairly quickly; and perhaps because he leans \nforward always in his ability and his desire to help people in need. He \ndidn't need the situation to be explained to him. He understood.\n  Not only did he help us pass one of the most extraordinary pieces of \nlegislation in that whole confusing time of the first 6 months when we \ndidn't know what levees had broken, where they had broken, whose they \nwere, whose\n\n[[Page S2245]]\n\nfault it was, and everyone was blaming everyone, but Senator Kennedy \nfocused on getting 330,000 children into school, and he focused on \ngetting them into the best school, any school, that would take them.\n  He passed legislation I think will serve this country significantly \nand powerfully in the decades to come. If any major catastrophe, \nwhether manmade or natural, hits our country again, at least the \nfamilies with children from K through 12 and the children who are in \nthose grades will know they have a champion in Senator Kennedy, who was \nnot in the majority, but with Senator Enzi as chairman of the Education \nCommittee and with a group of us who were committed to being their \nhelpers, we passed an extraordinary piece of legislation that, with 1 \nmillion people having been evacuated from their homes, 250,000 homes \ndestroyed, hundreds of schools, hospitals closed, literally within a \nfew weeks, children were, for the most part, safely ensconced. Even \nthose who found themselves in shelters for weeks and months at times \nwere allowed and encouraged and welcomed into schools because of \nlegislation that Senator Kennedy passed.\n  In addition to showing up on this floor day after day fighting for \nthat legislation and fighting against the extremes who wanted to turn \nit into a political football and vouchers, he held steady to allow \nchildren to go to public schools or Catholic schools--to allow children \nfrom Catholic schools to go to public schools and children from public \nschools to Catholic schools, which seems simple, but at the time it \nwasn't--he personally delivered to our office some nourishment and \nencouragement to my staff who were overworked and under tremendous \nstress and didn't call me to let me know he was coming, didn't call the \nnews media to make sure they saw him bringing these things, but just \nshowed up. To me and to my staff, that meant the world.\n  I thank him for his great service to this country on his 75th \nbirthday. I will submit a lot more for the public record because his \nlegislative achievements are quite long. Since they are well known, I \nthought I would add some points people might not know about this \nextraordinary public servant and Senator who turned 75. I only wish \nmedicine would keep up with us so that he could serve another 75. That \nis unlikely, but I am sure in the final years, in the final chapters of \nhis life, he will continue extraordinary service and will probably go \ndown in history as one of the finest Senators to ever serve in this \nbody.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2245-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. CECIL J. PICARD\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, my remarks about Senator Kennedy were \nfor a happy occasion, but this is on a sad occasion. Last week--very \nclose, actually, around the Senator's birthday--we lost our \nsuperintendent of education, Dr. Cecil Picard. Cecil Picard died \nprematurely of Lou Gehrig's disease, but he died in the arms of his \nloving wife of many years, surrounded by his children and his \ngrandchildren.\n  We knew for a time--and he knew, of course--that the disease that he \nhad been diagnosed with 2 years earlier was going to be fatal. Although \nhe fought it bravely and courageously, it took his life last week.\n  My husband, Frank Snellings, served on the board of elementary and \nsecondary education, and I want to say publicly what an inspiration Dr. \nPicard was to us, to our family but, more importantly, what an \noutstanding leader he was in the area of education reform in a State \nthat he loved, a community which he loved and in which he served as a \nteacher, principal, superintendent, and then as superintendent of \neducation of our State.\n  His passion and commitment to early childhood education was \ncontagious. In fact, in the last several years of my knowing Dr. \nPicard, I never had a conversation with him when he did not mention \nthis subject to me. He would say: Senator, when is the next meeting \nwith the Department of Education? Senator, do the other Senators \nunderstand how important early childhood is to this country? Do they \nreally understand that without this, our children will never be ready \nto learn and will never be able to access the great benefits of the \neducation infrastructure that we put together for them? Don't they \nunderstand?\n\n  I would say to him: Cecil, unfortunately, they don't understand it \nthe way you do. If everybody in this country had your passion and \nintellectual grasp of early childhood education, we would not be so \ngrossly underfunded. Because of his work in Louisiana, we now have--and \nit is his legacy--LA4, Louisiana 4, which the majority--not all, not \nbecause of his lack of trying--our 4-year-olds in Louisiana are almost \ncovered for early childhood opportunities. So when they show up and \nknock at that kindergarten door and that teacher welcomes them with \nopen arms, those children can sit down at that desk or at that table \nand open a book and begin to really grasp and understand the letters \nand the meanings of words because they have been taught up to that \npoint how to get their education started.\n  Of course, learning those early language symbols and numbers and \nsocial interaction is so important in those early years. Cecil knew \nthis. His life was committed to education, to being a leader and an \nadvocate for children, a champion for the profession of teaching, with \nhis enthusiasm and ability as a legislator, which is where I met him as \na State senator and as a legislator before he was a superintendent.\n  So as a father, a grandfather, a coach, a teacher, a principal, a \nsenator, and as an education advocate, we cannot say strongly enough in \nLouisiana that we have truly lost a champion. We have truly lost \nsomeone who, in my lifetime, probably cannot be replaced. Hopefully, \nanother Cecil Picard will come along, but they are few and far between.\n  So I wanted to say on behalf of the 4.5 million people I represent--\nand I can say this without fear of being contradicted--that he will be \nmissed, but his legacy will be long remembered, not only in our hearts \nand minds but in the way people live. His legacy will be reflected in \ntheir life, in their productivity, and their contributions to our State \nand to our Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of cloture on \nthe upcoming vote on S. 4, which is the bill relating to the 9/11 \nCommission implementation.\n  I just saw, as I came into the Senate Chamber, outside in the \nreception room a handful of people whom I would call American heroes. \nThese are women who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001, when \nterrorists brutally attacked innocent Americans here on our shores, in \nour homeland. They have taken their grief and worked very hard with \nmany of us here, first to get the Congress and the administration to \nagree on the 9/11 Commission and then, when that Commission came in \nwith its extraordinary findings and report, worked with us to see that \nlegislation was passed which would implement so many of its \nrecommendations. That was a remarkable bipartisan achievement which I \nbelieve has made our Nation safer from terrorist attack but not as safe \nas we need to be.\n  In the time that followed, the 9/11 Commissioners themselves asked us \nto come back and implement the unimplemented parts of their original \nreport or to go back and take another look at the parts they believed \nand we believed were not adequately implemented or funded, such as \nhomeland security grants or money for interoperable communication \nsystems that in a time of emergency, after a terrorist attack or a \nnatural disaster, enable our first responders to speak to each other in \norder to adequately and promptly protect us.\n  These women who are outside the Chamber, whom I saw as I came in, are \nhere today to persuade the Senate to begin debate on legislation to \nfulfill the recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission. The \nlegislation, S. 4, came out of our committee, and it was an honor and a \npleasure, as always, to work with Senator Collins. The bill passed our \ncommittee with 16 votes in the affirmative and one abstention. It is a \nvery significant, solid piece of work and will make America and the \nAmerican people even safer.\n  Is it a perfect piece of work? No. We expect that many of our \ncolleagues will look at different parts of the bill and will want to \noffer amendments. That is the nature of this process, and we look \nforward to a good, healthy debate. There is a sense of urgency, \nhowever. We are talking about homeland security. We are talking about \ncontinuing to raise our guard against the terrorists who attacked us on \nSeptember 11th, 2001 and who we know are planning and intending to \nattack us again in this most unconventional and deadly warfare on \nbehalf of a totalitarian ideology, radical Islam, which threatens us as \nmuch as the totalitarian ideologies we defeated in the last century. \nTogether, both here at home and throughout the world, we will defeat \nthis threat.\n  I wish to indicate that most of the bill before us, S. 4, came out of \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. There are \nother parts that came out of the Commerce and Banking Committees, and \nthey, in the ongoing process, will be blended with our bill.\n  I hope all of the Members of the Senate will vote for cloture so we \ncan proceed to the debate, consider the amendments, get the bill \npassed, meet with the House in conference, and get a good bill to the \nPresident to sign that will build on the security enhancements we have \nachieved since that dark day of\n9/11.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of invoking cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to S. 4, the Improving America's Security Act of \n2007. This legislation will strengthen our homeland security and will \ndo so in the spirit that shaped the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  I have worked very closely with the committee's chairman, Senator \nLieberman, as well as with the Presiding Officer, a valued member of \nthe committee, and with all of our committee members to shape this \nimportant legislation. Indeed, the committee voted unanimously on \nFebruary 15 to report this bill. The bill before the Senate now is the \nproduct of careful collaboration among the members of our committee, \nState, local, and tribal governments, emergency response providers, the \nprivate sector, the administration, and other stakeholders. It has \nproduced legislation that builds on the earlier work of the Committee \non Homeland Security over the last 3 years.\n  During that time, the committee has produced numerous pieces of \nlegislation implementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and \notherwise strengthening our homeland security. In the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, Congress enacted many \nsignificant measures to achieve the goals of the 9/11 Commission. In \nfact, that bill implemented the most sweeping changes in our \nintelligence community in more than 50 years.\n  More recently, in the last Congress, we passed measures that greatly \nstrengthened protections for America's cargo ports and chemical \nfacilities--again addressing vulnerabilities highlighted in the \nCommission report. We also approved an overhaul and reform of FEMA that \nwill help improve our emergency response and prepared negotiation, \nwhether it is through terrorist attack or a natural disaster.\n  As reported by the Homeland Security Committee, S. 4 builds upon \nthese past successes. It would authorize a comprehensive homeland \nsecurity grant program that includes four vital programs to assist \nState, local, and tribal governments in safeguarding our lives and \nproperty. Our approach to this bill reflects our belief that homeland \nsecurity is a partnership and that our State and local partners are \nvital to accomplishing this goal.\n  I will have much more to say about this bill as the debate proceeds. \nI will reserve the remainder of my time, if any does remain, and I urge \nmy colleagues to vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to \nthis important bill.\n  As always, it has been a great pleasure to work with the committee \nchairman and others, including the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield back all the remaining time, \nand I ask for a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I yield back the remaining time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Without objection, the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to S. \n184 is vitiated.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the motion to invoke cloture, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the motion to \n     proceed to S. 4, a bill to implement recommendations of the \n     9/11 Commission.\n         Joe Lieberman, Russell D.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to\n\n[[Page S2247]]\n\nproceed to S. 4, a bill improving America's security by implementing \nunfinished recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, shall be \nbrought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, if no one is seeking the floor, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCASKILL). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              trip to iraq\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, a colleague of mine asked a little earlier \nif I would give a brief report of a trip to Iraq, from which I just \nreturned, and I thought I would take this time to do that. Several of \nmy colleagues, both from the House of Representatives and the Senate, \nDemocrat and Republican, were able to make this trip, and I want to \nreport primarily on what we found when we went to Iraq.\n  I will start by saying we were in Israel the same day Secretary Rice \nmet with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud \nAbbas, and so we had an opportunity to speak with a lot of leaders in \nIsrael as well about the status of the negotiations that had been \nthought to proceed there, but with Hamas now likely being a part of the \nPalestinian Government they are likely going to come to a halt. This is \nmost unfortunate.\n  Obviously, neither Israel nor the United States can have direct \ndealings with a government which is dominated by a faction that refuses \nto recognize Israel's right to exist or renounce terrorism or agree to \nprevious Palestinian agreements. This will complicate the process of \nreaching a permanent accord that the people in the Palestinian areas \nparticularly want to have and the people of Israel also want to have in \norder to bring violence to a close against them.\n  So, unfortunately, the news out of Israel is pretty much the same as \nit has been year after year after year after year: Israel simply does \nnot have a partner for peace at this time. Obviously, Secretary of \nState Rice is continuing to pursue the situation as best she can to try \nto help the Israelis achieve that situation.\n  With regard to the Iraq situation, I took away three primary points \nfrom our visit, and I want to discuss them briefly. The first is that \nafter having talked to our commanders on the ground, General Petraeus \nand General Odierno, and a variety of other general officers as well as \ntroops of other rank, and Iraqi leaders, there is a sense of cautious \noptimism about the new plan that has been announced and, in fact, is \nalready being implemented. Our troops have begun to arrive, Iraqi \ntroops arriving in greater numbers than before, primarily in the city \nof Baghdad, and a new military strategy and a political, economic, and \ndiplomatic strategy has begun to play out.\n  Early signs are encouraging, though everyone cautioned that there \nwill be signs of progress, because they think it is a plan that can \nsucceed, but there will also be bad days.\n  Nobody should declare victory simply because things seem to be going \nwell for a while. An illustration of this is for about 3 days prior to \nour arrival there had been no major incidences of violence in the city \nof Baghdad, yet they were not willing to applaud that too loudly. Good \nthing, because as we were leaving the country, a couple of car bombs \nexploded. Clearly, it will be a matter of progress that is not \nnecessarily obvious and certainly will take a while to achieve.\n  Nonetheless, progress is possible this time because things are now \ndifferent. In fact, the Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq told us that in \nhis visits with people on the streets of Baghdad he was seeing \nsomething new, and he said it was an attitude that this time things are \ndifferent; that there is an opportunity here for success, for a plan to \nsucceed, where it didn't exist before. It is not simply because of \ngreater American presence, it is also because the Iraqis are beginning \nto do things differently than they had done in the past.\n  Whereas some people call this a troop surge, I think it is important \nto note there are many other factors involved in addition to the \naddition of Iraqi and American troops. For example, the Iraqis are now \ngoing to be much more involved in maintaining control of an area after \nit has been secured. Sometimes in the past the Iraqi or American troops \nwould take an area, would clear it of terrorists or militias, only to \nhave those people infiltrate back when we left. Clearly, an Iraqi \npresence must be maintained in order for stability to be preserved, and \nthat is what we are now beginning to see.\n  The Iraqi Shiite death squads and militia activity have gone way \ndown. Again, this is, we believe, partially because of some things the \nIraqi Government has done, rounding up about 600 of the Shiite \ntroublemakers and working with the people in places such as Sadr City \nto persuade them it is better to not resist control by the Iraqi Army \nthan it would be to fight. These are positive signs, but they are \ncertainly not an end of the problems.\n  There are little things that are being done, for example, to prevent \ncar bombs from going into marketplaces and blowing up a lot of people. \nThey are beginning now to create what are in effect pedestrian malls \nsuch as we have in the United States, where vehicles are not permitted. \nIt might still be possible for a single suicide bomber to go into a \nmarket and cause destruction but certainly not as much as a car bomb.\n  The point is, from a military tactical standpoint, the rules of \nengagement, the activities of the Iraqis, as well as what the United \nStates is doing, all are working together to consolidate the gains that \nhave been made there and to preserve them.\n\n  There is also a diplomatic, economic, and political aspect. The newly \nannounced legislation to distribute the oil revenues of the nation to \nthe people of the country is a very important political step that will \ngive the people of Iraq more confidence in their Government. This was \nmentioned by our Ambassador Khalilzad when we were there. So from the \nmilitary standpoint there are some signs this is already beginning to \nwork, and I certainly hope our colleagues here in the Congress will do \ntheir best to allow this plan to work.\n  That brings me to the second point. Our commanders, both in Kuwait \nand Iraq, were very clear that it was important the Congress pass the \nsupplemental appropriations bill to provide\n\n[[Page S2248]]\n\nthe necessary equipment and reinforcements and not to tie down the \ntactics of the people on the ground. They are very concerned that we \nwill somehow put limits on the kind of equipment that goes into theater \nor the number of troops or where the troops go or how they are \ndeployed. Clearly, Congress should not be trying to micromanage a war, \nand I hope my colleagues who have discussed that in some preliminary \nway will see the detriment to such an action and will not offer \nresolutions that would change the way these commanders are able to do \ntheir job. This is something specifically that General Petraeus asked \nof us.\n  The third and final point is the Iranian influence in Iraq cannot be \ndenied. It is true, I cannot read Farsi, the language of Iran. On the \nother hand, when General Odierno holds up an item, one of those \nexplosive devices, and says, in Farsi this says ``made in Iran,'' I \ncan't verify that, but I believe General Odierno. He pointed to batch \nand serial numbers on a variety of other weaponry and said, this can \nall be traced back to Iran.\n  We are clearly in a situation where we must make it crystal clear to \nthe Iranian leaders this will not be tolerated. We have a right to \nprotect our troops in Iraq and their interference will be intolerable. \nWe have to find a way to get the Iranians to back off of that.\n  Those were three of the key impressions we took from our trip to \nIraq, and I think it boils down to this: Some of our colleagues like to \npoint to the Baker-Hamilton report and say that is what we should be \ndoing instead of what we are doing. Remember what Lee Hamilton said in \ntestimony before the Senate not too long ago. He said, the President's \nannounced strategy should be given a chance to succeed. He specifically \nsaid, give it a chance to succeed.\n  I think there was some discussion of elements of the study \ncommission's recommendations, such as a temporary troop surge, which is \nnot inconsistent with what we are now doing. That is what I think we \nshould do, give this plan a chance to succeed. Our troops in theater, \nour commanders, and the Iraqi leaders all believe they can see early \nsigns of success in this program, even though it has just begun, and \nthey are cautiously optimistic that it can succeed. I think it would be \nunconscionable for the Congress, seeing the beginnings of success here, \nto then act in any way that would pull the rug out from under our \ntroops and make it impossible for them to achieve their mission.\n  I deliberately did not raise the question of the debate back here in \nWashington with the troops I met, but they raised it with me. They can \nsee what is going on. They watch television. They are very well aware \nof what is being debated here. They are proud of what they are \naccomplishing. Their morale is high. Yet I submit to my colleagues that \nwere we to pass legislation that would undercut their ability to \nperform their mission as they see it, clearly that situation could \nchange, and this bothers our troops. It certainly, I think, would have \nthe effect of causing our enemies to ask whether we have the will to \nsee this through. As General Petraeus said, this is all about a test of \nwill. Secretary Gates, I believe, and General Petraeus said it as \nwell--in this war, it is a test of wills, and the United States has to \nmake it clear we have the will to see it through.\n  From our perspective as legislators, we can take the example of the \nyoung men and women whom we put in harm's way to achieve a message. The \nexample I take from them is they have the will. They understand what is \nat stake. They are proud of what they are doing, and they want us to \nhelp them achieve the mission. I think that is the least we can do \nunder these circumstances. I hope my colleagues, as we debate in the \nensuing days, will keep in mind what these folks in Iraq who are on the \nground looking at this every day have to say about the situation and \nthat we won't do anything to undercut them but that we will do \neverything in our power to support their mission.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to speak about S. 4, but I \nthank my friend and colleague from Arizona, Senator Kyl, for his \nreport. It was very interesting for me to hear, and he will probably \nnot be surprised to hear I was both encouraged and in agreement with a \nlot of what he had to say. I particularly heard that Senator Kyl found \nin the field the first reactions to the implementation of the new plan \nfor Iraq have been encouraging. We all understand it is early, but it \nconforms with what I have heard from people I have spoken to from Iraq, \nin that particularly in the neighborhoods in which the joint United \nStates-Iraqi security forces have established dominance in Baghdad, \nthere has been a remarkable and significant drop in the sectarian \nviolence via death squads. Obviously, it is still possible, if someone \nis crazy enough to be prepared to blow themselves up in a car in a \ncrowd, that the bombings will occur, but I appreciate that \nencouragement.\n  I also agree with Senator Kyl that both Houses of Congress spoke on \nthese nonbinding resolutions. My colleague and I were both against \nthem. So I suppose what it shows is at this point there is a majority \nin both Chambers, although not 60 votes here, that is prepared to say \nin a nonbinding resolution they don't support the new plan, which \nSenator Kyl and I would say is a new plan to achieve success in Iraq, \nbut that there clearly, in my opinion, are not the votes, not a \nmajority in either Chamber, to do anything else, and certainly not to \ncut off funding for the new plan, which is the specific authority \nCongress is given in the Constitution.\n  So I want to echo what I heard Senator Kyl say, which is that I think \nthis is the moment for a pause over on this side for what I have called \na truce in the political war here about the war in Iraq.\n  Let's give General Petraeus and his troops an opportunity to make \nthis work. If, God forbid, they don't, then there will be plenty of \ntime for amendments and resolutions and all the rest because between \nnow and then--General Petraeus said to us, when he was here before the \nArmed Services Committee, that by the summer he would have an idea, \nbased on some evidence, of whether the new plan was working, and he \nwould report to us. He will begin to report quite soon, I think, on \nwhat he is seeing.\n  Since I don't see that there is anything that will pass both Houses, \ncertainly nothing that will pass both Houses and be signed by the \nPresident to try to block the carrying out of this new strategy, then I \nthink everybody would gain if we just did something that doesn't come \nnaturally to us, which is to remain silent for a while--particularly if \nthe sound and the fury will ultimately accomplish nothing between now \nand then.\n  I thank my friend from Arizona.\n  Madam President, I rise to speak about S. 4. I thank my colleagues \nfor voting overwhelmingly to invoke cloture on S. 4. The bill, if I \nunderstand the state of parliamentary play now, actually will not be \nformally before the Senate for debate and amendments until tomorrow \nmorning. But I thought I might expedite the matter--because this is a \nbig bill, it is an important bill, there will be many amendments; I \nthink we will be on it several days--if I came over and offered my \nopening statement on the bill today. I believe Senator Collins, the \nranking Republican member on the committee, may intend, as her schedule \nallows, to do the same.\n  Incidentally, Senator Collins and I have--what was for me an honor--\nworked very closely together on this bill to bring it out of committee. \nI am very pleased the final vote was across party lines: 16 in favor, 1 \nabstention. So we bring the bill to the floor with a real sense of \nbipartisanship.\n  The bill represents the hard work of the membership of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee and includes provisions \nthat are in the jurisdictions of other key committees as well, \nparticularly Commerce and Banking, during which occasions Senator \nInouye and Senator Dodd may exercise their right, with my \nencouragement, to manage those parts of the debate.\n  I thank the majority leader, Senator Reid, for working with all of \nthe committees that have contributed to this effort in bringing before \nthe Senate this comprehensive legislation that I am convinced will make \nour country safer. I look forward to working in the days ahead with my \ncolleagues on both\n\n[[Page S2249]]\n\nsides of the aisle to move the legislation through the Senate, into \nconference committee, and then ultimately to the President's desk for \nsignature.\n  September 11, 2001, shocked us. It was a tragedy of unspeakable \nproportions and human loss. It showed us, in that loss, how we had \nsuffered from what the 9/11 Commission itself called a failure of \nimagination. By that they meant an inability to imagine that there were \npeople in the world who would do something this outrageously inhuman, \nstriking buildings, symbols of America, but without regard to the \ndiversity of human beings in those buildings and the lives that they \nwere leading.\n  Someone said that on 9/11 the terrorists showed that they hate us \nmore than they love their own lives. That awakened us to our \nvulnerability and brought us into a new age.\n  I spoke, when I spoke on behalf of cloture, of the families of those \nwe lost on 9/11 who have been persistent and honorable and inspiring \nadvocates for closing the vulnerabilities that compromised and ended \nthe lives of so many of their loved ones. They fought with us on behalf \nof the bill that Senator McCain and I introduced to create the 9/11 \nCommission. They then worked very hard to advocate for the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. They deserve a lot of credit, \nas do a lot of other people in Congress and in the administration, for \nthe passage of the 2004 intelligence reform legislation that adopted so \nmany of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  In that bill we created a strong Director of National Intelligence to \nforge greater unity of effort among our intelligence agencies as they \nmoved forward to inform us about the plans and activities and \nintentions of our enemies, to stop them before they strike us again.\n  There are many reasons on this day we can be grateful that America \nhas not been the victim of terrorist acts again. Some of it is just \nplain good fortune. Some of it, however, I think is the work of the \nagencies created by the 9/11 legislation in 2004. Some of it is, \nwithout doubt, a result of the grace of God. We created in that bill \nalso a National Counterterrorism Center to improve interagency planning \nto achieve goals in the war against terrorism.\n  One of the most exciting moments I have had as a Senator was to go \nout to the National Counterterrorism Center. I urge my colleagues to \ntake the time. Established by the 9/11 legislation in 2004 to make \nsure, to use a very simplistic metaphor for a very complicated \nsituation, that never again would our Government fail to connect the \ndots that would have presented the warning that a terrorist attack was \ncoming.\n  This National Counterterrorism Center is out there. It has all the \nrelevant agencies, they are constantly streaming information, receiving \ninformation from around the country, around the world, and cooperating \nwith one another to protect our security. We mandated in the 2004 \nlegislation the development of an information sharing environment to \nfacilitate the sharing of national-security-related information among \nthe different branches and agencies of the Federal Government and also \nto make sure that the Federal, State, and local governments were \ncooperating. When you think about it, State and local first responders \nare not just first responders, they have the ability, with the hundreds \nof thousands of eyes and ears that they bring to law enforcement, to be \nalso first preventers. That was a goal of the information sharing \nenvironment we established.\n  In the 2004 legislation we made significant improvements to border \nand transportation security, focusing on aviation security, of course; \nbuilding on legislation passed in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, \nbecause of our obvious anger that the existing systems of our aviation \nstructure were used to attack the American people directly.\n  This is only a partial list of some of the significant achievements \nthat resulted from that legislation that I am convinced improved our \nNation's intelligence capability and the security of the American \npeople at home. But we know from ongoing congressional oversight, from \nthe work of the members of the 9/11 Commission who continued to be \nfocused on our homeland security, and from common sense, that there is \nmore to be done. Senator Reid made adoption of this 9/11 implementation \nlegislation a priority for this Congress.\n\n  At a hearing in January that I was privileged to call as the new \nchairman of our committee, Homeland Security, 9/11 Commissioners and \nfamily members of 9/11 victims urged us to go forward and finish the \njob that we started with the 2004 legislation: to implement parts of \nthe report that were unimplemented by that legislation and to go back \nand look at some things that were not quite working right or were not \nfully implemented and see if we could do a better job to close some of \nthe gaps that we left after 2004.\n  Some of the important Commission recommendations we included in the \nSenate legislation in 2004 were taken out or diluted in conference. \nOther provisions that Congress did enact have unfortunately been \nimplemented poorly.\n  How important is it that we go ahead with this legislation to finish \nthe job we started after the 9/11 Commission report? Let me quote from \nthe 9/11 Report:\n\n       The men and women of the World War II generation rose to \n     the challenges of the 1940s and 1950s. They restructured the \n     government so it could protect the country.\n       That is now the job of the generation that experienced 9/\n     11. Those attacks showed emphatically, that ways of doing \n     business rooted in a different era are just not good enough. \n     Americans should not settle for incremental, ad hoc, \n     adjustments to a system designed generations ago for a world \n     that no longer exists.\n\n  This bill that we will begin considering in the Senate tomorrow \ncontinues the process of securing our Nation in this new era where our \nenemies don't wear the uniforms of soldiers or follow any traditional \nlaws of combat but, rather, move silently among us, probing for \nweaknesses while plotting attacks on innocent civilians.\n  This bill will strengthen our ability to respond to not just \nterrorist attacks but also preparing our Federal, State, and local \ngovernments to better respond to natural disasters. We are trying to \ncreate an attitude in this bill, an ``all hazards'' attitude that \nincreases our homeland security against the threat of terrorist attack, \nbut also, in doing so, prepares our Government to respond better to \nnatural disasters--of course, thinking now of the extent to which our \nGovernment at all levels showed that it was incapable of responding \nadequately during Hurricane Katrina.\n  Let me now discuss some of the important provisions in the bill. The \nfirst I want to talk about is information sharing. The 9/11 Report \nshowed us that the different agencies had different pieces of \ninformation that should have aroused suspicion about the attack that \ncame on 9/11, but because those pieces were never pulled together, \nthere was no way to assemble that monstrous mosaic and to see the full \npicture it created so as to be able to stop it. One of the most \nimportant innovations since 9/11 is the establishment of fusion centers \nto share information within and between States. This legislation would \nimprove the crucial sharing of intelligence and information both within \nthe Federal Government and with State, local, and tribal governments, \nas well as creating standards for those State, local, and regional \nfusion centers that will be tied to the allocation of homeland security \ngrants.\n  While preserving the authority of State and local governments over \nfusion centers, this legislation, S. 4, requires DHS, the Department of \nHomeland Security, to provide essential elements of support and \ncoordination to the centers. It authorizes the assignment of homeland \nsecurity intelligence analysts to the centers to lend their expertise \nand to serve as a channel for information to and from the Federal \nGovernment. It also creates a program for State, local, and tribal \nofficials to spend time at the Department of Homeland Security's Office \nof Intelligence and Analysis to learn about its intelligence \ninformation sharing functions and to serve as a link to the State and \nlocal governments.\n  This legislation also will strengthen the information sharing \nenvironment which we created in the 2004 legislation. It will enhance \nthe authority of the Program Manager for that environment by allowing \nthe issuance of Government-wide standards whereby all\n\n[[Page S2250]]\n\nagencies of the Federal Government would be required to operate under \nthe same rules and guidelines and would not be permitted to conceal \ninformation.\n  The legislation, S. 4, would encourage the elimination of principles \nsuch as ``need to know'' which allow the holder of information in a \ngiven Federal agency to control its dissemination to other governmental \nagencies and, thus, act as a bureaucratic barrier to effective \ninformation sharing. We, instead, aim to encourage, through this \nlegislation, the development of a ``need to share information'' culture \nin which information is made available--with appropriate safeguards, of \ncourse--to all who could make use of it in the war against terror.\n  Let me go now to homeland security grants. This legislation will \nenhance homeland security grants to State and local governments and \nfirst responders. We simply have underfunded this critical element of \nhomeland security. The first responders, first preventers, need more \nhelp to better protect their constituents, those who live in the areas \nthey serve, from potential terrorist attacks and natural disasters.\n  Our proposal, S. 4, would authorize over $3.5 billion for each of the \nnext 3 years for key grant programs. It turns around a precipitous \ndecline in funding for homeland security. It provides for a \ncomprehensive system of both terrorism-oriented and all-hazards grants. \nIt will ensure that grants primarily intended to bolster prevention of \nand preparedness for terrorist attacks will be distributed \noverwhelmingly based on the risk to an area from a terrorist attack.\n  Our committee believes we have achieved a balanced proposal that \ngives most of the money out based on risk but still recognizes there is \nrisk in this new post-9/11 age everywhere and that in an all-hazards \napproach, first responders everywhere need to be assisted to protect \ntheir citizens not just from a potential terrorist attack but from the \nconsequences of a natural disaster.\n  Interoperable communications: We have known for decades we needed to \nimprove communications operability and interoperability at the \ndifferent levels of Government. Yet tragically the inability of fire \nand police to communicate with one another at the World Trade Center \nafter the attacks of 9/11 cost lives. That is a painful fact. Hurricane \nKatrina showed us once again how important it is to have communications \nthat can both survive the initial disaster and have the capabilities to \nallow different first responding agencies to talk to each other by \nsharing voice as well as data communications.\n  Under this grant program, States would be required to demonstrate \nthat the grants they are applying for and receive would be used in a \nway that is consistent with their statewide communications \ninteroperability plans and the National Emergency Communications Plan. \nIn other words, this is not going to be just ad hoc proposals from \nevery first responder for some money to use as he or she desires for \ntheir vision of interoperability. It has to be part of a statewide plan \nconnected to the national plan.\n  The States receiving the money would be required to pass at least 80 \npercent of the total amount of the grants they receive on to local and \ntribal governments. The legislation authorizes $400 million for \ninteroperability improvements--lifesaving, in my opinion--in 2008; $500 \nmillion in 2009; $600 million in 2010; $800 million in 2011; and $1 \nbillion in 2012.\n  Let me go on to terrorist travel. The legislation contains provisions \nto improve our ability to disrupt terrorists' travel and infiltration \nof the United States, which the 9/11 Commission said was just as \nimportant as crippling their financial networks. That certainly makes \nsense.\n  It requires the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of \nState to implement security enhancements to the so-called visa waiver \nprogram. It also is increasingly clear that serious vulnerabilities \nexist within the visa waiver program. There are enhancements to the \nprogram that, if adopted in this bill, will close many of those \nvulnerabilities, including mandating improved reporting by foreign \ncountries on the visa waiver program of lost or stolen passports, \nrequiring countries to share information about prospective visitors who \nmay pose a threat to the U.S., and authorizing an electronic travel \nauthorization system which would require travelers to apply in advance \nfor authorization to visit America, thus allowing their names to be \nchecked against terrorist watch lists well before they board airplanes.\n  I note Senator Collins is on the floor of the Senate, our ranking \nmember. I am going to yield to her in a few minutes. But she has \nconsiderably strengthened this section of the bill to protect America \nfrom people with the intent to harm us through acts of terrorism using \nthis visa waiver program.\n  Next, privacy and civil liberties: This legislation also makes \nimportant steps forward to ensure that as we fight terrorism, we do not \ntrample on the rights of Americans we are pledged to defend. The \nlegislation includes provisions very similar to those included in the \nSenate-passed version of the Terrorism Prevention Act with regard to \nthe Privacy and Civil Liberties Board.\n  I now move on to biosurveillance. The legislation enhances sharing of \ncritical information by authorizing and improving upon an existing \neffort within the Department of Homeland Security to establish a \nNational Biosurveillance Integration Center.\n  Next, private sector preparedness: The 9/11 Commission found that the \nprivate sector remains largely unprepared and that ignoring private \nsector preparedness could come at a huge cost because so much \ninfrastructure, so many targets of terrorists are in private hands. To \naddress this critical problem, S. 4 will promote private sector \npreparedness, without a mandate, by creating a voluntary certification \nprogram that will allow private sector entities to become certified as \nbeing in compliance with recommended national preparedness standards. \nThis is an important step forward and will quite sensibly promote, for \ninstance, evacuation plans and steps beyond that.\n  The legislation also strengthens private sector preparedness by \nrequiring that the Department of Homeland Security establish and report \non a list of critical infrastructure across the Nation that would cause \ncatastrophic damage if disrupted, or destroyed. This will strengthen \nand clarify what is a murky process right now and will focus our \nattention on protecting those parts of critical infrastructure.\n  Our legislation also improves upon the existing National Strategy for \nTransportation Security by ensuring that risk-based priorities \nidentified by the Department are based on the risk assessments \nconducted by the Department.\n\n  The legislation also requires the President and Congress to publicly \ndisclose the total amounts of appropriations requested, authorized, and \nultimately appropriated for the American intelligence community. This \nresponds directly to a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission and will \nimprove Congress's ability to oversee the conduct and progress of our \nintelligence agencies creating standards of accountability.\n  I stress, this is the bottom line of the budget: to give Members of \nCongress and the American people an idea of how much we are investing \nin intelligence to protect their security and give us some sense of the \naccountability that we should apply to the intelligence community in \ndelivering that funding.\n  TSA screeners: This will be debated at some length, I am sure. The \nlegislation includes a provision which I was pleased to cosponsor with \nthe occupant of the Chair, Senator McCaskill from Missouri, which will \nensure that screeners at the Transportation Security Administration--\nwith whom we have become very familiar as we come and go from \nairports--have the same employment rights as others in TSA and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. There is no good reason to deny these \nrights to these people. We are only applying to them the same rights as \nother people within TSA and others in law enforcement in the Department \nof Homeland Security have, with no negative effect on their performance \nof those responsibilities.\n  Madam President, as you can see, this is a very comprehensive bill. I \nhave not touched on many parts of it in this statement. I have tried to \nfocus on the most important. What I am convinced of is that if this \nbill passes and\n\n[[Page S2251]]\n\nbecomes law, the American people will be safer from both terrorism and \nthe consequences of natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, than \nthey are today.\n  All of the hard work of the committee members, including particularly \nmy ranking member, Senator Collins, gives me some sense of confidence, \nalong with the work done by our staffs on both sides of the aisle, that \nthis bill really will achieve the goals the 9/11 Commission stated in \ntheir report and the hopes that the families of those who were lost on \n9/11 have that we act in a way on their behalf and on behalf of all the \nAmerican people to be able to say we have done everything possible to \nmake sure no other Americans suffer the tragic pain and continuing loss \nthat these American heroes suffered when their loved ones' lives were \nended in the brutal terrorist attacks of 9/11.\n  I have a sense of urgency about this bill. I believe every day we do \nnot do some of the things this bill would enable and establish and \nsupport financially is another day in which we are not as secure at \nhome as we should be. This is the carrying out of the first \nconstitutional responsibility we have to ensure domestic tranquility \nand provide for the common defense, to do so in a way that those who \nwrote the Constitution could never have dreamed we would have to do. \nBut that is the world we live in today. That is the reality we must \nface. This is the action we must summon and carry out together to \ndispatch our responsibility.\n  Madam President, in the preface to the 9/11 Report, Chairman Kean and \nVice Chairman Hamilton wrote:\n\n       We hope our report will encourage our fellow citizens to \n     study, reflect--and act.\n\n  Well, we have studied and we have reflected. Now is the time, once \nagain, to act to build a safer and more secure America for the \ngenerations to come.\n  I look forward to a good, spirited debate. I hope when we are done, \nthe bill will be even stronger than it is today. We will start \ntomorrow. I urge my colleagues to come to the floor, even this \nafternoon, to file amendments because Senator Collins and I would like, \nwhen we move to this bill tomorrow morning--having carried out our \nmanagers' responsibility to make opening statements--to move right to \nthe amendments.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I think Senator Collins was called from the Senate floor momentarily, \nbut I know she will be back before I yield.\n  Madam President, the consent request I am about to propound has been \ncleared on both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following morning business on Wednesday, \nFebruary 28, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. \n57, S. 4, the 9/11 Commission recommendations legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, on behalf of the leader, I am happy \nto announce there will be no further rollcall votes today. I know \nSenator Collins will return soon and make her opening statement on the \nbill.\n  I thank the Chair very much, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to support S. 4, the Improving \nAmerica's Security Act of 2007. This legislation would strengthen our \nhomeland security and would do so in the spirit that shaped the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  As my colleague and friend Senator Lieberman has already indicated, \nthe Committee on Homeland Security voted unanimously on February 15 to \nreport this bill. The bill before us is the product of careful \ncollaboration among members of our committee; State, local, and tribal \ngovernments; emergency response providers; the private sector; the \nAdministration, particularly the Department of Homeland Security; and \nother stakeholders. This collaboration has produced legislation that \nbuilds on the work of the Homeland Security Committee over the last 3 \nyears. During that time, the committee has produced numerous bills \nimplementing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and otherwise \nstrengthening our homeland security. This bill helps to complete the \npicture.\n  The vast majority of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations were \nenacted in 2004 as part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act. There were, however, some recommendations that did not \nmake it through the process or were not incorporated into that bill, \nand those are reflected in the legislation before us.\n  The Intelligence Reform Act was a bipartisan effort by the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, and it made possible the most significant reforms \nin the structure and operations of our intelligence community in more \nthan 50 years--in fact, since the CIA was created after World War II. \nIndeed, approximately 39 of the 9/11 Commission's 41 recommendations \nhave been acted on in one form or another. More recently, Congress \npassed measures that greatly strengthen the protections for America's \ncargo ports and its chemical facilities--again addressing \nvulnerabilities highlighted in the Commission's report and by other \nexperts on terrorism. So during the past 3 years, in fact, a great deal \nhas been done to help make our Nation more secure and to improve our \ndefenses and capacity to respond to terrorism attacks.\n  The Homeland Security Committee also conducted a comprehensive, \nbipartisan investigation of the Federal, State, and local preparation \nfor and response to Hurricane Katrina, our country's first real test of \nits homeland security apparatus since the attacks on September 11 of \n2001. Our investigation found significant failures in emergency \nplanning, preparation, and response at all levels of government. As a \nresult, we issued a comprehensive report that summarized our \ninvestigation. Our investigation included 24 public hearings, \ninterviews of more than 400 people, and the review of literally \nhundreds of thousands of investigations. It also included the issuance \nof subpoenas because we wanted to make sure we had access to all the \ninformation we needed. As a result of this investigation, the committee \nissued a detailed report and drafted legislation based on those \nrecommendations. That legislation was incorporated into the Homeland \nSecurity appropriations bill which the President signed into law last \nyear.\n  The FEMA Reform Act built upon the 9/11 Commission recommendations \nalready enacted by reforming the structure of FEMA, enhancing its \nregional role throughout the country, and giving FEMA a primary place \nwithin the Federal Government for planning, training, and exercising \nwith State and local officials.\n  As reported by the Homeland Security Committee then, S. 4 builds upon \nour past successes. The legislation before the Senate would authorize a \ncomprehensive homeland security grant program. It includes four vital \ngrant programs to assist State, local, and tribal governments in \nsafeguarding our lives and properties in all catastrophes, whether \nnatural or manmade. Taken together, these four grant programs--the \nUrban Area Security Initiative, the State Homeland Security Grant \nProgram, the Emergency Management Performance Grant Program, and the \nEmergency Communications and Interoperability Grant Program--will \nensure significant and predictable Federal funding for our State and \nlocal partners.\n  The program will support error-prevention activities such as fusion \ncenters, all-hazards planning, training exercises, and the installation \nof reliable interoperable emergency communications systems. The bill \nwill help to strengthen emergency preparedness and response. It also \nstrikes the right balance between targeting funding to jurisdictions \nthe Department determines to be at the highest risk and ensuring a \nbaseline of adequate funding for prevention and preparedness across the \ncountry because we know that our Nation's homeland security is only as \nstrong as its weakest link.\n  Let me comment in more detail on these programs. With respect to the \nUrban Area Security Initiative, also known as UASI, the bill retains \nthe current practice directing the Secretary of Homeland Security to \naward\n\n[[Page S2252]]\n\ngrants based solely on risk of terrorist attacks. Clearly, our largest \nurban areas present attractive, high-value targets to terrorists. Our \nlegislation, the Lieberman-Collins legislation, recognizes that fact, \nbut it makes one sensible change. The Department's eligibility criteria \nfor UASI grant applications has been, to say the least, arbitrary and \ncontroversial. For that reason, our bill would expand the potential \npool of applicants beyond the current limit of 45. Instead of requiring \nthe Department to select which cities are eligible to apply, S. 4 would \nexpressly permit the largest 100 metropolitan areas to make their case \nfor funding.\n  Unfortunately, terrorist attacks do not respect city limits. A major \nattack could affect--or at least require--responses from many \nneighboring or regional jurisdictions. We also know that when we take a \nmore regional approach, we have a more effective response. Our bill \nraises funding for the State Homeland Security Grant Program to $913 \nmillion from the $525 million appropriated in fiscal year 2007. This \nfunding increase would also correct a serious deficiency in the \nproposed budget for fiscal year 2008. Unfortunately, the administration \nis calling for only $250 million for this important program. As with \nthe UASI grants, each State would receive funding on the basis of risk \nbut with a minimum award of 0.45 percent of the program funds. This \nwill, once again, ensure a baseline level of preparedness and response \nactivities across the country.\n\n  Hurricane Katrina illustrated that many of the actions required to \nrespond to terrorist attacks are identical to those required for \nnatural disasters. That is precisely why S. 4 would expand the \nemergency management performance grants. The EMPG has been a vital part \nof our national preparedness for years. Our bill seeks to increase its \nstature and importance by providing more funding and by authorizing \nStates to use EMPG funds to construct and enhance emergency operation \ncenters. The EMPG emphasizes all-hazards preparation, and the .75 \npercent minimum allocation and the population-based distribution of the \nremainder ensures that every State will receive assistance with \nplanning, training, and exercises for vital functions such as \nevacuation, logistics, continuity of operations of government, and \nrecovery. Those are skills which all States need to develop. Those are \nminimal levels of preparedness and response essential for every State. \nEvery State has the potential for either a natural disaster or a \nterrorist attack or some other catastrophe or emergency. That is why it \nis important we develop that capacity in every State.\n  It is important for me to emphasize that S. 4 does not change EMPG's \nallocation formula; it merely codifies existing practice. The EMPG is \nbasic insurance. As the DHS manual for the program observes:\n\n       An all hazards approach to preparedness, including the \n     development of a comprehensive program of planning, training, \n     and exercises, encourages an effective and consistent \n     response to any threatened or actual disaster or emergency \n     regardless of the cause.\n\n  This view is consistent with the expert testimony before the Homeland \nSecurity Committee during our investigation of the failed response to \nHurricane Katrina.\n  Now, some people have suggested that guaranteeing minimum funding for \nState and local preparedness is just another example of pork barrel \npolitics. These people could not be more mistaken. As the Rand \nCorporation noted in a 2004 report on the preparedness of State and \nlocal law enforcement after the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001:\n\n       Homeland security experts and first responders have \n     cautioned against an overemphasis on improving the \n     preparedness of large cities to the exclusion of smaller \n     communities or rural areas.\n\n  Again, I make the point that we need to bring up all areas to a \ncertain baseline level of preparedness. That doesn't mean we don't \nfactor in risk; we do. Indeed, the majority of the funds in this bill \nwould be allocated based on risk, and we provide more risk-based \nfunding than is the case in current law.\n  The RAND report went on to recognize that much of our Nation's \ninfrastructure and potential high-value targets are located in rural \nareas. We also cannot assume a precise calculation of risk. A Federal \nbuilding in Oklahoma City was not an obvious target for a terrorist \nbombing. Yet, we know a tragic attack occurred in that city. Rural \nflight schools were not obvious training grounds for hijackers, nor was \nthe Portland, ME, jetport an obvious departure point for terrorist \npilots as they began their journey of death and destruction on \nSeptember 11.\n  My point is that terrorists can shelter, train, recruit, prepare, or \nattack in unlikely places. In view of this cold reality, our bill \nrequires that at least 25 percent of the funding from the UASI and \nState homeland security grant programs--that is at least $548 million--\nbe used for terrorism prevention activities by law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Sometimes I think we forget the basic truth that if we can prevent a \nterrorist attack from happening in the first place, that is the best \npossible approach. We do need to be prepared to respond effectively, \nbut how much better if we can detect and interdict the attack before it \noccurs. We know from experience here, as well as in other countries, \nthat terrorists can be spotted and attacks intercepted by well-trained \nlocal police. The prevention of attacks through better policing must be \na focus of our grant programs. The last grant program our bill creates \nis an emergency communications and interoperability grants program. \nThese grants will help to close the alarming and persistent gaps in our \nfirst responders' ability to simply communicate with one another. As \nthe tragic events of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina demonstrated, this is \noften not the case.\n  Before the second tower of the World Trade Center collapsed on 9/11, \nthe police received a radio message to evacuate, but, tragically, the \nfirefighters never received that message because they used different \nradios and an incompatible frequency. The result was even more loss of \nlives. In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the first \nresponders resorted to the use of runners to carry messages by hand \nfrom one command center to another because the communications \ninfrastructure was so badly damaged. Well, the events of the magnitude \nof 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina, fortunately, do not occur every day. \nThere are daily incidents, such as fires, rescues, and hazardous \nmaterial spills that require different agencies and different \njurisdictions to communicate with one another in real time and on \ndemand. This is precisely why the emergency communications grants \nprogram is so important.\n  I will tell you it was very disturbing to hear, during our \ninvestigation of Hurricane Katrina, the same kinds of interoperability \nproblems that occurred during 9/11. This is a problem we simply must \nsolve.\n  Let me comment on some other important features of the bill. It \nimproves protection against terrorists traveling to our country under \nthe visa waiver program by requiring more timely notice from \nparticipating countries of lost or stolen passports. It also requires \nthose countries to share more information about travelers who could \npose a threat to our security. The bill improves information sharing, \nestablishes multijurisdiction fusion centers in order to encourage \ninformation to be shared, and allows the assignment of DHS intelligence \nanalysts to those centers. The bill expands upon a requirement in the \nHomeland Security Act by requiring DHS to create a prioritized list of \ncritical infrastructure and highest risks for terrorist attacks and \nother disasters. This list will help protect these critical assets from \nattacks and enable more effective response when disaster strikes.\n  The bill also requires that risk assessments be completed for each \nsector of the economy. Recognizing the need to exercise good \nstewardship of our taxpayers' money, our bill also includes strong \nprotections against waste, fraud, and abuse. By now, we have all heard \nthe disturbing stories of misspent homeland security grants. In fact, \nwhen I was chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, we held \nhearings looking at how homeland security grants have been spent in \nsome States. Along with Senator Lieberman, I asked the GAO to do an \ninvestigation into this area, and GAO testified before our committee. \nAt a time when the needs are so great for equipment, for training, and \nfor more preparedness to strengthen our homeland security, it was very \ndisturbing to\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\nhear the GAO testify that money had been wasted.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples. In the District of Columbia--\nyes, right here in Washington, DC, surely a high-risk area, an area \nattacked on \n9/11--we found that leather jackets were purchased for the local police \nusing homeland security grant money. In Newark, NJ, homeland security \nfunds were used to purchase air-conditioned garbage trucks. This is \ntotally inexcusable, when we have such great needs for new \ncommunications equipment, for training and exercises, and for help for \nour first responders. We simply cannot afford to have money frittered \naway. It is outrageous.\n  Our bill would help to eliminate those abuses. It would strictly \nprohibit the use of grant funds on items that don't relate to securing \nour homeland. It requires States to have an approved plan and for funds \nto be allocated, distributed, and spent according to that plan, and to \nachieve certain baseline preparedness goals. It requires DHS to set \nminimum performance standards for agency grants, and it provides for \naudits to ensure accountability.\n  I know that last safeguard is near and dear to the Presiding \nOfficer's heart and that she understands, perhaps better than anyone in \nthis body, the importance of regular, thorough, and timely audits.\n  Madam President, I acknowledge the work of Senator Coburn, and many \nother members of our committee, to strengthen the provisions of our \nbill. I offered an amendment to make sure that homeland security funds \nwere not used for social or recreational purposes. In short, I think we \nhave tightened up the safeguards and put new measures in to ensure \naccountability.\n  I mentioned earlier that our bill proceeds in the spirit of the 9/11 \nCommission; its provisions for increased and more effective information \nsharing, for strengthening the privacy and civil liberties oversight \nboard, and for disclosing the total sums requested, authorized, and \nappropriated for intelligence programs all testified to that amendment.\n  There are many provisions of the bill reported by the Homeland \nSecurity Committee that will improve our security in other ways. I want \nto note once again, however, that this bill is not a sudden, new, or \nunusual manifestation of congressional determination to strengthen our \nsecurity. The bill before us today continues the work of Congress in \ntaking proper notice of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations. I am \nproud to be part of the bipartisan deliberations that shaped this bill, \nand I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  I want to also acknowledge the tireless efforts of the families of \nthe victims of 9/11. They have worked with Senator Lieberman and me \nevery step of the way when we were drafting the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorist Prevention Act in 2004. They were our inspiration and they \nkept us going. They ensured that the bill got through to the \nPresident's desk and signed into law. They have continued to work with \nus on the bill before us today. I want to publicly thank them for their \neffort. They inspired our work.\n  Our legislation's broad-front attack on the threats we face will \nensure good value for every dollar our Nation spends to improve our \ndefenses at the Federal and State and local levels. It will provide \nappropriate transparency and accountability into the Government's \nsecurity decisions, and it will strike an appropriate balance between \nincreased security and our cherished civil liberties. The passage of \nthis bill will benefit every American.\n  Let me close by saying I am certain this bill will be improved even \nfurther as we proceed with the deliberations this week. I do not \nsupport every single provision in this bill. But on balance, it is yet \nanother step forward as we seek to protect the American people.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar).

Mr. President, in accordance with rule XXVI(2) of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate, I ask that the Rules of Procedure of the \nSelect Committee on Ethics, which were adopted February 23, 1978, and \nrevised November 1999, be printed in the Congressional Record for the \n110th Congress. The committee rules for the 110th Congress are \nidentical to the rules adopted by the committee for the 109th Congress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                RULES OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n                       Part I: Organic Authority\n\n\n                   SUBPART A--S. RES. 338 AS AMENDED\n\n       Resolved, That (a) there is hereby established a permanent \n     select committee of the Senate to be known as the Select \n     Committee on Ethics (referred to hereinafter as the ``Select \n     Committee'') consisting of six Members of the Senate, of whom \n     three shall be selected from members of the majority party \n     and three shall be selected from members of the minority \n     party. Members thereof shall be appointed by the Senate in \n     accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 1 of rule XXIV of \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate at the beginning of each \n     Congress. For purposes of paragraph 4 of rule XXV of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate, service of a Senator as a \n     member or chairman of the Select Committee shall not be taken \n     into account.\n       (b) Vacancies in the membership of the Select Committee \n     shall not affect the authority of the remaining members to \n     execute the functions of the committee, and shall be filled \n     in the same manner as original appointments thereto are made.\n       (c) (1) A majority of the members of the Select Committee \n     shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business \n     involving complaints or allegations of, or information about, \n     misconduct, including resulting preliminary inquiries, \n     adjudicatory reviews, recommendations or reports, and matters \n     relating to Senate Resolution 400, agreed to May 19, 1976.\n       (2) Three members shall constitute a quorum for the \n     transaction of routine business of the Select Committee not \n     covered by the first paragraph of this subparagraph, \n     including requests for opinions and interpretations \n     concerning the Code of Official Conduct or any other statute \n     or regulation under the jurisdiction of the Select Committee, \n     if one member of the quorum is a member of the majority Party \n     and one member of the quorum is a member of the minority \n     Party. During the transaction of routine business any member \n     of the Select Committee constituting the quorum shall have \n     the right to postpone further discussion of a pending matter \n     until such time as a majority of the members of the Select \n     Committee are present.\n       (3) The Select Committee may fix a lesser number as a \n     quorum for the purpose of taking sworn testimony.\n       (d)(1) A member of the Select Committee shall be ineligible \n     to participate in--\n       (A) any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review relating \n     to--\n       (i) the conduct of--\n       (I) such member;\n       (II) any officer or employee the member supervises; or\n       (III) any employee of any officer the member supervises; or\n       (ii) any complaint filed by the member; and\n       (B) the determinations and recommendations of the Select \n     Committee with respect to any preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review described in subparagraph (A).\n       For purposes of this paragraph, a member of the Select \n     Committee and an officer of the Senate shall be deemed to \n     supervise any officer or employee consistent with the \n     provision of paragraph 12 of rule XXXVII of the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate.\n       (2) A member of the Select Committee may, at the discretion \n     of the member, disqualify himself or herself from \n     participating in any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory \n     review pending before the Select Committee and the \n     determinations and recommendations of the Select Committee \n     with respect to any such preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory \n     review. Notice of such disqualification shall be given in \n     writing to the President of the Senate.\n       (3) Whenever any member of the Select Committee is \n     ineligible under paragraph (1) to participate in any \n     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review or disqualifies \n     himself or herself under paragraph (2) from participating in \n     any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review, another \n     Senator shall, subject to the provisions of subsection (d), \n     be appointed to serve as a member of the Select Committee \n     solely for purposes of such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review and the determinations and \n     recommendations of the Select Committee with respect to such \n     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review. Any Member of the \n     Senate appointed for such purposes shall be of the same party \n     as the Member who is ineligible or disqualifies himself or \n     herself.\n       Sec. 2. (a) It shall be the duty of the Select Committee \n     to--\n       (1) receive complaints and investigate allegations of \n     improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate, \n     violations of law, violations of the Senate Code of Official \n     Conduct and violations of rules and regulations of the \n     Senate, relating to the conduct of individuals in the \n     performance of their duties as Members of the Senate, or as \n     officers or employees of the Senate, and to make appropriate \n     findings of fact and conclusions with respect thereto;\n       (2)(A) recommend to the Senate by report or resolution by a \n     majority vote of the full committee disciplinary action to be \n     taken with respect to such violations which the Select \n     Committee shall determine, after according to the individual \n     concerned due notice and opportunity for a hearing, to have \n     occurred;\n       (B) pursuant to subparagraph (A) recommend discipline, \n     including--\n       (i) in the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate \n     for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, \n     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the \n     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a \n     combination of these; and\n       (ii) in the case of an officer or employee, dismissal, \n     suspension, payment of restitution, or a combination of \n     these;\n       (3) subject to the provisions of subsection (e), by a \n     unanimous vote of 6 members, order that a Member, officer, or \n     employee be reprimanded or pay restitution, or both, if the \n     Select Committee determines, after according to the Member, \n     officer, or employee due notice and opportunity for a \n     hearing, that misconduct occurred warranting discipline less \n     serious than discipline by the full Senate;\n       (4) in the circumstances described in subsection (d)(3), \n     issue a public or private letter of admonition to a Member, \n     officer, or employee, which shall not be subject to appeal to \n     the Senate;\n       (5) recommend to the Senate, by report or resolution, such \n     additional rules or regulations as the Select Committee shall \n     determine to be necessary or desirable to insure proper \n     standards of conduct by Members of the Senate, and by \n     officers or employees of the Senate, in the performance of \n     their duties and the discharge of their responsibilities;\n       (6) by a majority vote of the full committee, report \n     violations of any law, including the provision of false \n     information to the Select Committee, to the proper Federal \n     and State authorities; and\n       (7) develop and implement programs and materials designed \n     to educate Members, officers, and employees about the laws, \n     rules, regulations, and standards of conduct applicable to \n     such individuals in the performance of their duties.\n       (b) For the purposes of this resolution--\n       (1) the term ``sworn complaint'' means a written statement \n     of facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the \n     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of \n     law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule \n     or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     individuals in the performance of their duties as\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\n     Members, officers, or employees of the Senate;\n       (2) the term ``preliminary inquiry'' means a proceeding \n     undertaken by the Select Committee following the receipt of a \n     complaint or allegation of, or information about, misconduct \n     by a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate to determine \n     whether there is substantial credible evidence which provides \n     substantial cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has \n     occurred; and\n       (3) the term ``adjudicatory review'' means a proceeding \n     undertaken by the Select Committee after a finding, on the \n     basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Select Committee to conclude that a violation within the \n     jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred.\n       (c)(1) No--\n       (A) adjudicatory review of conduct of a Member or officer \n     of the Senate may be conducted;\n       (B) report, resolution, or recommendation relating to such \n     an adjudicatory review of conduct may be made; and\n       (C) letter of admonition pursuant to subsection (d)(3) may \n     be issued, unless approved by the affirmative recorded vote \n     of no fewer than 4 members of the Select Committee.\n       (2) No other resolution, report, recommendation, \n     interpretative ruling, or advisory opinion may be made \n     without an affirmative vote of a majority of the Members of \n     the Select Committee voting.\n       (d)(1) When the Select Committee receives a sworn complaint \n     or other allegation or information about a Member, officer, \n     or employee of the Senate, it shall promptly conduct a \n     preliminary inquiry into matters raised by that complaint, \n     allegation, or information. The preliminary inquiry shall be \n     of duration and scope necessary to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Select Committee to conclude that a violation \n     within the jurisdiction of the Select Committee has occurred. \n     The Select Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice \n     chairman the discretion to determine the appropriate \n     duration, scope, and conduct of a preliminary inquiry.\n       (2) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under \n     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines by a recorded \n     vote that there is not such substantial credible evidence, \n     the Select Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Select \n     Committee may delegate to the chairman and vice chairman the \n     authority, on behalf of the Select Committee, to dismiss any \n     matter that they determine, after a preliminary inquiry, \n     lacks substantial merit. The Select Committee shall inform \n     the individual who provided to the Select Committee the \n     complaint, allegation, or information, and the individual who \n     is the subject of the complaint, allegation, or information, \n     of the dismissal, together with an explanation of the basis \n     for the dismissal.\n       (3) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under \n     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that a \n     violation is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de \n     minimis nature, the Select Committee may dispose of the \n     matter by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, \n     which shall not be considered discipline. The Select \n     Committee may issue a public letter of admonition upon a \n     similar determination at the conclusion of an adjudicatory \n     review.\n       (4) If, as a result of a preliminary inquiry under \n     paragraph (1), the Select Committee determines that there is \n     such substantial credible evidence and the matter cannot be \n     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (3), the Select \n     Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review. \n     Upon the conclusion of such adjudicatory review, the Select \n     Committee shall report to the Senate, as soon as practicable, \n     the results of such adjudicatory review, together with its \n     recommendations (if any) pursuant to subsection (a)(2).\n       (e)(1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or \n     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection (a)(3) \n     may, within 30 days of the Select Committee's report to the \n     Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of \n     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing \n     written notice of the basis for the appeal to the Select \n     Committee and the presiding officer of the Senate. The \n     presiding officer of the Senate shall cause the notice of the \n     appeal to be printed in the Congressional Record and the \n     Senate Journal.\n       (2) A motion to proceed to consideration of an appeal \n     pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be highly privileged and not \n     debatable. If the motion to proceed to consideration of the \n     appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall be decided on the basis \n     of the Select Committee's report to the Senate. Debate on the \n     appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, which shall be divided \n     equally between, and controlled by, those favoring and those \n     opposing the appeal.\n       (f) The Select Committee may, in its discretion, employ \n     hearing examiners to hear testimony and make findings of fact \n     and/or recommendations to the Select Committee concerning the \n     disposition of complaints.\n       (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no \n     adjudicatory review shall be initiated of any alleged \n     violation of any law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, \n     rule, or regulation which was not in effect at the time the \n     alleged violation occurred.

Whenever the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman is authorized to make any \n     determination, then the determination may be released at his \n     or her discretion. Each member of the Committee shall be \n     given a reasonable opportunity to have separate views \n     included as part of any Committee report. (See Rule 8 on \n     Procedures for Handling Committee Sensitive and Classified \n     Materials.)\n       (k) Ineligibility or Disqualification of Members and \n     Staff.--\n       (1) A member of the Committee shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that relates \n     specifically to any of the following:\n       (A) a preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review relating \n     to (i) the conduct of (I) such member; (II) any officer or \n     employee the member supervises; or (ii) any complaint filed \n     by the member; and\n       (B) the determinations and recommendations of the Committee \n     with respect to any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory \n     review described in subparagraph (A).\n       For purposes of this paragraph, a member of the committee \n     and an officer of the Senate shall be deemed to supervise any \n     officer or employee consistent with the provision of \n     paragraph 12 of rule XXXVII of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.\n       (2) If any Committee proceeding appears to relate to a \n     member of the Committee in a manner described in subparagraph \n     (1) of this paragraph, the staff shall prepare a report to \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If either the Chairman or the \n     Vice Chairman concludes from the report that it appears that \n     the member may be ineligible, the member shall be notified in \n     writing of the nature of the particular proceeding and the \n     reason that it appears that the member may be ineligible to \n     participate in it. If the member agrees that he or she is \n     ineligible, the member shall so notify the Chairman or Vice \n     Chairman. If the member believes that he or she is not \n     ineligible, he or she may explain the reasons to the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, and if they both agree that the member is \n     not ineligible, the member shall continue to serve. But if \n     either the Chairman or Vice Chairman continues to believe \n     that the member is ineligible, while the member believes that \n     he or she is not ineligible, the matter shall be promptly \n     referred to the Committee. The member shall present his or \n     her arguments to the Committee in executive session. Any \n     contested questions concerning a member's eligibility shall \n     be decided by a majority vote of the Committee, meeting in \n     executive session, with the member in question not \n     participating.\n       (3) A member of the Committee may, at the discretion of the \n     member, disqualify himself or herself from participating in \n     any preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review pending before \n     the Committee and the determinations and recommendations of \n     the Committee with respect to any such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review.\n       (4) Whenever any member of the Committee is ineligible \n     under paragraph (1) to participate in any preliminary inquiry \n     or adjudicatory review, or disqualifies himself or herself \n     under paragraph (3) from participating in any preliminary \n     inquiry or adjudicatory review, another Senator shall be \n     appointed by the Senate to serve as a member of the Committee \n     solely for purposes of such preliminary inquiry or \n     adjudicatory review and the determinations and \n     recommendations of the Committee with respect to such \n     preliminary inquiry or adjudicatory review. Any member of the \n     Senate appointed for such purposes shall be of the same party \n     as the member who is ineligible or disqualifies himself or \n     herself.\n       (5) The President of the Senate shall be given written \n     notice of the ineligibility or\n\n[[Page S2259]]\n\n     disqualification of any member from any preliminary inquiry, \n     adjudicatory review, or other proceeding requiring the \n     appointment of another member in accordance with subparagraph \n     (k)(4).\n       (6) A member of the Committee staff shall be ineligible to \n     participate in any Committee proceeding that the staff \n     director or outside counsel determines relates specifically \n     to any of the following:\n       (A) the staff member's own conduct;\n       (B) the conduct of any employee that the staff member \n     supervises;\n       (C) the conduct of any member, officer or employee for whom \n     the staff member has worked for any substantial period; or\n       (D) a complaint, sworn or unsworn, that was filed by the \n     staff member. At the direction or with the consent of the \n     staff director or outside counsel, a staff member may also be \n     disqualified from participating in a Committee proceeding in \n     other circumstances not listed above.\n       (l) Recorded Votes.--Any member may require a recorded vote \n     on any matter.\n       (m) Proxies; Recording Votes of Absent Members.--\n       (1) Proxy voting shall not be allowed when the question \n     before the Committee is the initiation or continuation of a \n     preliminary inquiry or an adjudicatory review, or the \n     issuance of a report or recommendation related thereto \n     concerning a Member or officer of the Senate. In any such \n     case an absent member's vote may be announced solely for the \n     purpose of recording the member's position and such announced \n     votes shall not be counted for or against the motion.\n       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph \n     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held \n     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the \n     absent Committee member has been informed of the matter on \n     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested of the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.\n       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered \n     to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.\n       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of \n     establishing a quorum.\n       (n) Approval of Blind Trusts and Foreign Travel Requests \n     Between Sessions and During Extended Recesses.--During any \n     period in which the Senate stands in adjournment between \n     sessions of the Congress or stands in a recess scheduled to \n     extend beyond fourteen days, the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     or their designees, acting jointly, are authorized to approve \n     or disapprove blind trusts under the provision of rule XXXIV.\n       (o) Committee Use of Services or Employees of Other \n     Agencies and Departments.--With the prior consent of the \n     department or agency involved, the Committee may (1) utilize \n     the services, information, or facilities of any such \n     department or agency of the Government, and (2) employ on a \n     reimbursable basis or otherwise the services of such \n     personnel of any such department or agency as it deems \n     advisable. With the consent of any other committee of the \n     Senate, or any subcommittee, the Committee may utilize the \n     facilities and the services of the staff of such other \n     committee or subcommittee whenever the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly, determine that \n     such action is necessary and appropriate.\n\n\n     RULE 2: PROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS, ALLEGATIONS, OR INFORMATION\n\n       (a) Complaint, Allegation, or Information.--Any member or \n     staff member of the Committee shall report to the Committee, \n     and any other person may report to the Committee, a sworn \n     complaint or other allegation or information, alleging that \n     any Senator, or officer, or employee of the Senate has \n     violated a law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any \n     rule or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     any individual in the performance of his or her duty as a \n     Member, officer, or employee of the Senate, or has engaged in \n     improper conduct which may reflect upon the Senate. Such \n     complaints or allegations or information may be reported to \n     the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a Committee member, or a \n     Committee staff member.\n       (b) Source of Complaint, Allegation, or Information.--\n     Complaints, allegations, and information to be reported to \n     the Committee may be obtained from a variety of sources, \n     including but not limited to the following:\n       (1) sworn complaints, defined as a written statement of \n     facts, submitted under penalty of perjury, within the \n     personal knowledge of the complainant alleging a violation of \n     law, the Senate Code of Official Conduct, or any other rule \n     or regulation of the Senate relating to the conduct of \n     individuals in the performance of their duties as members, \n     officers, or employees of the Senate;\n       (2) anonymous or informal complaints;\n       (3) information developed during a study or inquiry by the \n     Committee or other committees or subcommittees of the Senate, \n     including information obtained in connection with legislative \n     or general oversight hearings;\n       (4) information reported by the news media; or\n       (5) information obtained from any individual, agency or \n     department of the executive branch of the Federal Government.\n       (c) Form and Content of Complaints.--A complaint need not \n     be sworn nor must it be in any particular form to receive \n     Committee consideration, but the preferred complaint will:\n       (1) state, whenever possible, the name, address, and \n     telephone number of the party filing the complaint;\n       (2) provide the name of each member, officer or employee of \n     the Senate who is specifically alleged to have engaged in \n     improper conduct or committed a violation;\n       (3) state the nature of the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation;\n       (4) supply all documents in the possession of the party \n     filing the complaint relevant to or in support of his or her \n     allegations as an attachment to the complaint.\n\n\n        rule 3: procedures for conducting a preliminary inquiry\n\n       (a) Definition of Preliminary Inquiry.--A ``preliminary \n     inquiry'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee \n     following the receipt of a complaint or allegation of, or \n     information about, misconduct by a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.\n       (b) Basis for Preliminary Inquiry.--The Committee shall \n     promptly commence a preliminary inquiry whenever it has \n     received a sworn complaint, or other allegation of, or \n     information about, alleged misconduct or violations pursuant \n     to Rule 2.\n       (c) Scope of Preliminary Inquiry.--\n       (1) The preliminary inquiry shall be of such duration and \n     scope as is necessary to determine whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, on behalf of the Committee \n     may supervise and determine the appropriate duration, scope, \n     and conduct of a preliminary inquiry. Whether a preliminary \n     inquiry is conducted jointly by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman or by the Committee as a whole, the day to day \n     supervision of a preliminary inquiry rests with the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) A preliminary inquiry may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, or subpoenas \n     deemed appropriate to obtain information upon which to make \n     any determination provided for by this Rule.\n       (d) Opportunity for Response.--A preliminary inquiry may \n     include an opportunity for any known respondent or his or her \n     designated representative to present either a written or oral \n     statement, or to respond orally to questions from the \n     Committee. Such an oral statement or answers shall be \n     transcribed and signed by the person providing the statement \n     or answers.\n       (e) Status Reports.--The Committee staff or outside counsel \n     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The \n     reports shall be confidential.\n       (f) Final Report.--When the preliminary inquiry is \n     completed, the staff or outside counsel shall make a \n     confidential report, oral or written, to the Committee on \n     findings and recommendations, as appropriate.\n       (g) Committee Action.--As soon as practicable following \n     submission of the report on the preliminary inquiry, the \n     Committee shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee \n     may make any of the following determinations:\n       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such \n     substantial credible evidence and, in such case, the \n     Committee shall dismiss the matter. The Committee, or \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly on behalf of the \n     Committee, may dismiss any matter which, after a preliminary \n     inquiry, is determined to lack substantial merit. The \n     Committee shall inform the complainant of the dismissal.\n       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation \n     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis \n     nature. In such case, the Committee may dispose of the matter \n     by issuing a public or private letter of admonition, which \n     shall not be considered discipline and which shall not be \n     subject to appeal to the Senate. The issuance of a letter of \n     admonition must be approved by the affirmative recorded vote \n     of no fewer than four members of the Committee voting.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence and that the matter cannot be \n     appropriately disposed of under paragraph (2). In such case, \n     the Committee shall promptly initiate an adjudicatory review \n     in accordance with Rule 4. No adjudicatory review of conduct \n     of a Member, officer, or employee of the Senate may be \n     initiated except by the affirmative recorded vote of not less \n     than four members of the Committee.\n\n\n        rule 4: procedures for conducting an adjudicatory review\n\n       (a) Definition of Adjudicatory Review.--An ``adjudicatory \n     review'' is a proceeding undertaken by the Committee after a \n     finding, on the basis of a preliminary inquiry, that there is \n     substantial cause for the Committee to conclude that a \n     violation within the jurisdiction of the Committee has \n     occurred.\n       (b) Scope of Adjudicatory Review.--When the Committee \n     decides to conduct an adjudicatory review, it shall be of \n     such duration and scope as is necessary for the Committee to \n     determine whether a violation within its\n\n[[Page S2260]]\n\n     jurisdiction has occurred. An adjudicatory review shall be \n     conducted by outside counsel as authorized by section 3(b)(1) \n     of Senate Resolution 338 unless the Committee determines not \n     to use outside counsel. In the course of the adjudicatory \n     review, designated outside counsel, or if the Committee \n     determines not to use outside counsel, the Committee or its \n     staff, may conduct any inquiries or interviews, take sworn \n     statements, use compulsory process as described in Rule 6, or \n     take any other actions that the Committee deems appropriate \n     to secure the evidence necessary to make a determination.\n       (c) Notice to Respondent.--The Committee shall give written \n     notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an \n     adjudicatory review. The notice shall be sent to the \n     respondent no later than five working days after the \n     Committee has voted to conduct an adjudicatory review. The \n     notice shall include a statement of the nature of the \n     possible violation, and description of the evidence \n     indicating that a possible violation occurred. The Committee \n     may offer the respondent an opportunity to present a \n     statement, orally or in writing, or to respond to questions \n     from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, or \n     outside counsel.\n       (d) Right to a Hearing.--The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand (not \n     requiring discipline by the full Senate).\n       (e) Progress Reports to Committee.--The Committee staff or \n     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee \n     concerning the progress of the adjudicatory review. Such \n     reports shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and \n     shall be confidential.\n       (f) Final Report of Adjudicatory Review to Committee.--Upon \n     completion of an adjudicatory review, including any hearings \n     held pursuant to Rule 5, the outside counsel or the staff \n     shall submit a confidential written report to the Committee, \n     which shall detail the factual findings of the adjudicatory \n     review and which may recommend disciplinary action, if \n     appropriate. Findings of fact of the adjudicatory review \n     shall be detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary \n     action is recommended.\n       (g) Committee Action.--\n       (1) As soon as practicable following submission of the \n     report of the staff or outside counsel on the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee shall prepare and submit a report to \n     the Senate, including a recommendation or proposed resolution \n     to the Senate concerning disciplinary action, if appropriate. \n     A report shall be issued, stating in detail the Committee's \n     findings of fact, whether or not disciplinary action is \n     recommended. The report shall also explain fully the \n     reasons underlying the Committee's recommendation \n     concerning disciplinary action, if any. No adjudicatory \n     review of conduct of a Member, officer or employee of the \n     Senate may be conducted, or report or resolution or \n     recommendation relating to such an adjudicatory review of \n     conduct may be made, except by the affirmative recorded \n     vote of not less than four members of the Committee.\n       (2) Pursuant to S. Res. 338, as amended, section 2 (a), \n     subsections (2), (3), and (4), after receipt of the report \n     prescribed by paragraph (f) of this rule, the Committee may \n     make any of the following recommendations for disciplinary \n     action or issue an order for reprimand or restitution, as \n     follows:\n       (i) In the case of a Member, a recommendation to the Senate \n     for expulsion, censure, payment of restitution, \n     recommendation to a Member's party conference regarding the \n     Member's seniority or positions of responsibility, or a \n     combination of these;\n       (ii) In the case of an officer or employee, a \n     recommendation to the Senate of dismissal, suspension, \n     payment of restitution, or a combination of these;\n       (iii) In the case where the Committee determines, after \n     according to the Member, officer, or employee due notice and \n     opportunity for a hearing, that misconduct occurred \n     warranting discipline less serious than discipline by the \n     full Senate, and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) \n     of this rule relating to appeal, by a unanimous vote of six \n     members order that a Member, officer or employee be \n     reprimanded or pay restitution or both;\n       (iv) In the case where the Committee determines that \n     misconduct is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de \n     minimis nature, issue a public or private letter of \n     admonition to a Member, officer or employee, which shall not \n     be subject to appeal to the Senate.\n       (3) In the case where the Committee determines, upon \n     consideration of all the evidence, that the facts do not \n     warrant a finding that there is substantial credible evidence \n     which provides substantial cause for the Committee to \n     conclude that a violation within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee has occurred, the Committee may dismiss the matter.\n       (4) Promptly, after the conclusion of the adjudicatory \n     review, the Committee's report and recommendation, if any, \n     shall be forwarded to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy \n     shall be provided to the complainant and the respondent. The \n     full report and recommendation, if any, shall be printed and \n     made public, unless the Committee determines by the recorded \n     vote of not less than four members of the Committee that it \n     should remain confidential.\n       (h) Right of Appeal.--\n       (1) Any individual who is the subject of a reprimand or \n     order of restitution, or both, pursuant to subsection \n     (g)(2)(iii), may, within 30 days of the Committee's report to \n     the Senate of its action imposing a reprimand or order of \n     restitution, or both, appeal to the Senate by providing \n     written notice of the appeal to the Committee and the \n     presiding officer of the Senate. The presiding officer shall \n     cause the notice of the appeal to be printed in the \n     Congressional Record and the Senate Journal.\n       (2) S. Res. 338 provides that a motion to proceed to \n     consideration of an appeal pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be \n     highly privileged and not debatable. If the motion to proceed \n     to consideration of the appeal is agreed to, the appeal shall \n     be decided on the basis of the Committee's report to the \n     Senate. Debate on the appeal shall be limited to 10 hours, \n     which shall be divided equally between, and controlled by, \n     those favoring and those opposing the appeal.\n\n\n                    rule 5: procedures for hearings\n\n       (a) Right to Hearing.--The Committee may hold a public or \n     executive hearing in any preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory \n     review, or other proceeding. The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate or \n     before it imposes an order of restitution or reprimand. (See \n     Rule 4(d).)\n       (b) Non-Public Hearings.--The Committee may at any time \n     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) \n     of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to \n     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive \n     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for \n     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall \n     so notify the Committee at least five days before he or she \n     is scheduled to testify.\n       (c) Adjudicatory Hearings.--The Committee may, by the \n     recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee, \n     designate any public or executive hearing as an adjudicatory \n     hearing; and any hearing which is concerned with possible \n     disciplinary action against a respondent or respondents \n     designated by the Committee shall be an adjudicatory hearing. \n     In any adjudicatory hearing, the procedures described in \n     paragraph (j) shall apply.\n       (d) Subpoena Power.--The Committee may require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses \n     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, \n     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule \n     6.)\n       (e) Notice of Hearings.--The Committee shall make public an \n     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any \n     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).\n       (f) Presiding Officer.--The Chairman shall preside over the \n     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice \n     Chairman is also absent, a Committee member designated by the \n     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is \n     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the \n     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee \n     member.\n       (g) Witnesses.--\n       (1) A subpoena or other request to testify shall be served \n     on a witness sufficiently in advance of his or her scheduled \n     appearance to allow the witness a reasonable period of time, \n     as determined by the Committee, to prepare for the hearing \n     and to employ counsel if desired.\n       (2) The Committee may, by recorded vote of not less than \n     four members of the Committee, rule that no member of the \n     Committee or staff or outside counsel shall make public the \n     name of any witness subpoenaed by the Committee before the \n     date of that witness's scheduled appearance, except as \n     specifically authorized by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly.\n       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Committee at least two working \n     days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to \n     be presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine \n     whether such statements may be read or placed in the record \n     of the hearing.\n       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted \n     to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she \n     desires to do so.\n       (h) Right to Testify.--Any person whose name is mentioned \n     or who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in \n     testimony or in statements made by a Committee member, staff \n     member or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably \n     believes that the statement tends to adversely affect his or \n     her reputation may--\n       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf; or\n       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she \n     complained. Such request and such statement shall be \n     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.\n       (i) Conduct of Witnesses and Other Attendees.--The \n     Presiding Officer may punish any breaches of order and \n     decorum by censure and exclusion from the hearings. The \n     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate \n     that the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (j) Adjudicatory Hearing Procedures.--\n       (1) Notice of Hearings. A copy of the public announcement \n     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall \n     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to\n\n[[Page S2261]]\n\n     all witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or \n     otherwise summoned to testify.\n       (2) Preparation for Adjudicatory Hearings.--\n       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the \n     following information and documents to the respondent, if \n     any:\n       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the \n     hearing;\n       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as \n     exhibits at the hearing; and\n       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony \n     expected to be given by each witness to be called at the \n     hearing.\n       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall \n     provide the information and documents described in divisions \n     (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.\n       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and \n     documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be \n     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and \n     disclosure.\n       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and \n     documents to the Committee (see (A) and (B) of this \n     subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual \n     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the \n     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that \n     the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (3) Swearing of Witnesses.--All witnesses who testify at \n     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding \n     Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have \n     to be sworn.\n       (4) Right to Counsel.--Any witness at an adjudicatory \n     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own \n     choosing, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his \n     or her legal rights during the testimony.\n       (5) Right To Cross-Examine and Call Witnesses.--\n       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent and any other \n     person who obtains the permission of the Committee, may \n     personally or through counsel cross-examine witnesses called \n     by the Committee and may call witnesses in his or her own \n     behalf.\n       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the \n     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the \n     production of documents on his or her behalf. An application \n     shall be approved upon a concise showing by the respondent \n     that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant and \n     appropriate, as determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman.\n       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or \n     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such \n     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the \n     witness or by that party's counsel.\n       (D) At least one working day before a witness's scheduled \n     appearance, a witness or a witness's counsel may submit to \n     the Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that \n     witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary, \n     such questions may be asked by any member of the Committee, \n     or by any Committee staff member if directed by a Committee \n     member. The witness or witness's counsel may also submit \n     additional sworn testimony for the record within twenty-four \n     hours after the last day that the witness has testified. The \n     insertion of such testimony in that day's record is subject \n     to the approval of the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting \n     jointly within five days after the testimony is received.\n       (6) Admissibility of Evidence.--\n       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the \n     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall \n     be admissible unless privileged under the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly, \n     but the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly \n     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight \n     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.\n       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of \n     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to \n     the Committee. Such rulings shall be final unless reversed or \n     modified by a recorded vote of not less than four members of \n     the Committee before the recess of that day's hearings.\n       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter \n     before the Committee involving allegations of sexual \n     discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual \n     misconduct, by a Member, officer, or employee within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided \n     by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal \n     Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit \n     evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only \n     upon a determination of not less than four members of the \n     full Committee that the interests of justice require that \n     such evidence be admitted.\n       (7) Supplementary Hearing Procedures.--The Committee may \n     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems \n     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory \n     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be \n     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made \n     available upon request to any member of the public.\n       (k) Transcripts.--\n       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall \n     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any member of \n     the Committee, Committee staff member, outside counsel \n     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of \n     the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own \n     remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any \n     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter \n     declines to make the requested corrections, the member, staff \n     member, outside counsel or witness may request a ruling by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. Any member or \n     witness shall return the transcript with suggested \n     corrections to the Committee offices within five working days \n     after receipt of the transcript, or as soon thereafter as is \n     practicable. If the testimony was given in executive session, \n     the member or witness may only inspect the transcript at a \n     location determined by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly. Any questions arising with respect to the processing \n     and correction of transcripts shall be decided by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to \n     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is \n     practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the \n     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the corrections \n     of a member or witness if they determine that such member or \n     witness has been afforded a reasonable time to correct such \n     transcript and such transcript has not been returned within \n     such time.\n       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, \n     one transcript copy of that witness's testimony given at a \n     public hearing. If the testimony was given in executive \n     session, then a transcript copy shall be provided upon \n     request, subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions \n     prescribed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any \n     individual violates such conditions and restrictions, the \n     Committee may recommend by majority vote that he or she be \n     cited for contempt of Congress.\n\n\n                   Rule 6: Subpoenas and Depositions\n\n       (a) Subpoenas.--\n       (1) Authorization for Issuance.--Subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses at depositions or \n     hearings, and subpoenas for the production of documents and \n     tangible things at depositions, hearings, or other times and \n     places designated therein, may be authorized for issuance by \n     either (A) a majority vote of the Committee, or (B) the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, at any time \n     during a preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review, or other \n     proceeding.\n       (2) Signature and Service.--All subpoenas shall be signed \n     by the Chairman or the Vice Chairman and may be served by any \n     person eighteen years of age or older, who is designated by \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman. Each subpoena shall be served \n     with a copy of the Rules of the Committee and a brief \n     statement of the purpose of the Committee's proceeding.\n       (3) Withdrawal of Subpoena.--The Committee, by recorded \n     vote of not less than four members of the Committee, may \n     withdraw any subpoena authorized for issuance by it or \n     authorized for issuance by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, may withdraw any subpoena authorized for issuance by \n     them.\n       (b) Depositions.--\n       (1) Persons Authorized To Take Depositions.--Depositions \n     may be taken by any member of the Committee designated by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or by any other \n     person designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, including outside counsel, Committee staff, other \n     employees of the Senate, or government employees detailed to \n     the Committee.\n       (2) Deposition Notices.--Notices for the taking of \n     depositions shall be authorized by the Committee, or the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman, or a Committee staff member or \n     outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. Depositions may be taken at any time during a \n     preliminary inquiry, adjudicatory review or other proceeding. \n     Deposition notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition shall \n     be in private, and the testimony taken and documents produced \n     shall be deemed for the purpose of these rules to have been \n     received in a closed or executive session of the Committee. \n     The Committee shall not initiate procedures leading to \n     criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a witness's \n     failure to appear, or to testify, or to produce documents, \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a subpoena \n     authorized for issuance by the Committee, or the Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) Counsel at Depositions.--Witnesses may be accompanied \n     at a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.\n       (4) Deposition Procedure.--Witnesses at depositions shall \n     be examined upon oath administered by an individual \n     authorized by law to administer oaths, or administered by any \n     member of the Committee if one is present. Questions may be \n     propounded by any person or persons who are authorized to \n     take depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a \n     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a \n     document, any member of the Committee who is present may rule \n     on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct \n     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. \n     If no member of the Committee is present, the individual who \n     has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, to take the deposition may proceed\n\n[[Page S2262]]\n\n     with the deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent \n     time, seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the \n     objection from the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the \n     Committee, who may refer the matter to the Committee or rule \n     on the objection. If the Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the \n     Committee upon referral, overrules the objection, the \n     Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the Committee as the case may be, \n     may direct the witness to answer the question or produce the \n     document. The Committee shall not initiate procedures leading \n     to civil or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses \n     to testify or produce documents after having been directed to \n     do so.\n       (5) Filing of Depositions.--Deposition testimony shall be \n     transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is \n     transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall \n     certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in \n     his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that \n     the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The \n     transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the \n     chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be \n     furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices \n     for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     a witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to \n     correct errors in transcription. The witness may also bring \n     to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness's testimony by submitting a sworn statement about \n     those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     may rule on the witness's request, and the changes or \n     attachments allowed shall be certified by the Committee's \n     chief clerk. If the witness fails to make any request under \n     this paragraph within the time limit set, this fact shall be \n     noted by the Committee's chief clerk. Any person authorized \n     by the Committee may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure.\n\n\n   Rule 7: Violations of Law; Perjury; Legislative Recommendations; \n   Educational Mandate; and Applicable Rules and Standards of Conduct\n\n       (a) Violations of Law.--Whenever the Committee determines \n     by the recorded vote of not less than four members of the \n     full Committee that there is reason to believe that a \n     violation of law, including the provision of false \n     information to the Committee, may have occurred, it shall \n     report such possible violation to the proper Federal and \n     state authorities.\n       (b) Perjury.--Any person who knowingly and willfully swears \n     falsely to a sworn complaint or any other sworn statement to \n     the Committee does so under penalty of perjury. The Committee \n     may refer any such case to the Attorney General for \n     prosecution.\n       (c) Legislative Recommendations.--The Committee shall \n     recommend to the Senate by report or resolution such \n     additional rules, regulations, or other legislative measures \n     as it determines to be necessary or desirable to ensure \n     proper standards of conduct by Members, officers, or \n     employees of the Senate.

Fiscus\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on the life and \nservice of Army SGT Keith E. Fiscus. Keith epitomized the best of our \ncountry's brave men and women who fought to free Iraq and to secure a \nnew democracy in the Middle East. He exhibited unwavering courage, \ndutiful service to his country, and above all else, honor. In the way \nhe lived his life--and how we remember him--Keith reminds each of us \njust how good we can be.\n  Keith was born to Pamela and Darrell Fiscus in Glendale, CA, in 1980. \nHis family moved to Townsend, DE, in 1998. He was the second oldest of \nfour children and is survived by an 18-year-old brother, Jordan, and \ntwo sisters, Korrie, 16, and Dena, 28. My heart goes out to each of \nthem.\n  Keith finished his senior year at Glasgow High School in Newark, DE, \nand graduated in 1998. After his graduation, Keith took a job in the \nproduce department at Genuardi's supermarket in Glasgow, DE, and then \nworked as a customer service representative for a major credit card \ncompany. He enrolled in business classes at Delaware Technical & \nCommunity College but soon decided that his interests didn't include \nsitting behind a desk in an office or classroom.\n  Inspired by his grandparents' service in the Armed Forces, Keith \njoined the Army in 2002. After graduating from boot camp, he was \nassigned to the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, \n25th Infantry Division based out of Schofield Barracks in Hawaii. He \nwas deployed to Iraq and served with distinction for the duration of \nhis 14-month tour.\n  While serving in Iraq, Keith decided to reenlist in the Army. After \nreturning to the States, Keith received training on how to identify and \ndisarm explosives. Keith volunteered to serve a second tour of duty in \nIraq and was deployed again in August of 2006. He was scheduled to \nreturn home in February of 2007.\n  On December 2, 2006, Keith was serving as a machine gunner for an \nexplosive ordinance disposal team on their way to clear a suspected \nroadside bomb near the city of Taji. An improvised explosive device was \ntriggered near the humvee he was riding in, and Sergeant Fiscus was \nkilled instantly.\n  Contrary to his tough-looking tattoos and love of heavy metal music, \nKeith was a fun-loving, caring, and sensitive young man. He was \ndescribed by those that knew him as a hopeless romantic who loved the \ncamaraderie of the Army and spending time with family and friends. He \nwas also an avid golfer and fisherman.\n  Sergeant Fiscus was also an excellent soldier. He was an expert \nrifleman who received numerous recognitions during his Army career: \nArmy Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraq Campaign \nMedal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, \nOverseas Service Ribbon, and Combat Infantryman Badge. The Purple Heart \nand the Bronze Star were awarded posthumously.\n  I rise today to commemorate Keith, to celebrate his life, and to \noffer his family our support and our deepest sympathy on their tragic \nloss.\n\n\n                        Specialist Travis Vaughn\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I would like to honor SPC Travis \nVaughn, who died on February 18, 2007, in a helicopter crash while \nfighting in Afghanistan. A Cedar Falls, IA, native, Travis served \nproudly and with distinction during Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  With bravery and valor, Travis accepted the call to defend America \nagainst those who seek to undermine our values, our democracy, and our \nway of life. In Afghanistan, he and others from the 160th Special \nOperations Aviation Regiment out of Fort Campbell, KY, served their \ncountry in a dangerous part of the world, helping to make the rest of \nthe world a safer place. Sadly, Travis's service to his country cost \nhim his life, forever earning him the gratitude of the American people.\n  Travis is remembered fondly and will be greatly missed. A longtime \nfriend of Travis recently said of him, ``He was always there to help \nanybody that he could and do whatever he could to make people happy.'' \nStill other friends recalled Travis's fondness for adventurous \nrecreational activities. These qualities made Travis well-suited for \nmilitary service, and certainly we were fortunate to have a man of such \ndrive and ability serving in the U.S. Army.\n  On behalf of all Iowans and people throughout this country, I offer \nmy heartfelt condolences to Travis Vaughn's friends and family. In \nparticular, my thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Heather, his \nstepson Taylin, his father Brad, and mother Christine. They should know \nthat the entire Nation stands behind them during this time of mourning. \nHis loss is\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\nindeed tragic, but he will be remembered as a hero and a patriot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2266-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            STOLEN VALOR ACT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to comment today on the \nStolen Valor Act of 2005 that was signed into law by President Bush on \nDecember 20, 2006. I am extremely proud of authoring the Senate version \nof this legislation that ultimately became law. The new law that has \nresulted from the Stolen Valor Act strengthens and expands the \nprotections for our Armed Forces military service awards and \ndecorations.\n  Since the Stolen Valor Act was signed into law, there have been \nreports of concerns raised by medal collectors, historians, museums, \nfamily members that inherit medals, and persons legitimately \npossessing, shipping, or selling military service awards and \ndecorations. I would like to make it clear for the Record that the \nintent and effect of my legislation and the resulting law is only to \nprovide the tools law enforcement need to prosecute those fraudulently \nusing military service awards they did not earn through service to our \nArmed Forces. It does not in any way restrict legitimate possession, \nuse, shipment, or display of these awards and decorations.\n  Before the law was enacted, my legislation was reviewed by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, the House Judiciary Committee, the Department of \nJustice, and the Congressional Research Service's American Law \nDivision. All concluded that the Stolen Valor legislation does not \nnegatively impact those legitimately in possession of military service \nawards and decorations.\n  Although the new law modifies title 18 USC, section 704, it does not \nimpact the legitimate purchase, sale, or possession of medals. The key \npart of this passage is the phrase, ``except when authorized under \nregulations made pursuant to law.'' That exception refers to 32 Code of \nFederal Regulations (CFR), section 507. I believe the concerns raised \nby collectors and dealers of military medals and memorabilia may stem \nfrom lack of familiarity with the CFR and its relationship to statutory \nlaw. The CFR is the regulation that implements and administers \nstatutory provisions, in this case, the provisions of 18 USC section \n704 as amended by the Stolen Valor Act.\n  The CFR specifically states in section 507.12(b), ``Mere possession \nby a person of any of the articles prescribed in Sec. 507.8 of this \npart is authorized provided that such possession is not used to defraud \nor misrepresent the identification or status of the individuals \nconcerned.'' According to numerous legal experts consulted on the \ndrafting of the Stolen Valor legislation, ``mere possession'' would \ninclude family members who inherit medals, museums, collectors, \napproved medals dealers, historians, and other persons in possession or \nselling medals that do not use them for fraudulent purposes. In \naddition, CFR Sec. 507.8(a) indicates, ``the articles listed in \nparagraphs (a) (1) through (10) of this section are authorized for \nmanufacture and sale when made in accordance with approved \nspecifications, purchase descriptions or drawings.''\n  The articles listed as authorized for manufacture and sale in Sec. \n507.8(a) include decorations, service medals, ribbons, lapel buttons, \nand badges with the exception of the Medal of Honor. The CFR allows for \nthe sale of all U.S. medals, except the Medal of Honor, and insignia, \nprovided that an official government manufacturer has made them and \nthat the Institute of Heraldry, IOH, approved those pieces. Thus, the \nStolen Valor Act does not in any way stop collectors or dealers from \nselling or collecting officially made medals and insignia, whether they \nwere made yesterday or 50 years ago.\n  In closing, I again want to assure those legitimately in possession \nof selling, displaying, or shipping military service awards that the \nStolen Valor Act is only directed at those who fraudulently use \nmilitary service awards and decorations. I have been to Walter Reed \nHospital, Bethesda Naval Hospital, and have awarded numerous awards and \ndecorations to soldiers and veterans. These brave men and women have \ngiven so much to ensure our freedoms. I strongly believe protecting the \nmeaning and valor of military service awards is a very important way we \ncan continue to honor their service and sacrifice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a memo from the American Law Division at \nCongressional Research Service supporting this analysis be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2006.\n     To: Hon. Kent Conrad; Attention: Shawn Ferguson.\n     From: John R. Luckey, Legislative Attorney, American Law \n         Division.\n     Subject: The Stolen Valor Act of 2005.\n\n       This memorandum is furnished in response to your request \n     for a review of the impact of enactment of the Stolen Valor \n     Act of 2005 upon collectors of military service medals who \n     are currently acting in compliance with federal regulations. \n     The Bill would amend the federal criminal code expand the \n     prohibition against wearing, manufacturing, or selling \n     military decorations or medals without legal authorization to \n     prohibit purchasing, soliciting. mailing, shipping, \n     importing, exporting, producing blank certificates of receipt \n     for, advertising, trading, bartering, or exchanging such \n     decorations or medals without authorization. It would \n     prohibit falsely representing oneself as having been awarded \n     any decoration or medal authorized by Congress for the Armed \n     Forces or any of the service medals or badges. The penalties \n     for violations, if the offense involves a distinguished \n     service cross, an Air Force Cross, a Navy Cross, a silver \n     star, or a Purple Heart, would be increased.\n       The current provision of title 18 states:\n       ``Sec. 704. Military medals or decorations\n       ``(a) In General.--Whoever knowingly wears, manufactures, \n     or sells any decoration or medal authorized by Congress for \n     the aimed forces of the United States, or any of the service \n     medals or badges awarded to the members of such forces, or \n     the ribbon, button, or rosette of any such badge, decoration \n     or medal, or any colorable imitation thereof, except when \n     authorized under regulations made pursuant to law, shall be \n     fined under this title or imprisoned not more than six \n     months, or both.''\n       The Bill would not affect the exception for acts authorized \n     by regulation. Therefore, it appears accurate to conclude \n     that if the action of the collector was authorized by \n     regulation, the enactment of the Bill would not affect that \n     authorization.\n       We hope this information is responsive to your request. If \n     we may be of further assistance, please call.\n                                                   John R.

Mr. President, March is National Eye Donor Month, an \nopportunity to celebrate the gift of sight, to honor past donors and \ntheir families, and to raise public awareness regarding the importance \nof eye donation. We in the Senate can help ensure a sufficient supply \nof precious corneas by educating the public about the importance of eye \ndonation and encouraging more Americans to become organ donors.\n  Last year, more than 46,000 Americans had their lives renewed and \nreinvigorated through the miracle of corneal transplantation. This \nsurgical procedure gives those people who have lost, or are losing, \ntheir vision the life-changing gift of restored sight.\n  For more than 30 years, Teresa Walton, an Ohio resident, lived \nwithout depth perception and with the stigma of an altered appearance, \nbecause a viral infection stole the vision in her left eye. At the age \nof 15, while most other children were enjoying high school sports and \nanxiously awaiting the day they could earn their driver's license, \nTeresa was unable to recognize when someone approached her from the \nleft, nor could she easily navigate a set of stairs.\n  Finally, in her forties, Teresa decided it was time for a transplant. \nBecause of the transplant she received in Springfield, OH, the vision \nin Teresa's left eye was restored. With the return of her depth \nperception, Teresa can now easily light the candles on her three \ndaughters' birthday cakes. She is no longer self-conscious about the \nappearance of her left eye. And as a teacher, she can now recognize \nwhen one of her students is standing next to her.\n  Through the tireless efforts of the eye banks located throughout the \ncountry, and the coordinated efforts of the Eye Bank Association of \nAmerica, Teresa Walton and thousands upon thousands of Americans like \nher have rediscovered the many joys full vision affords.\n  The power of cornea transplantation is evident in Teresa's story, but \nit is\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\nonly possible if concerned Americans register as an organ donor and, \nsubsequently, inform their family members and loved ones of their \nintention to donate.\n  That is why, as National Eye Donation Month approaches, I encourage \nmy colleagues to work with their local eye banks, and the Eye Bank \nAssociation of America, to promote eye donation and provide more \npeople, like Teresa Walton, with the miracle cornea transplantation \nprovides. There is no gift more meaningful, or more profoundly \nimportant, than the gift of sight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2267-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO W. DON NELSON\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nbest wishes and appreciation to a staff member who is leaving my office \nafter many years of public service.\n  W. Don Nelson has served with distinction as my State director in \nLincoln, NE, since I was elected in 2000, which is no small job in a \nState that stretches 500 miles.\n  Although we share the same last name, we do not share a family \nrelationship. We do share a passion for public service. W. Don, as he \nis known throughout Nebraska, has a long history of bipartisan \ngovernment service at the highest levels.\n  Mr. Nelson worked for former Congressman Douglas Bereuter when he was \ndirector of the Nebraska State Office of Planning and Programming. He \nalso served as a chief policy adviser for former Nebraska Governors \nNorbert Tiemann, Jim Exon, and former Wyoming Governor Ed Herschler and \nwas chief of staff for Nebraska Governor Bob Kerrey. Before Don became \nmy State director he was in the private sector serving as managing \ndirector for the Nebraska office of a major national securities firm.\n  To say that W. Don Nelson was an important and vital part of the \nstaff for those of us whom he served is an understatement. His \nbackground as a lawyer and investment banker made him invaluable in \ngovernment service but his abilities stretched far beyond that.\n  W. Don Nelson is one of the most fiercely loyal and completely \ntrustworthy individuals I have ever had the privilege to know. His \nintellect and depth of knowledge on virtually any issue is uncanny. He \nhas the courage to confront adversaries at the highest levels and the \ncompassion to help those who are less fortunate. He is a gracious host \nand gentleman to friends, and a devoted father and husband to a loving \nfamily.\n  W. Don may be retiring but not to a rocking chair. The W. Don Nelson \nthat so many Nebraskans know will never sit back and rest on his \nlaurels. His so-called retirement will be in front of a computer screen \nand stalking the halls of government buildings visiting with elected \nand appointed officials from the other side of the desk, as a reporter.\n  After answering questions from reporters for much of his career, he \nwill be asking the questions. He is crossing over to start his own \nnewspaper, called Prairie Fire, in Lincoln, NE. Its objective is to be \nthe progressive voice of the Great Plains offering thoughtful, \nbipartisan public discourse about all matters relating to politics and \nthe arts and, I imagine, Don's passion, the environment.\n  All of us will miss Don, his quirky sense of humor, his vintage \nneckties, his sports cars, and even his outward display of pride in \nCornhusker Country for his alma maters, the University of Florida and \nFlorida State University.\n  We wish him every success in his new role as editor, publisher, and \nwriter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2267-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            BIG SKY HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE PROGRAM RECOGNITION\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am honored to speak to you today \nabout the wonderful work being done in a school in my home State--Big \nSky High School in Missoula, MT. Big Sky High School is a leader in \nscience education and a wonderful example of how creativity and \ninnovation can prepare students for the 21st century.\n  To the students, teachers, parents, and administrators at Big Sky \nHigh School, I commend you for your dedication and imagination. Big Sky \nHigh School should be an example to schools all over the country of \nwhat we can do if we make a real commitment to teaching our students \nthe skills necessary to keep America competitive in the global economy.\n  Big Sky's science programs emphasize real-world applications and \ncollaboration. For example, in the elective ``Advanced Problems in \nScience,'' students work on research projects and learn how to document \ntheir results and present them to the community. Many of these projects \nare featured in science fairs and other competitions, giving students \nexperience and connecting them to the scientific community.\n  Science teacher Jim Harkins, who has taught at Big Sky for 24 years, \nis an example of how a great teacher can inspire students to go into \nthe sciences. Let me tell you about Jim's goals for science class in \nhis own words. ``I try to tell the students that the classroom, text \nbook setting is not real science,'' he said. ``Science is not learned \nin books while sitting at desks. In this class, Advanced Problems in \nScience, our goal is to simulate their curiosity in a real-life science \nsetting. This program provides Montana students with competitiveness on \nnational and international levels.''\n  To see the success of this program, you need to look no further than \nthe students themselves. Big Sky alumnus Jayce Getz was an active \nparticipant in these science programs and he was recently honored with \none of only 30 mathematical sciences postdoctoral research fellowships \nfrom the National Science Foundation. Jayce will begin a professorship \nat Princeton next fall. Jayce attributes some of his current success to \nhis participation in Big Sky's science program. ``Kids in Missoula, \nMontana, can and do get involved with important research in the \nsciences,'' he said. ``The trick is to get started early on.''\n  Yet at Big Sky, kids do start early. The halls are filled with the \nfuture scientific leaders of America. Students study the genetic code \nof a cyanobacterial strain and test sail designs in wind tunnels by \nusing an innovative interdisciplinary approach.\n  By nurturing the curiosity and creativity of these students, Big Sky \nteachers like Jim Harkins ensure America's youth are given the \neducation and tools necessary to succeed in the 21st century. I applaud \nJim and his students. They are examples of what makes Montana's school \nsystem the best in the Nation.\n  To Mr. Harkins and students of Big Sky High School, I extend my \ncongratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2267-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2267-S2268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF RICK SHAPIRO\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Rick \nShapiro, who recently retired as executive director of the \nCongressional Management Foundation.\n  I became acquainted with Rick early in my Senate career, when I asked \nRick to help me and my staff strengthen the management of my Senate \noffice. That began a very useful relationship with Rick and CMF.\n  Under his leadership, CMF grew in size, scope, and impact. Rick has \nmade CMF an integral part of the early organization of nearly every new \nHouse and Senate office, through CMF's practical publications and its \nrole in new office orientations.\n  For many offices like mine, Rick used his skills in organizational \nmanagement to help members and their senior staff improve how they run \ntheir offices and serve their constituents. His confidential counsel \nand evaluation, and that of a strong staff that he recruited and \nsupported, has allowed many Senators and Members of Congress to focus \non their jobs as legislators, with the confidence that their offices \nwould be well run.\n  Rick also used his extensive knowledge of strategic planning to \nensure offices have a strategic vision and the means to deliver on that \nvision. He and his staff have facilitated hundreds of staff retreats, \nhelping House and Senate offices produce ambitious, but realistic, \nplans for their work.\n  Rick was the driving force behind CMF's research into cutting edge \ntopics. For example, CMF's research and guidance on the Internet and \nelectronic communications has been the single most important force in \nbringing many\n\n[[Page S2268]]\n\noffices into the 21st century in their use of new technology.\n  Before joining CMF, Rick worked in the U.S. House of Representatives, \nfirst as a staff investigator and later as the staff director of two \nHouse committees. He brought his significant knowledge of the workings \nof the Congress to CMF and it progressed under his leadership.\n  All of us who know him and have benefited from his work wish him \nwell, and look with interest to his next project.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2268-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING MIKE HALL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \npay tribute to the memory of Mike Hall, who sadly passed away this last \nFriday.\n  Mike was a longtime sportswriter, editor, and columnist with the \nAlbuquerque Journal. Though he was born in Muskogee, OK, and began his \ncareer writing in California, there is no doubt Mike was a great New \nMexican. Mike first came to New Mexico in 1983 to serve as sports \neditor at the Albuquerque Tribune, and in 1988 he joined the staff at \nthe Albuquerque Journal. In his 24 years of reporting in New Mexico, \nboth his readers and those he wrote about came to appreciate and \nrespect Mike for his knowledge and his humor. He will be truly missed \nby New Mexicans.\n  I would also like to offer my deepest condolences to Mike's family, \nhis wife Sondra and children Dionne, Jason, Michael, and Kathryn and \nhis six grandchildren.\n  I ask that an article from the Albuquerque Journal celebrating Mike's \nlife and career be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n             [From the Albuquerque Journal, Feb. 24, 2007]\n\n                    Journal Editor/Writer Dies at 61\n\n\n veteran of sports department lived in Abq. since '83; covered boxing, \n                           unm women's hoops\n\n                           (By Lloyd Jojola)\n\n       Mike Hall, a veteran New Mexico journalist who was best \n     known as a sports editor, writer and columnist, died early \n     Friday.\n       Most recently, Hall held the title of associate sports \n     editor at the Albuquerque Journal and covered Lobo women's \n     basketball.\n       UNM women's basketball coach Don Flanagan said Hall \n     established an ``excellent relationship'' between himself and \n     the players and staff.\n       ``Once he got the position of our beat reporter I knew that \n     it was going to help our program immensely just because of \n     his background, how well he was thought of,'' Flanagan said. \n     ``I thought throughout his time his intention was always very \n     positive With our program, and I appreciated the recognition \n     that he brought to the program.''\n       Flanagan said Hall did his homework. The coach was often \n     ``amazed'' Hall knew who the staff was recruiting without \n     being told.\n       Flanagan might not have always liked the stories that were \n     printed, he said, but Hall was still highly regarded.\n       ``I respected him as a reporter and as somebody that would \n     give us honest and fair coverage,'' he said.\n       Hall joined the Albuquerque Journal staff in 1988.\n       ``Mike Hall was a real pro,'' said Journal Editor Kent \n     Walz. ``He loved what he did, and it showed.\n       ``In nearly 20 years here, Mike was a good colleague and a \n     good friend. We'll, miss him.'' Hall died of pneumonia, his \n     family said. The 61-year-old Albuquerque resident had battled \n     lung cancer in recent years and had recovered.\n       A memorial service is scheduled for 10 a.m. Feb. 28 at \n     French Mortuary, 10500 Lomas NE.\n       Hall launched his newspaper career in the San Francisco Bay \n     Area as a sports reporter for the Berkeley Gazette, covering \n     such teams as the Oakland A's and the Oakland Raiders. He \n     then served as sports news editor at the Wichita Eagle-Beacon \n     before leaving in 1979 to become weekend editor and assistant \n     news editor at The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., \n     according to past news stories.\n       Hall was named sports editor at The Albuquerque Tribune in \n     1983 and also served as the evening newspaper's city editor \n     and as a columnist, before moving to the Albuquerque Journal \n     to become sports editor.\n       He became a Journal associate sports editor in 1996 and \n     focused his reporting on UNM women's basketball and boxing.\n       Local boxer Danny Romero said Hall had been writing about \n     him since he was a very young, unknown fighter.\n       Romero's skills in the ring helped, he said, but Hall's \n     ``the one who made me famous.''\n       While stories can sometimes generate contentious \n     relationships between reporters and their subjects, Romero \n     said respect was never lost for Hall.\n       ``You didn't always have to have your guard up. As an \n     athlete, you always have to watch out with you guys,'' the \n     fighter said, referring to newspaper reporters. ``With him, \n     you didn't. It was always open arms. He would let you speak \n     your mind and make you sound good.''\n       Born in Muskogee, Okla., in 1945, Hall was raised in \n     Wichita, Kan., and studied journalism at Wichita State \n     University, said Sondra Hall, his wife.\n       Hall played a lot of sports in his younger days, including \n     boxing as an amateur, added Kathryn Hall, his daughter.\n       ``He was never very good at it, he always told me, but he \n     liked it,'' she said.\n       Hall loved the crunch of sports reporting: the road trips, \n     the demanding game-time coverage, the interviews and simply \n     getting the story.\n       But ultimately, ``he liked to write,'' Kathryn Hall said.\n       ``I always thought he just liked to write (newspaper) \n     articles but it turned out he wrote a lot of stuff,'' she \n     said, referring to journals the family found. ``We were \n     reading a lot of it last night.''\n       ``He just wrote all the time.''\n       Hall's work., with his easygoing style, was recognized \n     multiple times by his peers.\n       Among his awards, in 1990 Hall received, along with now \n     Tribune Editor Phill Casaus, the best sports story award from \n     the Albuquerque Press Club for stories on the NCAA's \n     investigation surrounding a UNM track sprinter. The following \n     year, he picked up the top sports writing award from the New \n     Mexico Press Association for stories on athletic spending at \n     UNM. And in 1993, the press association again honored Hall \n     with a first-place award for two sports columns.\n       ``He was humorous and fun-loving,'' Kathryn Hall said, \n     ``and very strong and courageous.'' Hall was preceded in \n     death by his parents, Harold Rea Hall and Jewell Gray. His \n     survivors include his wife of 30 years, Sondra; children, \n     Dionne Mantaoni, Jason Hall, Michael Bolton and Kathryn Hall; \n     and six grandchildren.\n       Contributions can be made to St. Jude Children's Research \n     Hospital, 501 St. Jude Place, Memphis, Tenn., 38105.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2268-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING CONSUL SERGIO AGUILERA\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

By working closely with the Federal, State, and local \ngovernments, as well as schools, businesses, and community \norganizations, Consul Aguilera has ably represented the people of \nMexico and served the needs of the Mexican community in the Midwest.\n  In addition to his official duties, Consul Aguilera has given \ngenerously of his time in service to the Indianapolis community through \nwork with the Mexican Scholarship Fund and the Central Indiana \nCommunity Foundation. The Indianapolis community will continue to \nbenefit from Consul Aguilera's leadership as he seeks to expand his \ncharitable work in retirement.\n  I am especially pleased that Consul Aguilera and his wife Lori have \nchosen to remain in Indianapolis as they pursue new and exciting \nexperiences together.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to congratulate Consul Aguilera and \nwish him good health and success upon his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2268-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2268-S2269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARY BURKS\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Mary \nBurks, founder of the Alabama Conservancy, mother of the wilderness \nmovement, and champion of the Sipsey Wilderness in the Bankhead \nNational Forest.\n  Last week, Mary Burks passed away in Birmingham, at the age of 86.\n  Her passing is a loss, not just for Alabama or the conservation \nmovement, but for every person who has ever explored and enjoyed \nAlabama's vast wilderness. She helped protect those natural areas, and, \nwithout her, our children might not be as able to enjoy them as they do \ntoday.\n  Her lifelong struggle to protect and conserve sensitive lands \nprovides a record of accomplishment that deserves both recognition and \ncelebration.\n  John Randolph, author of a book titled The Battle for Alabama \nWilderness, described Mary Burks's passion for what she did. Randolph \nsays, ``If one believes in fate, then surely Mary Burks was fated to \nbecome the mother of Alabama wilderness preservation. Passionate, \ntough, and resilient, a lover of all things wild and natural . . .''\n\n[[Page S2269]]\n\n  Mary Burks did not simply sit and dream. She led a 6-year campaign in \nthe early 1970s to designate the Sipsey Wilderness area in the Bankhead \nNational Forest as wilderness. In doing so, she won the support of the \nentire Alabama congressional delegation.\n  That is not always an easy thing to do.\n  After the campaign, not only was the Sipsey Wilderness created, but \nthe Eastern Wilderness Area System was established when President \nGerald Ford signed the Eastern Wilderness Act. It is fair to assume \nthat this success would not have been achieved without Mary Burks' \ntireless efforts.\n  Today, Alabama is home to more than 41,000 acres of wilderness, \nincluding the Cheaha and Dugger Mountain Wilderness Areas. As you know, \nhundreds of thousands of acres have now been designated as wilderness \nin the Eastern United States.\n  All of these accomplishments have roots in Mary Burks's original push \nto preserve wilderness in Alabama.\n  Describing the importance of Mary's efforts and the organization that \nshe founded, the Alabama Conservancy, Floyd Haskell, former U.S. \nSenator from Colorado, stated ``If not for the Alabama Conservancy, \nthere would be no concept of Eastern Wilderness.''\n  There is a difference between thinking that things ought to be a \ncertain way, and actually making them so. Too often we are quick to do \nthe former, and slow to do the latter. But the protected resources in \nmy home State and others are larger in size, great in quantity, and \nmore secure in their protection because Mary Burks fought for them all \nher life. She left a lasting legacy in Alabama that will forever be \nfelt by all who care about wilderness and natural places.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2269-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AMERICAN HELLENIC EDUCATIONAL PROGRESSIVE ASSOCIATION\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I would like to offer my sincere \ncongratulations to the American Hellenic Educational Progressive \nAssociation, AHEPA, on their 85th anniversary this year. Since 1922, \nAHEPA has diligently served the Hellenic community and all Americans \nthrough a variety of programs and outreach endeavors.\n  Initially created to combat discrimination and hate, AHEPA's mission \nhas expanded during its distinguished history. As the largest and \noldest American-based, Greek heritage grassroots membership \norganization, AHEPA works to promote the Greek ideals of philanthropy, \neducation, civic responsibility, and family and individual excellence \nwithin the community. Such principles can be appreciated by people of \nall backgrounds, and I commend AHEPA for inspiring and supporting \ngenerations of Americans.\n  AHEPA's work has touched people from all walks of life. The \norganization raised funds for U.S. war bonds during World War II, and \ncurrently contributes more than $2,000,000 each year to educational, \nmedical, and other philanthropic causes. AHEPA's positive contributions \nstem from both the organization and the outstanding people involved. \nMembers of AHEPA have served in the U.S. Armed Forces and have held \npositions in local, State, and Federal Government throughout the years.\n  As we honor AHEPA's many successes, we also celebrate the \ncontributions of the more than 1 million Greek-Americans in this \ncountry, some 61,000 of whom live in my home State of New Jersey. The \nHellenic community in America contributes daily to the economic, \npolitical and cultural fabric of this Nation, and the United States \nshares a close relationship with Greece and the Republic of Cyprus. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues and AHEPA to strengthen \nAmerica's relationship with our Hellenic friends.\n  I commend AHEPA's commitment to serving the United States and the \nHellenic community. I congratulate them on their 85 years of advocacy, \nand I look forward to their bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2269-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2269]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING T. DENNY SANFORD\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize T. Denny Sanford \nfor his generosity recently represented by the gift of $400 million to \nSioux Valley Hospitals and Health System. This gift is the second \nlargest donation to any medical institution since 2001 and will help \nSioux Valley transform itself into a world-class research institution. \nIn recognition of the donation and in honor of Mr. Sanford, the health \ncare system has been renamed Sanford Health.\n  Since his birth in St. Paul, MN, in 1935, T. Denny Sanford has \nreached many outstanding milestones that deserve recognition and \npraise. After starting work at age 8 in his father's clothing \ndistribution company, he spent most of his teen years selling his \nfather's clothing to retail stores. He later graduated with a degree in \npsychology from the University of Minnesota and was recruited for a \nsales and marketing management position with Armstrong Cork Company.\n  In the 1960s, Mr. Sanford established a manufacturers' representative \ncompany and a regional distribution company. Then in 1971, he bought \nContech, a specialty chemical company, from Sears & Roebuck and took it \npublic the following year. After selling Contech in the 1980s, he \ncreated a venture capital fund to provide financing to young \nentrepreneurs. Out of the 28 companies he has financed, 18 have become \npublic corporations.\n  In 1986, Mr. Sanford purchased United National Bank in Sioux Falls, \nSD. The bank, now named First Premier Bank, has expanded throughout \nSouth Dakota and includes Premier Bankcard Inc., which is a national \nleader in the credit card industry.\n  Although Mr. Sanford is well-known for his business achievements, he \nis even more distinguished for his philanthropy. He has donated \nmillions to organizations that are close to his heart and even started \nthe Sanford Foundation for charitable giving. In 2005, he gave over \n$70.5 million to charitable causes in the United States and ranked 14th \non the Chronicle of Philanthropy's list of America's most-generous \ndonors. Additionally, in 2006, he was named to the Business Week Top 50 \nlist of most-generous philanthropists in the United States.\n  Before his most recent donation, Mr. Sanford had contributed $20 \nmillion to Sioux Valley for expansion with South Dakota's medical \nschool and $16 million for Sanford Children's Hospital, which plans to \nopen in 2009. This recent gift of $400 million will be used to achieve \nfour major goals. These goals are to build 5 pediatric clinics around \nthe country, to expand research, to build a health care campus with \nover 20 separate facilities, and to specialize in a specific line of \nmedical research that will result in a cure.\n  T. Denny Sanford's generous gift to Sioux Valley will encourage \nprosperity and growth for South Dakota by generating an estimated 9,200 \nnew jobs, adding approximately $1.2 billion to the economy, drawing \npatients from around the world, and improving the wellness of our \ncitizens. This donation will reach people from across the country and \nmake South Dakota a leader and magnet in medical research.\n  T. Denny Sanford is a giving man with a passion for making a \ndifference in the lives around him. He is even known to have a goal to \n``die broke.''

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na business credit against income for the purchase of fishing safety \nequipment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Commercial \nFishermen Safety Act of 2007, a bill to help fishermen purchase the \nlife-saving safety equipment they need to survive when disaster \nstrikes. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, in introducing this legislation.\n  Everyday, members of our fishing communities struggle to cope with \nthe pressures of running a small business, complying with burdensome \nregulations, and maintaining their vessels and equipment. Added to \nthese challenges are the dangers associated with fishing.\n  Year-in and year-out, commercial fishing ranks among the Nation's \nmost dangerous occupations. Last August, when the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics released the most recent National Census of Fatal \nOccupational Injuries, fishing was the most dangerous occupation. While \nthe national rate of occupational-related fatalities dropped by 1 \npercent in 2005, I am saddened to say that the fishing community saw an \nincrease of almost 14 percent from the previous year. I have introducd \nsimilar measures in previous sessions of Congress, but these tragic \nstatistics illustrate why this piece of legislation is absolutely \nneeded right now.\n  And as we know, these statistics have a very real face to them. And \nsadly, the New England fishing community is certainly no stranger to \nthe pain and loss of their own.\n  Last November, the small fishing community of Port Clyde saw the \ntragic loss of one their own. The Taylor Emily, a 48-foot fishing boat, \ncapsized and sank about 80 miles east of Portland, ME. Tragically, \nlong-time fisherman Jim Weaver perished in this incident. Another \nfisherman aboard the boat, Christopher Yattaw, was saved when the \nTaylor Emily sank. Chris treaded the frigid waters for almost an hour, \nbut finally, the boat's life raft inflated. Almost 8 hours later, Chris \nwas rescued from the life raft by a passing fishing vessel. This \nincident could have been even more tragic if the critical live-saving \nequipment had not been aboard.\n  Coast Guard regulations require all fishing vessels to carry safety \nequipment. The requirements vary depending on factors such as the size \nof the vessel, the temperature of the water, and the distance the \nvessel travels from shore to fish. Required equipment can include a \nlife raft that automatically inflates and floats free, should the \nvessel sink. This is what saved Christopher Yattaw's life. Other live-\nsaving equipment includes: personal flotation devices or immersion \nsuits which help protect fishermen from exposure and increase buoyancy; \nEPIRBs, which relay a downed vessel's position to Coast Guard Search \nand Rescue Personnel; visual distress signals; and fire extinguishers. \nWhen an emergency arises, safety equipment is priceless. At all other \ntimes, the cost of purchasing or maintaining this equipment must \ncompete with other expenses such as loan payments, fuel, wages, \nmaintenance, and insurance.\n  The Commercial Fishermen Safety Act of 2007 provides a tax credit \nequal to 75 percent of the amount paid by fishermen to purchase or \nmaintain required safety equipment. The tax credit is capped at $1,500. \nItems such as EPIRBs and immersion suits cost hundreds of dollars, \nwhile life rafts can reach into the thousands. The tax credit will make \nlife-saving equipment more affordable for more fishermen, who currently \nface limited options under the Federal tax code.\n  We have seen far too many tragedies in this occupation. Please, let \nus support fishermen who are trying to prepare in case disaster \nstrikes. Safety equipment saves lives. By providing a tax credit for \nthe purchase of safety equipment, Congress can help ensure that \nfishermen have a better chance of returning home each and every time \nthey head out to sea.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be put in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 687\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend and expand the charitable deduction for \ncontributions of food inventory; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Lincoln, I \nrise today to introduce the ``Good Samaritan Hunger Relief Tax \nIncentive Extension Act of 2007''. This important legislation extends \nand expands the food bank donation provisions that were included in the \nPension Protection Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-280). The Pension \nProtection Act allows farmers and small business owners to receive a \ntax deduction for donation of food products contributed to food banks, \npantries and homeless shelters for 2006 and 2007.\n  The new law permits businesses a deduction from their taxes for a \ndonation equal to either (1) twice cost basis; or (2) the difference of \ncost basis plus one half the difference between cost basis and fair \nmarket value. Food donations of all sizes from all businesses can \nqualify for this type of donation. The bill that I am introducing today \nincreases the valuation to full market value of the donation and makes \nthis provision a permanent part of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Demand on food banks has been rising, and these tax deductions would \nbe an important step in increasing private donations to the non-profit \nhunger relief charities playing a critical role in meeting America's \nnutrition needs. It is estimated that food banks provide meals to more \nthan 23 million Americans and that 13 million children are hungry or at \nrisk of hunger.\n  As I have traveled around Indiana, I have visited many food banks in \nour State. They have confirmed the results of a study by the U.S. \nConference of Mayors that showed demand for food at food banks has \nrisen one hundred percent. Forty-eight percent of the people requesting \nemergency food assistance are either children or their parents. The \nnumber of elderly persons requesting food assistance has increased by \nninety-two percent. The success of welfare reform legislation has moved \nmany recipients off welfare and into jobs. In many States, welfare \nroles have been reduced by more than half. But we need to recognize \nthat these individuals and their families are living on modest wages. \nAs unemployment rates have risen, as with the fluctuation of the price \nof gas and heating oil, the demand placed on the food banks and soup \nkitchens has also increased.\n  Private food banks provide a key safety net against hunger. According \nto a report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 31 million Americans \nare living on the edge of hunger. USDA statistics show that up to 96 \nbillion pounds of food go to waste each year in the United States. If a \nsmall percentage of this wasted food could be redirected to food banks, \nwe could make important strides in our fight against hunger.\n  I have been especially impressed by the remarkable work of food banks \nin Indiana. In many cases, they are partnered with churches and faith-\nbased organizations and are making a tremendous difference in our \ncommunities. We should support this private sector activity, which not \nonly feeds people, but also strengthens community bonds and \ndemonstrates the power of faith, charity, and civic involvement.\n  Each citizen can make an important contribution to the fight against \nhunger at a local level. It is important to make sure that none of us \nforget those who find themselves having to utilize the services of the \nfood banks. In order to ensure that hunger relief organizations are \nmeeting the greater demand they are seeing, we must make food drives a \npart of everyday activities. People should get in the habit of buying \nextra cans or boxes of food on every trip to the grocery store, not \njust around the holiday season.\n  I am committed to work with Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley to find an offset to pay for this change to the tax code. I \nwould like to thank them for their past support of this initiative and \ncommend them on their efforts in helping America's charities meet their \nfunding goals, and assist those individuals who take advantage of the \nservices provided by these groups.\n  I believe the enactment of this legislation would be a great \nincentive in redirecting this food from being discarded to being \ndistributed to hungry families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 690.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to highlight \nthe ongoing needs of our small businesses and homeowners in the gulf \ncoast who were devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In Louisiana \nalone, these disasters claimed 1,464 lives, destroyed more than 200,000 \nhomes and 18,000 businesses and inflicted $25 billion in uninsured \nlosses. Many of my colleagues here in the Senate have been down to \nLouisiana and have seen firsthand the size and scope of the \ndestruction. The Congress has been very generous in providing billions \nof Federal recovery dollars as well as valuable Gulf Opportunity, GO, \nZone tax incentives to help spur recovery in the region. These \nresources will be key in the recovery of the region but there are \nadditional needs on the ground that still must be addressed. That is \nwhy I am proud to introduce a bill today, the Catastrophic Disaster \nRecovery Improvements Act of 2007, which I believe, addresses a \nspecific problem which is impacting homeowners throughout the gulf \ncoast.\n  Katrina was the most destructive hurricane ever to hit the United \nStates. The next month, in September, Hurricane Rita hit the Louisiana \nand Texas coast. It was the second most powerful hurricane ever to hit \nthe United States, wreaking havoc on the southwestern part of my State \nand the east Texas coast. This one-two punch devastated Louisiana \nlives, communities and jobs, stretching from Cameron Parish in the west \nto Plaquemines Parish in the east.\n  We are now rebuilding our State and the wide variety of communities \nthat were devastated by Rita and Katrina, areas representing a diverse \nmix of population, income and cultures. We hope to restore the region's \nuniqueness and its greatness. To do that, we need to rebuild our local \neconomies now and far into the future. We cannot succeed, however, if \nour homeowners are being buried under Federal red tape and regulations.\n  The people who work for the Small Business Administration and FEMA \nare dedicated and interested to help in the recovery of our region. \nHowever, these individuals are operating under a system which is \ninadequate and, in some cases, unresponsive to needs on the ground.\n  I come to the floor today to introduce a bill which provides a \ncommonsense solution to get the Federal assistance to our struggling \nhomeowners. If we don't help them now, building a strong gulf coast \nwill be all the more difficult if residents cannot rebuild their homes \nand businesses cannot open their doors.\n  For homeowners in Louisiana, the State is doing its part by setting \nup the Louisiana Road Home program, to provide homeowners with up to \n$150,000 in grant proceeds for uninsured losses on their properties. \nThis program is State-administered, but supplemental CDBG-funded. \nHowever, many applicants are concerned because under the Stafford and \nSmall Business Acts, the SBA is required to ensure there are no \n``duplication of benefits'' provided to disaster victims. This means \nthat SBA must review every file which received an SBA Disaster Loan, \nand if there is deemed to be duplication, deduct the\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\nduplication amount from the grant proceeds. As I said, I want the SBA \nto ensure taxpayers funds are used wisely, but at the same time, I want \nto ensure that all residents are able to get the funds they need to \nrebuild their homes.\n  Under the current scenario, some residents who have additional \nuninsured losses, are being required to still pay back these grant \nproceeds. This is because many SBA loss inspections were done right \nafter the storms in 2005, but since then building/labor costs have \nincreased dramatically, and this is not reflected in the SBA verified \nloss. Borrowers are able to request a loan modification from SBA, but \nmany residents who waited months and months for SBA to respond are wary \nto go through the process again, especially if there is a prospect they \nwill be declined for the increased loan amount. I can't blame them \nbecause there is enough uncertainty down there right now. Personally, I \nwould also be hesitant to go through the SBA loan process again if I \nhad to fill out as much paperwork as my constituents have had to fill \nout, and to receive constant requests for more information once they \nthink they are done with submitting information.\n\n  For this reason, this bill provides the SBA administrator the \nflexibility to waive, partially or fully at the discretion of the \nadministrator, this ``duplication of benefits'' rule. This provides \nborrowers with additional funds for rebuilding while retaining the \nFederal Government's financial responsibility to taxpayers. I believe \nthis commonsense fix for major disasters corrects a major problem \noccurring in Louisiana right now and gives SBA some flexibility for \nfuture major disasters. The current SBA interpretation of these \nregulations overlooks the fact that a grant, with no repayment, has a \ndifferent value to homeowners than loans, which require repayment. In \neffect, disaster victims are being penalized for getting an SBA loan \nbefore they received their Road Home grant and that is not how the \nFederal Government should respond to victims, who in many cases, lost \neverything. We should not allow victims to ``double-dip'' or benefit \nfrom the disaster, but the Federal Government should be responsive to \nneeds on the ground and adjust as necessary to allow disaster victims \nto fully recover.\n  In introducing this bill today, I am hopeful it sends the signal to \ngulf coast residents that Congress has not forgotten about them and \nthat we are doing our part to reduce red tape and bureaucracy. Congress \ndid a great deal during the 109th Congress to help victims of the 2005 \nstorms, but that does not mean we should just write off recurring \nproblems to the responsibility of States or disaster victims \nthemselves. I believe that both the leadership on the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship as well as the new SBA \nadministrator, Steve Preston, are receptive to addressing ongoing needs \nin the gulf coast. I look forward to working closely with them in the \ncoming weeks to provide substantive and lasting solutions for our small \nbusinesses and homeowners.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nrecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 690\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Catastrophic Disaster \n     Recovery Improvements Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. WAIVER OF PROHIBITION ON DUPLICATION OF CERTAIN \n                   BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 7(b) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 636(b)) is amended by inserting immediately after \n     paragraph (3) the following:\n       ``(4) Waiver of prohibition on duplication of certain \n     benefits.--For any major disaster (as that term is defined in \n     section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \n     Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122)), in providing \n     assistance under paragraph (1) or (2), the Administrator may \n     waive, in whole or in part, the prohibition on the \n     duplication of benefits, including whether damage or \n     destruction has been compensated for by, credit is available \n     from, activities are reimbursable through, or funds have been \n     made available from any other source.''.\n       (b) Applicability and Retroactivity for Victims of \n     Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma.--The amendment made by \n     this section shall apply to any assistance under section 7(b) \n     of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 636(b)) provided on or \n     after August 29, 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD:\n  S. 691. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security act to \nimprove the benefits under the Medicare program for beneficiaries with \nkidney disease, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Kidney \nCare Quality and Education Act. For the over 400,000 Americans living \nwith kidney disease, the time has come to modernize and improve the \nMedicare End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) program. They simply can't wait \nany longer.\n  When Congress enacted the Medicare ESRD program, we recognized that \nthis disease was unique and deserved special consideration. \nUnfortunately, since that time, Congress has fallen behind in its \ncommitment, and the program has not kept pace with changes in \ntreatment. My bill would take needed steps to modernize and improve the \nprogram to recognize quality and encourage education on kidney disease \nto better prevent and control ESRD.\n  The Kidney Care Quality and Education Act establishes education \nprograms to assist patients with kidney disease to learn important \nself-management skills that will help them manage their disease more \neffectively and improve their quality of life. The bill also seeks to \nhelp individuals before they develop irreversible kidney failure by \nteaching individuals about the factors that lead to chronic kidney \ndisease, the precursor to kidney failure, and how to prevent it, treat \nit, and, most importantly, avoid it. Additionally, the bill seeks to \nestablish uniform training requirements for dialysis technicians and to \nidentify barriers to accessing the home dialysis benefit.\n  Improving the ESRD program payment system and ensuring continued high \nquality care is also a critical component of modernizing the ESRD \nprogram. Medicare established the first prospective payment system \n(PPS) in the ESRD program in the early 1980s. Yet, the ESRD program \nremains the only Medicare PPS that does not receive an annual update. \nAs a result, dialysis facilities have experienced difficulties in \nhiring qualified health care professionals and purchasing new \ntechnology.\n  It is time for the dialysis community to receive annual payment \nupdates; however, it is also critically important that increased \npayments are tied to high quality. My bill addresses both of these \nissues by creating a three-year Continuous Quality Improvement \nInitiative to link payments with quality. First, the three-year \ninitiative would create an annual update mechanism to fairly pay \nproviders. Second, it would ask providers to report on quality measures \ndeveloped through consultation with key stakeholders. Finally, it would \nwithhold a certain percentage of the annual update to fund a quality \nbonus pool from which payments would be made to those providers who \nprovide the best quality of care.\n  Congress must reaffirm its commitment to Americans with kidney \nfailure by improving the program through new educational programs, \nquality initiatives, and payment reform. The Kidney Care Quality and \nEducation Act is a comprehensive bill that moves the program in that \ndirection. I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 693. A bill to amend the Public health Service Act to reauthorize \nthe Automated Defibrillation in Adam's Memory Act; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by the \nSenator from Maine, Ms. Collins, in introducing the reauthorization of \nthe Automated Defibrillators in Adam's Memory Act, or the ADAM Act. \nThis bill is modeled after the successful Project ADAM that originally \nbegan in Wisconsin, and will reauthorize a program to establish a \nnational clearing house to provide schools with the ``how-to'' and \ntechnical advice to set up a public access defibrillation program.\n  Sudden cardiac death from coronary heart disease occurs over 900 \ntimes per\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\nday in the United States. By improving access to automated external \ndefibrillators, or AEDs, we can improve the survival rates of cardiac \narrest in our communities.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, as in many other States, heart disease \nis the number one killer. In 2004, 35.4 percent of all deaths in \nWisconsin were caused by heart disease and stroke. Overall, heart \ndisease kills more Americans than AIDS, cancer and accidents combined.\n  Cardiac arrest can strike anyone. Cardiac victims are in a race \nagainst time, and unfortunately, for too many of those in rural areas, \nEmergency Medical Services are unable to reach people in need, and time \nruns out. It's simply not possible to have EMS units next to every farm \nand small town across the Nation.\n  Fortunately, recent technological advances have made the newest \ngeneration of AEDs inexpensive and simple to operate. Because of these \nadvancements in AED technology, it is now practical to train and equip \npolice officers, teachers, and members of other community \norganizations.\n  An estimated 164,600 Americans experience out-of-hospital sudden \ncardiac arrests each year. Immediate CPR and early defibrillation using \nan AED can more than double a victim's chance of survival. By taking \nsome relatively simple steps, we can give victims of cardiac arrest a \nbetter chance of survival.\n  Over the past 6 years, I have worked with Senator Susan Collins, a \nRepublican from Maine, on a number of initiatives to empower \ncommunities to improve cardiac arrest survival rates. We have pushed \nCongress to support rural first responders--local police and fire and \nrescue services--in their efforts to provide early defibrillation. \nCongress heard our call, and responded by enacting two of our bills, \nthe Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act and the ADAM Act.\n  The Rural Access to Emergency Devices program allows community \npartnerships across the country to receive a grant enabling them to \npurchase defibrillators, and receive the training needed to use these \ndevices. I'm pleased to say that grants have already put defibrillators \nin rural communities in 49 States, helping those communities be better \nprepared when cardiac arrest strikes.\n  Approximately 95 percent of sudden cardiac arrest victims die before \nreaching the hospital. Every minute that passes before a cardiac arrest \nvictim is defibrillated, the chance of survival falls by as much as 10 \npercent. After only 8 minutes, the victim's survival rate drops by 60 \npercent. This is why early intervention is essential--a combination of \nCPR and use of AEDs can save lives.\n  Heart disease is not only a problem among adults. A few years ago I \nlearned the story of Adam Lemel, a 17-year-old high school student and \na star basketball and tennis player in Wisconsin. Tragically, during a \ntimeout while playing basketball at a neighboring Milwaukee high \nschool, Adam suffered sudden cardiac arrest, and died before the \nparamedics arrived.\n  This story is incredibly sad. Adam had his whole life ahead of him, \nand could quite possibly have been saved with appropriate early \nintervention. In fact, we have seen a number of examples in Wisconsin \nwhere early CPR and access to defibrillation have saved lives.\n  Seventy miles away from Milwaukee, a 14-year-old boy collapsed while \nplaying basketball. Within 3 minutes, the emergency team arrived and \nbegan CPR. Within 5 minutes of his collapse, the paramedics used an AED \nto jump start his heart. Not only has this young man survived, doctors \nhave identified his father and brother as having the same heart \ncondition and have begun preventative treatments.\n  These stories help to underscore some important issues. First, \nalthough cardiac arrest is most common among adults, it can occur at \nany age--even in apparently healthy children and adolescents. Second, \nearly intervention is essential--a combination of CPR and the use of \nAEDs can save lives. Third, some individuals who are at risk for sudden \ncardiac arrest can be identified to prevent cardiac arrest.\n  After Adam Lemel suffered his cardiac arrest, his friend David Ellis \njoined forces with Children's Hospital of Wisconsin to initiate Project \nADAM to bring CPR training and public access defibrillation into \nschools, educate communities about preventing sudden cardiac deaths and \nsave lives.\n  Today, Project ADAM has introduced AEDs into several Wisconsin \nschools, and has been a model for programs in Washington, Florida, \nMichigan and elsewhere. Project ADAM provides a model for the Nation, \nand now, with the enactment of this new law, more schools will have \naccess to the information they seek to launch similar programs.\n  The ADAM Act was passed into law in 2003, but has yet to be funded. \nShould funding be enacted, the program will help to put life-saving \ndefibrillators in the hands of people in schools around the country. I \nhave been very proud to play a part in having this bill signed into \nlaw, and it is my hope that the reauthorization of the Act will quickly \npass through the Congress and into law, and that funding will follow. \nIt would not take much money to fund this program and save lives across \nthe country.\n  The ADAM Act is one way we can honor the life of children like Adam \nLemel, and give tomorrow's pediatric cardiac arrest victims a fighting \nchance at life.\n  This act exists because a family that experienced the tragic loss of \ntheir son was determined to spare other families that same loss. I \nthank Adam's parents, Joe and Patty, for their courageous efforts and I \nthank them for everything they have done to help the ADAM Act become \nlaw. Their actions take incredible bravery, and I commend them for \ntheir efforts.\n  By making sure that AEDs are available in our Nation's rural areas, \nschools and throughout our communities we can help those in a race \nagainst time have a fighting chance of survival when they fall victim \nto cardiac arrest. I urge Congress to pass this reauthorization, and to \nfund this Act. We have the power to prevent death--all we must do is \nact.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 693\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Automated Defibrillation in \n     Adam's Memory Reauthorization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT.\n\n       Section 312(e) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     244(e)) is amended in the first sentence by striking ``fiscal \n     year 2003'' and all the follows through ``2006'' and \n     inserting ``for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2011''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Roberts, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. \n        Lautenberg):\n  S. 694. A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to issue \nregulations to reduce the incidence of child injury and death occurring \ninside or outside of light motor vehicles, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing with my \ncolleague Senator Sununu The Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety \nAct, a bill to improve the child safety features in new vehicles.\n  While we hear a great deal about automobile accidents, we don't hear \nnearly as much about non-traffic automobile accidents, which can be \njust as tragic. This bill is named in honor of a 2-year-old Long Island \nboy who was killed when his father accidentally backed over him in his \ndriveway. Since 2000, over 1,150 children have died in non-traffic, \nnon-crash incidents, and this number has been steadily rising. The \naverage age of victims in these cases is just 1 year old, and in 70 \npercent of backover cases, a parent, relative or close friend is behind \nthe wheel. This bill is aimed at preventing other families from \nsuffering this fate.\n  The Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act would make new \npassenger motor vehicles safer in three important ways. First, it \nrequires a detection system to alert drivers to the\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n\npresence of a child behind the vehicle. Second, it will ensure that \npower windows automatically reverse direction when they detect an \nobstruction--preventing children from being trapped, injured or killed. \nAnd finally, the bill will require the vehicle service break to be \nengaged in order to prevent vehicles from unintentionally rolling away.\n  The bill also establishes a child safety information program \nadministered by the Secretary of Transportation to collect non-traffic, \nnon-crash incident data and disseminate information to parents about \nthese hazards and ways to mitigate them.\n  This bill proves that with modest, cost-effective steps, we can \nprevent many tragic car-related accidents from occurring. Power window \nsensors, for example, cost around $10 a window. Brakeshift interlocks \nare already standard in most passenger vehicles, but will cost only $5 \nwhere needed. Backover warning systems cost approximately $300 a car, \nfar cheaper than DVD and stereo systems. This inexpensive technology \ncould save thousands of children's lives.\n  I fought long and hard into the last hours of the 109th Congress to \nget this bill through and I know that families, advocates and many of \nmy colleagues are poised to continue that momentum in the new Congress.\n  I am proud to be reintroducing the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars \nSafety Act of 2007 and urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis bill. Together, we can ensure that we have safer cars and safer \nkids across our country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 695. A bill to amend the International Claims Settlement Act of \n1949 to allow for certain claims of nationals of the United States \nagainst Turkey, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as you may know, Turkey invaded the \nnorthern area of the Republic of Cyprus in the summer of 1974. At that \ntime, less than 20 percent of the private real property in this area \nwas owned by Turkish Cypriots, with the rest owned by Greek Cypriots \nand foreigners. Turkey's invasion and subsequent occupation of northern \nCyprus displaced people who are to this day prevented by the Turkish \nArmed Forces from returning to and repossessing their homes and \nproperties.\n  A large proportion of these properties were distributed to, and are \ncurrently being used by, the 120,000 Turkish settlers brought into the \noccupied area by Turkey. It is estimated that 7,000 to 10,000 U.S. \nnationals today claim an interest in such property.\n  Adding urgency to the plight of Greek-Cypriots and Americans who lost \nproperty in the wake of the invasion is a recent property development \nboom in the Turkish-occupied north of Cyprus. As an ever-increasing \nnumber of disputed properties are transferred or developed, the \nrightful owners' prospects for recovering their property or being \ncompensated worsen.\n  In 1998, the European Court of Human Rights found that Turkey had \nunlawfully deprived Greek Cypriot refugees of the use of their \nproperties in the north of the island. The Court ruled that the \nGovernment of Turkey was obliged to compensate the refugees for such \ndeprivation, and to allow them to return home.\n  It is to provide similar redress to the American victims of Turkey's \ninvasion and occupation of Cyprus that my colleague Senator Menendez \nand I today introduce the ``American-Owned Property in Occupied Cyprus \nClaims Act''.\n  This act would direct the U.S. Government's independent Foreign \nClaims Settlement Commission to receive, evaluate and determine awards \nwith respect to the claims of U.S. citizens and businesses that lost \nproperty as a result of Turkey's invasion and continued occupation of \nnorthern Cyprus. To provide funds from which these awards would be \npaid, the act would urge the President to authorize the Secretary of \nState to negotiate an agreement for settlement of such claims with the \nGovernment of Turkey.\n  The act would further grant U.S. Federal courts jurisdiction over \nsuits by U.S. nationa1s against any private persons, other than Turkey, \noccupying or otherwise using the U.S. national's property in the \nTurkish-occupied portion of Cyprus. Lastly, the act would expressly \nwaive Turkey's sovereign immunity against claims brought by U.S. \nnationals in U.S. courts relating to property occupied by the \nGovernment of Turkey and used by Turkey in connection with a commercial \nactivity carried out in the United States.\n  This bill represents an important step toward righting the \ninternationally recognized wrong of the expropriation of property, \nincluding American property, in northern Cyprus in the wake of the 1974 \ninvasion by the Turkish Army. I strongly urge my colleagues to promptly \nconsider and pass this critical piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 696. A bill to establish an Advanced Research Projects \nAdministration-Energy to initiate high risk, innovative energy research \nto improve the energy security of the United States, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, energy is once again one of the top two or \nthree domestic issues facing the Congress this year.\n  Prices for gasoline, heating oil, electricity, and natural gas have \nsoared in recent years, hitting working families hard. Our energy \nsecurity has been threatened on many fronts: We have seen a terrorist \nattack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities, oil workers kidnapped in \nNigeria, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatened to cut off our \nsupply of oil from his country, and some question whether Iran's role \nas an oil supplier keeps other countries from properly addressing \nIran's nuclear proliferation threat. Recently we learned that Russia \nand Iran are talking about creating an OPEC-like organization for \nnatural gas--a cartel that could put even more pressure on natural gas \nprices.\n  Energy provides one of America's greatest challenges for the 21st \ncentury. Our economy has been dependent on oil and coal for about 100 \nyears. And since World War II, natural gas has become part of the \nequation. Will we continue to rely on these energy sources for the next \n100 years?\n  The cost of energy will profoundly affect the future competitiveness \nof the American economy. As the Chinese and Indian economies grow, so \nwill their demand for energy. And that will add further upward pressure \nto energy prices.\n  Global climate change is another issue that demands that we take a \nfresh look at our energy future. While we address the issue of energy \nsecurity, we must also keep an eye on the effect that new energy \ndevelopment will have on carbon dioxide emissions and global warming.\n  We are essentially trapped in an energy box. It is a box \ncharacterized by high imports, wildly fluctuating prices for oil and \nnatural gas, and environmental danger. As a Nation, we must experiment \nwith ways to break out of that box. To break out, we need an energy \nresearch effort modeled after the Manhattan project, or the Apollo \nmission to the moon.\n  America has a brilliant record of gathering the best minds. We have \nconsistently met challenges that at first seemed to be impossible. \nDuring World War II, the Manhattan project brought together brilliant \nphysicists and engineers to build an atomic bomb in 3 short years. And \nafter President Kennedy described his vision to a joint session of \nCongress in May of 1961, the Apollo space program put a man on the moon \nin just 8 years.\n  Looking back, these achievements look stunning. Both projects started \nout with no guarantee of success. Each could have ended in utter \nfailure. Yet because of the talent, ingenuity, and focus of creative \nminds, they both succeeded.\n  Breaking out of the energy box poses a similar challenge. Success is \nnot guaranteed. But we have got to give it our best shot.\n  Today I am reintroducing legislation to create an ARPA-E, Advanced \nResearch Projects Agency--Energy. My legislation would create a new \nenergy research agency to help our nation face the challenges of a \nnewly competitive global economy. It will help us to move into a new \nenergy future.\n  We have the greatest research scientists on the planet. We have the \nmost technically-talented workforce in\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\nthe world. But we do not have the vigor that we need in energy \nresearch. Energy research is a backwater, compared to other research \nefforts in biotechnology, medicine, computers, and defense-oriented \nprojects.\n  With the Manhattan project and the Apollo space program, America \nproved that we can gather the best talent for a focused mission and \nsucceed. It is time that we began a similar effort on energy.\n  We need to create a new agency to initiate cutting-edge, innovative \nenergy research and development aimed at taking us to a new energy \nfuture. Doing so is essential to our effort to improve our economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  The new agency is modeled on DARPA--the Defense Advanced Research \nProjects Agency--in the Department of Defense. Among the revolutionary \ntechnologies that DARPA has developed are the internet and stealth \ntechnology for aircraft. DARPA has been a tremendous success.\n  The National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of \nEngineering, and the Institute of Medicine joined to form the Committee \non Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century. Norm Augustine \nchaired the committee. Based on DARPA's achievements, the committee \nrecommended the creation of an ARPA-E: Advanced Research Projects \nAgency--Energy.\n  This was one of a number of recommendations that the committee made \nin its impressive 2005 report on the future competitive challenges that \nAmerica faces. The committee recommended that ARPA-E be designed to \nconduct transformative, out-of-the-box energy research.\n\n  My bill proposes that ARPA-E be a small agency with a total of 250 \npeople. A minimum of 180 of them would be technical staff. A director \nof the agency and four deputies would lead ARPA-E. I propose that ARPA-\nE be funded at $300 million in fiscal year 2008, $600 million in 2009, \n$1.1 billion in 2010, $1.5 billion in 2011, and $2.0 billion in 2012.\n  We would require that the staff have a technical background. The \nagency would use the Experimental Personnel Authority designed for \nDARPA. That authority authorizes higher salaries than for typical \nFederal employees, and faster hiring, so that the agency could get to \nwork quickly.\n  To keep the intense, innovative focus that we want, technical staff \nwould be limited to 3 to 4 years at the agency. Managers would be \nlimited to 4 to 6 years. The director could give both groups extended \nterms of employment if the director so chose.\n  For contracts, the agency would use the DARPA procedure. That \nprocedure allows more flexible contracting arrangements than are \nnormally possible under the Federal Acquisition Regulations. To ensure \nthat ARPA-E would conduct innovative research, 75 percent of research \nprojects initiated by ARPA-E would not be peer reviewed.\n  The ARPA-E would be authorized to award cash prizes to encourage and \naccelerate energy research accomplishments.\n  Finally, the bill would require a report by the end of fiscal year \n2008 on whether ARPA-E would need its own energy research lab.\n  Congress enacted an important companion piece to ARPA-E last December \nin the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. That law extended the \ncredit for electricity from renewable resources, added $400 million to \nthe Clean Renewable Energy Bond program, extended the deduction for \nenergy efficient buildings and the credit for energy efficient homes, \nand provided incentives for cellulosic biomass ethanol facilities.\n  On the energy agenda this year is consideration of President Bush's \nproposal to increase Federal targets for use of renewable and \nalternative fuels. And additional tax incentives to encourage the \ndevelopment and use of alternative energy are being contemplated.\n  We are seeing exciting new efforts in America to strengthen our \nenergy competitiveness. We need to build on this foundation by creating \nan aggressive energy research agency that will push the limits of new \ntechnology and discover alternative energy sources.\n  America has massive coal reserves. So coal gasification is receiving \ngreater attention. Gasification involves breaking down coal under heat \nand pressure to create synthetic natural gas. We must address the \nenvironmental issues. But if this technology can be improved, then \nAmerica will be able to take a huge step toward energy independence.\n  There are exciting developments in wind energy. In Montana, the \nJudith Gap Wind Farm has been generating power at full capacity, using \n90 wind turbines. Each turbine can produce enough electricity for \nroughly 400 homes. The entire farm can produce the electricity needed \nto supply 300,000 customers. And my State ranks in the top 15 States in \nthe Nation for wind power capacity. Nationwide, wind power generating \ncapacity increased 27 percent in 2006.\n  Fusion is another possible area where aggressive research could lead \nto huge payoffs. Continuing research will help us to determine whether \nenergy production through fusion is a practical option.\n  Ethanol is also gaining as an alternative energy option. The Nation's \nfirst cellulosic ethanol pilot facility has opened in Jennings, \nLouisiana. This 1.4 million gallons-per-year, demonstration-scale \nfacility will produce cellulosic ethanol from sugarcane plant residue \nand specially-bred energy cane by the end of 2007.\n  There are also exciting developments in nanotechnology, solar power, \nenergy-efficient materials, biomass, and green buildings.\n  All of these are examples of possible directions for our Nation's \nenergy future. But we need a more aggressive and focused research and \ndevelopment effort to push these alternatives. And we need an effort to \ncreate scientific breakthroughs to supplement existing technologies.\n  We have got to give it our best shot. As President Franklin Roosevelt \nsaid, we must conduct ``bold, persistent experimentation.''\n  Our economic security is at stake. Our ability to compete in the new \nworld economy is at stake.\n  ARPA-E will help us to move forward on existing technologies. It will \nhelp us to find new technologies that are not even imaginable today.\n  I urge my Colleagues to look closely at this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 696\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Steel Industry National Historic Site \nin the State of Pennsylvania; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation along with my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, \nthat will honor the importance of the steel industry in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Nation by creating the ``Steel \nIndustry National Historic Site'' to be operated by the National Park \nService in southwestern Pennsylvania.\n  The importance of the steel industry to the development of the United \nStates cannot be overstated. A national historic site devoted to the \nhistory of the steel industry will afford all Americans the opportunity \nto celebrate this rich heritage, which is symbolic of the work ethic \nendemic to this great nation. The National Park Service has reported \nthat Congress should make remnants of the U.S. Steel Homestead Works an \naffiliate of the national park system, rather than a full national \npark, an option which had been considered in years prior, and which I \nproposed in the 107th Congress. Due to the backlog of maintenance \nprojects at national parks, the legislation offered today instead \ncreates a national historic site that would be affiliated with the \nNational Park Service. There is no better place for such a site than in \nsouthwestern Pennsylvania, which played a significant role in early \nindustrial America and continues today.\n  I have long supported efforts to preserve and enhance the historical \nsteel-related heritage through the Rivers of Steel Heritage Area, which \nincludes the city of Pittsburgh, and seven southwestern Pennsylvania \ncounties: Allegheny; Armstrong, Fayette, Greene, Washington and \nWestmoreland. I have sought and been very pleased with congressional \nsupport for the important work within the Rivers of Steel Heritage Area \nexpressed through appropriations levels of roughly $1 million annually \nsince fiscal year 1998. I am hopeful that this support will continue. \nHowever, more than just resources are necessary to ensure the \nhistorical recognition needed for this important heritage. That is why \nI am introducing this legislation today.\n  It is important to note why Pennsylvania should be the home of the \nnational site that my legislation authorizes. The combination of a \nstrong workforce, valuable natural resources, and Pennsylvania's \nstrategic location in the heavily populated northeastern United States \nallowed the steel industry to thrive. Today, the remaining buildings \nand sites devoted to steel production are threatened with further \ndeterioration. Many of these sites are nationally significant and \nperfectly suited for the study and interpretation of this crucial \nperiod in our Nation's development. Some of these sites include the \nCarrie Furnace Complex, the Hot Metal Bridge, and the United States \nSteel Homestead Works, which would all become a part of the Steel \nIndustry National Historic Site under my legislation. As testimony of \nthe area's historic significance, on September 20, 2006, the Carrie \nFurnaces were designated as a National Historic Landmark by the \nSecretary of the Interior.\n  Highlights of such a national historic site would commemorate a wide \nrange of accomplishments and topics for historical preservation and \ninterpretation from industrial process advancements to labor-management \nrelations. It is important to note that the site I seek to become a \nnational site under this bill includes the location of the Battle of \nthe Homestead, waged in 1892 between steelworkers and Pinkerton guards. \nThe Battle of the Homestead marked a crucial period in our nation's \nworkers' rights movement. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, \nindividuals, and public and private entities have attempted to protect \nand preserve resources such as the Homestead battleground the Hot Metal \nBridge. For the benefit and inspiration of present and future \ngenerations, it is time for the Federal Government to join this effort \nto recognize their importance with the additional protection I provide \nin this bill.\n  I would like to commend my colleague, Representative Doyle, who has \nbeen a longstanding leader in this preservation effort and who has \nconsistently sponsored identical legislation in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. I look forward to working with southwestern \nPennsylvania officials and Mr.\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\nAugust Carlino, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Steel \nIndustry Heritage Corporation, in order to bring this national historic \nsite to fruition. We came very close to passing this bill in the 108th \nCongress with its passage in various forms in the House and the Senate. \nHowever, Congress adjourned prior to final passage of the same bill in \nboth chambers during the 108th and l09th Congresses. Therefore, today \nwe reintroduce this legislation and urge its swift passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 698. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to expand and \nenhance educational assistance for survivors and dependents of \nveterans; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Veterans' \nSurvivor Education Enhancement Act. This legislation would expand \neducation benefits for the survivors and dependents of fallen \nservicemembers.\n  Specifically, the legislation would adjust the Survivors' and \nDependents' Educational Assistance Program by increasing the dependent \nbenefit to $80,000 which the dependent can draw against for any period \nbetween the ages of 17 and 30. This benefit may be used for any \nexpenses incurred while pursuing an education, including: tuition, \nfees, books, room, and board. Education benefits may be used for degree \nand certificate programs, apprenticeship, and on-the-job training. The \nsurviving spouse benefit also will rise to $80,000 and may be used by \nthe spouse for 20 years after the death of the servicemember.\n  Of the 24.3 million veterans currently alive, nearly three-quarters \nserved during a war or an official period of conflict. About a quarter \nof the Nation's population, approximately 63 million people, are \npotentially eligible for veterans' benefits and services because they \nare veterans, family members or survivors of veterans. Since the \ndependents program was enacted in 1956, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) also has assisted in the education of more than 700,000 \ndependents of veterans whose deaths or total disabilities were service-\nconnected. In 2005, VA helped pay for the education or training of \n336,347 veterans and active-duty personnel, 87,589 reservists and \nNational Guardsmen and 74,360 survivors.\n  Surviving families of veterans have already given so much to our \nNation. We need to give the widowed spouses and children a helping \nhand. Therefore, in honor of these families and our brave fallen \nservicemembers, I encourage my colleagues to support the Veterans' \nSurvivor Education Enhancement Act and cosponsor this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 698\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 87\n\n       Whereas lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death \n     for both men and women, accounting for 28 percent of all \n     cancer deaths;\n       Whereas lung cancer kills more people annually than breast \n     cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, \n     melanoma, and kidney cancer combined;\n       Whereas, since the National Cancer Act of 1971 (Public Law \n     92-218;

Mr. President, I would like to announce for the \ninformation of the Senate and the public that the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs will hold a hearing entitled ``Credit Card \nPractices: Fees, Interest Rates, and Grace Periods.'' It is the first \nof several subcommittee hearings that will examine a variety of credit \ncard practices that raise concerns. This hearing will focus on how \ncredit card issuers apply interest rates and fees to consumer accounts. \nIt will examine, for example, how credit card issuers select and apply \ninterest rates and, for consumers carrying a balance forward, eliminate \ngrace periods for repaid debts. It will also analyze high fees charged \nfor late payments, over-the-limit charges, and other matters, including \nhow those fees are assessed, how they add to increase interest costs, \nand how they contribute to consumer debt. In addition, the hearing will \nexamine an industry practice requiring consumer payments to be applied \nfirst to balances with the lowest interest rates instead of to balances \nwith the highest interest rates. The hearing will draw, in part, from a \nSeptember 2006 GAO report detailing the finance charges, fees, and \ndisclosure practices associated with 28 popular credit cards. Witnesses \nfor the upcoming hearing will include representatives from the three \nlargest credit card issuers, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and \nCitigroup, as well as consumer witnesses. A final witness list will be \navailable on Monday, March 5, 2007.\n  The subcommittee hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, March 7, 2007, \nat 10 a.m. in room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building.

Bean, of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations at 224-3721.\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/27/senate-section/article/S2284-3", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2284-S2285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARlNGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.
