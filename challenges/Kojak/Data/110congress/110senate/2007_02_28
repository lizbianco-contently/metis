I thank the Republican leader for his cooperation in \nallowing consent to be granted for us to switch the cloture vote from \nthe Commerce Committee-reported legislation to S. 4, which is, of \ncourse, the measure reported by the Homeland Security Committee. I hope \nMembers will be here early to offer amendments to the legislation.\n  Once I have laid down the substitute amendment, which will encompass \nprovisions from several committees--Homeland Security, Banking, and \nCommerce--we will be ready for the amendment process. Members should \nexpect rollcall votes throughout the day. We could go into late evening \nsessions. We really need to complete this bill. As I told Members \nyesterday, except for Friday late in the day, because of Senator \nLieberman, our manager of the bill--he starts his Sabbath at sundown on \nFriday--we are going to move this bill. We could very likely have \nFriday afternoon votes. So everyone who has airplane reservations \nshould cover themselves because we may have to be here. If progress is \nnot sufficient to finish this bill next week, we will have to start \nworking longer hours. I hope we can get things available Monday so that \nwe have more than one vote Monday night. We really need to start \nlegislating. We have had, in my mind, too much time off.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Colorado. We have the first \ntime, but we have no one here at this stage; they are on their way.

Mr. President, if one travels across the States of \nMaryland or Illinois and stops at any business, large or small, and has \na conversation about how the business is going, it won't take long for \nthe conversation to move to the issue of health care. Virtually every \nbusiness I have visited in Illinois in the last 10 or 20 years--or \nlabor union, for that matter--wants to talk about health care. There is \na growing concern that the cost of health insurance keeps going up and \ncoverage keeps going down. It is affecting our competitive edge in \nAmerica. It compromises the security many families want to feel when it \ncomes to medical care necessary for their loved ones.\n  Yesterday, I was visited by a spokesman for the Business Roundtable. \nThey are infrequent visitors in the offices of Democratic Senators, but \nit was a good, positive meeting. We talked about a number of issues and \nstarted with their concern and our growing concern about the limited \navailability of health care and its cost.\n  We now have some 47 million uninsured Americans and many who are \nunderinsured and more and more who are vulnerable each year. There was \na disturbing story in this morning's Washington Post about a young \nmother who lost her son because she had no way to pay for the \nextraction of a tooth. The child's tooth became decayed, abscessed, and \nled to a terrible condition which ultimately cost him his life. So for \nan $80 tooth extraction, this little boy gave up his life. It is \nunthinkable, in a great country such as America, that such could occur. \nIt is one small example of a life that has been lost because of a lack \nof concern we have about extending health care coverage.\n  It has been a long time since we have had a real conversation about \nthis issue. One has to go back to the previous administration, when \nPresident Clinton came forward with a plan. It was complicated. It was \ncontroversial. I joined in the debate on the plan because I thought it \nwas long overdue. After some months, the forces in the health care \nindustry, which is very profitable today, came together and killed the \nidea. So for 10 years nothing has happened except the situation has \ndisintegrated and we are now facing a real crisis.\n\n  Recently, President Bush put forward a health coverage proposal that \nclaims to make health coverage more affordable, make the tax treatment \nof health benefits more equitable, and create incentives for people to \nenroll in lower cost health plans. I welcome the President's proposal \nas a sign that he, too, believes the status quo of health care in \nAmerica is unacceptable and we need to begin the hard work to reform \nit. But when you take a close look at the President's proposals, some \nquestions arise, and some concerns.\n  The heart of the plan is a proposal to equalize the tax treatment of \nhealth benefits, whether you obtain health coverage through an employer \nor purchase it yourself in the individual insurance market. On the \nsurface, it sounds very appealing. After all, some people simply do not \nhave access to employer-sponsored coverage. But such a change would not \nprovide people with two equally good options for obtaining health \ninsurance.\n  Employer-sponsored health coverage is far superior to the individual \ninsurance market for the vast majority of people, even if they have \naccess to a tax deduction. Unless you are in perfect health, \nindividual-market insurance is often unaffordable or unavailable. To a \nmuch greater extent than employer coverage, insurers in the individual \nmarket can deny you coverage if you have a preexisting medical \ncondition or can refuse to cover you at all. Insurers in the individual \nmarket also can charge much higher premiums if you are older or sicker. \nIn short, if you are not in perfect health, you do not want to be in \nthe individual market. Recognizing this, the President's proposal to \nequalize tax treatment is really not as appealing as it sounds unless \nyou happen to be one of those very young, very healthy people who can \ngo to an individual market and find a competitive rate.\n  The President's plan has an even more alarming implication. The way \nhe has constructed it, equalizing the tax treatment of benefits could \nweaken employer-sponsored coverage, which is the bedrock of our current \nhealth coverage system. He could do it in two ways.\n  First, offering the same tax deduction, for either employer-provided \ncoverage or individual coverage, could create an incentive for some \nemployers to drop coverage. They can just basically say: Now you are on \nyour own. We are finished providing health coverage. Use the tax \ndeduction to buy your own plan. Given the current state of the \nindividual insurance market, this could be terrible news for everyone \nbut the youngest and healthiest workers. Most people losing employer \ncoverage would likely end up with insurance that costs more and covers \nless--if they are lucky to find a policy at all.\n  The second adverse effect is that even if an employer maintains \nhealth coverage, young and healthy employees would have an incentive to \nleave their employer plan for individual coverage. You know what that \nmeans: When the younger and healthier workers leave the pool, there is \nmore risk and higher premiums for those who remain.\n  Another major element of the President's plan is a proposal to cap \nthe tax deduction for health benefits at $15,000 for families and \n$7,500 for individuals. Those with health benefits above this cap would \nface a new tax on the health benefits exceeding this threshold. The \nPresident says capping the tax deduction would dissuade people from \nenrolling in ``gold-plated'' or ``Cadillac'' health plans, which the \nadministration has fixated on as a major cause of rising health care \ncosts. Some have gone so far as to characterize this part of the \nPresident's plan as a way to tax the rich and their expensive health \nbenefits in order to help lower income people.\n  What a curious juxtaposition, that for 6 years this administration \nhas argued for tax breaks for people at the highest income categories, \nsaying they must be rewarded, even at the expense of middle-income and \nlower income families and now, when it comes to health insurance, the \ntables are turned and the administration is arguing that we should not \nbe rewarding expensive health benefits, we should be, in fact, trying \nto help lower income people, though his approach does not achieve that.\n  A closer look at his plan raises even more serious questions. It \nrests on a shaky premise that large numbers of Americans have an \noverabundance of health insurance. The President believes Americans are \noverinsured when it comes to health care protection. There may be some \npeople out there who fit in that category, but most of the people I \ntalk to do not. They are very anxious about their coverage. They are \nanxious about the cost of their premiums, their deductibles, and their \ncopayments. We find a lot of important health services are not covered.\n  We know what is happening in bankruptcy courts. Those who can make it \nthrough the new maze that has been created by this Congress and this \nadministration usually are there primarily for medical bills. The real \nproblem is not the overinsured but the 16 million Americans who are \nunderinsured. Their health coverage is not adequate to protect them if \nthey have a serious problem. Forty-seven million Americans have no \ncoverage at all. The President's focus on the overinsured seems \nmisplaced, to put it mildly.\n\n  Part of the problem stems from this notion of ``Cadillac'' health \nplans. The phrase suggests that buying health coverage is like buying a \ncar: You can buy the basic model, which allows you to get to work, pick \nup the kids, and go to the store, or, if you have some extra money, you \ncan buy the high-end model with lots of extras--leather seats, more \nhorsepower, some electronics, and a fancy stereo. Health coverage just \ndoes not work that way. The\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\ncost of health coverage typically has more to do with the \ncharacteristics of who is being covered: How old are you? Do you have a \nmedical problem? Where do you live? These are some of the factors which \nare taken into consideration when people assess the cost of a health \ncare plan.\n  I am concerned that the new health tax the President proposes would \nhit many people who are older, with chronic conditions, medical \nproblems, those who live in high-cost coverage areas. If this is the \ncase, the tax is highly unfair. It raises the taxes on the people who \ncan afford to pay them the least.\n  It also is going to hit people who have sacrificed wage increases in \nthe past for comprehensive health care coverage. I cannot tell you how \nmany labor unions I visit where they say their members have to make a \nhard call: take-home pay or better health care protection. If they \nchose better health care protection, the President's approach is going \nto penalize them. That is not fair.\n  To make matters worse, the $15,000 cap the President proposes could \nincrease only at the rate of general inflation, even though the cost of \nhealth benefits usually rises much faster than inflation. For example, \nsince 2000, premiums for family coverage for health insurance have \nincreased five times faster than general inflation--a 73-percent \nincrease in premiums for family coverage for health insurance in the \nlast 6 years; and the overall inflation rate, up 14 percent--73 percent \nto 14 percent. So when the President says he is going to index the \n$15,000 in health coverage, it is not going to keep up with the actual \nincrease in health care costs.\n  The administration estimates that 20 percent of people would be \nsubject to this new tax. But that number could grow considerably over \ntime. Before long, people with below-average coverage would start to \npay the tax. That approach only makes sense if the goal of the \nadministration is actually to reduce health care coverage in America--\nhardly a worthy goal of this Nation.\n  The President's plan also misses another critical point. A tax \ndeduction really does not help people with low or moderate incomes. The \nvalue of a tax deduction increases with income. Someone with a high \nincome receives a large deduction under the President's plan. Someone \nwith a lower income, even people with moderate incomes, has little to \nlook forward to. The President should have proposed a tax credit.\n  The last piece of the President's health plan--called the Affordable \nChoices Initiative--is the part about which we know the least. Under \nthis initiative, funds that now go to help hospitals care for low-\nincome and uninsured patients would be taken away and used instead for \nthe purchase of basic private insurance. The plan would snip away the \nexisting safety net without guaranteeing health insurance for everyone. \nEven by the administration's own estimates, only a fraction of the \nuninsured would gain coverage. Already hard-pressed safety net \nproviders would still be responsible for caring for the uninsured and \nunderinsured, yet they would have fewer funds to do so.\n  It appears those who would gain private health insurance would be \nenrolled in health plans that may not meet their needs. The President's \nproposal makes reference to changing State benefit requirements and \npremium-setting rules, which could make health insurance more expensive \nor provide less coverage for those who need it.\n  I appreciate the President has put forward a plan. My vision of \nhealth reform differs from his. We should have a health system that \ncovers everyone regardless of income or health status. We should make \nsure everyone has the health benefits they need to prevent illness and \nto obtain care when they get sick. We should conduct the research that \ntells us which medical interventions work best and create incentives \nfor physicians to provide recommended care, and we need to do a better \njob of managing chronic disease.\n  On the insurance front, the starting point should be legislation I \nhave introduced with Senator Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas. Here \nis a radical concept: What if we established a standard across America \nthat small businesses would be able to offer the same type of health \ninsurance that is available to Members of Congress? How about that for \na revolutionary statement?\n  It turns out that Members of Congress are part of the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program. In other words, we are in the same \npool with 8 million Federal employees and their families all across \nAmerica. Of course, that employee pool includes younger workers, older \nworkers, workers who are healthy and those who are not, and people who \nlive all across our Nation in large cities and small, in rural areas \nand urban areas. It is a plan that has worked for 40 years. For 40 \nyears, we have pooled together Federal employees and we have asked \nprivate insurance companies to bid for their business, and they do.\n\n  We have the best deal as Federal employees. Every year, there is an \nopen enrollment period. Think about this in your own family situation. \nLet's assume you are unhappy with the health insurance you have at work \nor what you had to buy in the individual market. Sometimes you are \nstuck with it, you have no choice in changing it. A Federal employee \nhas a decision each and every year at the end of the calendar year: Did \nyou like the way you were treated last year by your health insurance \ncompany? If you did not, chose another one.\n  In my State of Illinois, my wife and I have nine choices. We can \nchoose from nine different health care plans that could protect us. \nWell, of course, we take a look at what the cost might be, what the \ncoverage might be, and pick the one best for our circumstances. If we \npick a plan with more coverage, they take more out of my paycheck; \nlower coverage, less out of my paycheck--just as it should be.\n  These are private insurance companies bidding for the business of \nFederal employees. The Federal Government administers this plan with an \noverhead cost of less than 2 percent. It is widely popular. It is \nsuccessful. It has worked for 40 years. Why couldn't we take the same \nmodel--that is what Senator Lincoln and I believe--and apply it to \nsmall businesses across America and say no matter where you are, you \ncan join a pool of small businesses, and you as a small business \nemployer and your employees would be sought after by the same private \ninsurance companies?\n  We sat down with some of the major health insurance companies and \nsaid: We don't want to write the bill like legislators. We want to \nwrite the bill like insurance companies. We want to make sure, when it \nis all said and done, there is some potential business for you here. \nWell, they helped us write the bill.\n  We do provide some tax incentives in the bill which I think are \nentirely appropriate. If you have a small business, low-income \nemployees, you still want to have health insurance for the owners of \nthe business and the people who work for you, and you want to offer \nthis and provide a little toward paying those costs, I think we ought \nto reward you. I think the Tax Code ought to create incentives for that \nto happen.\n  Now, we have had a debate within the last year on the floor. Senator \nMike Enzi of Wyoming is my colleague and friend. He sees this issue the \nsame as I do in terms of needing a solution. Our approaches have been \ndifferent. We have sat down to speak since then about how we might \nmerge our two approaches. I hope we can.\n  It would be good for us around here once in a while to cooperate, to \ncompromise, and to come up with a bipartisan approach that says to \nfamilies across America: We are just not coming to the floor to score \npolitical points; we are just not coming here to disagree; we are going \nto try to find areas of agreement and try to move forward so that at \nthe end of the day we can point to a positive accomplishment.\n  I think this bill Senator Lincoln and I have introduced is a good \nstarting point. I believe if a President of the United States said to \nthe American people: We are going to eliminate Americans being \nuninsured in America in just a certain number of years--4 or 5 or 10 \nyears--that would be a positive step forward. We could set a goal, and \nthen it would be up to us in Congress to work with the President each \nyear to reduce the 47 million uninsured even more. I think we can do \nit. I think we have to do it. We cannot be competitive as a nation, we \ncannot have a compassionate policy when it comes to\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\nhealth protection for our fellow citizens unless we show initiative and \nleadership in the area of health care.\n  Our vision differs from the President's that I described earlier, but \nthe goal is important and affects every American. I welcome the \nPresident's interest in health care. Let's begin the debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/28/senate-section/article/S2290-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2290-S2291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VETERANS HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, since this body recessed 10 days ago, I \nhave been outraged to see report after report after report detailing \nthis administration's complete failure to care for our troops and for \nour veterans. What is worse, since we returned on Monday, I have heard \nseveral of our Republican colleagues attempt to question our patriotism \nand our support for those troops. So I felt compelled this morning to \ncome to the floor to speak up.\n  For more than 4 years, this administration has failed to plan for the \ntrue cost of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have demanded blind \nloyalty from Congress, asking us for rubberstamps for their emergency \nbudgets, avoiding oversight, and pursuing their own strategy in the \nface of criticism from Members of Congress, from generals, and the \nAmerican public. Yesterday Senator Martinez, I thought, encapsulated \nthe White House position better than I ever could. He said:\n\n       At a time of war, the Congress should do only one thing, \n     which is to support our President, to try to unite behind our \n     troops and unite behind our effort.\n\n  I couldn't disagree more. As elected Members of Congress, and even as \nmere citizens of this country, we can and we must question the policies \nimplemented by our Government. That is our job. It is our \nresponsibility. At no time is that more important than in a time of war \nwhen the lives of our bravest men and women are on the line.\n  But my colleagues don't have to take my word for it. General Pace, \nthe chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a congressional hearing \nrecently:\n\n       Our troops understand the need for debate back home and are \n     sophisticated enough to know that debate does not equate to \n     lack of support.\n\n  But that important debate, that important discussion, and all \noversight was stifled for years. Unfortunately for everyone, for the \nfirst years of this war Congress was under Republican control and that \nled to a stunning lack of oversight, an outrageous number of \nrubberstamps, and an impotence from this Congress that should shame us \nall.\n  Well, those days are over.\n  I don't have the time this morning to outline each and every failure \nI have seen by the administration. I don't have the time to detail the \nmany ways the administration has failed our troops, our men and women \nwho are serving us. I don't have time to detail how many ways the \nadministration has failed the men and women who serve us when they come \nhome and go into the VA system.\n  So instead I want my colleagues to know I am going to be here on this \nfloor speaking frequently and loudly, because I think it is so \nimportant to get this administration once and for all to pay the troops \nand our veterans the attention they deserve 4 years into this war in \nIraq. My Democratic colleagues and I are committed to supporting our \ntroops from the battlefield all the way back to their local VA and \neverywhere in between. We have worked very hard to ensure they get the \ncare they deserve, the care they have earned.\n  My real worry is that this administration continues to be slow to \nreact to these problems and rarely, if ever, takes proactive measures \nto stop the many problems before they even begin. From sending our \ntroops to war without the critical armor they need to protect \nthemselves, to housing them in squalor at Walter Reed as we heard about \na week ago, to leaving them to fend for themselves when they need \nmental health care, this administration is utterly failing our \nservicemembers, our veterans, and all of their families.\n  Nowhere is that failure more apparent than in the handling of what \nwill one day, I believe, become known as the signature wound of this \nwar, and that is traumatic brain injury. Right now it is estimated that \n10 percent of our Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have suffered from \nthese traumatic brain injuries because of their service. One of the big \nproblems with traumatic brain injury, or TBI, is it is an unseen wound \nand too often it is misdiagnosed. Many times, unless a servicemember is \ninvolved directly in an IED incident and is bleeding, he or she won't \nbe documented as having been involved in that explosion. Even if they \nare two or three tanks behind where the IED exploded, they can get the \nimpact and be a victim of TBI and not know it. As a result, I believe \nthe actual number of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with TBI will be \neven higher than the statistics we are now seeing.\n  We owe it to these men and women in uniform to come on this floor and \nsay: We are going to do everything we can to help you. We should say: \nWe will screen for TBI, we will document TBI, and we will not fail to \ntreat veterans suffering from the signature wound of this war. It is \nclear our system today is not catching all of the TBI patients this war \nis producing.\n  I hope every one of my colleagues saw the special broadcast last \nevening. ABC News anchor Bob Woodruff detailed his own experience with \na traumatic brain injury. I was personally moved by Bob Woodruff's \nstruggle with his injury, by his family's unrelenting hope for \nrecovery, and their ongoing work toward triumph over this horrible \nsituation.\n  While Bob Woodruff has seen a tremendous recovery from his horrendous \ninjury, I fear the care he received has not been duplicated for \nthousands of other troops when they return home. He detailed several \ncases of soldiers who were suffering from injuries not unlike his own, \nand the lack of care they received was clear when they left our \nflagship care centers for some of the smaller local hospitals. While so \nmany of us know this injury has become the signature wound of this war, \nI fear last night's program once again showed us that this \nadministration and the VA in particular has not stepped to the plate to \nhandle the crush of troops with brain injuries who are returning from \nwar each and every day.\n  What is worse, I am very concerned that we do not even know today the \nreal number of troops who are suffering from traumatic brain injury. \nThe Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center, the place that gathers \nall of this information on these injuries, has so far refused--\nrefused--to release it publicly. That information is collected at \ntaxpayer expense, and that information, I hope, could provide us with a \nbaseline of how many of our troops have suffered from a traumatic brain \ninjury. That is a critical and important starting point for dealing \nwith these terrible injuries.\n  What we do know is that while the Department of Defense claims that \nless than 30,000 troops have been injured during this war, 205,000 \ntroops have enrolled for care at the VA. Let me say that again. The \nDepartment of Defense claims that only 30,000 troops--only? That is a \nbig number, 30,000 troops--have been injured, but 205,000 troops have \nenrolled for care at the VA. To me, those numbers don't add up. So \nyesterday I asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates to provide us with the \ndata that has been compiled by the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury \nCenter on the actual number of TBI victims. We don't have this \ninformation yet, but I see no reason why it shouldn't be shared with \nCongress and the American people.\n  In addition, I was heartened to hear, I have to say, yesterday that \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs, in a long overdue step forward, \nfinally announced they will begin screening every recent combat veteran \nfor TBI. But we have to do a lot more. We can't simply take the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs at their word. Their record of care and \nopenness has left a lot to be desired. As every Member of the Senate \nknows, we went through that debate several years ago where they denied \ntime and time again they were short-funded and then came and told us: \nYes, they were indeed billions of dollars short, and we had to provide \nadditional dollars in the supplemental to make sure our veterans were \ngetting the most basic care. The lines are still long. Veterans are not \ngetting care. We are now dealing with a high number of TBI victims of \nthis war and we are not dealing with it realistically.\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\n  We have to develop a system to address traumatic brain injuries, from \nthe battlefield all the way back to the VA hospitals and beyond. \nScreening is absolutely critical. Pre- and post-deployment screening \nhas to be done. This signature wound has to be a top priority at each \nand every step along the path to recovery for these wounded members of \nthe armed services.\n  The bottom line is we have not yet offered our brave men and women a \nreal plan to take care of them when they come home. The Department of \nDefense and Veterans Affairs must come together to solve these problems \nplaguing the system. Too many of our men and women get lost in the \ntransition between the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. I \npledge to them and I pledge to our fighting men and women and to all of \ntheir families that this new Democratic Congress is going to hold them \naccountable for their inaction and finally ensure that we are going to \ngive these men and women what they deserve when they come home.\n  We hear a lot in this body about who supports the troops. Well, I say \nto my colleagues that each and every one of us has a responsibility to \nsupport these troops, particularly those who are injured, particularly \nthose who come home with TBI and other injuries, not just when they \ncome home but far into the future, and we have not yet budgeted \nresponsibly to do that. We have not provided the programs to do that. \nWe have not done everything we can. This is one Senator who is going to \nkeep talking until we get it done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/28/senate-section/article/S2291-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2291-S2292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, in approximately half an hour we begin \nproceeding to debate on the 9/11 bill. Saturday a week ago we concluded \nwithout resolution a debate on an Iraq resolution. I come to the floor \nof the Senate this morning to share with my colleagues my thoughts on \nIraq and where we are, and to do so in the context of 9/11.\n  When I collected my thoughts about what I would say this morning, I \nthought back to a lot of lessons I learned from a great Georgian. In \nfact, on Saturday of last week, the day we had that debate, it was the \n75th birthday of former Senator Zell Bryan Miller of Towns County, GA. \nI learned a lot from Zell Miller in my lifetime. I learned humility \nwhen he beat me for Governor of Georgia in 1990. I learned respect for \nclass in 1996 when he came back and asked me to chair the State Board \nof Education after he taught me a lesson in humility 6 years earlier. \nWhen I read his book, ``Corps Values: Everything You Need to Know I \nLearned in the Marines,'' I learned about commitment.\n  Also in the final debate I had with Zell Miller in 1990, I learned \nabout how you snatch victory when somebody else thought they had it. In \nthe closing debate, 48 hours before the general election when the \ncameras went on each of us for our last 60 seconds, Zell Miller's \nclosing remarks were simply this. He said:\n\n       You know, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to have a race \n     for governor in 2 days and it's all up to you. But I want you \n     to remember something. Zell Miller knows one thing. If you \n     ever walk down a country road and you see a turtle sitting on \n     a fence post, there is one thing you know for sure. He did \n     not get there by himself.\n\n  In taking that remark, I would remind my colleagues we didn't get to \nwhere we are by ourselves. We got here together at least in terms of \nIraq. After 9/11 happened, within days, the United States of America \nchanged and the President announced to the Congress we would no longer \nas a nation have a defense policy based on reaction. We would have a \ndefense policy based on preemption. We learned on 9/11 you can't wait \nto find the smoking gun in terrorism to react, because if you do, it is \ntoo late. In the case of 9/11, there were 3,000 dead citizens of this \nworld because we didn't preempt. The United Nations, 171 countries, \nvoted unanimously in favor of resolution 1441 which authorized or \nthreatened military action against Saddam Hussein if he didn't \ncooperate with the disclosures and the inspectors that the U.N. was \nprompting. When the U.N. failed to act and this President, George W. \nBush, wanted to act, he came to this Congress and we voted \noverwhelmingly to support using force to hold Saddam Hussein \naccountable and to go after weapons of mass destruction and to go after \nthose sanctuaries of terrorism.\n  One would think, in listening to the debate in the Senate in the last \nfew weeks, that some people have bad memories. They forgot about those \nvotes. They forgot about the fact that George Bush didn't get there by \nhimself. He got there with us. Now, are we disappointed in some of the \nthings that have happened? Yes. Do we want to change some things? Yes. \nDo we differ? Yes, and the Senate is the place we differ. But while we \ndiffer, we should not discourage our troops. We should not discourage \nthe people who are deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the \nworld in terms of our resolve.\n  So I would suggest as we go to the debate on the 9/11 bill, we \nconsider it as a wonderful opportunity to make a simple statement, a \nstatement that while we may differ, there is one thing we don't differ \non: We don't differ on the fact that we will give our troops the \nsupport and the finances and everything they need to carry out the \nmission to which they are assigned. That is precisely what Senator Judd \nGregg of New Hampshire wanted to do in his resolution that never could \ncome to the floor in that 2 weeks of debate on the Iraq resolution that \nfailed to get enough votes to get a final vote. It is time, with a bill \nas relevant as this \n9/11, which is the genesis of all we deal with today, that we send that \nclear message. While we may differ on some policies, we do not differ \non the financial support and the absolute commitment to our men and \nwomen in harm's way.\n  I wish to put one other thing into perspective. As much bad news as \nwe always talk about, a lot of good things happen. While some people \nmay differ with the President's commitment to a surge in Iraq, even in \nthe anticipation of that surge, there are some good things that have \nhappened. Moqtada al-Sadr left Sadr City. He saw what was coming. Prime \nMinister al-Maliki already called for--and there are now talks about \nit--a regional conference on Iraq, including all the neighbors in the \nregion--something many in here have called for, and I support, \nincluding getting the Iranians and Syrians into dialog.\n  Last week, the Iraqi council approved the foundation of a hydrocarbon \nbill, oil revenue sharing with the people and provinces of Iraq. That \nis soon to go to that assembly. Think of something; the people of Iraq \nare on the doorstep of having equity for the very first time in their \nhistory.\n  There are also disappointing things that have happened. Yes, we wish \nwe were home with a victory already. But we have accomplished a lot, \nand we are this close to accomplishing the ultimate goal, which is a \npeaceful democracy in Iraq, terrorism without a sanctuary, and a \nstatement that people are more important than power and dictators and \nterror.\n  The United States is the country that has, in history, led and today \nneeds to lead as well. I encourage our colleagues, as we get into this \n9/11 debate, let's not forget about the debate we had on Iraq. We ought \nto send a clear message of support to our troops, understanding that we \nmay differ on the policy. It should be clear and precise that this \nCongress and this country will see to it that our men and women have \nthe finances and resources to carry out the orders to which they are \nresponsible and they take on without any reservation.\n  I began my remarks by acknowledging my friend, Zell Miller, and his \n75th birthday and all of the lessons I have learned from him. He \npreceded me in this Senate, and I extend to him a belated birthday wish \ntoday in this speech. I also want us to be reminded of Zell Miller's \nmany speeches on the U.S. Marine Corps, service to our country, \npatriotism, and commitment. Zell Miller knew as a soldier, he knew as \nthe Governor of a State commanding the National Guard, and as a member \nof the Senate that while there may be political differences on the end \nresult, there should be no difference in the support for the men and \nwomen who defend us and fight for freedom every day.\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\n  As this debate unfolds, it is my hope we will have the opportunity to \nbring the Gregg amendment to the floor and vote to send a clear message \nto our men and women in harm's way that we support them, the funding \nwill be there, and we will stay with them as they pursue the cause on \nbehalf of peace, liberty, freedom, and democracy in Iraq, Afghanistan, \nand around the world.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I recently came to the Senate floor to \nexpress my views relative to the deliberations this body was \nundertaking approving and disapproving of the President's way forward \nin Iraq. I am strongly in favor of this body debating the U.S. policy \nrelative to Iraq and believe all my colleagues are as well.\n  However, as I stated in my earlier speech, it is not appropriate to \nallow the majority party to completely dictate the terms of that \ndebate, as they have tried to do over the last several weeks. That is \nwhy I voted against cloture on the motion to proceed to the Reid \nresolution on February 17, along with a vast majority of my Republican \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, since that time, a new strategy relative to this \ndebate has come forward. The strategy is essentially an attempt to \ndeauthorize or restrict U.S. military action in Iraq by revoking or \naltering the Iraq war resolution, which passed this body by a vote of \n77 to 23 on October 11, 2002. I don't agree with this tactic.\n  On January 26, the Senate unanimously approved GEN David Petraeus for \nhis fourth star and to be commander of the multinational forces, Iraq. \nNo Senator opposed his nomination. General Petraeus supports President \nBush's plan and new strategy in Iraq and has embarked on the mission \nfor which President Bush chose him and for which this body unanimously \nconfirmed him. Once again, now we are being asked to disapprove and \ndeauthorize the very mission we have unanimously confirmed him to \nexecute. Hopefully, my colleagues can see the irony, as well as the \ninconsistency, in the choice they are presenting before this body.\n  As I have said before, we need to give the new strategy in Iraq a \nchance to work. If General Petraeus comes and says it is not working, \nthen I am prepared to change course. President Bush's current strategy \nis not guaranteed to work. However, no approach I have seen or heard \ndiscussed in the past several months has any greater chance of success \nthan the course we are now taking. Therefore, this strategy deserves a \nchance.\n  In talking with some of my colleagues, on the Republican side as well \nas the Democratic side, who recently returned from Iraq, I am very \nhopeful that based on the comments they have made, per their visual \ninspection of what is going on in Iraq today, based upon their \nconversations with General Petraeus, we are seeing some successes, even \nthough they are minimal at this point. But there is now hope and \nencouragement that this strategy is going to work.\n  If Members of Congress truly don't support our efforts in Iraq and \nbelieve we should withdraw troops, they should vote to cut off funds \nfor the war, which is the primary authority Congress has in this area. \nHowever, having refused to allow the Senate to vote on protecting \nfunding for our troops serving in harm's way, the Democrats are now \nproposing another symbolic resolution.\n  This is the fourth resolution that the Senate Democratic leadership \nhas backed to address the troop increase, and the Democrats still \ninsist on avoiding the fundamental issue of whether they will cut off \nfunds for troops serving in Iraq.\n  As the Wall Street Journal wrote in an editorial:\n\n       Democrats don't want to leave their fingerprints on defeat \n     in Iraq by actually voting to bring the troops home. So \n     instead, they're hoping to put restrictions on troop \n     deployments that will make it impossible for the Iraq \n     commander, General David Petraeus, to fulfill his mission.\n\n  This is essentially an attempt to ensure the policy does not succeed. \nLogically, the Senate should be giving General Petraeus everything he \nneeds to succeed, both in terms of financial as well as political \nsupport. But that is not what the majority party is trying to do.\n  Democrats in the House of Representatives have undertaken a plan that \nwould tie war funding in a supplemental spending bill to strict new \nstandards for resetting, equipping, and training troops. This strategy \nto choke off resources and the Senate plan to revise the use of force \nauthorization are attempts to make the war in Iraq unwinnable while \navoiding political responsibility.\n  As Charles Krauthammer has said:\n\n       Slowly bleeding our forces by defunding what our commanders \n     think they need to win or rewording the authorization of the \n     use of force so that lawyers decide what operations are to be \n     launched is no way to fight a war. It is no way to end a war. \n     It is a way to complicate the war and make it inherently \n     unwinnable--and to shirk the political responsibility for \n     doing so.\n\n  There is nothing easy or pretty about war, and this war is no \nexception. Not a day passes that I don't consider the human cost of our \nattempt to defeat the terrorists and eradicate extremism in Iraq and \nreplace it with a self-reliant and representative government.\n  The debate, as we move forward, should focus on how we can most \nquickly and effectively achieve the victory that all of us desire. It \nis not about political posturing. It is about what Congress can do to \nsupport our young men and women in Iraq and help them accomplish this \ncritical mission.\n  Losing the global war on terrorism is not an option. Failure in Iraq \nwould be devastating to our national security, entangling the Middle \nEast in a web of chaos that breeds terror and extremism. The Iraq Study \nGroup and countless expert witnesses have testified that simply leaving \nIraq, without stabilizing the country, would be disastrous.\n  As the senior Senator from my State, my support of our mission and \nour troops includes a responsibility to examine the tactics and \nquestion the steps that we take to reach our goal. I will continue to \ndo that in a very deliberate way, but I intend to be constructive in my \napproach and criticism in order to do everything we can to ensure that \nour troops and our mission succeed, rather than doing whatever I can to \nmake sure they fail.\n  When this motion to deauthorize or micromanage the war in Iraq comes \nto the floor of the Senate, I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/28/senate-section/article/S2292-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMBATING DOMESTIC \n                   RADICALIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The United States is engaged in a struggle against a \n     transnational terrorist movement of radical extremists \n     seeking to exploit the religion of Islam through violent \n     means to achieve ideological ends.\n       (2) The radical jihadist movement transcends borders and \n     has been identified as a potential threat within the United \n     States.\n       (3) Radicalization has been identified as a precursor to \n     terrorism.\n       (4) Countering the threat of violent extremists \n     domestically, as well as internationally, is a critical \n     element of the plan of the United States for success in the \n     war on terror.\n       (5) United States law enforcement agencies have identified \n     radicalization as an emerging threat and have in recent years \n     identified cases of ``homegrown'' extremists operating inside \n     the United States with the intent to provide support for, or \n     directly commit, a terrorist attack.\n       (6) The alienation of Muslim populations in the Western \n     world has been identified as a factor in the spread of \n     radicalization.\n       (7) Radicalization cannot be prevented solely through law \n     enforcement and intelligence measures.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Secretary, in consultation with other relevant Federal \n     agencies, should make a priority of countering domestic \n     radicalization and extremism by--\n       (1) using intelligence analysts and other experts to better \n     understand the process of radicalization from sympathizer to \n     activist to terrorist;\n       (2) recruiting employees with diverse worldviews, skills, \n     languages, and cultural backgrounds and expertise;\n       (3) consulting with experts to ensure that the lexicon used \n     within public statements is precise and appropriate and does \n     not aid extremists by offending the American Muslim \n     community;\n       (4) developing and implementing, in concert with the \n     Attorney General and State and local corrections officials, a \n     program to address prisoner radicalization and post-sentence \n     reintegration;\n       (5) pursuing broader avenues of dialogue with the Muslim \n     community to foster mutual respect, understanding, and trust; \n     and\n       (6) working directly with State, local, and community \n     leaders to--\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\n       (A) educate these leaders on the threat of radicalization \n     and the necessity of taking preventative action at the local \n     level; and\n       (B) facilitate the sharing of best practices from other \n     countries and communities to encourage outreach to the \n     American Muslim community and develop partnerships between \n     all faiths, including Islam.\n\n     SEC. 1303. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING OVERSIGHT OF \n                   HOMELAND SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Senate recognizes the importance and need to \n     implement the recommendations offered by the National \n     Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (in \n     this section referred to as the ``Commission'').\n       (2) Congress considered and passed the National Security \n     Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-458; 118 \n     Stat. 3643) to implement the recommendations of the \n     Commission.\n       (3) Representatives of the Department testified at 165 \n     Congressional hearings in calendar year 2004, and 166 \n     Congressional hearings in calendar year 2005.\n       (4) The Department had 268 representatives testify before \n     15 committees and 35 subcommittees of the House of \n     Representatives and 9 committees and 12 subcommittees of the \n     Senate at 206 congressional hearings in calendar year 2006.\n       (5) The Senate has been unwilling to reform itself in \n     accordance with the recommendation of the Commission to \n     provide better and more streamlined oversight of the \n     Department.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Senate should implement the recommendation of the \n     Commission to ``create a single, principal point of oversight \n     and review for homeland security.''.\n\n     SEC. 1304. REPORT REGARDING BORDER SECURITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to \n     Congress regarding ongoing initiatives of the Department to \n     improve security along the northern border of the United \n     States.\n       (b) Contents.--The report submitted under subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (1) address the vulnerabilities along the northern border \n     of the United States; and\n       (2) provide recommendations to address such \n     vulnerabilities, including required resources needed to \n     protect the northern border of the United States.\n       (c) Government Accountability Office.--Not later than 270 \n     days after the date of the submission of the report under \n     subsection (a), the Comptroller General of the United States \n     shall submit a report to Congress that--\n       (1) reviews and comments on the report under subsection \n     (a); and\n       (2) provides recommendations regarding any additional \n     actions necessary to protect the northern border of the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, with the authority of the Homeland \nSecurity and the Governmental Affairs Committee--that is, the consent \nof a majority of the Members--I now withdraw the committee-reported \nsubstitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a substitute amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Dodd, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 275.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the substitute I have just offered \nencompasses the provisions of S. 4, also legislation on surface \ntransportation security, aviation security, and rail security from the \nCommerce Committee, as well as transit security legislation from the \nBanking Committee.\n  As I said yesterday, I deeply appreciate, as does the distinguished \nRepublican leader, the work done by the two committee managers. Senator \nLieberman and Senator Collins have worked together for a number of \nyears, and they work well together. This is an extremely important \npiece of legislation, and so we ask Members if there is something about \nthe bill that has just been laid down that they don't like, they should \ncome and try to change it and not wait around because they will be \ndisappointed. We have to move through this bill.\n  We have been told there are a number of amendments people have to \noffer, and we want them to do that. I asked the Democratic manager, \nChairman Lieberman, if people offer amendments, to have a reasonable \ndebate. We are not going to mess around here for a long time. With \nappropriate debate, Senator Lieberman is going to move to table if it \nis something we don't like, and I think it is important that Members \nknow that.\n  I have been told there are a lot of amendments on both sides. It is \nour goal to finish this legislation as soon as we can next week. That \nis going to be difficult. We could have some late nights, and as I \nindicated this morning, we might have to work into Friday sometime. \nMonday night, I hope we can stack votes so that we have a number of \nvotes. As I have indicated, we will not have votes starting before \n5:30, but I hope we can have a number of votes at 5:30 so we can \ndispose of them that night.\n  This is what we do. We are legislating now, and I look forward to a \ngood piece of legislation when we finish.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me echo the remarks of the majority \nleader. We have a number of amendments on this side, and we are \nprepared to offer them in the next few hours. I believe the first \namendment is going to come from the Democratic side. Senator Collins is \neither here or on her way, and she is certainly going to manage the \nbill on our side, but then we will follow the Democratic amendment with \nan amendment on our side.\n  I also want to remind everyone that at 2 p.m. this afternoon the \nTransportation Security Administration will hold an all-Members \nbriefing related to the provisions of S. 4, the bill we are now \ndiscussing, which will be pending today. A notice was sent to all \noffices, and Senators should be made aware that this briefing will be \nheld in S407 of the Capitol.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would also say this: We are going to \nalternate back and forth. If there is not a Democrat here, a Republican \nwill offer two amendments in a row, and vice versa. In other words, we \nneed expedition. There are a number of amendments, and we are not going \nto wait while somebody is coming from their office to offer an \namendment. If somebody is here ahead of someone, then they will \nproceed.\n  Our first amendment, if she is here on time, will be from Senator \nFeinstein; otherwise, Senator Collins, I understand, has an amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, while the two leaders are here, I want \nto thank Senator Reid for designating this urgent legislation which \nwould implement the previously unimplemented or inadequately \nimplemented recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. I also thank \nSenator McConnell, the Republican leader, for his cooperation and \nconsent to moving this forward quickly on the Senate floor.\n  This bipartisan cooperation, obviously, is justified by the subject \nmatter, homeland security, and in that regard I want to thank, again, \nSenator Collins. We switched titles in this session of Congress, but as \nI said to her when that happened, nothing else will change but our \ntitles. She has been a wonderful partner and coworker on this measure \nonce again, and it is in that spirit that we invite amendments, as \nSenator Reid said, from our colleagues who may think that, as good as \nthe bill is, it could be better, and we urge them to come forward \nquickly.\n  In our committee, only one amendment was divided on a party-line \nvote. The rest were totally nonpartisan, and I hope that is generally \nthe way things will go on the Senate floor as we consider the \namendments brought forth.\n  Yesterday, to expedite matters, Senator Collins and I both made our \nopening statements, so we do not have those opening statements now. \nTherefore, we look forward to the Senator from California coming to the \nfloor as soon as she can to offer an amendment, which I note will \nconcern visa waiver sections of the measure. Senator Collins has \nanother amendment which we will go to if Senator Feinstein does not \ncome soon.\n  I thank the Chair and, for the moment, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\n                 Amendment No. 271 to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Feinstein, I call up amendment No. 271.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for Mrs. \n     Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 271 to amendment \n     No. 275.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit a foreign country with a visa refusal rate of \n  more than 10 percent or that exceeds the maximum visa overstay rate \n             from participating in the visa waiver program)\n\n       Strike subsection (c) of section 401 and insert the \n     following:\n       (c) Discretionary Visa Waiver Program Expansion.--Section \n     217(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1187(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(8) Nonimmigrant visa refusal rate flexibility.--\n       ``(A) Certification.--On the date on which an air exit \n     system is in place that can verify the departure of not less \n     than 97 percent of foreign nationals that exit through \n     airports of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security shall certify to Congress that such air exit system \n     is in place.\n       ``(B) Waiver.--After certification by the Secretary under \n     subparagraph (A), the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State, may waive the \n     application of paragraph (2)(A) for a country--\n       ``(i) if the country meets all security requirements of \n     this section;\n       ``(ii) if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines \n     that the totality of the country's security risk mitigation \n     measures provide assurance that the country's participation \n     in the program would not compromise the law enforcement, \n     security interests, or enforcement of the immigration laws of \n     the United States;\n       ``(iii) if there has been a sustained reduction in the rate \n     of refusals for nonimmigrant visitor visas for nationals of \n     the country and conditions exist to continue such reduction;\n       ``(iv) the country cooperated with the Government of the \n     United States on counterterrorism initiatives and information \n     sharing before the date of its designation as a program \n     country, and the Secretary of Homeland Security and the \n     Secretary of State expect such cooperation will continue; and\n       ``(v)(I) if the rate of refusals for nonimmigrant visitor \n     visas for nationals of the country during the previous full \n     fiscal year was not more than 10 percent; or\n       ``(II) if the visa overstay rate for the country for the \n     previous full fiscal year does not exceed the maximum visa \n     overstay rate, once it is established under subparagraph (C).\n       ``(C) Maximum visa overstay rate.--\n       ``(i) Requirement to establish.--After certification by the \n     Secretary under subparagraph (A), the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security and the Secretary of State jointly shall use \n     information from the air exit system referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) to establish a maximum visa overstay rate \n     for countries participating in the program pursuant to a \n     waiver under subparagraph (B).\n       ``(ii) Visa overstay rate defined.--In this paragraph the \n     term `visa overstay rate' means, with respect to a country, \n     the ratio of--\n\n       ``(I) the total number of nationals of that country who \n     were admitted to the United States on the basis of a \n     nonimmigrant visitor visa for which the period of stay \n     authorized by such visa ended during a fiscal year and who \n     remained in the United States unlawfully beyond the such \n     period of stay; to\n       ``(II) the total number of nationals of that country who \n     were admitted to the United States on the basis of a \n     nonimmigrant visitor visa for which the period of stay \n     authorized by such visa ended during such fiscal year.\n\n       ``(iii) Report and publication.--Secretary of Homeland \n     Security shall submit to Congress and publish in the Federal \n     Register a notice of the maximum visa overstay rate proposed \n     to be established under clause (i).

Mr. President, I rise today to voice my concern about \nthe efforts to expand the Visa Waiver Program in the 9/11 commission \nreport bill and to offer an amendment that will cap the unlimited \nexpansion of this program.\n  I believe the bill as offered on the floor will make us less safe, \nnot more safe with respect to this huge program called Visa Waiver.\n  The bill would allow the Department of Homeland Security and the \nDepartment of State to expand the Visa Waiver Program without limits. \nMy amendment would limit this discretion based on a 10 percent visa \nrefusal rate or on the actual visa overstay rate.\n  The Visa Waiver Program provides an extraordinary exception to our \nimmigration laws. It allows the citizens of 27 nations to visit this \ncountry by merely showing up on the day of departure with a passport \nfrom their home country. In 2004, the State Department reported that \n15.6 million people came to this country as part of this program. I am \ntold that in 2005, unofficially, the number was at least 15.5 million \nand in 2006, the number was at least 15.6 million.\n  We have no way of knowing how many left because we do not have an \nexit system.\n  The bill on the floor today changes the Visa Waiver Program in a \nnumber of key ways.\n  First, it adds some good security measures, such as the expedited \nreporting of lost and stolen travel documents; and the exchange of \ninformation on terrorist watchlist. It also authorizes the Department \nof Homeland Security to develop an electronic travel authorization \nprogram so that all persons entering the U.S. will have to apply for \nclearance to enter the U.S. in advance of their trip. And it requires \nthe Department of Homeland Security to develop a system to track all \nthe foreign visitors who leave the U.S. via our airports--but not our \nseaports or land ports. This has been an unmet goal, however, year \nafter year.\n  I welcome and support the enhanced security measures included in the \nbill. They are long overdue.\n  Second--and here is the problem--the bill allows the Department of \nHomeland Security and the Department of State to fundamentally change \nthe way countries are admitted into the visa waiver program, and thus, \nwho can come into the U.S. without getting a visa.\n  Under current law, a country is eligible for this program so long as \nthe vast majority--at least 97 percent--of its nationals can get a visa \nwhen they apply for one. The percentage of people who are rejected when \nthey apply for a visa is called the ``visa refusal rate'' and that \npercentage must be under 3 percent for a country to participate in the \nprogram.\n  The rationale is that if the overwhelming majority of visitors \nsatisfy requirements for a U.S. visa when they apply, we should not \nwaste our resources and the time of U.S. consular officers to evaluate \nevery single visa application. The 3 percent rate means that 97 percent \nof these applicants will return to their home country for one reason or \nanother. They have family and earn a satisfactory living.\n  But even with a 3 percent rejection rate, the Visa Waiver Program is \na security problem.\n  Convicted terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui from France and ``shoe-\nbomber'' Richard Reid from Great Britain both boarded flights to the \nUnited States with passports issued by Visa Waiver Program countries.\n  On August 10 of this past year, British police charged 17 suspects \nwith a terrorist plot to detonate liquid explosives carried on board \nseveral airliners traveling from the United Kingdom to the United \nStates. The key suspects were reported to be British-born Muslims, \neligible to travel to the U.S. with just a passport in hand.\n  For that reason, I believe that the current Visa Waiver Program is \nthe soft underbelly of our national security.\n  But this bill undermines even the scant protection afforded by our \ncurrent laws in that it allows the administration to admit new \ncountries into the program with complete disregard for how many people \nwere previously rejected when they applied for a U.S. visa. My \namendment would provide a meaningful limit to that discretion.\n  This bill does not affect just a handful of countries. It would \naffect any\n\n[[Page S2320]]\n\nand every country whose nationals travel to the United States.\n  As a matter of fact, the ``roadmap'' countries--or countries that the \nadministration is currently talking to about inclusion in the Visa \nWaiver Program--total 19. So the Departments of State and Homeland \nSecurity are actively talking with 19 countries for acceptance into \nthis Program.\n  A significant number of these 19 countries have visa rejection rates \nthat are well above 3 percent. They are marked with an asterisk, and \ntotal 13 of the 19. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a chart showing by country the rejection rates.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n        Country Name                        2006 Refusal Rate (Percent)\nArgentina*..........................................................6.7\nBrazil*............................................................13.2\nBulgaria*..........................................................17.5\nCyprus..............................................................2.2\nCzech Republic*.....................................................9.4\nEstonia*............................................................7.1\nGreece..............................................................2.2\nHungary*...........................................................12.7\nIsrael..............................................................4.2\nKorea, South........................................................3.6\nLatvia*............................................................21.6\nLithuania*.........................................................27.7\nMalta...............................................................2.8\nPoland*............................................................26.2\nRomania*...........................................................34.1\nSlovakia*..........................................................16.0\nTaiwan..............................................................3.1\nTurkey*............................................................15.4\nUruguay*...........................................................12.6\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, 544 million people are eligible \nto travel into the U.S. without a visa as part of the Visa Waiver \nProgram. If we add these ``roadmap'' countries to the program, we will \nadd 162 million more people who can travel into the United States \nwithout a visa--a 30 percent increase.\n  And if these 19 additional ``roadmap'' countries can come into the \nprogram, what is to preclude any other country from coming into the \nprogram? How do we say ``no'' to India, also a good ally, when its \nrefusal rate--19.5 percent--is lower than 4 of the roadmap--countries? \nThe rejection rate for China--24.5 percent--is lower than those coming \nfrom Romania. Indonesia, at 35.1 percent just exceeds Romania. So this \nbill will likely set up some real conflicts and create additional \nproblems.\n  The administration has argued that the expansion of the visa waiver \ncountries should be limited to our allies. But what does it mean to be \nan ally? According to this administration, when we invaded Iraq we \ncounted Colombia with a 33.3 percent visa rejection rate, and \nNicaragua, with a 48 percent rejection rate among our allies because \nthey had provided some assistance in war.\n  Do we, in Congress, really want to give the administration unfettered \nflexibility to allow nationals from any country to travel to the U.S. \nwithout a visa, simply because their governments have cooperated with \nours?\n  Does that mean that those nationals should be allowed to come to the \nUnited States with no advance screening?\n  We can only assume that we will also significantly increase the \nnumber of people who will not leave the United States after their visa \nexpires. In this manner, this bill, if enacted into law, will likely \nadd many thousands, if not millions, to the undocumented or illegal \npopulation.\n  Remember, today, 30 to 40 percent of the illegal population are, in \nfact, visa overstays--people who come with temporary or visitor visas \nand do not return to their countries.\n  I believe we should not expand this program without a good hard look \nat how it will compromise our national security, law enforcement, and \nimmigration goals and without ensuring that safety measures are in \nplace to make the program strong.\n  First, whenever the United States adds new countries to the program, \nit increases the demand for, and the availability of, fraudulent travel \ndocuments.\n  The value of lost, stolen or fraudulent Visa Waiver Program documents \nis enormous. A person carrying a visa waiver country passport has \nvirtually unlimited access into and out of the United States.\n  No doubt, the expansion of the program will increase the use of \nfraudulent border documents which are sold on the black market in the \ntens of thousands: passports, international driver's licenses, and \nother forms of identification from new visa waiver countries will flood \nthe market.\n  According to the July 2006 GAO report on improving the security of \nthe Visa Waiver Program, visa waiver travel documents have been used by \ncriminals and terrorists seeking to disguise their true identity.\n  In 2004, more than 15 million people from 27 countries traveled in \nand out of the United States with no visa.\n  And from January through June 2005--a 6-month period--the Department \nof Homeland Security reported that it confiscated 298 fraudulent or \naltered passports issued by Visa Waiver Program countries that \ntravelers were attempting to use to enter the United States. And these \nare just the ones who got caught.\n  In fact, Interpol reports that they have records of more than 12 \nmillion stolen and lost travel documents in their database, but that \nthere are 30 to 40 million travel documents have been stolen worldwide.\n  We can extrapolate that tens of thousands of those documents are from \nvisa waiver countries.\n  As the 9/11 Commission report demonstrates, individuals with \nfraudulent documents pose a far greater threat to our national security \nthan those traveling with no documents at all.\n  For that reason, Senator Sessions and I have introduced a bill this \nCongress to crack down on people who traffic in lost and stolen travel \ndocuments.\n  The second problem is that some countries have very weak policies on \nwho can become a citizen--and therefore legally obtain travel \ndocuments. Not every country has the same strict controls on who can \nbecome a citizen as the U.S. does.\n  For example, Romania, one of the ``road map'' countries, extends \ncitizenship to many citizens of Ukraine or Moldova as a matter of \ncourse without prior residency requirements. Ukraine and Moldova are \nnot slated to participate in the visa waiver program, and in fact, have \nvisa rejection rates of 38.7 percent and 34.2 percent, respectively. \nAdding Romania is like adding Ukraine and Moldova. How would their \ninclusion impact national security?\n  Finally, this bill does not go far enough to protect U.S. borders.\n  The bill requires the development of an air exit system, but it does \nnothing to track who comes and goes by way of our land and sea ports.\n  It also requires the Department of Homeland Security to track how \nmany people overstay their visas, but it does not require them to use \nthis information to determine who can participate in the program.\n  For example, even if we learn that one out of four Lithuanian \nvisitors never returns to Lithuania when their visa expires, Lithuania \ncould still participate in the Visa Waiver Program.\n  Again, experts estimate that between 30 percent and 40 percent of \nthose undocumented people living in the U.S. today are here because \nthey ignored the time limits on their visa and just never went back \nhome.\n  At a time when this country is torn about how to handle the 12 \nmillion undocumented people currently living here, we must consider who \nplays by the rules when we talk about who participates in the program.\n  If a high number of travelers from countries overstay their visas, \nthen those countries should not be allowed the benefit of permitting \ntheir nationals to enter the U.S. without a background check and a \nconsular interview.\n  The amendment I am proposing today offers a way to limit the \nexpansion of the Visa Waiver Program in light of our immigration and \nnational security concerns.\n  The amendment I am offering would increase the visa rejection rate \nunder the current law from 3 percent to 10 percent for countries that \nagree to these enhanced security measures.\n  The result is that countries such as South Korea, 3.6 percent, \nTaiwan, 3.1 percent, Estonia, 7.1 percent, and the Czech Republic, 9.4 \npercent could be eligible to participate in the program provided they \npass the security requirements this bill imposes.\n  Then, once the U.S. has statistics on which foreign nationals \nregularly overstay their visa, the government should use those \nstatistics to decide who can participate in the program.\n  My amendment would require the Departments of Homeland Security and \nState, in consultation and with the approval of Congress, to set a \nmeaningful\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\noverstay rate once they have that data. Then countries with a proven \ntrack record--those with nationals who go home when they are supposed \nto go home--could be eligible for the program.\n  The answer is not to entirely remove the visa rejection rate, 3 \npercent, as this bill does with no suitable replacement, but to enact a \nfair system across the board that recognizes that the screening of \nthose who wish to come to our country is important, both for the \nsecurity of the country, as well as to ensure that visitors do what \ntheir ``visa waiver'' provides--and that is to return to their country \nof origin at the end of the 90-day period.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, there are discussions going on between \nthe Senator from California and others to answer a question or two \nabout the amendment, so for the moment we are going to leave it \npending, and I yield for my colleague from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have only had a brief time to look at \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from California, but it would, in \nmy judgment, enhance certain provisions in the underlying bill on the \nvisa waiver program. There are discussions going on with key Senators \non our side of the aisle, such as Senator Kyl of Arizona, who has also \na great interest in this area.\n  We are not prepared on this side to proceed with a full discussion of \nthe amendment at this time or to dispose of it at this time, but I \nwould inform my colleagues that I am optimistic that the discussions \nwill produce a fruitful result. At this time, we cannot proceed to \ndisposing of the amendment, however.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, Parliamentary inquiry: Am I correct \nthat the Feinstein amendment, No. 271, is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I have been informed the questions one Member was \nraising about the amendment of Senator Feinstein have been resolved. I \nnow urge we adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nMaine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, to clarify for our colleagues, the \nobjection or the clarification I mentioned earlier has been resolved on \nthis side of the aisle. I know of no objection to adopting the \namendment of Senator Feinstein. I believe it strengthens the provisions \nin the underlying bill and I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 271) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 277\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment to \naddress the growing concern among States regarding the implementation \nof the REAL ID Act of 2005. This law requires States to meet minimum \nsecurity standards before citizens can use their driver's licenses for \nFederal purposes, such as boarding an airplane. I am very pleased to \nhave several cosponsors of this amendment, including Senator Alexander, \nSenator Carper, Senator Cantwell, Senator Snowe, and Senator Mikulski. \nAll of them have expressed concerns about the impact on their States. I \nparticularly wish to single out Senator Alexander,\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\nwho has long been a leading voice in raising concerns about the costs \nimposed upon States by the REAL ID Act.\n  As the deadline for compliance for the REAL ID Act rapidly \napproaches, States are beginning to send a very clear message that they \nare deeply concerned they simply will not be able to meet these \nstandards. The amendment I introduce today recognizes those concerns by \nallowing more time to devise a way to make driver's licenses more \nsecure without unduly burdening State governments and without \nthreatening privacy and civil liberties.\n  To begin with, perhaps some background information would be useful. \nThe 9/11 Commission's investigation found that all but one of the 9/11 \nterrorists had acquired some form of U.S. identification--in most cases \na State driver's licenses. The Commission recommended that the Federal \nGovernment should set standards for the issuance of driver's licenses \nto make them more secure, to ensure the person was, in fact, entitled \nto a driver's license, and to make certain the driver's license has \ncertain security features to ensure the individual is who he or she \nclaims to be.\n  To implement that recommendation, which was indeed in response to a \nvery real concern identified by the 9/11 Commission, I worked with a \nbipartisan group of Senators, most notably my colleague, Senator \nLieberman, to craft a provision in the 2004 Intelligence Reform Act \nthat would accomplish the goal of the Commission. It called for the \ncreation of a committee of experts from the Federal Government, from \nState governments, from privacy groups, from technology information \norganizations, to come together in a negotiated rulemaking process and \nto develop a means of providing secure identification, while protecting \nprivacy and civil liberty rights, and also respecting the role of the \nStates, which have always had the primary responsibility in this area.\n  The language we came up with also provided for some grants that would \nhelp the States bear this cost--not the whole cost but to help them \nout.\n  This committee was indeed appointed--indeed, at my recommendation, \nMaine's secretary of state was one of the members--and they began \ndiligently working on this task. Unfortunately, before the committee \ncould complete its work, the House of Representatives attached the REAL \nID Act of 2005 to an emergency war supplemental, a bill that was truly \nurgent. There was not a lot of consideration in the Senate nor debate \nover this provision. It was inserted into the emergency war \nappropriations bill.\n\n  The effect of that was to repeal the negotiated rulemaking provisions \nthat we had worked so hard to craft and to put into the Intelligence \nReform Act of 2004. The further effect, therefore, was to halt the very \nproductive and worthwhile progress this committee was making in \ndevising standards to improve security without imposing unnecessary \nburdens and costs on State governments.\n  Unlike our Intelligence Reform Act, the REAL ID Act of 2005 did not \ninclude States and other interested parties, whether privacy advocates \nor technological experts, in the rulemaking process. Instead, the REAL \nID Act simply instructed the Department of Homeland Security to write \nits own regulations. It has been almost 2 years since the REAL ID Act \nwas passed, and the Department has yet to issue the detailed guidance \nthe States need to comply with the law. We expect these regulations are \njust about to be published, that they are about to be issued under the \nformal notice and comment period later this week.\n  The problem is, the States are facing this looming May of 2008 \ndeadline for being in full compliance with the REAL ID Act. That is an \nenormously constricted period for the States to comply, when the \nregulations have not yet been issued.\n  As States begin work this year on their 2008 budgets, they still have \nno idea what the final regulations will require of them, but they do \nknow that the costs are likely to be substantial based on a study \nreleased in 2006 by the National Governors Association. The NGA \nestimated that the costs to States to implement the REAL ID Act could \ntotal more than $11 billion over the next 5 years. This is a \nsubstantial amount. Perhaps the cost will be less than that, but the \npoint is, we don't know because the regulations with the detailed \nguidance have still not been issued, even as we speak.\n  The State of Maine reports that the costs of implementation of the \nREAL ID Act could total $158 million. The Secretary of State tells me \nthat is more than six times the normal operating budget of the Maine \nBureau of Motor Vehicles.\n  The result has been an increasing rebellion by States over this \nunfunded, very difficult mandate. Some States, including my home State \nof Maine, have passed resolutions that have sent the message to \nWashington that they cannot and will not implement the REAL ID Act by \nthe May 2008 deadline. So what do we do?\n  Here is what my amendment proposes. I have had extensive \nconsultations with the National Governors Association, the National \nCouncil of State Legislatures, and other experts on this issue.\n  My amendment has two primary objectives. The first is to give the \nFederal Government and States the time and flexibility they need to \ncome up with an effective but practical system to provide secure \ndriver's licenses.\n  Second, my amendment would ensure the involvement of experts from the \nStates, from the technology industry, and privacy and civil liberties \nadvocates, by bringing them back to the table and giving them a chance \nto review these regulations and make them work.\n  There are three major provisions in the amendment we are offering. \nFirst, the amendment provides that States would not have to be in full \ncompliance with the REAL ID Act until 2 years after the final \nregulations are promulgated. That is reasonable. This is a difficult \ntask, and it is important that we get it right. It is important for our \nsecurity, but it is also important for the States that have been \nburdened with the task. That means no matter how long it takes for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to finish these regulations, States \nwill have a full 2 years to implement them. Most likely, the impact of \nthat is to delay from May of next year to May of 2010 the compliance \ndate. That is the likely timeframe about which we are talking.\n  Second, the amendment would give the Secretary of Homeland Security \nmore flexibility to waive certain requirements of REAL ID, if an aspect \nof the program proves to be technically difficult to implement. I have \ntalked with some technology experts. Some of them say it can be done. \nSome of them say this is an enormous task because we are talking about \nhaving interlocking databases so that States can check with other \nStates on whether an individual is licensed there. That is a very \ncomplex project because, not surprisingly, each State has its own \nsystem. So there are questions about the technology and the feasibility \nof all of the requirements of the REAL ID Act. We want to give the \nSecretary some flexibility in that area.\n  It is possible that some of the technological links necessary for \nREAL ID may not be fully in place at the time that compliance is \nrequired. On the other hand, if the technology is there and the systems \nare up and running, it will be easier for the States to proceed. That \nis another advantage of the extension in time. The technology is only \ngoing to get better and become more effective.\n  This also gives us more time to address privacy concerns because \nthere are a lot of questions, if you have people throughout the country \nworking in motor vehicle bureaus who are now going to have access to \ndatabases and are going to need training in evaluating the underlying \ndocuments, whether they are birth certificates or visas, in determining \ntheir validity. So this is a complicated task.\n\n  Third, the amendment reconstitutes the committee that we created in \n2004, and that was making such good progress in its deliberations \nbefore these provisions were repealed by the REAL ID Act. This \ncommittee would be required to look at the regulations published by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and to make suggestions for \nmodifications to meet the concerns of States, privacy advocates, and \nother interested parties. Within 120 days of convening, the committee \nwould report its recommendations to the Department of Homeland Security \nand to Congress. So we are not throwing out\n\n[[Page S2323]]\n\nthe work that has already been done by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. It doesn't make sense to go back to square one, to go back to \nscratch, as the 2004 bill had proposed. Instead, we create this \ncommittee, bringing all the stakeholders to the table. They would take \na rigorous look at the regulations that are issued, and they would make \nrecommendations to the Department and to us so that we could exercise \nour oversight.\n  The Department of Homeland Security would then either have to make \nthe recommendations recommended by this committee or explain why it \nchose not to. So we would have much more transparency and \naccountability in the process.\n  In addition, the committee could recommend to Congress, if they \nbelieved that statutory changes are needed to mitigate concerns that \ncould not be addressed by modifications to the regulations. That is an \nimportant safeguard as well.\n  The amendment we are offering would give us time, the information \nthat Congress and the Department of Homeland Security need to better \nimplement the recommendations of the \n9/11 Commission in order to make our driver's licenses secure so that \nthey cannot again be used to facilitate a plot to attack our country.\n  There is a real problem. The 9/11 Commission was correct in \nidentifying the ease with which the hijackers were able to secure \ndriver's licenses. But let's come up with not only an effective \nsolution to the problem identified but also a practical one. We don't \nhave to choose one versus the other. We can come up with a cost-\neffective, efficient, effective way to achieve this goal. This bill \ndoes so in a way that does not rewind the clock 3 years but instead \nkeeps us moving to a more secure America.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to address REAL ID and to put us back on the right track to \nprotect our country, to protect our privacy, to protect our liberty, \nand to do so in a practical way.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Collins \namendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, it is actually a Collins-Alexander \namendment, along with several of our colleagues. I am very pleased to \nnote the Senator from Tennessee, who has been such a leader and such an \nearly voice raising concerns about the implications of the REAL ID Act \nfor State governments, is here on the floor. As a former Governor, he \nhas a better appreciation than many of us of the burden this act \nimposes on the States. So I am very pleased the Senator is here and I \nyield to him such time as he may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee, the coauthor of \nthe amendment, is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maine and I \nsalute the Senator from Maine. She is paying close attention not just \nto the security of our country but the fact that we need strong States \nand cities in our country at the same time. She, obviously, is in tune \nwith the people in Maine because they, like people in Tennessee and \nother States, have taken a look at the so-called REAL ID law and \nwondered what we are doing up here.\n  She has made a very thoughtful and sensible suggestion, which is that \nwe delay for 2 years the implementation of the so-called REAL ID law, \nand let's make sure we know what we are doing.\n  Senator Collins, because she is ranking member of the committee that \ndeals with homeland security and a former chairman, and because she \nserved in State government, is more sensitive to this issue than \nperhaps some of our colleagues. But she understands it is very easy for \nthose of us in Washington to stand up here and come up with a big idea \nand think it might be a good idea, and then turn it into a law and hold \na press conference and take credit for it, and then send the bill to \nthe Governor and the legislature and say: You pay for it.\n  Senator Collins is more polite about this than I might be. Nothing \nused to make me madder when I was Governor than for legislators and \nCongressmen to do just that: to pass a big bill, take credit for it, \nand send the bill to the State. Then that same Congressman would \nusually be back in Tennessee making a Lincoln Day speech or a Jefferson \nDay speech or a Jackson Day speech about local control and saying how \nwe need strong States and strong cities, but they dumped a big unfunded \nmandate on top of us.\n  So let me see if I can be in support of Senator Collins, who has made \na very reasonable, sensible amendment: First, to think about what we \nare doing with REAL ID and to make sure if we want to continue down \nthis path, we do it in a way that respects the privacy of Americans. We \nare, after all, for the first time in our history actually creating a \nnational identification card with all the ramifications of that. That \nis what the REAL ID law did. Second, to make sure that we don't create \nan unfunded mandate. The Republican Congress in 1994 was ushered in \nclaiming no more unfunded mandates. The Congressmen stood on the steps \nover there in the House and said: If we break our promise, throw us \nout. Well, they threw us out this past election, so why would we \npersist with unfunded mandates?\n  This is an $11 billion unfunded mandate on State governments over the \nnext 5 years. What does that mean? Higher property taxes, higher \ntuition costs, less funding for higher education so we can stay \ncompetitive with China and India, less money for lower classroom sizes, \nand less money for rewarding outstanding teachers. That is what \nunfunded mandates will mean, so we shouldn't do that.\n  Then the third thing that is unfortunate about this REAL ID law that \npassed is we didn't have the opportunity to say anything about it over \nhere in the Senate. Now, we are not always the wisest people in \nWashington, DC, but we have half the say. The REAL ID Act came up in \nthe House of Representatives. It was stuffed into the supplemental \nappropriations bill for Katrina and the troops in Iraq. So of course we \nhad to vote for the bill. We had no chance to amend it, no debate, no \nhearings, and no consideration of other alternatives. Yet we impose on \nevery State in this country a total of $11 billion worth of unfunded \nmandates, and we create for the first time in the history of a liberty-\nloving nation a national identification card. I would say we wouldn't \nbe doing our job if we didn't stop and think about what we have done. \nFortunately, we have time to stop and think about it, because while the \nlaw has been passed, it is not implemented yet.\n  Here is what Senator Collins has done, and I give her great credit \nfor this. For her to introduce this amendment is especially useful \nbecause of her position as former chairman of the affected committee \nand now its ranking member. She has quickly attracted several \ncosponsors, Republicans and Democrats. She would extend the deadline \nfor compliance with REAL ID to 2 years after final regulations are \nissued by the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Now, from the point of view of a Governor, that makes sense. If I \nwere sitting back in Nashville, I would say: Well, now, Madam \nCongressman or Mr. Congressman, you are not going to expect me to take \n3 or 4 million Tennesseans and run them through the State driver's \nlicense offices and find out if they are terrorists or if they are \nillegally here, or send them back home to grandma's attic and dig up \ntheir birth certificates, are you? I mean how many Tennesseans have \ntheir birth certificates handy? How many want to go back to the \ndriver's license office and stand in line? That is a lot of people, 3 \nor 4 million people, and that is only Tennessee. There are over 196 \nmillion people with driver's licenses in the United States.\n  There is another section or two in Senator Collins' amendment. She \ngives a little more discretion to the Secretary of DHS to waive State \ndeadlines. That is a reasonable approach. She reestablishes the \nnegotiated rulemaking committee that was created as part of the \nNational Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. That means in plain\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\nEnglish that States that have the job of implementing this law will \nhave a chance to come to the Federal Government and say: Well, in \nMinnesota, we have longer lines during this part of the year because it \nsnows and shorter lines during that part of the year because there is \nice. And in other times of the year people are fishing on their lakes, \nand so we have some local conditions here. This gives more time to take \ninto consideration the local conditions.\n  Also, it requires figuring out what a fair system of reimbursement \nis. Here are the figures I have seen: Apparently we have appropriated \n$40 million for this. The Senator from Maine is nodding her head. Yet, \nthe Governors tell us it is going to cost $11 billion. We have \nappropriated $40 million. They say it is going to cost $11 billion. We \nhave a 60-vote point of order against unfunded Federal mandates. We \ncouldn't even raise that when this went through like a freight train in \nthe middle of a Katrina and troops-in-Iraq bill. There would have to be \n60 votes in order to impose on the States this kind of financial \nburden.\n  So that is basically it. This amendment says let's stop and think \nabout this since this is the first national identification card we have \never had in this country. And since it is a massive unfunded mandate \nthat would have the effect, if the Governors are right, of raising \nState taxes, raising tuition, cutting the amount of money available for \ncolleges and competitiveness, cutting money for reducing classroom \nsize, and cutting money for State health care plans.\n  Then the third thing is we had no discussion--I don't believe there \nwas a single hearing anywhere in the Senate--about this bill. I am \ndelighted to have a chance to be a cosponsor of this legislation that \nSenator Collins has introduced.\n\n  I will say one other thing about this idea of a national \nidentification card. I have lived long enough to have changed my mind a \nfew times on important issues. When I was Governor of Tennessee, I \nvetoed twice the photo identification card I now carry in my billfold \nbecause I thought it was an infringement on civil liberties and I \ndidn't think it was anybody's business to have my picture on the \nidentification card. Well, the retailers wanted it for check cashing, \nand law enforcement people wanted it so they could catch more \ncriminals. So the legislature overrode me. Plus, when I tried to get \ninto the White House one time as Governor, they wouldn't let me in \nbecause I didn't have a photo identification card and I said: Well, I \nvetoed it, and they didn't think that was a good reason. The Governor \nof Georgia had to vouch for me, and after that indignity, Tennessee \nfinally got a photo identification card.\n  We have a right in America to be skeptical of national identification \ncards. We love liberty more than anything in this country, and that \ncould infringe on our liberty. We have seen what happened in South \nAfrica when people carried around passports and they were classified \nbased on race, and their lives, their activities, everything about them \nwas regulated that way. We can think back on Nazi Germany and other \ntotalitarian countries where so much information was on a single card \nthat it gave the Government a good chance to keep up with every single \nperson.\n  I have changed my mind after 9/11. I believe we need a national \nidentification card of some kind, and we, in fact, have one now. It is \na de facto identification card. We call it the driver's license, but it \nis completely ineffective. It gets stolen. It gets copied. We show it \nwhen we go through the line at an airport. For a long time, mine said \non the front that it expired in the year 2000, but if you turn it over, \nit said 2005. Well, at the airport they never turned it over so it is \nnot a very effective identification card, and that is the impetus for \nthe REAL ID. I understand that.\n  The first thought was let's take all of these 196 million driver's \nlicenses and turn them into identification cards, but that might not be \nthe best thought. There are other options. For example, we might need a \nwork card in the United States. A lot of the impetus for this came from \nimmigration problems. Since many of the immigration problems are the \nresult of people wanting to come here and work, maybe one way to think \nabout identity theft is to say: Let's have a Social Security card that \nis biometric and let people apply for that; let people who get new \ncards get that, and let's have a work card. Or maybe we need a travel \ncard for people who want to travel on airplanes, and they would have a \ntravel card. Maybe we need to expand the number of passports. Twenty-\nfive percent of us have passports. I am not sure what the right answer \nis. My instinct is that probably a work card would be a good card to \nhave. Maybe we ought to have two or three cards that meet certain \nFederal requirements, any of which could be used for other \nidentification purposes. That way we would technically avoid having the \nnational identification card, but for convenience, people could have a \nwork card, a travel card, and a passport. All of those are just ideas. \nBut I wouldn't suggest that the Senate wait until midnight and take \nSenator Alexander's ideas, ram them through, and send them to the House \nand tell them to pass them with the next Iraq supplemental bill just \nbecause we thought of it.\n  I think it would be better to let Senator Lieberman and Senator \nCollins and others consider all of these options very carefully. I \nthink it might be best when we get to the immigration bill and we talk \nabout having an employer identification system, because that is going \nto be an essential part of the comprehensive immigration bill. Well, if \nthat is the case, then we are probably going to need some kind of work \ncard. If that is the case, we might end up with a secure Social \nSecurity card. If that is the case, we might not need REAL ID at all.\n  So that is an even better reason to adopt the Collins amendment, \nbecause between now and the expiration of 2 years, we should pass a \ncomprehensive immigration bill here in Congress. In fact, if we don't, \nwe should all be severely criticized, because it is our job to do it. \nSo I urge my colleagues respectfully to look at the Collins amendment \nand see it as a reasonable approach. It says: Let's delay 2 years. \nLet's hold some hearings. Let's ask the States to be more involved in \nwhat the cost is. Let's think about any privacy issues that might \nresult from a de facto national identification card, and let's even \nmake sure, if we are going to have an identification card, that the \nidea of using driver's licenses is the best way to do it.\n  As my last comment, I would underscore the fact that there are a \nnumber of States already considering taking the action Maine has \nalready taken, the Senator's State, in passing a resolution rejecting \nthe REAL ID card. Those are Hawaii, Georgia, Massachusetts, New Mexico, \nOklahoma, Vermont, and Washington State. If the REAL ID card were to go \ninto effect in those States in May, next spring, and they didn't have \nthe REAL ID card, according to the law they can't fly on a commercial \nairplane. Well, that is going to create a situation I don't think any \nMember of this Senate wants to see.\n  So I am here to salute the Senator from Maine for being diligent in \nprotecting our liberty and in protecting the rights of State and local \ngovernments, and making sure that if we are going to have some kind of \nmore secure card, whether it is a driver's license or a work card, a \ntravel card, or even a passport, that we do it right after we have \nsuitable hearings.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Collins amendment, and I thank \nthe Senator for yielding time to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for \nhis excellent statement. He outlined the issue very well.\n  I emphasize two points the Senator made. First is the cost. The \nNational Governors Association has estimated that compliance with the \nrequirements of the REAL ID card will impose $11 billion of costs on \nState governments over the next 5 years. Yet we have appropriated only \n$40 million to be used toward that cost, and of that amount the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has only allocated $6 million, so only \na tiny fraction of the expected cost.\n  The second point I emphasize is the Department of Homeland Security \nhas yet to issue the regulations detailing how States are to comply \nwith the law.\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\nSo to expect the States to comply by May of next year with regulations \nthat have yet to be issued is simply unfair and will add another layer \nof costs because of the short time for compliance. This 2 years will \nallow a more careful review. It will allow more input by the States \nwhen DHS does issue the regulations, and it will allow us to devise a \ncost-effective way of achieving a goal all of us have, and that is to \nmake driver's licenses more secure.\n  I am very grateful for the insights of the Senator from Tennessee, \nfor his support, and for his very early leadership on this issue.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the provisions included in the Commerce \nCommittee title, title 13 of the substitute amendment, reflect the \nCommerce Committee's relentless efforts to tackle emerging issues and \nbuilding upon existing security transportation legislation. The \nprovisions included in the Commerce title improve and enhance our \nsecurity efforts across all modes: rail, truck, motor carrier, \npipeline, and aviation.\n  Senator Stevens and I, and our colleagues on the Commerce Committee \nare no strangers to the issue of transportation security. In fact, the \nCommerce Committee responded and the Congress enacted immediately in \nthe aftermath of the 9/11 attack landmark aviation and maritime \nsecurity laws.\n  Last year, the Congress took its first step in 4 years, to \nsignificantly improve the Nation's transportation security system by \nenacting the Commerce Committee's SAFE Port Act, which strengthened the \nsecurity of our Nation's ports and maritime vessels.\n  While significant in terms of the protections provided to our ports \nand maritime system, the Congress failed during conference to seize the \nopportunity to enact comprehensive transportation security legislation \nthat would have addressed many of the gaps in other modes of the \ntransportation system.\n  Today we begin to correct that shortcoming with the proposed \nlegislation before us.\n  The Commerce title to the substitute amendment before the Senate \naddresses transportation security for our rail, motor carrier, and \npipeline industries. The economic importance of these three industries \ncan not be overstated.\n  While 95 percent of the Nation's cargo comes through our ports, our \nrail system and our motor carriers move these goods from our coasts and \nborders, through the interior of this country, to their final \ndestinations. Together, these systems are the backbone that sustains \nour economy.\n  In terms of rail security, the Nation's 560-plus freight railroads \nown more than 140,000 miles of track over which nearly 30 million \ncarloads are transported annually. This network transports 42 percent \nof all domestic intercity freight, the majority of coal used in \nelectricity generation, more than 12 million trailers and containers, \nand two million carloads of chemicals. Meanwhile, U.S. trucking hauled \n9.1 billion tons of freight and employed 5.6 million people in trucking \nrelated fields in 2003.\n  Equally important is the contribution that these modes make in moving \npassengers throughout our Nation. Approximately 24 million passengers \nride Amtrak annually, and there are nearly 3.4 billion passenger and \ncommuter rail trips in this country each year. Similarly, over-the-road \nbuses transport approximately 600 million passengers annually and are \nthe only viable means of public transportation for many people \nthroughout the country.\n  The recent attacks on the passenger trains and transit systems in \nMadrid, London, and Mumbai all demonstrate that railroads and surface \ntransportation systems are vulnerable targets for terrorists, and are a \nconstant reminder of what can happen in our communities.\n  We must address the risks facing our essential surface and rail \ntransportation systems here at home in a comprehensive and coordinated \nway before we become the next victim of a successful attack.\n  Toward this goal, Senator Stevens and I, along with Senators \nLautenberg, Rockefeller, Kerry, Boxer, Snowe, Pryor, Carper, Dorgan, \nHutchison, Klobuchar, Cantwell, and others, introduced the Surface \nTransportation and Rail Security Act of 2007, or STARS Act. This bill \nhas 22 cosponsors to date.\n  The STARS Act incorporates updated versions of provisions within the \nRail Security Act of 2004, which the Senate passed by unanimous consent \nin the 108th Congress, and the Senate version of the SAFE Port Act \nwhich we passed in the 109th Congress.\n  The Commerce Committee unanimously reported this bill along with S. \n509, the Aviation Security Improvement Act, and S. 385, the \nInteroperable Emergency Communication Act, on February 13, 2007, and \nthese provisions are included in the substitute amendment before us \ntoday as title 13.\n  The surface and rail provisions in title 13 require the Department of \nHomeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration to \nexpand existing security initiatives and develop grant programs to \nassist private-sector surface transportation security efforts. The \ntitle authorizes $1.1 billion over fiscal years 2008 through 2011.\n  The rail title of the substitute amendment requires railroad risk \nassessments and plans for improving rail security. It also authorizes \ngrants to Amtrak, freight railroads and others to upgrade passenger and \nfreight rail security, undertake research and development, and improve \ntunnel security.\n  Additionally, the title encourages the deployment of rail car \ntracking equipment for high-hazard material shipments, requires \nrailroads to create a railroad worker security-training program, and \nprovides whistleblower protection for rail workers who report security \nconcerns.\n  The surface transportation security provisions in title 13 of the \nsubstitute amendment promotes tracking technology for truck shipments \nof high-hazard materials and requires new guidance and assessments \npertaining to hazardous materials truck routing.\n  The title also establishes programs for reviewing and enforcing \nhazardous materials and pipeline security plans and requires the TSA to \ndevelop pipeline incident recovery plans.\n  Additionally, the title authorizes the existing grant program for \nimproving intercity bus and bus terminal security.\n  Finally, the title clarifies, at the TSA's request, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security's legal authority for initiating an administrative \nenforcement proceeding for violations of security regulations relating \nto nonaviation modes of transportation.\n  Regarding aviation security, title 13 addresses all the \nrecommendations in the 9/11 Commission's report, including cargo and \nbaggage screening, explosive detection at airport checkpoints, \npassenger prescreening, airport access controls, and general aviation \nsecurity. The title requires the TSA to provide for the screening of \nall cargo being carried on commercial passenger aircraft within 3 \nyears. The system must allow for a level of screening ``comparable'' to \nthat of checked baggage screening and ensure the security of all cargo \nthat is shipped on passenger aircraft.\n  The aviation provisions in title 13 advance the deployment of \nelectronic Explosive Detection Systems, EDS, at airports across the \nnation by extending the Aviation Security Capital Fund that is used to \nintegrate such machines into the baggage conveyor process.\n  The title also bolsters the existing grant program through changes in \nfunding allocation requirements requiring a prioritized schedule for \nsuch projects that will increase flexibility for funding options.\n  Our legislation recognizes the threat presented by passengers \ntransporting explosives through security checkpoints and promotes key \nchanges to address this risk.\n  Title 13 requires the TSA to produce a strategic plan to deploy \nexplosive detection equipment at airport checkpoints and fully \nimplement that plan within 1 year of its submission. They must also \nprovide specialized training to the screener workforce in the areas of \nbehavior observation, and explosives detection. To address ongoing \nproblems in developing an advanced passenger\n\n[[Page S2326]]\n\nprescreening system, the aviation provisions in title 13 would ensure a \nsystem is in place to coordinate passenger redress for those \nindividuals misidentified against the ``no-fly'' or ``selectee'' \nwatchlists. The TSA must also submit a strategic plan to Congress for \nthe testing and implementation of its advanced passenger prescreening \nsystem.\n  To increase General Aviation, GA, security, the title will require a \nthreat assessment program that is standardized and focused on GA \nfacilities. It will further require foreign based GA aircraft entering \nU.S. airspace to have their passengers checked against appropriate \nwatchlists to determine if there are any potential threats on board.\n  Title 13 of the substitute amendment includes a number of additional \nprovisions that will take significant steps toward strengthening \naviation security generally.\n  Title 13 will also authorize research and development spending for \naviation security technology, remove the arbitrary cap of 45,000 full-\ntime equivalent--FTE--employees currently imposed on the TSA's screener \nworkforce, and mandate security rules for foreign aircraft repair \nstations.\n  In addition, this title will require the TSA to develop a system by \nwhich the Administrator will provide blast-resistant cargo containers \nto commercial passenger air carriers for use on a random or risk-\nassessed basis, implement a sterile area access system that will grant \nflight deck and cabin crews expedited access to secure areas through \nscreening checkpoints, and require a doubling of the DHS's existing dog \nteam capacity used for explosive detection across the Nation's \ntransportation network.\n  In addition to transportation security, title 13 also includes the \ntext of S. 385, the Interoperable Emergency Communications Act, which I \nintroduced earlier this year with Senators Stevens, Kerry, Smith, and \nSnowe. Under the foresight and leadership of Senator Stevens, during \nthe Deficit Reduction Act, the Commerce Committee created a new $1 \nbillion fund administered by the National Telecommunications and \nInformation Administration--NTIA--to support state and local first \nresponders in their efforts to talk to one another during emergencies.\n  The interoperable provisions in title 13 provide congressional \ndirection on the implementation of that fund.\n  Since its creation, NTIA has served as the principal \ntelecommunications policy advisor to the Secretary of Commerce and the \nPresident, and manages the Federal Government's use of the radio \nspectrum.\n  In this capacity, NTIA has historically played an important role in \nassisting public safety personnel in improving communications \ninteroperability and recognizing that effective solutions involve \nattention to issues of spectrum and government coordination as well as \nfunding.\n  Today, our first responders continue to struggle in their efforts to \nimprove the interoperability of their systems. The statutory guidance \nprovided to NTIA in this legislation will help them in these efforts.\n  First, the provision would make clear that proposals to improve \ninteroperable communications are not solely limited to systems or \nequipment that utilize new public safety spectrum that will be vacated \nfollowing the digital television transition.\n  In a letter to the majority leader earlier this year, Mayor Bloomberg \nof New York City noted the significant efforts of his city to improve \ncommunications interoperability for first responders utilizing systems \nin other public safety spectrum bands, and urged Congress to eliminate \nthe apparent eligibility restriction in current law. As a result, our \nprovisions make clear that if the project will improve public safety \ninteroperability, it is eligible for funding.\n  In addition, the provisions provide the NTIA Administrator to direct \nup to $100 million of these funds for the creation of State and Federal \nstrategic technology reserves of communications equipment that can be \nreadily deployed in the event that terrestrial networks fail in times \nof disaster.\n  Recently, an independent panel created by FCC Chairman Kevin Martin \nto review the impact of Hurricane Katrina on communications networks \nnoted the impact that limited pre-positioning of communications \nequipment had in slowing the recovery process. As a result, these \nprovisions will help to ensure that our focus on interoperability also \nconsiders the importance of communications redundancy and resiliency.\n  Second, the provisions ensure that funding allocations among the \nseveral States result in a fair distribution by requiring a base amount \nof funding--.75 percent--to be distributed to all States.\n  On top of these minimum allocations, the provision would further \nrequire that prioritization of these funds be based upon an ``all-\nhazards'' approach that recognizes the critical need for effective \nemergency communications in response to natural disasters, such as \ntsunami, earthquakes, hurricanes, and tornadoes, in addition to \nterrorist attacks.\n  Finally, NTIA's administration of the grant fund will not only help \nto integrate the disparate elements that must be a part of effective \ninteroperability solutions, but will also ensure greater program \ntransparency and oversight. Given the myriad of different grant \nprograms administered by the Department of Homeland Security, it is \ncritical that these funds--specifically allocated by Congress to speed \nup our efforts to improve communications interoperability for first \nresponders--not get lost in the shuffle of other disaster and \nnondisaster grants.\n  As a result, the provisions not only devote NTIA's attention to the \nsuccess of this program, but also require the inspector general of the \nDepartment of Commerce to annually review the administration of this \nprogram.\n  The terrorists that seek to do us harm are cunning, dynamic, and most \nof all, patient. While they have not successfully struck our homeland \nsince September 11, 2001, it does not mean they are not preparing to do \nso.\n  They work 24 hours a day, studying every move we make, looking for \nsome weakness to exploit. It is imperative that we stay ahead of them.\n  We must recruit, train, and deploy a skilled and dedicated security \nforce. We must research and implement the most effective and cutting \nedge technologies to enhance the capabilities of that security force. \nAnd we must provide communications equipment to our first responders \nthat is interoperable and accessible in the immediate aftermath of a \ndisaster.\n  Simply put, our entire economy relies on a well-functioning, secure \ntransportation system, and we must ensure that the system, and the \npassengers and cargo that use it, are well protected.\n  The steps we take in the coming months will impact our safety, \nsecurity, and one of our most essential freedoms--movement--for years \nto come. We must commit ourselves to ensuring that our transportation \nsecurity remains a priority and is as strong and effective as possible.\n  The provisions before the Senate this week that were reported out of \nthe Commerce Committee make that commitment.\n  We have worked over the past several years with our colleagues and \nwith the TSA and DHS and with the FCC and NTIA to address concerns, \nimprove on initial efforts, and plan for the future. Now, it is time to \nact and to pass these provisions, so we can continue to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank Senator Inouye for his \nextraordinary leadership in these matters. The committees have \ndiffering jurisdictions, all aimed at supporting homeland security.

Madam President, the amendment I have offered, No. 279, \nis very simple. It codifies the recent regulations issued by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security which bans certain criminals from \ngaining security access to our seaports. My amendment is needed to \nprotect these regulations from outside groups that may challenge them \nin court, as well as from future administrations that may repeal or \nweaken them.\n  My amendment is also bipartisan and should not be controversial. It \nwas unanimously adopted by this body last\n\n[[Page S2328]]\n\nyear as part of the SAFE Port Act which passed 98 to 0. Unfortunately, \nit was gutted by the conference committee behind closed doors, and that \nis why I am offering it again today.\n  As my colleagues know, the Maritime Transportation Security Act \nrequires the Transportation Security Agency, TSA, to develop a \nbiometric security card for port workers at our seaports that can be \nused to limit access to sensitive areas within a seaport. The security \ncard is called a transportation worker identification card or, as we \nsometimes call it, a TWIC.\n\n  The law requires that the Secretary issue this card to any individual \nrequesting it unless the Secretary determines that the individual poses \na terrorism security risk or if the individual has been convicted of \ntreason, terrorism, sedition, or espionage. To clarify who poses a \nsecurity risk, the Department of Homeland Security recently issued \nregulations that bar certain serious felons from receiving these TWICs. \nSpecifically, the regulations permanently bar from our ports criminals \nconvicted of espionage, sedition, treason, terrorism, crimes involving \ntransportation security, improper transport of hazardous material, \nunlawful use of an explosive device, bomb threats, murder, violation of \nthe RICO Act, where one of the above crimes is a predicate act, and \nconspiracy to commit any of these crimes.\n  The Department of Homeland Security regulations also bar recent \nfelons--defined as those convicted within the last 7 years or \nincarcerated in the last 5 years--from gaining access to our ports if \nthey have been convicted of any of the following felonies: assault with \nintent to murder, kidnapping or hostage-taking, rape or aggravated \nsexual abuse, unlawful use of a firearm, extortion, fraud, bribery, \nsmuggling, immigration violations, racketeering, robbery, drug dealing, \narson, or conspiracy to commit any of these crimes.\n  These regulations were developed after an extensive process that \nincluded consultation with the Department of Justice and Transportation \nto identify individuals who have a propensity to engage in unlawful \nactivity, specifically activity that places our ports at risk. These \nregulations governing who can gain access to our seaports are nearly \nidentical to the regulations that govern those who can gain access to \nour airports as well as those who can transport hazardous material in \nour country.\n  These prohibitions are crucial because individuals who engage in this \ntype of unlawful activity have a greater likelihood to engage in these \nacts or in acts that put American ports and American lives at risk. Our \nlaw enforcement officials understand this risk. They understand the \nthreat our ports face when traditional criminals, particularly \norganized criminals, work with terrorists. For example, the FBI \nrecently apprehended a member of the Russian mafia attempting to sell \nmissiles to an FBI agent who he believed was acting as a middleman for \nterrorists.\n  Joseph Billie, Jr., the FBI's top counterterrorism official, recently \ncommented that the FBI is continuing to look at a nexus between \norganized crime and terrorists, and they are looking at this very \naggressively. The threat not only comes from criminals working directly \nwith terrorists, it also comes from criminals who may look the other \nway when a suspect container comes from a port. Joseph King, a former \nCustoms Service agent and now a professor at the John J. College of \nCriminal Justice, outlined the concern very clearly: ``It is an \ninvitation to smuggling of all kinds,'' he said. ``Instead of bringing \nin 50 kilograms of heroin, what would stop them from bringing in 5 \nkilograms of plutonium?'' The nightmare scenario here is where a \ncriminal at one of our ports who may think he is just helping a friend \nsmuggle in drugs inadvertently helps smuggle in a weapon of mass \ndestruction. That is a risk we cannot take.\n  I offered this amendment last year to address this threat and to \nensure that serious felons are kept out of our ports. My amendment \ncodified in statute the then-proposed TWIC regulations. As I said \nearlier, my amendment was unanimously adopted and was included in the \nSenate-passed version of the SAFE Port Act that passed 98 to 0. \nUnfortunately, my amendment was also completely gutted behind closed \ndoors in the conference committee. The provision went from addressing a \nlist of 20 serious felons to a list of just 4. These 4 felonies are so \nrare that the conference committee made the provision almost \nmeaningless.\n  I am extremely disappointed by the stealth opposition to this \nmeasure. I cannot understand who would oppose banning serious felons \nfrom gaining secure access at our American ports. While no Senator has \nbeen willing to publicly oppose this measure, the longshoremen's labor \nunion was more than happy to take credit for gutting the provision. \nLate last year, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union claimed \ncredit for killing the provision in the SAFE Port conference committee. \nThey stated in their newsletter:\n\n       We have heard rumors that Senator DeMint is particularly \n     angry with the union's successful lobbying effort to strip \n     his anti-labor provision. He may attempt to amend another \n     piece of legislation, so the union will stay on guard to \n     protect its members' interests.\n\n  Apparently, this union has stayed on guard because it was able to get \nfive Senators to object to this vital homeland security measure when I \ntried to pass it the second time late last year.\n  I wish I could say that the unions would stop at fighting this \nlegislation on the Senate floor, but they are also gearing up to mount \na legal battle against Department of Homeland Security regulations. In \nresponse to a Wall Street Journal editorial on the subject, the union \nstated that the TWIC security regulations were `` . . . double jeopardy \nand unconstitutional.'' This is a clear indication that they have a \nlegal challenge in mind. It seems clear that once longshoremen start \napplying for TWIC cards and some members are rejected because they are \nconvicted felons, the labor unions are going to take the Department of \nHomeland Security to court and try to bog the regulations down in \nlengthy legal battles. The consequence will be that as we continue to \nfight this global war on terror, America's ports will be staffed by \nserious felons who cannot be trusted.\n  Some of my colleagues may be tempted to come to the defense of the \nlongshoremen. They will say that the individuals in question have paid \ntheir debt to society and barring them is gutting our port workforce. \nThey may also claim that the crimes listed in the Department of \nHomeland Security regulations are somehow not related to homeland \nsecurity. These objections are just plain wrong.\n  I don't disagree that convicted felons should be given a second \nchance. I hope they get back on their feet and become productive \nmembers of their communities. What I disagree with is that we should \ngive serious felons a pass, literally and figuratively, to access the \nmost secure areas of America's port infrastructure. When they are fresh \nout of prison, we should not trust them with the most vulnerable areas \nof our ports. The stakes here are simply too high.\n  As for the concern that barring these individuals will empty the \nranks of the port workforce, the facts don't agree. When the Department \nof Homeland Security issued nearly 350,000 ID cards for hazmat \ntruckdrivers and subjected them to the same background check that is \nrequired by my amendment, only 3,100 were rejected. That is less than 1 \npercent. The fact is, we are talking about an isolated group of serious \nfelons here, and the workforce in the United States is dynamic enough \nto supply the few thousand longshoremen who may be needed to replace \nthose we let go.\n\n  Finally, some may say these felonies do not represent serious crimes. \nTo that, I would ask any of my colleagues to tell me which individual \nhe or she wants working at our ports where security is so important: \nMurderers? Extortionists? Drug dealers? Bomb makers? I just want to \nhear the rationale for trusting these criminals with our national \nsecurity.\n  The bottom line is this: My amendment applies nearly the same \nprotections to seaports that are already applied at our airports. It \nwill make us safer by keeping individuals who have shown a willingness \nto break the law outside our ports. This is extremely important. We can \nspend all the money in our Treasury trying to screen cargo, but if we \ndon't screen the people who\n\n[[Page S2329]]\n\nwork at our ports, we cannot expect to be safe.\n  I do wish to thank several people for supporting this important \npolicy. First, I thank the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, who was \nvery helpful to me during the debate on the SAFE Port Act last year. I \nalso thank the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, for his \nsupport. I should also say that the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, \nwas also helpful in getting this provision into the bill.\n  This is a bipartisan proposal, and it should not be controversial. \nAmericans expect us to check and verify the nature of the people who \nwork at our seaports, and we have a responsibility to ensure that \nhappens even if it upsets a labor union that feels compelled to protect \nthe jobs of a small group of serious felons. My amendment codifies in \nstatute these important security regulations, and I hope all of my \ncolleagues will support it.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important measure, and \nI will be happy to work with the bill managers to arrange a time to \ncome back to the floor if further debate is needed.\n  I thank the Chair for this time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Menendez). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank our friend from South Carolina \nfor the amendment he has offered. We worked together when last this \nsubject came before the Senate to bring about a result that I believe \nwas a good one and in the public interest, which was that the Secretary \nof Homeland Security issued regulations to create an identity card. The \ncard has a marvelous acronym, which doesn't sound as serious as it is. \nThe acronym is TWIC, transportation worker identification card. This is \none of the necessities of the post-9/11 age, that we need to move \ntoward some filter for people working in areas that now have become \nhigher vulnerability areas and are more likely targets for terrorism. \nUnfortunately, that includes our ports and, obviously, includes our \nairports as well, which have a separate ID program on which they are \nworking.\n  I know there is some hope within the Department of Homeland Security \nthat we are moving toward a more common program for a similar \nbackground check and card for postal workers at a host of different \ntransportation-related locations to protect them and us from potential \nterrorist attacks.\n  Senator DeMint, I gather from his statement--and I appreciate his \nintentions here--intends by this amendment to codify in law the \nregulations the Department of Homeland Security has established for \nthese identification cards for workers at our ports. I want to take a \nlook at it. I know Senator Collins does as well. We want to work with \nSenator DeMint.\n  Clearly, the intention here is one we all share, which is to do \neverything we can, within reason and respectful of common sense and \nconstitutional rights, to secure our critical transportation \nfacilities, including our ports. I rise now to simply thank the Senator \nfor offering his amendment, to tell him we will consider it with some \nthoughtfulness and look forward to working with him as we move toward a \nvote on this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The DeMint amendment is the pending business.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent that amendment be set aside \nand I be allowed to speak on the Collins amendment, No. 277, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 277\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment offered by my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, relative \nto the issue of REAL ID. I was back in my State last week, as most of \nus were, and I had the opportunity to speak to our legislature and \nvisit with members of both the State house and the State senate in \nAtlanta, and I cannot tell you the angst and apprehension that I saw \namong members of my legislature over this issue of REAL ID.\n  When I got back I did not understand why there would be that much \nconcern about the issue. I was not sure how this thing came about. When \nI checked with my staff I found out, as Senator Alexander said this \nmorning in his comments, that this was a measure that was stuck into \nthe Katrina appropriations bill that did not go through committee, we \ndid not have debate on it on the floor of this body, and I don't think \nanybody here understood the real consequences of it.\n  When the 19 hijackers came to this country and carried out the \nhorrific attack on September 11, they were in possession of 63 driver's \nlicenses issued by various States around the country. That should never \nhave happened, and we need to make sure it does not happen again. But \nthe fact is, I don't think anybody understood the consequences of this \nREAL ID Act as it pertains to that particular issue of driver's \nlicenses.\n  In 1994, when I was elected to the House of Representatives, we \ntalked a lot about unfunded mandates. The Presiding Officer was a \nMember of that body. He remembers well we had a lot of conversations \nabout unfunded mandates coming out of Washington to our State and local \nofficials and organizations that were required to fund those mandates \nthat we passed. There is no bigger unfunded mandate that we have passed \nlately that is more atrocious than this particular mandate.\n  I applaud Senator Collins for looking at this issue, for deciding \nthat it is a real, practical problem. It is an issue that needs to be \ndealt with. Her amendment makes a lot of sense. It does not repeal the \nlaw. What it does is to say that the law is not going to be implemented \nuntil 2 years following the issuance of the regulations. Here we are, \nwith this law supposed to be implemented by our State legislatures this \nyear, and we don't even have the regulations coming out of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security yet. They don't know how to carry out \nthe provisions of this law.\n  I support the Collins amendment, No. 277. I think it makes an awful \nlot of sense. It allows us to go back in and take a more thorough look \nat this particular issue and decide how we can accomplish the results \nthat the REAL ID Act wants to accomplish but at the same time not \nburden our States with a mandate that none of us intended to impose \nupon them.\n  I do support this amendment. I hope when the time comes it will \nreceive not only passage but significant numbers to support the passage \nof this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his \nsupport and his excellent comments. This is a carefully drafted \namendment. It doesn't rewind the clock in terms of throwing out the \nwork that the Department has done, but it recognizes that it is simply \nunreasonable to expect States to comply by May of next year with \ncomplex and costly regulations that the Department has yet to issue. \nThe Department has yet to issue the detailed guidance that the States \nneed.\n  It also recognizes that the quality of the final regulations will be \nimproved by the formation of a committee with State officials, privacy \nadvocates, technological experts, and Federal officials sitting down, \nlooking at the regulations, and providing input to the Department on \ntheir proposed regulations and also providing that input to us.\n  The third provision of the amendment would increase the waiver \nauthority that the Secretary can have if it proves that there are \ntechnological barriers to complying with certain provisions of the law. \nI think this is a reasonable approach to a real problem.\n  Finally, let me say to my colleagues, the estimates for the cost of \ncompliance with this law are as high as $11 billion over the next 5 \nyears. This is a huge unfunded mandate on the States. My hope is \nthrough our approach we can come up with more practical, cost-effective \nmeans of achieving a goal that all of us share and that is improving \nthe security of driver's licenses that are used for Federal \nidentification purposes, such as boarding an airplane. There is a real \nneed to have a secure driver's license, but let's do it in a practical, \ncollaborative way, and let's make sure there is adequate time to \ncomply.\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia for his support and for his \nexcellent comments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, \nbe added as a cosponsor of the Collins amendment, No. 277.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 20 minutes. I don't think I will use all that \ntime. If I need more time, I will ask for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Taxes\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as everybody who follows Congress on a \nregular basis knows, when you get close to the month of March, we are \nin budget season. The President sent his budget to the Hill, which he \ndoes regularly, the first week of February, about a month ago. So now \nit is up to the Congress. In the next few days the Senate Budget \nCommittee will be marking up our budget resolution.\n  For the public at large, don't confuse a budget resolution, which is \na discipline for Congress on budgeting, with appropriations bills that \nactually give the President the authority to spend money. They come \nalong a little bit later in the year.\n  At a minimum, the budget resolution will lay out the fiscal \npriorities of the next 5 years. As everyone knows, the American people \nspoke last November and sent a Democratic majority to both Houses of \nCongress. For the first time in 12 years, Democrats will take the \ninitiative on the Senate budget. As ranking Republican on the Finance \nCommittee, which deals with taxes, trade, Social Security, Medicare, \nand Medicaid, and also as the senior Republican on the Budget \nCommittee, which is the committee that sends the budget to the Senate, \nI am eager to see the direction the new Democratic majority wants to \ntake on fiscal policy for this year, but the budget also has long-term \nimplications of 5 years.\n  There are a lot of questions I am waiting to get answered. What will \nbe their plan on pay-go, which means pay as you go? With spending at \nhigher-than-average levels of our economy, what kind of spending \ndiscipline will the Democratic majority show? On the revenue side of \nthe ledger, will Democrats look to prevent a tax increase on virtually \nevery American taxpayer a few years down the road, when the present tax \npolicy sunsets, or will the Democratic majority, without a vote, set in \nmotion, then, the largest Federal tax increase of all time? This is a \nfact. It will happen. When we have a sunsetting of tax law, it is \npossible to have a tax increase without Congress voting it. In this \nparticular instance, this would put in place the biggest Federal tax \nincrease ever.\n  Over the next few days, I want to talk about the tax issues--I want \nto do it topic by topic--that are going to come up during debate on the \nprocess of the budget. There are probably many ways to do it, but this \nis how I split the general subject into topics: One, the importance of \npreventing a tax hike on virtually all American taxpaying families and \nindividuals. That is what I want to visit about today. Next is the \nnegative economic consequences of sunsetting the bipartisan tax relief \nplan that will be the biggest tax increase in the history of the \ncountry without a vote of the people, if we don't do something about \nit. Then another time, I am going to review Democratic tax increase \noffset proposals with a specific focus on the limits and problems \nassociated with those tax increases.\n  Next I will focus on one particular ill-defined but often mentioned \noffset; that is, reducing the tax gap. Everybody is for reducing the \ntax gap, and I am working with Senator Baucus to do that. He is \nchairman of our committee. But there has to be realism brought into \nthat debate, and I hope to provide that realism. Then fifth and last, \ntax reform and simplification, its necessity and bipartisan \nopportunities to do so.\n  These discussions are meant to be about the revenue side of the \nbudget. But before we get into the revenue side of the budget, I want \nto issue a challenge to my friends on the other side of the aisle. It \nis a challenge I have made over the last few years. It is in the \ncontext of intellectually honest budgeting. It is also in the context \nof the bipartisan record of the Finance Committee on tax policy over \nthe last few years. That tax policy has been led by this Senator, when \nI was chairman, and by Senator Baucus working with me during that \nperiod of time, or Senator Baucus, now leading the committee and, \nhopefully, my always working with him as he worked with me.\n  That bipartisan record of the Senate Finance Committee shows about \n$200 billion of revenue raisers from antitax shelter measures and \ncorporate loophole closures, basically doing something about abuse of \nthe Tax Code, unintended by Congress, by people who can hire very \nsophisticated lawyers to find ways around paying taxes. We have closed \n$200 billion of those, and it has been bipartisan. So when I hear from \nself-styled deficit hawks, or from the media, who are sympathetic to \nthose points of view that we need higher taxes to reduce the deficit, I \nbelieve the Finance Committee has anted up in terms of producing \nrevenue raisers without raising general levels of taxation on the \nAmerican people.\n  Here is my challenge, and I will ask my friends to listen up. Anyone \non the other side who considers themselves a deficit hawk needs to \nprove it, then, on the spending side. Compared to our committee already \nraising revenue by $200 billion by closing tax loopholes and tax abuse, \nshow me, then, a spending restraint proposal for deficit reduction. I \nissued that challenge several years ago and have issued it repeatedly. \nNo one from the other side has stepped up. We can look and look and \nlook and we won't find such a proposal. All of those liberal think \ntanks that oppose tooth and nail any kind of tax relief are usually \nadvocates of spending increases, all of this under the guise of fiscal \nresponsibility. We won't find any proposals to restrain spending from \nthese liberal think tanks.\n\n  If we look at the media sources that are sympathetic to the views of \nthe Democratic leadership or the liberal think tanks, we will find \nhard-line opposition to tax relief and a lot of tax increase proposals \nbut, likewise, no proposal reining in spending. They will claim the \nmantle of fiscal responsibility but won't show anything on the spending \nside other than spending increases. For these folks, when it comes to \ndeficit reduction, there is only one side of the Federal ledger. That \nis raising taxes.\n  We have a Federal Government that is projected to spend $2.7 trillion \nfor this fiscal year alone and is projected to spend $33.7 trillion \nover the next 10 years. Yet leadership on the other side of the aisle, \nthe liberal think tanks that back them up, and the media that helps \nthem get their message out so easily and is sympathetic to their views, \ncan't find a dollar of savings on the spending side. To these folks, \nwith all due respect, I want to call them out. They won in November. \nThe Congress is in their hands. Let's see some credibility on the \nspending side of the ledger. Show the taxpayers the money. Show me a \nproposal to restrain spending and put it to deficit reduction. That is \na preliminary point.\n  Now I will move to talk about preventing tax hikes. The same group's \nposition on current law tax relief is radically different than its \nposition on spending restraint. Back in 2001 and 2003, Congress \napproved, and the President signed, legislation that provided across-\nthe-board tax relief to nearly every American taxpayer. The Democratic \nleadership, liberal think tanks, and sympathetic east coast media \ncriticized tax relief on a couple of grounds. One charge was that the \ntax relief was a tax cut for the rich. The other charge was that the \nbipartisan tax relief was fiscally irresponsible.\n  Nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation distribution tables actually \nput a lie to that first charge. The record levels of revenue show that \nthe growing economy, the expanding U.S. economy, and economic stimulus \nfrom tax relief better the Nation's fiscal situation, bringing in more \ntax dollars,\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n\nnot depriving the Federal Treasury of dollars.\n  This debate on preventing tax increases is often couched only in \nmacroeconomic terms. We will hear what it ``costs'' to extend \nbipartisan tax relief. We will hear very big numbers. For instance, the \nJoint Committee on Taxation projects that the revenue loss from making \nthe bipartisan tax relief permanent is $1.9 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. That is the way the Democratic leadership, liberal think tanks, \nand sympathetic east coast media will define proposals to prevent a tax \nhike. We won't see them talk about the number of families who benefit \nfrom the extension of the $1,000 child tax credit. You won't see them \ntalk about the number of married couples who benefit or the average \nfamily benefit from marriage penalty relief.\n  Today I am going to take a few minutes and shed some light on the \nside of the debate about extending bipartisan tax relief. Lord only \nknows, there is not much light shed on these important facts, because \neverybody is talking about tax relief for the rich. I will acknowledge \nthe critics' point on the macro cost of extending tax relief. But keep \nin mind, a liberal's tax relief cost is a conservative's tax hike, when \nwe are talking about extending current law. They are the two sides of \nthe same taxpayer's coin. I will agree to that number, but call it a \n$1.9 trillion tax increase.\n  So I am going to follow the Democratic leadership plan and dismantle \nthe bipartisan tax relief package bit by bit. I am also going to \nchallenge the Democratic leadership to show us the money by indicating \nwhether they want to scrap each piece as I move through the package. \nWhich pieces would they scuttle? I will work through the bipartisan tax \nlegislation piece by piece.\n\n  Let's start, then, with the basis for the 2001 bipartisan tax relief \nmeasure. That is the new 10-percent bracket. The revenue loss for this \npart of the package is $299 billion over 10 years, according to the \nJoint Committee on Taxation. The 10-percent bracket is a huge piece of \ntax relief for low-income people. The 10-percent bracket does that. No \nwonder 100 million families and individual taxpayers benefit from the \n10-percent bracket. I do not think anybody wants to dismantle that \npiece. But I want to hear that from the Democratic leadership because \nthat is a compromise of their position of whether the 2001 tax \nincreases ought to sunset.\n  Where do we go next, then? The marginal tax rate cuts, which include \nthe 10-percent bracket, lose $852 billion over 10 years, according to \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation. That proposal reduces the taxes of \napproximately 100 million families and individuals across America. It \nappears some folks think 35 percent is too low of a top rate. Well, \nguess what. Repealing the marginal rate cuts hits small business--the \nbiggest source of new jobs in this great country of ours--and it hits \nsmall business the hardest.\n  The Treasury Department estimates 33 million small business owners \nwho are taxed on their business income at individual rates benefit from \nthe marginal rate cuts. Repealing these cuts would cause 33 million \nsmall business owners to pay a 13-percent penalty. Do the Democratic \nleaders want to raise taxes on these small business taxpayers, \nrestricting the ability of small business to create jobs?\n  Treasury also projects that small business gets over 80 percent of \nthe benefits of the cuts in the top two rates. Do we want to raise the \ntax rates on these people--small businesses for the most part--by 13 \npercent? Does that make any sense? So to the Democratic leadership, \nwhat do you say?\n  How about the death tax relief package? The Joint Committee on \nTaxation scores that package at $499 billion over 10 years. Most of the \nrevenue loss is attributable to increasing the exemption amount and \ndropping the rate to 45 percent on already taxed property. Is it \nunreasonable to provide relief from the death tax or should we raise \nthe death tax on small businesses and family farms? That is what will \nhappen if the bipartisan tax relief package is not extended. So to the \nDemocratic leadership, what is your take on that provision?\n  Do the opponents want to repeal the proposal to double the child tax \ncredit, which the 2001 bill does? Mr. President, 31.6 million families \nbenefit from the child tax credit, according to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. Or how about the refundable piece that helps 16 million kids \nand their families? That proposal loses $135 billion over 10 years. I \ndo not think we would have a lot of takers on that one. They are going \nto want to extend that. Democratic leadership, do you agree?\n  How about the lower rates on capital gains and dividends? Thirty-\nthree million Americans--a good number of them low-income seniors--\nbenefit from the lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Does the Democratic \nleadership think we should raise taxes on these 33 million Americans \nbenefiting from these lower tax rates? That would be families and \nindividuals.\n  On a side note, in another speech, I will be talking about the \nworrisome Goldman Sachs economic report on the adverse economic effects \nof failing to extend lower rates on capital gains--this line right \nhere, as shown on the chart--when it expires.\n  There are consequences to what Congress does. When you have a booming \neconomy, there could be very detrimental consequences to the country \nwhen you take away the incentives that have had this economy exploding \nlike not any time since the early 1990s.\n  Let's take a look at the marriage penalty piece. It is the first \nmarriage penalty relief we delivered in over 30 years. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation scores this proposal at $52 billion over 10 \nyears, and Treasury estimates that in 2004, nearly 33 million married \ncouples benefited from this tax relief. Again, I do not think many \nfolks would want to raise taxes on people because they decided to be \nmarried. I hope the Democratic leadership would agree with that \nstatement.\n  Another proposal is expensing for small businesses; in other words, \nwriting everything off in 1 year instead of stretching it out over 10 \nyears. This is a commonsense, bipartisan proposal and directed \nspecifically to small business--the engine that creates new jobs. \nAccording to IRS Statistics of Income, 6.7 million small businesses \nacross the country benefited from this expensing provision in 2004. If \nwe do not make it permanent, small businesses face a tax increase of \n$19 billion over 10 years and probably sputtering the engine that \ncreates so many jobs in America. Does the Democratic leadership think \nsmall business expensing is an unwise tax policy?\n  Continuing on through the bipartisan tax relief package, let's take a \nlook at education tax relief. This package, which will help Americans \ndeal with college education costs, scores at $12 billion over 10 years \nby the Joint Committee on Taxation. IRS Statistics of Income show \nnearly 16 million families and students benefited from this tax relief \nin 2004.\n  In this era of rising higher education costs, should we gut tax \nbenefits for families to send their kids off to college? Does the \nDemocratic leadership think that is the way to go, which would be the \nway we would go if Congress does nothing and you let this tax law \nsunset?\n  Finally, families where both parents work have to deal with childcare \nexpenses. The tax relief package includes enhanced incentives for \nchildcare expenses. Mr. President, 5.9 million families across America \nbenefit, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Does the \nDemocratic leadership think we ought to take away these childcare \nbenefits? That is what would happen if the tax cuts of 2001 were \nsunset. It would happen without a vote of the Congress either.\n  Now, I have taken you through about $1.9 trillion of tax relief. It \nsounds like a lot in abstraction, but it provides relief to every \nAmerican who pays income tax. I would ask any of those who want to \nadjust or restructure--and those are words that are used around here \nabout this tax relief package passed in 2001--do you want to adjust it \nor restructure it? Where would you cut in this package?\n  Would you hit the 10-percent bracket, driving up the taxes of low-\nincome people? Would you hit small business tax relief and sputter the \ngrowth machine, the job machine of America; or the now refundable child \ntax credit, and hurt low-income people; or the death tax relief; or the \nmarriage penalty relief;\n\n[[Page S2332]]\n\ndividends and capital gains relief; education tax relief; or childcare \ntax relief? I hope not. Because in a recovering economy, with above-\naverage levels of individual income tax, as a percentage of GDP, even \nwith the tax relief package in place, which areas would you adjust, \nwhich areas would you restructure?\n  Why, then, undo bipartisan--with emphasis upon ``bipartisan''--tax \ncuts that make the Tax Code actually more progressive? Now get that, \nnot regressive; it is more progressive now than before the tax bill of \n2001.\n  As folks on both sides of the aisle say, budgets are about \npriorities. As the Democratic leadership draws up its budget, we will \nhear a lot of talk about a big number for extending tax relief. It is a \nbig number. It is the biggest tax increase ever. It is going to affect \nnearly every American taxpayer.\n  If leadership now in the majority of this body, because of the \nresults of the last election, decides to propose the biggest tax \nincrease in history in the name of deficit reduction, I will be looking \nfor that one, single dollar of spending restraint I never see. Now, \nmaybe we will see it, but I will bet we would not. Only time will tell, \nand it will be within the next 2 or 3 weeks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I do not think I see any colleagues \nwho wish to speak, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Space Station Safety Report\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, there was a space station task \nforce safety report released yesterday which points out a number of \nhazards as we are now in the process of completing the space station. \nRemember that we have this multibillion-dollar structure about 300 \nmiles above the Earth, with a crew of three, and eventually it will \nhave more of a complement, of five or six, which will have the ongoing, \nfull-time responsibility of scientific experiments. Right now it is \nabout two football fields long. During the completion, which will occur \nover the next 3 years, it will have all the additional appendages, \nincluding the international laboratory we need to conduct all of the \nexperiments that we want. Yet the task force that released its report \nyesterday says there are certain inherent hazards that we have always \nknown about, such as meteorites striking and/or space debris.\n  The U.S. Air Force catalogs all of the space debris. Therefore, we \nhave the ability, if something really got in the way, to actually \nmaneuver the space station out of the way of that debris--if we know \nwhere that debris is. The same is true with weather and reconnaissance \nsatellites. I don't need to say anything about weather satellites here. \nEverybody knows because it is obvious what technology we have today to \nsee the approaching storms, and if you live on the coast and it is \nduring the summer, it is all the more important, because of an inbound \nhurricane, that everybody is prepared.\n  Well, what is preparing us? It is not only that airplane that is \nflying into the hurricane, it is those satellites that are constantly \ntracking the position of that hurricane. Those are threatened by this \nspace debris, which brings me to share with my colleagues: Isn't it \ninteresting that there has almost been a strange silence throughout the \nworld for the last 6 weeks after the Chinese tested their antisatellite \nmissile, which created a debris field that is 100 times more than any \ndebris that has been created, and because of its altitude, some 500 \nmiles, it is going to be years before all of that debris is pulled back \nto Earth by the gravitational pull of the Earth?\n  It is that debris field of thousands of particles, as a result of the \nChinese rocket destroying a Chinese satellite by hitting it and \nexploding all of the kinetic energy in parts into the vacuum of space, \nthat now we have a new threat not only to our space station but also to \nall of our weather satellites and our reconnaissance satellites. So my \ncolleagues can imagine the headache now for the U.S. Air Force of \ntrying to track all of that Chinese debris, much more so I think just \nfrom that one explosion, more debris than all the other debris that is \nup there. It is going to take several years before it ever comes down \nbecause of the altitude where the kinetic energy occurred when the \nvehicle slammed into the target, which was an old Chinese weather \nsatellite.\n  So as we are looking at the future of NASA and the completion of the \nspace station and the saving of the Hubble space telescope, which has \nopened vast vistas of new knowledge to us about the heavens and about \nthe origin of the universe, thanks to the Chinese, as we do this we now \nhave to worry about something that could be lethal to our astronauts \nand cosmonauts who are onboard the space station.\n  Some of the things they are talking about in this report released \nyesterday include some kind of special curtains they put over the \nwindows that would give extra protection to the glass of the space \nstation windows. Others are talking about protective blankets they \nmight put over very sensitive areas of the space station that could be \nhit by debris. This debris could be coming at a velocity of 10,000 \nmiles per hour because, if it is in a different orbit and suddenly it \ncrosses the orbit of the space station and hits it--remember, going \naround the Earth in orbital velocity is 17,500 miles an hour. If that \ndebris hits at right angles, you are going to have a velocity of 17,500 \nmiles an hour. With the space station going at a different orbit, you \nstart to see the kind of kinetic energy that could rain from such a \ncollision. So it complicates it, and it complicates it not only for the \nAmerican space program but for every space program on planet Earth, and \nthat is the problem.\n  That is what the Chinese have done for us. Yet there has been a \nsuspicious silence of anybody speaking out in the world community about \nwhat the Chinese have done in space. There was an intellectual \ndiscussion about China having shown they have the capability of \ntargeting an antisatellite to hit a satellite, which is a significant \nfeat. But in the process, they ignored the threats now to all of the \nhuman and nonmanned assets that are up there, not just for our country \nbut for every country in the world that depends on a satellite or a \nspacecraft of some kind.\n  That is what we are facing. That is what we have to figure a plan \nfor. I hope the Chinese who have had singular success--and this Senator \nhas invited their Chinese astronaut to come here and visit, and he did. \nThis Senator has congratulated them on their space accomplishments. But \nthis time China has done something in accomplishing something \ntechnologically that has endangered the other nations of the world with \nthe manned and the unmanned programs.\n  That is what is facing us. This is only the first the Chinese have \nheard from this Senator about how they have endangered the interests of \nplanet Earth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about two parts of the \nbill that is before us, the Improving America's Security Act, which is \nreally the attempt by our committee and the Senate to finish the job \nthe 9/11 Commission gave us to protect the security of the American \npeople from terrorist attack and also to adopt for the first time a \nnational all-hazards defense strategy that would set up a system that \nwould not only be aimed at preventing and, if, God forbid, necessary, \nresponding to a terrorist attack but\n\n[[Page S2333]]\n\nalso being ready and preparing every level of government to be ready to \nrespond to a natural disaster.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina is pending. \nI wanted, in the interim, hoping others will come to the floor to offer \nother amendments or speak on that pending amendment, to speak about \nthese two parts of the bill.\n  The first is about what is one of the most significant changes the \nbill would make; that is, to establish for the first time a dedicated \ngrant program to assist States and localities in creating interoperable \ncommunications systems to be used to protect the American people in \ntime of emergency. The ability of first responders to communicate with \none another is fundamental at a time of disaster. Yet time and time \nagain over the years, disasters have occurred, and police, \nfirefighters, and emergency medical workers are unable to exchange \ncritical information with one another, even indications of their \nlocation. Sometimes, as we saw in Katrina, certainly, not only is this \na problem of their not being able to communicate with one another, it \nis a problem of their not being able to communicate at all. There is a \npainful and tragic cost to this failure to communicate or to \ninteroperate with others in law enforcement, and that is that lives are \nlost.\n  This is a problem which was intensely made clear to all of us on \nSeptember 11, 2001 and again during Katrina, but it is not new. In \n1982, the record shows, communications difficulties frustrated the \nrecovery efforts in response to the crash of the Air Florida plane \nright here in Washington, DC. In 1995, again the record shows \ncommunications difficulties complicated the response to the terrorist \nbombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, OK. \nIn 1999, communications difficulties again slowed the response to the \nshootings at Columbine High School near Littleton, CO.\n  Then came 9/11. The story of the communication breakdown among New \nYork City's first responders is well known. It is well known because it \ncost the lives of some of the bravest Americans, some on duty and some \noff duty, who rushed to the aid of their fellow citizens and fellow \nfirst responders. But there were other communications breakdowns on \nSeptember 11, 2001, as well--less well known but also breakdowns that \nhampered the response at the Pentagon and in Shanksville, PA.\n  After an in-depth look at the three incidents I have described--the \nPentagon, the World Trade Center, and the plane that went down in \nPennsylvania on 9/11--the 9/11 Commission wrote:\n\n       The occurrence of this problem at three very different \n     sites is strong evidence that compatible and adequate \n     communications among public safety organizations at the \n     local, State, and Federal level remains an important problem.\n\n  That was the 9/11 Report which came out in 2004. We are now at the \nend of February 2007, and that problem remains as real and intense as \never.\n  The Commission recommended expediting and increasing the assignment \nof radio spectrum for public safety purposes. In 2005, as part of the \nDeficit Reduction Act, Congress set February 2009 as the deadline for \nbroadcasters to transition to digital signals, which will free up much-\nneeded spectrum for first responders. A lot of us, including myself, \nbelieved that delay to February 2009 was too long. The occupant of the \nchair remembers that well; we stood together on that. But so be it, \nthat is what it is.\n  Since that time, Hurricane Katrina devastated the gulf coast, \nparticularly the great city of New Orleans, and reminded us again how \nmuch more needs to be done to improve communications operability, to \nsustain the very operation of an emergency communications system, and \ninteroperability, the ability of different first responders to \ncommunicate with one another.\n  The communications infrastructure in Louisiana and Mississippi at the \ntime of Hurricane Katrina was decimated. Once again, difficulties in \ncommunicating among officials and first responders significantly \nimpeded rescue and relief efforts. Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour \ndrove the point home when he said the chief of the National Guard in \nMississippi ``might as well have been a Civil War general for the first \n2 or 3 days'' because in order to get information, he had to use \nrunners. His runners had helicopters instead of horses, but the point \nwas clear. The lack of operable or interoperable communications \nequipment put first responders in that disaster back about a century \nand a half.\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is \nproud to claim the Presiding Officer as a member, investigated the \npreparations for and response to Hurricane Katrina, a 9-month \ninvestigation that produced a 700-page report and almost 90 \nrecommendations. We enacted some of those recommendations last fall as \npart of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act. That \nlegislation, which I am proud has largely become law, included ways to \nimprove planning and coordination, establish a much needed national \nemergency communications plan, and strengthen technical guidance and \nassistance to local first responders. The newly created Office of \nEmergency Communications, which was created therein, will be \nresponsible for carrying out many of those responsibilities. Like many \nof the homeland security challenges we face, achieving nationwide \noperability and interoperability of communications will require \nsignificant resources, a lot of money. One estimate from our Government \nseveral years ago put the figure at $15 billion. Testimony before the \nSenate Commerce Committee this past month estimated that the cost may \nbe as high as $50 billion to create a genuinely interoperable, \ndisaster-resistant communications system for our country. We don't know \nthe exact price tag, but we do know the costs will be significant. We \ndo know they are beyond the ability of State and local government \nthemselves to provide. That is why title III of the legislation before \nthe Senate, the Improving America's Security Act, establishes a \ndedicated interoperability grant program for first responders which \nwill put us on the path to nationwide operability and interoperability, \ncapable of surviving and helping America survive a potential terrorist \nattack or a natural disaster.\n  This is an important investment, a kind of leverage for the Federal \nGovernment to create in partnership with the States and local \ngovernments. Of course, part of the reason there is not only financial \nneed but programmatic policy justification for this. The kinds of \nattacks, the kinds of natural disasters we are talking about, as we saw \nmost painfully in Katrina, have national consequences. The Federal \nGovernment needs to be there to make some additional investments on \nwhich the State and local governments will build.\n  The legislation, S. 4, before the Senate today authorizes $3.5 \nbillion over 5 years, beginning in the coming fiscal year. That is on \ntop of the $1 billion interoperability grant program to be administered \nby the Department of Commerce during this fiscal year, the result of \nprevious legislation. This is the beginning of moving toward a genuine \nnational system, if we can adopt this and fund it, a call to the States \nand localities to match that money, each in their own way, so we can \nbuild this survivable network of communications.\n  Individual States will be able to apply for grants under this new \nprogram, which will be administered by FEMA, with assistance from the \nOffice of Emergency Communications. The committee was very anxious, as \nthe Presiding Officer knows, to not only create a fund of money and \nthrow it out there for every local official who had some idea about how \nto create interoperable communications--all applications will have to \nbe consistent with each State's communications plan and the national \nemergency communication plan which is being developed and expanded by \nthe new Office of Emergency Communications. In other words, to get \nmoney, you have to prove you are going to fit into a statewide and \nnational plan for interoperability of communications.\n  Incidentally, the national element of this is pretty obvious. In \nKatrina, you had a lot of first responders streaming into the gulf \ncoast, and New Orleans particularly, when local first responders were \noverwhelmed. They were all bringing their own communications systems \nwith them. A similar response occurred--a really moving patriotic \nresponse--after 9/11 to New York City, with first responders from all \nover the country coming in.\n\n[[Page S2334]]\n\n  What do we want at that point? A Tower of Babel, where people cannot \ncommunicate with one another, or the ability, easily, as part of a \nnational communications plan, to do so? Obviously, the latter is what \nwe want.\n  States, incidentally, which would be the recipients of this money, \nwould be required to pass at least 80 percent of the grant funding to \nlocal and tribal governments. The money could then be used for a range \nof activities: planning, system design, engineering, training, \nexercises, procurement, and installation.\n  We also include a minimum amount of funding for each State because \ninteroperability is an all-hazards concern. In other words, we are \nhaving a well-intentioned, good-faith debate about homeland security \ngrants and to what extent--as some would say--should they all be \ndistributed based on risk or be distributed with a minimum amount going \nto each State?\n  In this case of interoperability of communications, it seems to me \nthe argument is compelling there ought to be some element that gives a \nminimum to each State because what we are trying to establish is a \nnational emergency communications system that will be ready to respond \nnot just to a potential terrorist attack, but to natural disasters \nwhich, obviously, can occur anywhere in the country. In other words, \nthe ability for first responders and other emergency responders to \ncommunicate with one another, either by voice or through data sharing, \nis necessary regardless of the nature of the emergency.\n  In short, we owe it to the memory of the firefighters and police \nofficers who gave their lives on 9/11, some of whom lost their lives \nbecause of the absence of interoperable communications, and to the \ncommitment of first responders who struggled under such adverse \ncircumstances to do their jobs in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, \nand to first responders and emergency managers today all across our \ncountry who are ready to respond in the time of our need to pass this \nlegislation, to provide the funding necessary for this critical effort, \nand to move the Nation's first responders toward real 21st century \noperable and interoperable communications in the face of disaster.\n  I have one more topic I want to discuss at this time. The one I have \njust talked about--a dedicated fund for interoperable communications--I \nthink is one of the most significant parts of the bill. It is the \nbeginning of a transformational partnership between the Federal, State, \nlocal, and tribal governments that I am convinced will have a \nmeasurable, significant effect on the security of the American people.\n  This next topic I want to talk about has to do with a provision in \nthe committee bill which extends employee rights and protections to \nairport screeners who work for the Transportation Security \nAdministration. Frankly, I do not consider this to be a major part of \nthe bill. To me, it is correcting an inequity that exists in current \nlaw. I honestly do not know why anybody would oppose it. I will listen \nto the arguments, but I want to contrast it with the section I just \ndescribed, because if the last 24 hours are any indication, this \nsection may receive more attention than any other section of the bill. \nThe White House has indicated it will veto the bill if this section is \nin it. I respectfully do not understand that.\n  Colleagues, I know, are preparing to come to the floor to try to \nstrike this section from the bill. I think this section is an act of \nelemental fairness, granting quite limited employee rights to airport \nscreeners who are now denied--I am using this term beyond its judicial \nmeaning--equal protection that is enjoyed by most every other Federal \nemployee, including most every other Federal employee involved in \nsecurity.\n  So I hope, one, we do not spend a disproportionate amount of time on \nthis section; and, two, we do not allow it to get in the way of us \nfulfilling our urgent responsibility to finish the job of enacting the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission, which S. 4, the legislation \nbefore us, would do.\n  I wish to spend a few moments talking about this section of the bill. \nThe fact is, since the Transportation Security Administration was \ncreated in 2001, TSA screeners have been denied the same employment \nrights and protections as almost all of their fellow workers in TSA. In \nfact, they have been denied the same rights and protections that are \nenjoyed by most of their fellow employees at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, such as the Border Patrol and Customs and Immigration \nofficers.\n  TSA screeners--often also known as TSOs, transportation security \nofficers--are familiar to most Americans because we see them at every \nairport across our country. Thanks, in part, I believe to their hard \nwork and diligence, we have been spared a repeat of September 11, and \nair travel generally is safer than it was before that day.\n  They deserve to be treated equally in their employment rights. It is \nlong past time to provide the same protections to TSA screeners as are \nenjoyed by their colleagues.\n  I wish to take just a moment to review the history of how this \ninequality came to exist. Shortly after the September 11 attacks, \nCongress federalized the work of passenger and baggage screeners at \nU.S. airports. TSA was created within the Department of Transportation. \nIt was subject generally to the same personnel rules as the Federal \nAviation Administration. Responding to the sense of emergency at the \ntime, however--remember, this was right after 9/11--Congress gave the \nhead of TSA broad authority to set personnel rules at his own \ndiscretion for airport screeners.\n  In 2002, when Congress established the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to coordinate and strengthen our defenses against manmade and \nnatural disasters, TSA was removed from the Department of \nTransportation and put into the Department of Homeland Security.\n  At that time, Congress engaged in extensive debate with quite serious \npartisan and political overtones about how to apply civil service law \nto employees at the new Department. This was an amalgam of 22 different \nagencies, almost 180,000 employees, most of whom were coming already \nwith their own employee rights--their own rights--most particularly, to \njoin a union.\n\n  Ultimately, and contrary to my own position, Congress authorized the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary to waive certain provisions \nof civil service law which Congress and the President believed were \nnecessary for national security purposes.\n  Meanwhile, since 2001, TSA has declared itself exempt from laws \nenforcing the most basic employee protections, including the \nWhistleblower Protection Act, the Rehabilitation Act protecting Federal \nemployees with disabilities, the Federal Sector Labor-Management \nRelations statute, appeal of adverse personnel actions to the Merit \nSystems Protection Board, and veterans preference laws.\n  In each case, the Transportation Security Agency has devised its own \nversion of these fundamental employee protections substantially below \nthe standard that Congress and the President decided were appropriate \ngenerally for DHS employees.\n  So now you have this anomaly because of this unusual statutory \nhistory where TSA screeners have a much lower level of employee \nprotection than most of the other employees at the Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  It is now 5 years after the agency was established, and TSA screeners \nstill lack those basic rights that are available to their colleagues at \nDHS and throughout the Federal Government. That is exactly the inequity \nthis small provision in this bill, S. 4, aims to overcome.\n  For example, TSA screeners have no individual right to appeal to the \nMerit Systems Protection Board when they believe they have been subject \nto unlawful retaliation for protected whistleblowing activity. OK, this \nis exactly what we want employees of the Federal Government to do. They \nare our representatives. We are paying them. If they see something \nwrong going on, we want them to blow the whistle, and we do not want \nthem to be punished as a result.\n  But under the current state of the law, TSA screeners do not have any \nright to an outside appeal when they believe they have been subject to \nunlawful retaliation because they blew the whistle on something or \nsomeone else they saw doing something they thought was wrong.\n  Second, TSA is not bound and the screeners are not protected by the \nRehabilitation Act. So TSA is not bound\n\n[[Page S2335]]\n\nto make reasonable accommodations for a disabled screener still able to \nperform his duties. This is the basic mindset we have overcome in \nrecent decades, that somebody who may be disabled in one way is--if I \ncan make up a word--abled in many other ways and perhaps, therefore, \nable to carry out the responsibilities of a screener at one of the \nsecurity checkpoints we have all gone through. We have all gone through \nthem, so we know there are a number of those functions that could be \nperformed by somebody who may have a disability. But there is no right \nto appeal if an employee, a screener, thinks they have been \ndiscriminated against based on that.\n  TSOs--that is, screeners--are allowed to join a union, but they \ncannot collectively bargain as other security forces at DHS and \nthroughout the Federal Government can do. Nor can TSOs claim an unfair \nlabor practice with the independent Federal Labor Relations Authority.\n  I want to stress something. Screeners at TSA can join a union. They \ncannot strike. There is nothing in this small provision in S. 4 that \nwill give them the right to strike. There is nothing in this provision \nthat will give them the right to strike. I fear people hearing about \nthis provision may think we want to extend some employee rights to TSA \nscreeners and may think, oh, my God, at a time of crisis these people \nwill just walk off their jobs and strike. It is illegal. They cannot do \nit. It is the same limitation that is on Federal employees who have \ncollective bargaining rights generally. It is just that these screeners \nhave much less, many fewer rights than others do. They cannot claim an \nunfair labor practice with the independent Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority.\n  Finally, unlike the rest of the Federal Government, TSA limits the \nveterans preference in hiring and other personnel decisions to veterans \nwho retired from the Armed Services, and denies the preference to those \nwho were honorably discharged. Of course, it is the vast majority of \nmen and women who have served our country in uniform who are honorably \ndischarged as opposed to serving until the time of their retirement. \nBut they do not get any veterans preference in hiring and other \npersonnel decisions at the TSA. Is that a big deal? It is if you are a \nveteran. One of the things this provision in this bill would say is \nthat, the full veterans preference should apply for TSA screeners.\n\n  So that is the amendment we adopted, the literal effect of which is \nto instruct the Secretary of Homeland Security to include TSA \nscreeners, either under the departmentwide human resources management \nsystem or under the specialized system that now applies to TSA \nemployees other than the screeners, in the most specific way, which \nleaves no ground--no gaps for misunderstanding. Although there are \npeople, I fear, who are misunderstanding or misstating it, this \namendment simply and directly says that TSA screeners have to be \nincluded under the departmentwide DHS human resources management \nsystem, or under the specialized system that applies to TSA employees \nother than the screeners.\n  I know critics of this provision are arguing right now that TSA needs \nflexibility to manage the screener workforce in a way that provides \nsecurity when, where, and how it is needed, such as when the threat \nlevel is raised, or when a new threat becomes evident, or when \nunexpected problems arise at a particular location so the Administrator \nof TSA would want to move screeners from one airport to another. This \nargument is not based on fact. The concerns are misplaced. The \ncommittee bill, in this small section, retains flexibility for the TSA \nAdministrator to promptly redeploy employees, change their assignments, \nor otherwise respond to problems as they arise. The bill recognizes \nthis is a department which has to have the flexibility, the management \nflexibility, to respond to emergencies. In granting these TSA screeners \nthe same employee rights most everybody else within the Department, \nincluding people involved in border patrol, for instance, and other \nsecurity functions, we retain nonetheless the flexibility of the \nadministrator to redeploy his forces at a time of crisis.\n  There is another reason to do this, I believe, apart from equity, and \nthat goes to the effectiveness of the TSA screeners and the Department \nof Homeland Security employees generally. Personnel management at TSA, \nthe record will show, has been troubled since its inception. The record \nwill show the agency has experienced unusually high rates of \nattrition--people leaving, unusually high rates of workplace injury, \nhigh rates of absenteeism, and other indications of low employee \nmorale. Anybody in the private sector will tell you if you have high \nattrition, high workplace injury, absenteeism, and low morale, you have \na problem, and the problem is going to mean the service you are \nintending to provide is not going to be what you want it to be.\n  I would say those problems interfere with establishing and \nmaintaining the core of experienced and professional screeners we need, \nthat the American people need to ensure aviation security. From \nconversations I have had with screeners, simply taking a step to put \nthem on an equal plane with everybody else in TSA or DHS in terms of \ntheir employee rights will go a long way toward creating the kind of \nmorale, devotion to work, and avoidance of workplace injury that will \nbetter serve our Nation. I know the Administrator of TSA, Kip Holley, \nhas recently made some efforts to improve personnel management, but I \nbelieve they haven't gone far enough, and this amendment will take them \na large step forward.\n  I want to say finally that when the Homeland Security and Government \nAffairs Committee marked up the bill, there was apparently a \nTransportation Security Agency screener by the name of A.J. Castilla \nwho was there in the public section of the room. Later he wrote a note \nof thanks in which he said:\n\n       We TSOs aren't asking for special treatment, merely to be \n     made whole and equal again in the eyes of the law.\n\n  A.J. Castilla is committed to his job, is as committed as any other \nemployee of the Department of Homeland Security or the Transportation \nSecurity Administration, and it is time to give him and every other TSA \nscreener parity with those other Federal employees so that they may \nbetter do the critical work we ask and need them to do.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak at some length about these two \nprovisions. Both are, I think, important. One is a dedicated grant \nprogram for interoperable communications that, as I said, I think will \nhave a critical effect and I hope we will discuss the positive effect. \nThe second, I am afraid, will be discussed more than it deserves. That \nprovision is fair. It is simple equity. It treats working people with \nthe fairness they deserve, and in fact will improve our security, not \nhamper it, as its critics say. I urge my colleagues to look at both \ncarefully, and particularly when an amendment is offered, as I fear it \nwill be, to strike the section that would correct the inequity now \nsuffered by transportation screeners, when it comes to the floor, that \nmy colleagues will come, will listen, and ultimately will vote to \nreject that amendment.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 269\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment and call up amendment No. 269.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, for the moment I am going to object on \nbehalf of Senator Collins who is co-managing the bill with me because \nno one has looked at the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from California has the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. The amendment I \nam seeking to bring up is a bill that has been reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee, and essentially what it would do is ensure the \nconfirmation of all U.S. attorneys by the Senate.\n  What happened was that in 2006, an amendment went into the PATRIOT\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\nAct that allowed the administration to appoint an interim U.S. attorney \nindefinitely without confirmation. In the early part of this year, I \nbelieve it was on January 6, I learned that six U.S. attorneys had been \ncalled and summarily told they were to resign effective a specific date \nin January. I was told by the person who gave me the information that \nthere was something suspicious about that. I didn't know, so I began to \nlook into it.\n  Well, I received a new story today about one of those U.S. attorneys, \nand if I might, I will read it to this body. It is an article by Marisa \nTaylor of the McClatchy Newspapers:\n\n       The U.S. Attorney from New Mexico who was recently fired by \n     the Bush administration said Wednesday that he believes he \n     was forced out because he refused to rush an indictment in an \n     ongoing probe of local Democrats a month before November's \n     congressional elections.\n       David Iglesias said two Members of Congress separately \n     called in mid October to inquire about the timing of an \n     ongoing probe of a kickback scheme and appeared eager for an \n     indictment to be issued on the eve of the elections in order \n     to benefit the Republicans. He refused to name the Members of \n     Congress because he said he feared retaliation.\n       Two months later, on December 7, Iglesias became one of six \n     U.S. Attorneys ordered to step down for what administration \n     officials have termed ``performance-related issues.'' Two \n     other U.S. Attorneys also have been asked to resign.\n       Iglesias, who received a positive performance review before \n     he was fired, said he suspected he was forced out because of \n     his refusal to be pressured to hand down an indictment on the \n     ongoing probe:\n       I believe that because I didn't play ball, so to speak, I \n     was asked to resign, said Iglesias, who officially stepped \n     down on Wednesday.\n       Iglesias acknowledged that he had no proof that the \n     pressure from the congressional members prompted his forced \n     resignation, but he said the contact in and of itself \n     violated one of the most important tenets of a U.S. \n     Attorney's Office: Don't mix politics with prosecutions. The \n     article goes on.\n\n  Now this is only one element of this story. The matter has been the \nsubject of a hearing in the Judiciary Committee. Legislation is ready \nto come before the floor. I have introduced it as an amendment. We \napproved it in the Judiciary Committee with a bipartisan vote. I think \nthe time has come to do two things. One would be for the Judiciary \nCommittee--and I hope it will, and I believe the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Administrative Oversight and The Courts, Senator \nSchumer, is interested in doing this--to issue subpoenas to have these \nU.S. attorneys come before the Committee to answer questions about how \ntheir demanded resignations took place.\n  Generally, a U.S. attorney is appointed for a term of four years, but \nserves at the pleasure of the President. If he wants to fire them he \ncan. However, U.S. attorneys have very complicated and very difficult \ncases and I believe they must have some level of independence. The FBI, \nas we have heard in our oversight hearings, has raised the level of \npublic corruption in their investigations.\n  So if the FBI investigates a case and comes up with the evidence, a \nU.S. attorney is obviously bound to prosecute that case. How this \naffects David Iglesias, I don't know. But the fact that these people \nall had very good performance reviews causes me a great concern. I wish \nto read from those performance reviews.\n  The performance review for John McKay of the Western District of \nWashington says:\n\n       ``McKay is an effective, well-regarded and capable leader \n     of the [U.S. attorney's office] and the District's law \n     enforcement community,'' according to the team of 27 Justice \n     Department officials.\n\n  David Iglesias, about whom I read the news story, of the District of \nNew Mexico, got this performance review:\n\n       The [U.S. Attorney] had a highly effective firearms \n     violence initiative and active and effective program to \n     address drug trafficking.\n\n  Daniel Bogden, District of Nevada:\n\n       United States Attorney Bogden was highly regarded by the \n     federal judiciary, the law enforcement and civil client \n     agencies, and the staff of the United States Attorney's \n     Office. He was a capable leader of the [office].\n\n  Bud Cummins, who many of us know, in the Eastern District of \nArkansas:\n\n       The U.S. Attorney had an active, well managed anti-\n     terrorism program . . . The Project Safe Neighborhoods \n     initiatives were being effectively implemented and \n     successfully managed.\n\n  Carol Lam, Southern District of California, including San Diego, whom \nI am very familiar with:\n\n       Carol Lam was an effective manager and respected leader in \n     the District . . . Appropriate management procedures and \n     practices were in place to ensure a quality written work \n     product.\n\n  These are some of the snippets from the reviews. But clearly, the \nperformance of these U.S. attorneys was not a reason to fire them.\n  I truly believe what the Department of Justice intended to do was \nwhat they did in the Eastern District of Arkansas--bring in bright, \nyoung Republican political operatives to assume these roles to give \nthem a leg up and fire or require the resignation of these U.S. \nattorneys.\n  When I began to inquire into it, I asked whether interviews for \nreplacements were taking place within these offices, particularly in \nSan Diego. At that time, no one in the office was being interviewed as \na replacement. Since these hearings have begun, individuals within the \noffice have been interviewed. In fact, one has been appointed to fill \nin for former U.S. Attorney Carol Lam.\n  I truly believe there was an effort to use this section of the \nPATRIOT Act reauthorization to bring political operatives into these \noffices, and I think it is a matter of urgency for us to pass the \nlegislation that was marked up by the Judiciary Committee. Absent that, \nthere is no recourse, other than to issue subpoenas, to have these \nformer U.S. attorneys come before the committee and be able to ask them \nsome hard questions.\n  I think when a U.S. attorney who has served, and served well, is \nsummarily dismissed for no real reason, it is a problem. We all know \nthe U.S. attorney in San Diego brought the prosecution of a Member of \nthe House of Representatives who is serving consequential time for \nmajor felonies and had subpoenas outstanding for other Members of the \nHouse and was summarily told in December that she should resign--in \nthis case--by the end of January. That is not right.\n  So the only way I know to right the wrong is to restore the law to \nwhere it was before the PATRIOT Act reauthorization. That law is this \namendment and the amendment is very simple. It simply says that the \nAttorney General may appoint an interim U.S. attorney to a vacancy for \n120 days. After 120 days, if a nominee has not been confirmed by the \nSenate, the district court in the district where the vacancy exists can \nmake an appointment. This provides the incentive for the administration \nto move a nominee. I should say there are 13 vacancies, of which only 3 \nnominees have presently been sent to the Senate. If you combine those \n13 vacancies with the seven new vacancies, then over 20 percent of the \nU.S. attorney positions could be filled without Senate confirmation if \nwe assume the intent was not to send a nominee to the Senate. Of \ncourse, the administration will decry this and say that is not the \ncase. Nonetheless, there were 13 vacancies and now seven new vacancies \nwith only 3 nominees before the Judiciary Committee for review and for \napproval by the full Senate.\n  If the law is left as it is, any Attorney General or President could \nessentially appoint every single U.S. attorney as an interim U.S. \nattorney, not subject to confirmation. If you consider the work of the \nU.S. attorneys--the public corruption, the major narcotics cases, the \nimmigration cases, the complicated Federal law they carry out--I think \nevery Member of this body would believe that confirmation by the Senate \nfor every U.S. attorney should be assured. This amendment will carry \nthat forward.\n  I was shocked to read about David Iglesias. I don't know whether it \nis accurate. I know it appeared in the news. Based on that, he has said \nhe believes he was forced out for a political reason. There is only one \nway to find out, and that is for the Judiciary Committee to issue \nsubpoenas, have these U.S. attorneys come before us, and ask a number \nof hard questions.\n  I am hopeful this body will see fit to pass this amendment. It is \nsimple, short, direct, and it solves the problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, knowing the Senator from California as I \ndo, I am certain a lot of the issues she has raised are serious ones, \ndeserving of\n\n[[Page S2337]]\n\nscrutiny. They are, however, under the jurisdiction of the Judiciary \nCommittee and not the Homeland Security Committee. As such, I don't \nfeel that I, at this time, have the expertise or the knowledge to \nevaluate the amendment that has been filed by the Senator from \nCalifornia. That is why I am objecting to the amendment. It is not \nbecause of its merits but because it is not relevant to this debate. I \nhave not had a chance to look at it, and it is not in the jurisdiction \nof the Homeland Security Committee.\n  I will say to my colleagues that the Senator from Connecticut and I \nhave been working very hard in a bipartisan way to try to keep the \nfocus of this bill on issues to improve our homeland security. We were \nvery pleased that, despite the overwhelming importance of the debate on \nIraq, there had been an agreement by our leaders to try to keep that \ndebate for the next issue to come before the Senate, rather than having \nit tied in with this bill. Similarly, the families of the victims of 9/\n11 have made a plea to all of us to focus on this bill and to keep \nextraneous issues off this bill and rather focus on issues the 9/11 \nCommission raised. That is what we are attempting to do. I have no \ndoubt this is an important issue, an issue that is worthy of debate, an \nissue that is worthy of scrutiny by the Judiciary Committee, based on \nthe explanation of the Senator from California, for whom I have a great \ndeal of respect. But it is an issue that is completely outside the \njurisdiction of the Homeland Security Committee.\n  For that reason, my hope is the Senator from California will look at \nthis as an opportunity to educate us on the issue but will not proceed \nwith this amendment because it is not at all relevant to the bill \nbefore us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to follow up on the comments of my \nfriend from California, who has legislation I am proud to cosponsor on \nthe general issue of the fired U.S. attorneys.\n  Mr. President, it is said that ``where there is smoke there is \nfire.'' As we look at the case of the U.S. attorneys, that is more and \nmore likely to be true.\n  Today, according to the McClatchy Newspapers, one of the fired U.S. \nattorneys from New Mexico said that ``two Members of Congress \nseparately called in mid-October to inquire about the timing of an \nongoing probe of a kickback scheme and appeared eager for an indictment \nto be issued on the eve of the elections in order to benefit the \nRepublicans.''\n  That is a quote in an article by Marisa Taylor of the McClatchy \nNewspapers. Frankly, it comes as no surprise to me. That is because \nDavid Iglesias, the U.S. attorney, told my staff the same thing the day \nbefore. He asked, in fact, that he be brought to Washington--was \nwilling, rather, to be brought to Washington, under the power of \nsubpoena, to tell his story. We have inquired of the fired U.S. \nattorneys. The overwhelming majority of them want to tell more but feel \nhonor-bound not to do it, except if they were brought under the power \nof subpoena to Washington.\n  So I join certainly in the request of my colleague from California \nand others. I have already spoken to Senator Leahy, and we are \nexamining how that can be accomplished. Senator Leahy is very mindful \nof the fact that the Judiciary Committee doesn't issue subpoenas willy-\nnilly. But given the fact that some of the U.S. attorneys expressed a \ndesire to testify, and others said they would be willing to testify, \nand now with these new revelations, the fear many of us had that these \nU.S. attorneys were summarily fired not for no reason and not for a \ngood reason but for a bad reason is coming closer to reality.\n  Mr. President, we must get to the bottom of this issue. The U.S. \nattorney is the lead enforcer of the law in his or her jurisdiction. \nFortunately, for decades, the U.S. attorneys, almost without exception, \nhave been insulated from the political process, even though they are \nchosen in part by the political process. So when six were fired in one \nevening, and when it later became clear in hearings I held that at \nleast one, by the admission of the Deputy Attorney General, was fired \nfor no reason, and a call from the White House to suggest a replacement \nwho was someone with very little legal experience but someone who had \nworked for both Karl Rove and the RNC, I believe it was, you can \nimagine the concern that not only the Senator from California and I had \nbut the concern throughout the country in law enforcement--\nnonpolitical, simply a desire to protect the integrity of the U.S. \nattorneys. So we must do two things now.\n  These new revelations are extremely troubling. They would show \npolitics at its worst--the long hand of the Justice Department reaching \nout to fire U.S. attorneys who would not do what was politically asked. \nAt least that is a very real suspicion. So we must get to the bottom of \nthis. The only way to do that is to call before us the fired U.S. \nattorneys and hear their side of the story.\n  I remind my colleagues that we did have a briefing--the Senator from \nCalifornia was there, the Senator from Rhode Island was there--and then \nwere shown the evaluation reports, the EARS reports, and almost to a \nperson the fired U.S. attorneys received very good evaluations from \ntheir peers and from everybody else. If you read those evaluations, you \nwould say: Oh, they will keep that person in office for as long as he \nor she wants to stay. But instead, they were fired.\n  In private conversations my staff has had with them, they have grave \nsuspicions as to why--some of them more than grave suspicions. Today, \nMr. Iglesias said publicly what he told my staff privately, that he has \na very troubling view that he may well have been fired because he \nrefused to bend his U.S. attorney's office to politics of the worst \nsort.\n  So there are two imperatives here. One, as I said, is to get to the \nbottom of this and get to the bottom of it quickly. The second is to \npass legislation that restores the appointment of U.S. attorneys away \nor at least removes it somewhat from the political realm because when \nthe Senate must confirm or when an independent judge must temporarily \nappoint, there is a check, there is a balance that was removed, \nunbeknownst to almost all of us, in the PATRIOT Act. The minute that \npassed, people were surprised and wondered: Why did it happen? The \nexplanation from the administration didn't quite ring true. Then, on \nthe evening of December 7, when six U.S. attorneys were called at once \nand fired and not given any reason, suspicions went further. The \ninvestigations my subcommittee has had, with the help of our chairman, \nthe Senator from Vermont, and the Senator from California, who has \ntaken a keen interest in this issue and is lead sponsor of the \nlegislation, have gotten worse every day.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the expression goes: Where \nthere is smoke, there is fire. Every day, not only is there more smoke \nin this investigation of the firing of the U.S. attorneys, but there \nseems to be, unfortunately, a real fire. We will not rest until we get \nto the bottom of this matter, to see what happened, to see if possibly \nany rules, regulations, or even laws were broken. By bringing it to \nlight, it will importune this body, the other body, and the White House \nto pass legislation so that it cannot happen again.\n  Mr. President, in sum, this is serious stuff. When U.S. attorneys are \nfired for political reasons, fired to stand in the way of justice \nrather than promote justice, it puts a dagger into the heart of the \nfaith Americans have in their Government and in their system of \njustice. That faith, fortunately, is long and deep, but if we don't get \nto the bottom of this, if we don't change the law to make sure it \ndoesn't happen again, we will be weakening permanently our system of \njustice and the faith the public has in it.\n  We will move forward in whatever way we can. Hopefully, we will find \nit is possible to subpoena these attorneys and subpoena them quickly \nand then take the necessary action in these cases and prevent future \ncases from occurring, which justice and the faith the people have in \nthe American system demand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the remarks the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from New York\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\nhave made today are very well taken, and I rise to express my shared \nconcern with them and my support for their initiative to get to the \nbottom of what took place. In May of 1994 I had the honor to be sworn \nin as Rhode Island's U.S. attorney. It was one of the great honors of \nmy life, equivalent to the great honor of being sworn in with you, Mr. \nPresident, into this extraordinary body. I knew when I took that oath \nthat I would be forced to make very hard decisions and that my \nindependence and my integrity would be my strongest allies as I \ndischarged the extraordinarily difficult and powerful responsibilities \nof a U.S. attorney.\n  Last December, seven U.S. attorneys were fired by the Department of \nJustice, all on the very same day. That is unprecedented. Never, to my \nknowledge, in the history of the Department have so many heads of U.S. \nattorneys rolled all on the same day. These men and women had been \nconfirmed in this great Chamber. By all indications, they were well \nqualified and performing well in their jobs. Several of them were \ninvolved in ongoing public corruption investigations. Yet in this \nunprecedented step, this administration showed them all the door. It \nsuggests to us all the question: why might such an extraordinary act \nhave taken place; why were they told their services were no longer \nrequired?\n  The Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales, told us this:\n\n       What we do is make an evaluation about the performance of \n     individuals, and I have a responsibility to the people in \n     your district that we have the best possible people in these \n     positions.\n\n  Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty testified that ``turnover in the \nposition of U.S. attorney is not uncommon.''\n\n  So the two suggestions that were made were that this was performance \nrelated, that a performance evaluation had been done of these \nindividuals and they had not measured up, and that it was just \nturnover. It is hard to accommodate both of those stories, but when one \nlooks into each of them, it makes even less sense.\n  The committee, through Senator Schumer and Senator Feinstein, asked \nto see the Evaluation and Review Staff reports, what is called an EARS \nevaluation. When I was a U.S. attorney in Rhode Island, I lived through \nan EARS evaluation. All the local agencies were interviewed by career \nU.S. attorney services staff, detailed to Rhode Island just for the \npurpose of doing these evaluations. They happen in every office every 3 \nyears. They are a significant part of the oversight and management \npractice of the Department of Justice, and they are extremely thorough.\n  We asked to see the reports. When it was clear that we were going to \nask to see these performance evaluations, the Department began to back \ndown. Mr. McNulty told the committee:\n\n       We are ready to stipulate that the removal of the U.S. \n     attorneys may or may not be something supported by an EARS \n     report because it may be something performance related that \n     isn't the subject of what the evaluators saw or when they saw \n     it or how it came up, and so forth.\n\n  There isn't much that an EARS evaluation doesn't look at, and \ncontrary views began to emerge from the Department very shortly.\n  In an article published February 4, the Washington Post reported \nthat:\n\n       [O]ne administration official, who spoke on the condition \n     of anonymity in discussing personnel issues, said the spate \n     of firings was the result of ``pressure from people who make \n     personnel decisions outside of Justice who wanted to make \n     some things happen in those places.''\n\n  Let's look at some of those places. In Arkansas, H.E. Bud Cummins III \nwas a 5-year veteran U.S. attorney serving in Arkansas's Eastern \nDistrict. Last June, he was asked to resign. The man chosen to replace \nthe well-respected Mr. Cummins was Tim Griffin. Mr. Griffin is 37 years \nold. He served as Special Assistant to Assistant Attorney General \nMichael Chertoff in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice, \nwhere he was sent as a detailee to the Arkansas U.S. Attorney's Office.\n  What Mr. Griffin lacked in prosecutorial experience, he more than \nmade up for in political experience. Mr. Griffin is a former aide to \nPresidential adviser Karl Rove. He is also a former Republican National \nCommittee research director. As those of us who have been through this \nsort of thing know, ``research director'' is not about looking up old \nstatutes; it is about prying into personal lives of other candidates in \norder to try to dig up dirt on them.\n  A more partisan choice could not have been made to replace Mr. \nCummins. Remember, Mr. McNulty said:\n\n       The Department is committed to having the best person \n     possible for discharging the responsibilities of that office \n     at all times in every district.\n\n  It is just hard to believe that Mr. Tim Griffin was the best person \npossible, at least not as we ordinarily define those terms. At the end \nof our Judiciary hearing, Mr. McNulty admitted that Mr. Cummins, the \nGovernment's chief prosecutor in Little Rock, Arkansas, was fired to \ngive Mr. Griffin the opportunity to have the appointment.\n  In San Diego, U.S. attorney Carol Lam successfully prosecuted Duke \nCunningham, who pled guilty and resigned in 2005. She subpoenaed the \nHouse Armed Services, Appropriations, and Intelligence Committees in \nconnection with a probe into Defense Department contracts. Her office \nindicted Kyle ``Dusty'' Foggo, the CIA's former Executive Director, and \nBrent Wilkes, a defense contractor and top Republican fundraiser.\n  In her district, former Reagan U.S. attorney Peter Nunez--another \nRepublican political appointee familiar with the world of U.S. \nattorneys because he served there himself; he served from 1982 to \n1988--said this:\n\n       It's just like nothing I have ever seen before in 35-plus \n     years. To be asked to resign and to be publicly humiliated by \n     leaking this to the press is beyond any bounds of decency and \n     behavior. It shocks me. It is really outrageous.\n\n  San Diego's top-ranking FBI official, Dan Dzwilewski, also commented \non Lam's firing. Bear in mind, this is the Director of the FBI office \nthat is operating as lead agency in these public corruption \ninvestigations. His quote:\n\n       I guarantee politics is involved . . . It will be a huge \n     loss from my perspective.\n\n  Other U.S. attorneys, such as David Iglesias of New Mexico and John \nMcKay of Seattle, said they had no idea why they were being asked to \nstep down.\n  That changed recently. Today was posted a story from which I will \nquote:\n\n       The U.S. attorney from New Mexico who was recently fired by \n     the Bush administration said Wednesday that he believes he \n     was forced out because he refused to rush an indictment in an \n     ongoing probe of local Democrats a month before November's \n     Congressional elections.\n       David Iglesias said two members of Congress separately \n     called in mid October to inquire about the timing of an \n     ongoing probe of a kickback scheme and appeared eager for an \n     indictment to be issued on the eve of the elections in order \n     to benefit the Republicans. He refused to name the members of \n     Congress because he said he feared retaliation. . . .\n       \"U.S. Attorney Daniel Bogden, who also stepped down \n     Wednesday after being asked to leave in December'' had it \n     recently reported in the Wall Street Journal that the FBI was \n     investigating in his district allegations ``whether Nevada \n     Governor Jim Gibbons performed any official acts on behalf of \n     a contract in exchange for gifts or payments. Gibbons, a \n     Republican, has denied any wrongdoing.''\n       Bogden said he hoped that the ongoing case did not have \n     anything to do with his ouster.\n\n  This is his quote:\n\n       You would like to think that the reason you're put in the \n     position as U.S. attorney is because you are willing to step \n     up to the plate and take on big cases, Bogden said.\n       It's not a good thing if you begin to wonder whether you'll \n     lose your job if you pursue them.\n\n  Last month, a Las Vegas newspaper reported:\n\n       a GOP source said . . . the decision to remove U.S. \n     attorneys, primarily in the West, was part of a plan to \n     ``give somebody else that experience'' to build up the back \n     bench of Republicans by giving them high-profile jobs.\n\n  These are extremely troubling facts. The New York Times has recently \neditorialized on this subject and hypothesized three reasons for why \nthese well-qualified attorneys were fired. As the New York Times said, \n``all political and all disturbing.'' The first reason: helping \nfriends; the second, candidate recruitment; the third, Presidential \npolitics.\n  The newspaper concluded that the politicization of Government over \nthe last 6 years has had tragic consequences in New Orleans, in Iraq, \nand elsewhere, but allowing politics to infect U.S. Attorney's Offices \ntakes it to\n\n[[Page S2339]]\n\na whole new level. Congress should continue to pursue the case of the \nfired U.S. attorneys vigorously, both to find out what really happened \nand to make sure that it does not happen again.\n  I would like to highlight two further concerns that come from my \nexperience as a U.S. attorney. One concern is how this alters the \nbalance between U.S. Attorney's Offices and what we used to call main \nJustice, and the second concern is the chilling effect on prosecutions \nof public corruption.\n  There is constant tension between the U.S. attorneys in the field and \nmain Justice. The U.S. attorneys know their districts, they have \npracticed before those judges, they know their office's capabilities \nvery well, and they have their own local priorities. Of course, the \nDepartment of Justice also has its own priorities, its national \npriorities set by the President, and the tension between those two is \nhealthy and is constant. In getting its message out to the U.S. \nattorneys, the Department has a wide array of ways to send its signals \nand make its wishes known, but to take six or seven well-performing \nU.S. attorneys and sack them all at once ends that dialogue. It brings \nthe blunt instrument of, not even persuasion any longer, but brute \nforce, to bear.\n  Now, there can very well be policy differences between the Department \nof Justice and local offices, but this would be a first for the \nDepartment of Justice, to say: You haven't emphasized this enough so we \nare going to have your head. It will squash the healthy tension between \nU.S. attorneys and between the Department, and at least in my \nexperience, the greater wisdom of the Department of Justice versus that \nof all the U.S. attorneys in the field was not such that it justifies \nthis level of force in emphasis and enforcement and in the demand for \nconformity with its policy positions.\n  I submit there is long-term damage to the capabilities of the \nDepartment of Justice as this tension is disrupted. We live in a \ncountry of checks and balances, and tensions like these are very often \nthe best things for the public we serve when they are allowed to be \nmaintained in a healthy fashion.\n  The second point I would make is the chilling effect on prosecutions \nof public corruption. This applies particularly with respect to Ms. Lam \nin California. In many respects, she had become the leading edge of the \nFederal Government's sword point on public corruption investigation \nbecause of the investigations that I mentioned earlier in my remarks. \nHer office was leading the biggest public corruption cases in the \nNation, with more to come it appears. U.S. Attorney Lam was personally \nat the helm of these investigations, and she was well qualified for \nthat role. Her unceremonious expulsion from office will send a \nshockwave through the offices of her fellow U.S. attorneys, and that \nshockwave will carry a very unfortunate message because these cases are \nnot easy ones.\n  Public corruption cases are resource intensive for the office \ninvolved. They are extraordinarily challenging. Witnesses are scarce \nand difficult, significant agent expertise is required, internal \nprocedures governing the investigation itself are complex and onerous, \nand launching one's office at established political figures is a \ndecision with potentially serious consequences not only for the U.S. \nattorney but for the career people in that office. Someone who has come \nthrough all of that and moved out onto the leading edge of public \ncorruption investigation for this country, I believe, merits the active \nsupport of the Department of Justice not just for the good work done \nbut as a message and a signal to U.S. attorneys around the country that \nwhen they step out into that public corruption arena, we will back them \nup.\n  The signal to the contrary is a dangerous one. When a U.S. attorney \ngets fired, and one who was deep into a public corruption investigation \nand is leading it so well that their termination draws a public rebuke \nfrom the FBI chief, antennae will go up across the country.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks a letter that the Attorney \nGeneral has received from the National Association of Former United \nStates Attorneys.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, the sentence in that letter which \nstrikes me as the most significant is:\n\n       We are concerned that the role of the United States \n     Attorneys may have been undermined by what may have been \n     political considerations which run counter to the proper \n     administration of justice and the traditions of the \n     Department of Justice.\n\n  This is not a good day. This is not the sort of thing that we need to \nbe discussing. This is not the sort of thing that we should be \ndiscussing. As Senator Schumer earlier said, there is a lot of smoke in \nthe air right now, and it looks as if there is actually some fire. It \nis truly incumbent on this body, the body which confirmed these \nindividuals to their offices and which has oversight responsibility \nwith the Department of Justice, to look into what is happening and to \nreestablish the procedures to prevent this from happening again.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         The National Association of Former United States \n           Attorneys,\n                                                February 14, 2007.\n     Hon. Alberto R. Gonzales,\n     Attorney General of the United States, United States \n         Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n\n     Re: Media Reports of Termination of United States Attorneys\n       Dear Attorney General Gonzales, We are the President and \n     Executive Director of the National Association of Former \n     United States Attorneys (``NAFUSA''). NAFUSA was founded in \n     March 1979 to promote, defend and further the integrity and \n     the preservation of the litigating authority and independence \n     of the Office of the United States Attorney. Our membership \n     includes United States Attorneys from every administration \n     back to President Kennedy and includes former United States \n     Attorneys from every state in the union. It is with this \n     mission and with our cumulative experience as United States \n     Attorneys that we write.\n       We are very troubled with recent press accounts concerning \n     the termination of a sizable number of United States \n     Attorneys. Historically, United States Attorneys have had a \n     certain degree of independence because of the unique and \n     integral role the United States Attorneys play in federal law \n     enforcement Among other things, the United States Attorney \n     establishes and maintains working and trusting relationships \n     with key federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. \n     In many respects, while the United States Attorney is a \n     representative of the Department of Justice in each district, \n     the United States Attorney also brings to bear his or her \n     experience and knowledge of the law enforcement needs of the \n     district in establishing priorities and allocating resources. \n     Most importantly, United States Attorneys have maintained a \n     strong. tradition of insuring that the laws of the United \n     States are faithfully executed, without favor to anyone and \n     without regard to any political consideration. It is for \n     these reasons that the usual practice has been for United \n     States Attorneys to be permitted to serve for the duration of \n     the administration that appointed them.\n       We are concerned that the role of the United States \n     Attorneys may have been undermined by what may have been \n     political considerations which run counter to the proper \n     administration of justice and the tradition of the Department \n     of Justice. While we certainly recognize that the United \n     States Attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President, we \n     would vigorously oppose any effort by any Attorney General to \n     remove a United States Attorney as a result of political \n     displeasure or for political reward. Any such effort would \n     undermine the confidence of the federal judiciary, federal \n     and local law enforcement agencies, the public, and the \n     thousands of Assistant United States Attorneys working in \n     those offices.\n       We do not mean to suggest that we know the reasons for each \n     of the terminations or, for that matter, all of the relevant \n     facts. Indeed, we encourage the Department of Justice and \n     Congress to make as full and as complete a disclosure of the \n     facts surrounding these firings as is permissible. Still, the \n     reported facts are troubling, perhaps unique in the annals of \n     the Department of Justice, and certainly raise questions as \n     to whether political considerations prompted the decision to \n     terminate so many United States Attorneys. It may well be \n     that legislative attention or a written policy of the \n     Department of Justice is necessary to deal with this and \n     similar situations in the future to afford continuity and \n     protection to United States Attorneys. We will be happy to \n     assist the Department or Congress in any such effort.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Atlee W. Wampler III,\n       President.\n     B. Mahlon Brown,\n       Executive Director.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 279, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask for regular order in regards to my \namendment No. 279.

Madam President, if I can make a couple of comments about \nthe modification, many will recall that this amendment is focused on \nour ports and the security of our ports. I think all of us are well \naware that as a nation we see that our ports of entry, whether they be \nin Seattle, New York, or Charleston, SC, could be our most vulnerable \npoints when it comes to smuggling in a weapon of mass destruction. We \nhave committed many resources and lots of technology to try to detect \nradiation and other types of weapons that might be smuggled into our \ncountry that could hurt Americans and destroy American cities, and we \nare making some progress. But there is a lot more to be done.\n  All the spending, all the technology, all the equipment in the world \nwill make no difference at all if we don't have the right people \nworking in the secure areas of our ports. We need to make sure those \npeople are the most trusted we have, just as we do in our airports. Our \nresponsibility, whether it is homeland security as an administration or \nwe as the Congress, is to make sure these people are screened and that \nwe have the best and the most trusted individuals working in our secure \nareas. This is very important.\n  My amendment focuses on just that subject. It prohibits convicted \nfelons\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n\nfrom working in the secure areas of our ports. This is common sense to \nmost Americans, and I think it is common sense to most in this Senate \nbecause when this exact same amendment was offered last year, when we \nwere dealing with port security specifically, everyone voted for this \namendment in the Senate. Unfortunately, that amendment was stripped out \nwhen we had a conference with the House.\n  Many of my colleagues have encouraged me to reintroduce this \namendment, Republicans and Democrats alike, and that is exactly what I \nhave done. I understand the Senator from Hawaii is considering \nintroducing a modification that would allow the Secretary to eliminate \nsome of these felonies that we have listed in our amendment. Please \nkeep in mind that the listed felonies are the exact same ones that \nhomeland security has listed in the regulation that they have put in \nforce at their agency. So this amendment puts in law what homeland \nsecurity has already put into regulation.\n  The importance of putting it in law is that we already suspect this \nlegislation will be contested; that there will be delays, there will be \nchallenges, and we need to make sure that our ports are secure. The \nmodification of my amendment would allow the Secretary to add felonies \nin the future which may become important but that are not now listed. \nWe think it would be a huge mistake if we put in law something that \nallowed future administrations to eliminate felonies that are \nspecifically laid out in regulation and in this amendment I am \noffering.\n  If anyone in the Senate would like to eliminate some of the felonies \nthat we have listed, I would encourage them to come to the Senate floor \nand let's discuss those that they would like to eliminate. Maybe they \nwould like to have some of these folks working in the secure areas of \nour ports, folks who have committed espionage, sedition, treason, \nterrorism, crimes involving transportation security, improper transport \nof hazardous material, unlawful use of an explosive device, bomb \nthreats, or murder. These are specifically listed. If there are some of \nthese that we think should be eliminated, let's discuss them.\n  Homeland Security has evaluated this and has listed these, just like \nwe have for our airports, to keep our ports secure.\n  I am offering this modification that would allow our Secretary to add \nfelonies but prohibit the elimination of these felonies which we think \nare so important to our security.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to offer this modification, and \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from South \nCarolina for his modification. We talked about this briefly. I think he \nis heading in the right direction. We are taking a look at the \namendment as it is offered, and we look forward to working together. I \nthink the purposes are very important.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add Ms. \nMurkowski, a Senator from Alaska, as a cosponsor to the Collins \namendment No. 277.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 277\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, speaking of the Collins amendment on \nREAL ID, cosponsored by Senators Alexander, Mikulski, Carper, Cantwell, \nSnowe, Chambliss, and Murkowski, I bring to my colleagues' attention \nthe several groups representing Governors, State legislatures, and \nothers who are now speaking in favor of passage of this amendment. In \naddition, as the Presiding Officer so ably represents the State of New \nYork, there was a Newsday editorial today also endorsing the amendment \nwith its 2-year delay.\n  The National Governors Association has also issued a statement that \nsays:\n\n       Senator Collins' bipartisan amendment recognizes the need \n     to give state officials and other interested parties the \n     right to review regulations and suggest modifications.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       This proposal would provide states a more workable time \n     frame to comply with federal standards, ensure necessary \n     systems are operational and enhance the input states and \n     other stakeholders have in the implementation process.\n\n  We have also heard from the American Federation of State, County and \nMunicipal Employees, a union that is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, which \nhas written a letter as well. It says:\n\n       It is clear that the states do not have the capacity to \n     comply with the REAL ID Act by the 2008 deadline and that a \n     number of serious concerns related to privacy must be \n     addressed. The Collins amendment provides the opportunity to \n     address these matters.\n\n  Similarly, another group with whom we have worked closely is the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures. In fact, it was a high-\nranking official of the NCSL who sat next to me on a plane going to \nMaine some time ago and suggested that what States needed most was a \ndelay in the compliance time. I worked very closely with the NCSL in \ndrafting our amendment. I am very grateful for their advice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters and editorials I have \nmentioned be printed in the Record so we may share them with our \ncolleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the National Governors Association, Feb. 28, 2007]\n\n         NGA Praises Congressional Movement To Correct REAL ID\n\n       Washington.--On behalf of the nation's governors, the \n     National Governors Association (NGA) issued the following \n     statement regarding the introduction of an amendment to delay \n     implementation of Real ID.\n       ``Governors praise Senator Susan Collins, ranking member of \n     the Senate Homeland Security Committee, for introducing an \n     amendment to address the issues raised by the Real ID Act of \n     2005.

We strongly urge you to oppose this amendment. \n     In addition, we urge you to support an amendment to be \n     offered by Senator Collins that would delay implementation of \n     requirements under the REAL ID Act and to reopen negotiated \n     rulemaking of the Act.\n       With respect to the DeMint amendment, it is important to \n     highlight that civil service protections, backed up by \n     collective bargaining, ensure that federal employment is \n     efficient, fair, open to all, free from political \n     interference and staffed by honest, competent and dedicated \n     employees. Civil service protections and collective \n     bargaining rights ensure that federal employees are able to \n     fulfill their assignments with professional integrity and a \n     commitment to the public interest. The decision to take away \n     civil service protections and collective bargaining rights \n     has resulted in a demoralized workforce, with injury and \n     illness rates that are six times higher than the federal \n     average and an attrition rate that is more than ten times \n     higher than the federal employee average. Clearly, the \n     removal of civil service protections and collective \n     bargaining rights has jeopardized the public, not made it \n     safer.\n       With respect to the Collins amendment, we have previously \n     expressed our concern over the costs to the states to \n     implement the requirements under the REAL ID Act. It is clear \n     that states do not have the capacity to\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\n     comply with the Act by the 2008 deadline and that a number of \n     serious concerns related to privacy must be addressed.

Legislators throughout the country \n     support REAL ID's goal of making drivers licenses more \n     secure, but are frustrated by the rigidity of the law's \n     approach, the high costs it imposes on states and the \n     inordinately long time it has taken the Department of \n     Homeland Security to issue the regulations needed to \n     implement REAL ID.\n       NCSL is encouraged that Senator Collins, ranking member of \n     the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n     Committee, and other members of Congress are taking steps to \n     correct the problems associated with the law. S. 563 provides \n     a longer time frame to comply with the federal standards and \n     to ensure that necessary systems are operational.

Part of a \n     suite of measures to beef up homeland security, the act \n     requires that by mid-2008, Americans must have a federally \n     approved ID card--most likely an enhanced driver's license--\n     to travel on airplanes, collect government payments or use \n     government services and open a bank account. The national ID \n     cards would have to be machine-readable.\n       As the deadline approaches for compliance with the act, \n     opposition to the mandate has grown. Late last month, the \n     Maine Legislature became the first in the nation to pass a \n     measure against the requirement, unequivocally refusing to \n     implement the act and urging Congress to repeal it. Too \n     expensive, too fast, too much of an invasion of privacy and \n     too burdensome to administer, said a bipartisan coalition of \n     Maine lawmakers. Estimate of the cost of compliance in Maine \n     alone is $185 million.\n       The Legislature's rejection made news around the nation. \n     What Maine started threatened to become a tidal wave of state \n     opposition. In an effort to stem the momentum and salvage \n     what she considers good about the requirement, U.S. Sen. \n     Susan Collins Friday announced she's introducing legislation \n     to delay implementation of the act and provide states with a \n     more reasonable time frame for complying with its new \n     standards for drivers' licenses. ``The costs of complying \n     with REAL ID are enormous and overly burdensome to states, \n     including Maine,'' said Collins.\n       We agree. Collins' legislation puts the brakes on a mandate \n     that raises significant concerns, as well as the broader \n     question of whether the REAL ID would ultimately be \n     effective.\n       Her bill would give the Department of Homeland Security the \n     ability to delay or waive REAL ID requirements if states \n     don't have the technical capability to comply with it, or the \n     money.\n       It furthermore calls to the discussion table the right \n     group of people to hammer out an alternative: federal and \n     state officials, privacy advocates and others with a stake in \n     the matter. We're encouraged that this senator, who has made \n     her name as an advocate of effective and real security \n     measures, has focused on finding a solution to the real \n     problems posed by REAL ID.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From the Bangor Daily News]\n\n                            Needed ID Delay\n\n       By introducing a bill to slow the pace of new federal \n     identification rules, Sen. Susan Collins today is expected to \n     offer a way out of a growing confrontation between Washington \n     and the states. The bill would extend the deadline for REAL \n     ID by two years and recognize the cost burden currently \n     imposed on states. Additionally, it reopens the question of \n     how much information the federal government should \n     centralize.\n       This pause is needed. Last week, for instance, Georgia \n     looked at REAL ID's expected price tag of between $30 million \n     and $60 million and declined to fund it. That follows Maine's \n     resolution to reject the program and likely precedes work in \n     about a dozen states that have legislation against REAL ID \n     before their legislatures. The Collins bill would reconvene \n     the panel that made recommendations on this issue and review \n     problems raised by the states, the standards for protecting \n     constitutional rights and civil liberties and the security of \n     the electronic information, among other issues.\n       Under the current regulations, all Americans would have a \n     federally approved ID card by the end of next year. Usually \n     seen as a machine-readable driver's license, the card would \n     be needed not only for driving but all the standard uses--to \n     board airplanes, do business with the federal government, \n     open a bank account. One estimate put the cost to states for \n     transitioning to these new IDs at $11 billion.\n       Besides cost, opponents of the standardized identification \n     program fear that REAL ID will result in a national database, \n     which the federal government may not be equipped to protect. \n     In particular, one provision would require states to verify \n     all documents required for the issuance of a driver's license \n     or identification card. That would require each state to have \n     agreements with all other states or, more likely, have a \n     single national agreement.\n       Given the government's track record on securing private \n     information, states are reasonably worried. Not long ago, the \n     House Government Reform Committee looked at 19 agencies going \n     back to 2003 and found 788 separate cases of confidential \n     data being either lost or stolen. Most of the lost data, the \n     report concluded, was due to ``unauthorized use of data by \n     employees.''\n       The extended deadline proposed by the Collins legislation \n     would give officials an opportunity to improve security at \n     both federal and state levels. And it should find ways for \n     Washington to help pay for this expensive program.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From the Portland Press Herald]\n\n  Real ID program Is a Real Mess; How Can States Standardize Driver's \n           Licenses by 2008 When Standards Haven't Been Set?\n\n       Maine's ``revolt'' against a federal mandate to create an \n     expensive, high-tech driver's license that meets new \n     standards set by the federal government is catching on.\n       Since state legislators overwhelmingly approved a \n     resolution objecting to the Real ID Act of 2005 in late \n     January, lawmakers in Vermont, Georgia, Wyoming, Montana, New \n     Mexico and Washington state have followed suit.\n       The Real ID Act was an effort to enhance and standardize \n     the information on state driver's licenses so they could \n     double as a national identification card.\n       Such a sensitive federal-state issue ought to have been the \n     subject of negotiations including the states. But the House \n     of Representatives forged ahead with the Real ID Act, which \n     simply ordered the Department of Homeland Security to write \n     its own requirements. The measure passed the Senate attached \n     to a supplemental spending bill.\n       A very real set of concerns revolve around the security of \n     the machine-readable personal information that will be \n     included in the high-tech card, as well as the security of \n     the linked national database that will house this \n     information. One recent study found more than 700 instances \n     of confidential data being stolen from the federal government \n     since 2003.\n       Also problematic is the notion that state transportation \n     workers will be essentially conscripted to the front line of \n     this federal program.\n       Across the country, states will begin working on their 2008 \n     budgets this year. A 2006 study by the National Governors \n     Association tabbed the cost of compliance at $11 billion over \n     five years. Secretary of State Matt Dunlap estimates Maine's \n     share will be $185 million.\n       Yet despite Real ID's looming May 2008 deadline for \n     compliance, states still haven't seen the law's requirements.\n       On Monday, Sen. Susan Collins introduced a bill that would \n     delay the compliance date for two years to 2010 so the \n     federal government can get its act straightened out.\n       Her bill would convene a panel of federal and state \n     stakeholders to examine issues raised by the states around \n     cost, privacy and feasibility.\n       Rep. Tom Allen intends to offer a bill that would repeal \n     the law entirely.\n       If Congress feels homeland security requires that all \n     Americans carry an internal passport, then it ought to \n     administer the program.\n       It ought to pay for it as well.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From Newsday (NY), Feb. 28, 2007]\n\n                    Go Slow on New Driver's Licenses\n\n\n                 u.s. should take time to get it right\n\n       It's a sad sign of the times, but a national identification \n     card, a new gold standard for\n\n[[Page S2343]]\n\n     proof of identity, may be needed in the battle against \n     terrorism. The 9/11 Commission urged tighter security for \n     driver's licenses and Congress has asked the Department of \n     Homeland Security to develop rules for standardizing licenses \n     and other state issued identification into what would be, \n     essentially, a national ID card.\n       But establishing a system that will make it appreciably \n     harder for terrorists to operate without exacerbating the \n     problem of identity theft or compromising what's left of \n     privacy in the digital age won't be quick or easy. The \n     current May 2008 implementation date is unrealistic. And \n     there's the question state officials are already asking: Who \n     will pay?\n       Washington hasn't gotten off to a very promising start in \n     dealing with these concerns. In 2004, Congress established a \n     committee of state and federal officials and others to craft \n     regulations for making licenses more uniform and secure. It \n     preempted that process in 2005 when it tacked the Real ID Act \n     to a spending bill, giving the rule-making job to the \n     Department of Homeland Security. It's been almost two years \n     and no rules have been announced, although officials say they \n     may come as soon as this week.\n       But creating a secure, standardized national ID card \n     involves more than deciding on such things as digital \n     photographs and bar codes. Clerks everywhere would need ready \n     access to nationwide databases to verify vital records such \n     as birth certificates, immigration status and driver's \n     license records in all 50 states. Integrating that data, \n     securing it, controlling access and correcting errors will be \n     no small task.\n       Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) wants to give states more time \n     to comply. That's advisable and probably inevitable.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 285 to Amendment No. 275\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nincorporates Senator DeMint's amendment No. 279 regarding the \nTransportation Worker Identification Credential, known as TWIC.\n  I am pleased to advise my colleagues of this amendment. It is \ncosponsored by Senator Stevens, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Murray.\n  The amendment offered by Senator DeMint codifies in statute the list \nof permanent and interim disqualifying offenses for individuals \napplying for a TWIC that the Department of Homeland Security has \nalready codified in final regulations this January.\n  While I understand Senator DeMint's desire to ensure we do not allow \nindividuals who could pose a terrorism security risk to have access to \nour ports, Senator DeMint's language restricts the authority of the \nSecretary to identify, adopt, and modify criminal offenses that may \npose a terrorist security threat.\n  We are all aware of the fact the war on terrorism continues to evolve \nwith emerging threats. We need to ensure the Department has the \nflexibility to adjust their procedures accordingly. I, along with my \nfellow cosponsors, believe such a responsibility is best left to the \nintelligence, terrorist, and law enforcement experts at the Department \nof Homeland Security rather than Members of Congress. Therefore, this \namendment preserves the authority of the Secretary to modify the \noffenses accordingly.\n  I ask my colleagues to support our amendment and help ensure we \nimprove the security of our port facilities in a fair and effective \nmanner.\n  Madam President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Inouye], for himself, Mr. \n     Stevens, Mr. Lieberman, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 285 to amendment No. 275.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To specify the criminal offenses that disqualify an applicant \n          from the receipt of a transportation security card)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. OBAMA). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       U.S. Economic Sovereignty\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, we are in the middle of an ongoing \ndiscussion and debate over our homeland security, and certainly, as all \nof us know, this remains a matter of grave concern. Homeland security \nmeans many things, and it certainly does mean that we fully and \nappropriately fund our police and our fire. It means we guard our ports \nand our infrastructure such as our tunnels and bridges, all of which \nare going to be the subject of the authorization legislation brought \nforward by the chairman and ranking member. But it also means we have \nto remain strong at home and we have to have the economic resources to \nspend on protecting ourselves.\n  Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 416 points--the \nlargest single drop since the markets reopened after the September 11 \nattacks. While our markets were reeling, alarm bells were ringing once \nagain over the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies of this \nadministration that continue to surrender the economic sovereignty of \nour country to foreign banks, investors, and governments piece by \npiece.\n  Yesterday's stock market disruption came on the heels of pessimistic \neconomic news on the homefront and ominous comments about recession by \nformer Fed Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. So while it can and will be \ndebated whether yesterday's market fluctuation was a blip or a larger \nindicator of our economy's vulnerabilities, it is clear that what \nhappened underscores the exposure of our economy to a combination of \neconomic developments in countries such as China and economic policies \nhere at home. A scare in the Chinese stock market, based on rumors \nwithin that country, sent economic reverberations around the world.\n  In terms of our fiscal stability, we are in uncharted waters. \nMarkets, to a certain degree, will always be volatile and, to a great \nextent, we are fortunate that our domestic markets are deep enough to \nabsorb certain shocks. But there is no precedent in U.S. history for an \neconomy as large as ours to be as heavily in debt to its trading \npartners as the United States is to countries such as China, Japan, and \nothers.\n  When it comes to the fiscal recklessness and economic fatalism of the \ncurrent administration, the writing may not be on the wall, but \nyesterday the writing was on the ``Big Board.'' In the face of this \nchallenge, the economic policies of the last 6 years have contributed \nto an erosion of U.S. economic sovereignty and have made us more \ndependent on the economic decisions of other nations. As I have \nproposed, and continue to support, we need to take steps to restore \nfiscal responsibility and sound economic policies based on the facts, \nnot ideology.\n  I will continue to support legislative steps to require that the Bush \nadministration address mounting fiscal and trade imbalances. Today I \nsent letters to Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve \nChairman Ben Bernanke urging them to address many of our underlying \neconomic vulnerabilities resulting from our debt and deficits.\n\n  Our Nation has been running record deficits and digging a massive \nfiscal hole of nearly $8.8 trillion as foreign countries have been \nbuying our debt and in essence becoming our bankers. According to the \nmost recent Treasury statistics, foreign nations now hold more than \n$2.2 trillion, or 44 percent, of all publicly held U.S. debt. Japan and \nChina alone hold nearly $1 trillion. To put it plainly: 16 percent of \nour entire economy is being loaned to us by the Central Banks of other \nnations. I know other Members of this Chamber, such as Senator Conrad, \nthe chairman of our Budget Committee, share my concern over the \nimplications of this massive foreign debt.\n  While the foundations of our fiscal house are eroded by our fiscal \npolicies, our failure to pursue smart economic policies has added \nstrain on our economy. Every single year since President Bush took \noffice we have had a record trade deficit. Last year the deficit was \n$764 billion. One of the ramifications of that trade deficit to foreign \ninterests is the control by foreign interests of more and more of our \nassets.\n  How can we negotiate fair, pro-American trade agreements and ensure \nforeign countries uphold these agreements when we sit across the \nnegotiating table not only from our competitor but from our banker as \nwell? While ceding our economic sovereignty, we also sow the seeds of \neconomic vulnerability. Precipitous decisions by any country holding \nour debt could create much graver economic problems than what we saw \nyesterday.\n  I believe in smart, pro-American trade, and globalization does hold \nincredible promise to continue to improve our standard of living and to \ncreate economic growth. But for too long, the choices have been painted \nfar too starkly and with a broad political brush. In fact, we can \nprotect our economic interests while promoting trade. We can secure our \neconomic sovereignty while promoting policies that secure our global \neconomic position. Trade does not have to be a zero sum game.\n  The choice is not between fatalism and protectionism. The choice is \nbetween policies that work and policies that are not working. We have \nto curb these deficits and ensure foreign governments do not own too \nmuch of our Government debt. We need a firewall that keeps our economic \nfuture more in our own hands.\n  In years past I have worked with other Members of Congress who share \nmy concerns. For example, during the last session of Congress I \nsupported legislation by Senator Dorgan and then-Congressman Cardin \nthat rings an alarm bell when U.S. foreign-owned debt reaches 25 \npercent of GDP or the trade deficit reaches 5 percent of GDP. It would \nrequire the administration to\n\n[[Page S2345]]\n\ndevelop a plan of action to address these conditions and report their \nfindings to Congress. At the very least this proposal would compel our \nGovernment to deal with these economic issues while they are problems \nbut before they become crises. I believe proposals such as these need \nto be considered in order to put our economic house in order, as we can \ntoo easily be held hostage to the economic policies that are being made \nnot in Washington and not in the markets of New York but in Beijing, \nShanghai, Tokyo, and elsewhere.\n  Yesterday it was the selloff of foreign stocks that had \nreverberations in U.S. markets. But if China or Japan made a decision \nto decrease their massive holdings of U.S. dollars, there could be a \ncurrency crisis and the United States would have to raise interest \nrates and invite conditions for a recession. Precipitous decisions by \nany country holding our debt could create far graver economic \nconsequences than what we witnessed yesterday.\n  While it is clear we should take reasonable steps now to ensure that \nthe economic problems of today do not become the crises of tomorrow, we \nare awaiting some action by the administration that gives us a clear \nsignal that we can begin to restore responsibility. This is a long-term \nproblem, but it is one that I think we must respond to. We ignore it at \nour peril. As we saw yesterday, the United States is interconnected \nwith globalized markets. They are not going to leave anyone out. We \nwill all be impacted by decisions that we have nothing to do with \nmaking, even if they are rumors or quickly reversed.\n  It is my hope what happened yesterday, which gave us headlines across \nthe world, will open our eyes to what we need to do to take action to \nput ourselves in a much more competitive position and to begin to move \naway from the loss of economic sovereignty we have seen over the last \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Inouye amendment to S. 4 is pending.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bunning are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:20 \ntoday, the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Inouye amendment \nNo. 285, to be followed by a vote in relation to the DeMint amendment \nNo. 279, as modified; with the time until then for debate to run \nconcurrently on both amendments, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Inouye and DeMint or their designees; that \nno amendments be in order to either amendment prior to the vote and \nthat there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I concur with the statement just issued, \nand I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 285\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the second-degree \namendment that has been offered by my colleague from Hawaii, Senator \nInouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired under the previous \nagreement.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent----\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, to clarify the unanimous consent request, \nI believe there were 2 minutes between the votes, am I correct, for \ndebate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from South \nCarolina may proceed.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator through the \nChair, how much time does the Senator from South Carolina need?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Three or 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator be given 4 minutes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the Senator fitting me \nin. Again, I am speaking on the second degree to my amendment that is \nrelated to port security.\n  As we talked about here several times on the floor, and actually \npassed last year, it is important that the people who are working at \nour ports are people we can trust to use the equipment and technology \nthey are given to keep the people of America safe.\n  The amendment I have offered is consistent with--in fact, it is \nidentical to--the regulations that the Secretary and the homeland \ndefense agency have put together so that we will not have convicted \nfelons working in our ports around this country, so that we know the \npeople who are operating our most secure areas are people who have not \nproven to be susceptible to crimes.\n  Senator Inouye is offering a second degree to my amendment that would \nallow the Secretary to change some of these crimes or felony \nconvictions or to modify the rules. The Secretary of Homeland Security \nhas not asked for this. In fact, he is supporting the amendment we \nhave. I cannot imagine any future Secretary or future administration \nwanting to eliminate some of these felonies. The whole point of having \nthis amendment and putting it into law is so that our agencies are not \nsubject to lawsuits and constant harassment to change the criteria for \nworking in the secure areas of our ports.\n  So I appeal to my fellow colleagues, a vote for this second-degree \namendment is a vote to gut my amendment. It is a vote to allow in the \nfuture any administration or this administration to eliminate certain \nfelonies that would keep convicted criminals from working in our ports. \nI encourage my colleagues not to vote for this second degree. Vote for \nmy amendment, which everybody in this body has voted for unanimously in \nthe past.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Connecticut and Senator Collins for \nthe opportunity to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the amendment I introduced is not a \nsecond-degree amendment. However, it incorporates Senator DeMint's \namendment.\n  It doesn't in any way minimize the matter of security. It just says \nthe Secretary shall have flexibility with changing times. As we all \nconcur, times do change.\n  Thirdly, in the other areas where security threats are common, such \nas airports, the Department of Transportation has not asked for \nanything like this, with no flexibility.\n  Fourth, if rules are to be made to differ from the present rules as \nset forth in the DeMint amendment and the Inouye amendment, it will \nhave to go through the rulemaking process. I can assure my colleagues \nthat we will not let felons be in charge of our security.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, may I have an additional 60 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Senator from Hawaii. I need to make an \nimportant point. The whole point of my amendment is to put a regulation \nin law so it cannot be changed and contested. The amendment offered by \nSenator Inouye basically guts the amendment and eliminates the reason \nfor the amendment. It moves from being a law to something that is \nsubject to the whims of any future administration or Secretary.\n  Our job here is certainly to be fair to workers, but our first \npriority is to protect the American people. Please, let's not allow \nconvicted felons to work in our ports.

Madam President, because of these two votes coming together \nas they did, there was some confusion. That is why this vote took \nlonger. Everyone should understand, we will not make a habit of this. \nWe have been very strict in enforcing the 20-minute rule, and we will \ncontinue to do so.\n  For the benefit of all Senators, we had a productive day today but, \nin my opinion, not as productive as it should have been. For Senators \nwho have amendments, tomorrow is Thursday. We are not having votes \nuntil 5:30 on Monday night. We are going to have some amendments \noffered or I am going to get the idea there are not any amendments to \noffer, and we will have to either move to third reading or move to \ncloture or something. If Members have amendments, we said this would be \nan open process. This is a very important piece of legislation. I hope \nthey are not waiting until the last minute because the last minute may \narrive more quickly than they think. It is important legislation. In \nour cloakroom, we sent out a hotline today to find out what amendments \nmy caucus has. I hope the Republicans will follow up on that so we may \nhave a list of amendments so we know whom to call.\n  We have had a lot of dead time today.

I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide financial aid to local law enforcement officials \n          along the Nation's borders, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n              TITLE__.--BORDER LAW ENFORCEMENT RELIEF ACT\n\n     SEC. __01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Relief Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n\n[[Page S2347]]\n\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region\n\n     SEC. __03. BORDER RELIEF GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Grants Authorized.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary is authorized to award \n     grants, subject to the availability of appropriations, to an \n     eligible law enforcement agency to provide assistance to such \n     agency to address--\n       (A) criminal activity that occurs in the jurisdiction of \n     such agency by virtue of such agency's proximity to the \n     United States border; and\n       (B) the impact of any lack of security along the United \n     States border.\n       (2) Duration.--Grants may be awarded under this subsection \n     during fiscal years 2007 through 2011.\n       (3) Competitive basis.--The Secretary shall award grants \n     under this subsection on a competitive basis, except that the \n     Secretary shall give priority to applications from any \n     eligible law enforcement agency serving a community--\n       (A) with a population of less than 50,000; and\n       (B) located no more than 100 miles from a United States \n     border with--\n       (i) Canada; or\n       (ii) Mexico.\n       (b) Use of Funds.--Grants awarded pursuant to subsection \n     (a) may only be used to provide additional resources for an \n     eligible law enforcement agency to address criminal activity \n     occurring along any such border, including--\n       (1) to obtain equipment;\n       (2) to hire additional personnel;\n       (3) to upgrade and maintain law enforcement technology;\n       (4) to cover operational costs, including overtime and \n     transportation costs; and\n       (5) such other resources as are available to assist that \n     agency.\n       (c) Application.--\n       (1) In general.--Each eligible law enforcement agency \n     seeking a grant under this section shall submit an \n     application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, \n     and accompanied by such information as the Secretary may \n     reasonably require.\n       (2) Contents.--Each application submitted pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) describe the activities for which assistance under this \n     section is sought; and\n       (B) provide such additional assurances as the Secretary \n     determines to be essential to ensure compliance with the \n     requirements of this section.\n       (d) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:\n       (1) Eligible law enforcement agency.--The term ``eligible \n     law enforcement agency'' means a tribal, State, or local law \n     enforcement agency--\n       (A) located in a county no more than 100 miles from a \n     United States border with--\n       (i) Canada; or\n       (ii) Mexico; or\n       (B) located in a county more than 100 miles from any such \n     border, but where such county has been certified by the \n     Secretary as a High Impact Area.\n       (2) High impact area.--The term ``High Impact Area'' means \n     any county designated by the Secretary as such, taking into \n     consideration--\n       (A) whether local law enforcement agencies in that county \n     have the resources to protect the lives, property, safety, or \n     welfare of the residents of that county;\n       (B) the relationship between any lack of security along the \n     United States border and the rise, if any, of criminal \n     activity in that county; and\n       (C) any other unique challenges that local law enforcement \n     face due to a lack of security along the United States \n     border.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Department of Homeland Security.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2007 through 2011 to \n     carry out the provisions of this section.\n       (2) Division of authorized funds.--Of the amounts \n     authorized under paragraph (1)--\n       (A) \\2/3\\ shall be set aside for eligible law enforcement \n     agencies located in the 6 States with the largest number of \n     undocumented alien apprehensions; and\n       (B) \\1/3\\ shall be set aside for areas designated as a High \n     Impact Area under subsection (d).\n       (f) Supplement Not Supplant.--Amounts appropriated for \n     grants under this section shall be used to supplement and not \n     supplant other State and local public funds obligated for the \n     purposes provided under this title.\n\n     SEC. __04. ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAW.\n\n       Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize State \n     or local law enforcement agencies or their officers to \n     exercise Federal immigration law enforcement authority.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this is an amendment I am offering on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Domenici, my colleague. It is to provide \nfunds to local law enforcement agencies along our very substantial \nborders with Canada and Mexico to assist them with criminal activity, \nproblems of enforcement of the laws, and dealing with criminal activity \nin those border communities. This is an amendment that sets up a $50 \nmillion-a-year grant program. It is an amendment we have passed twice \nin the Senate, but it has not become law as yet.\n  It calls upon the Department of Homeland Security to establish a \ncompetitive grant program to assist local law enforcement located along \nthe border or other local law enforcement agencies that are determined \nby the Homeland Security Department to be heavily impacted, high-impact \nareas elsewhere in the country.\n  The border with Canada is 5,525 miles long. Our border with Mexico is \nnearly 2,000 miles long. We have had serious problems on the New \nMexico-Mexico border, as has the State of Arizona. In fact, last year \nthe States of Arizona and New Mexico declared states of emergency in \norder to provide local law enforcement with immediate assistance in \ndealing with criminal activity along the border. The Federal Government \nneeds to step up and do its part in helping these local law enforcement \nagencies. This amendment helps to do that.\n  I hope when the time comes for a vote on the amendment, my colleagues \nwill agree to support it, and we can pass it with a unanimous vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, the Improving America's Security Act \nis not only about unfinished business, it is not only about doing what \nothers have failed to do, it is about living up to the responsibilities \nwe have as a Congress and a government to protect our Nation and its \npeople and to do everything possible to prevent what was once \nunthinkable from happening again.\n  As a Senator from New Jersey, I take that responsibility as a solemn \npromise to the 700 New Jerseyans who lost their lives on September 11 \nand their families who survived them.\n  More than 5 years ago, it became painfully clear that we, as a Nation \nthat believed it was the most secure in the world, were unprotected. In \nthe glimpse of a few minutes and over the course of a few short \nhorrific hours, our Nation and the security we thought we had was \nchanged forever. We entered into the stark reality of a post-September \n11 world.\n  On that day, glaring gaps in our security were exploited, lax systems \nwere taken advantage of, and a trusting nation paid the price. \nThousands of innocent lives, everyday Americans whom this Nation has \ngrieved every day\n\n[[Page S2348]]\n\nsince, were lost. We can never go back to rectify past mistakes that \ncould have prevented that day, but we can work to better secure our \nNation moving forward.\n\n  We have a roadmap of how to get there. The 9/11 Commission laid out a \nplan, provided guidance, and delivered 41 specific and wide-ranging \nrecommendations. Yet more than 2 years after the Commission issued \nthose recommendations, many of them remain just that--recommendations \nthat have not been acted on or fully implemented.\n  This legislation already comes before this body far later than it \nshould. But the fact that it is on the floor of this Chamber just 2 \nshort months into a new Congress speaks boldly of our new leadership \nand how important finishing the 9/11 Commission's work is to our \nleadership. I commend both Majority Leader Reid and Chairman Lieberman \nfor making this a top priority for this Congress, as well as Chairman \nInouye and Chairman Dodd for their roles in crafting this legislation.\n  Many of us have been pushing for a long time to see all 41 \nrecommendations fully implemented and to make significant improvements \nto our Nation's security that have been under the radar screen for far \ntoo long.\n  As a former Member of the House of Representatives, I fought to see \nthat all 41 recommendations were fully implemented in the 2004 \nintelligence reform legislation. I was proud to serve as the lead \nDemocratic negotiator in the House on the conference committee that \ncreated the final intelligence bill. While that legislation made \nessential and urgently needed reforms to our Nation's intelligence, \nunfortunately, it fell far short on implementing all of the \nrecommendations.\n  I have also since introduced legislation that ensures that all of \nthese recommendations will be fully implemented and to hold the \nexecutive branch accountable for implementing each recommendation. It \nis my hope that with the bill we are working on now before the Senate, \nand with the vigorous oversight under the leadership of Chairman \nLieberman and Ranking Member Collins, we will be able to see all these \nrecommendations enacted and implemented.\n  It was just over a year ago the 9/11 Public Discourse Project, led by \nformer members of the 9/11 Commission, published its disturbing report \ncard, giving far more Fs than As on the implementation of those 41 \nrecommendations.\n  There is no excuse left for Congress, the White House, or our Federal \nagencies for not finishing what is so direly needed: improving the \nsecurity of our Nation. Yes, we have made some great steps forward. \nYes, we have made some significant improvements that have likely saved \nlives and stopped terrorists in their tracks. But no one--no one--\nshould use the lack of another catastrophic attack on our soil as proof \nthat we have succeeded in fully meeting our goals.\n  The fact is, so long as we do not heed the advice of the 9/11 \nCommissioners who spent months examining how we could improve our \nNation's security, so long as we do not make dramatic improvements to \nour security--at our Nation's ports, on our trains and buses, around \nour chemical plants, and in how we allocate homeland security funding--\nwe continue to leave our Nation at risk.\n  I cannot imagine talking about the security of our Nation without the \n41 recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. The Commission's findings \nand recommendations are integral to understanding our deepest flaws, \nthe complexity of our intelligence and security networks, the obstacles \nthat lie ahead and, most of all, what needs to be done.\n  Yet if some in our Government had had their way, there would have \nbeen no Commission, there would have been no digging into the secrecy \nand ineffectiveness of our Nation's security, no poring over thousands \nupon thousands of documents, no reviewing of every action Federal \nagencies took or did not take to prevent and respond to the attacks of \nSeptember 11, no asking of some of the toughest questions our Nation \nhas had to bear.\n  So once we pass this final legislation, have it signed into law and \nimplemented, we will come to the day--I hope sooner rather than later--\nwhen our Nation's security funding is based more on risk, when our \nports are fully secure because of 100 percent scanning, when we are \nmaking the necessary investments in mass transit security, and when our \nfirst responders have a strong emergency communications system that \nworks in interoperable ways, so that those who are sworn to protect us \ncan speak to each other effectively.\n  These are only a few of the dimensions in this fight. Unfortunately, \nthis is a fight that would not have taken place without the commitment \nand strength of the families of the victims of September 11.\n  When the loved ones of those who were lost on September 11 have to \nbecome full-time advocates, spending every possible hour lobbying \nCongress, when they have to be the constant reminder for our Government \nto do its job, we know we have failed them. Many of them are here and \nhave been here today watching this body, waiting to finally see this \nlegislation become law, hoping that all their suffering, their work, \nand their tireless advocacy will not be in vain.\n  Let us not only fulfill their wishes but the wishes of all Americans \nto have a nation as secure as possible for their families and \nneighbors. Let's work to pass this legislation and make sure it is \nfully enacted. Let's finally accomplish what should have been finished \nseveral years ago.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, on February 16, the Commonwealth of \nKentucky lost a favorite son. Marian ``Gene'' Snyder was born on \nJanuary 26, 1928 in Louisville, KY, to a working-class family. He would \noften say he was ``a poor boy from the other side of the tracks in a \ncold-water flat.'' His upbringing during the Great Depression and the \nwork ethic taught to him by his mother and father would serve Gene well \nin future years.\n  Gene worked his way through college and law school and earned a law \ndegree from the University of Louisville at the ripe young age of 26. \nHe was appointed to his first political post as Jeffersontown city \nattorney.\n  In 1962, Louisville Republican leaders saw they had a great young \ncandidate and backed him for his first race for Congress. Gene won that \nrace and represented the people of Kentucky's third congressional \ndistrict for the next 2 years. Gene unfortunately lost reelection in \n1964, but as he did all of his life, he bounced back and in 1966 he won \nthe fourth congressional seat. He would serve and hold that seat with \ndistinction for the next 20 years.\n  Gene was instrumental in bringing a number of important \ninfrastructure projects back to Kentucky while serving on the Public \nWorks Committee. One of his greatest achievements is a freeway that \nbears his name in Louisville, KY.\n  Gene Snyder worked hard to make sure Kentucky got its fair share from \nthe Federal Government. But I think the most important thing he did was \nto validate conservatism in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Back in the \nearly 1960s, you couldn't count on one hand the number of Republicans \nin Kentucky. Gene Snyder was the first brick in the foundation of what \nthe Republican Party is today in Kentucky.\n  Gene had something lacking in today's world of weekly polls and \npolitical consultants. Gene had conservative principles and never \nwavered from those principles. Gene Snyder actually stood for \nsomething. That is why I consider Gene Snyder one of my political \nmentors. I would not be standing here in the well of this great Senate \nif it were not for Gene Snyder.\n\n[[Page S2349]]\n\n  My wife Mary and I extend our thoughts and prayers to Pat, Gene's \nbeloved wife, and the entire Snyder family. Gene was a true patriot and \na great American who loved the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the \ncitizens he represented.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/28/senate-section/article/S2349-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF INTELLECTUAL & DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

In all cases, notification to \n     all Members of the intent to hold hearings must be given at \n     least 7 days in advance to the date of the hearing.

This authority may be delegated by the \n     Chairman to any other Member of the Subcommittee when \n     necessary.\n       (4) If at least three Members of the Subcommittee desire \n     the Chairman to call a special meeting, they may file in the \n     office of the Subcommittee, a written request therefor, \n     addressed to the Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk \n     of the Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman of such \n     request. If, within 3 calendar days after the filing of \n     such request, the Chairman fails to call the requested \n     special meeting, which is to be held within 7 calendar \n     days after the filing of such request, a majority of the \n     Subcommittee Members may file in the office of the \n     Subcommittee their written notice that a special \n     Subcommittee meeting will be held, specifying the date and \n     hour thereof, and the Subcommittee shall meet on that date \n     and hour. Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the \n     Subcommittee clerk shall notify all Subcommittee Members \n     that such special meeting will be held and inform them of \n     its date and hour. If the Chairman is not present at any \n     regular, additional or special meeting, the Ranking \n     Majority Member present shall preside.\n       (5) For public or executive sessions, one Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the administering \n     of oaths and the taking of testimony in any given case or \n     subject matter.\n       One-third of the Members of the Subcommittee shall \n     constitute a quorum for the transaction of Subcommittee \n     business other than the administering of oaths and the taking \n     of testimony, provided that one member of the minority is \n     present.\n       (6) All witnesses at public or executive hearings who \n     testify to matters of fact shall be sworn.\n       (7) If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, his \n     or her counsel, or any spectator conducts himself or herself \n     in such a manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of such hearing, \n     the Chairman or presiding Member of the Subcommittee present \n     during such hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the \n     Senate, his or her representative or any law enforcement \n     official to eject said person from the hearing room.\n       (8) Counsel retained by any witness and accompanying such \n     witness shall be permitted to be present during the testimony \n     of such witness at any public or executive hearing, and to \n     advise such witness while he or she is testifying, of his or \n     her legal rights; provided, however, that in the case of any \n     witness who is an officer or employee of the government, or \n     of a corporation or association, the Subcommittee Chairman \n     may rule that representation by counsel from the government, \n     corporation, or association, or by counsel representing other \n     witnesses, creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness may only be represented during interrogation by staff \n     or during testimony before the Subcommittee by personal \n     counsel not from the government, corporation, or association, \n     or by personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     rule shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event his or her counsel is ejected for \n     conducting himself or herself in such a manner so as to \n     prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with the \n     orderly administration of the hearings; nor shall this rule \n     be construed as authorizing counsel to coach the witness or \n     answer for the witness. The failure of any witness to secure \n     counsel shall not excuse such witness from complying with a \n     subpoena or deposition notice.\n       (9) Depositions.--\n       (9.1) Notice.--Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Subcommittee shall be \n     authorized and issued by the Chairman. The Chairman of the \n     full Committee and the Ranking Minority Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall be kept fully apprised of the \n     authorization for the taking of depositions. Such notices \n     shall specify a time and place of examination, and the name \n     of the Subcommittee Member or Members or staff officer or \n     officers who will take the deposition. The deposition shall \n     be in private. The Subcommittee shall not initiate procedures \n     leading to criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a \n     witness's failure to appear unless the deposition notice was \n     accompanied by a Subcommittee subpoena.\n       (9.2) Counsel.--Witnesses may be accompanied at a \n     deposition by counsel to advise them of their legal rights, \n     subject to the provisions of Rule 8.\n       (9.3) Procedure.--Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Subcommittee Members or staff. Objections by the witness as \n     to the form of questions shall be noted for the record. If a \n     witness objects to a question and refuses to testify on the \n     basis of relevance or privilege, the Subcommittee Members or \n     staff may proceed with the deposition, or may, at that time \n     or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling by telephone or \n     otherwise on the objection from the Chairman or such \n     Subcommittee Member as designated by him or her. If the \n     Chairman or designated Member overrules the objection, he or \n     she may refer the matter to the Subcommittee or he or she may \n     order and direct the witness to answer the question, but the \n     Subcommittee shall not initiate procedures leading to civil \n     or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify \n     after he or she has been ordered and directed to answer by a \n     Member of the Subcommittee.\n       (9.4) Filing.--The Subcommittee staff shall see that the \n     testimony is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12. The individual \n     administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that \n     the witness was duly sworn in his or her presence, the \n     transcriber shall certify that the transcript is a true \n     record of the testimony, and the transcript shall then be \n     filed with the Subcommittee clerk.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On February 21, 2007, in Boulder, CO, a Naropa University lesbian \nstudent was attacked by two men. These two men made sexual advances \ntowards the student. When she informed them that she was a lesbian, \nthey attacked her. She was kicked and punched several times and had to \nbe treated for serious body injuries at a nearby hospital. The police \nare investigating this as a possible hate crime.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance.

Mr. President, yesterday, February 27 marked the 200th \nanniversary of the birth of one of America's greatest and best loved \npoets, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. His magnificent poems portray the \nunique character of the Nation and its history and are an essential \npart of our cultural legacy.\n  He is especially beloved in Massachusetts. He was a member of the \nHarvard faculty for many years, and the beautiful Longfellow House and \nthe Longfellow National Historic site are among the most popular sites \nin our State for residents and tourists alike.\n  He was famed throughout the world for his extraordinary narrative \npoems, and in his later years he was known as ``the grand old man of \nAmerican letters.'' One of his classic poems in the genre was ``The \nBuilding of the Ship,'' which drew on his love of the sea and knowledge \nof ship building from his early years in Portland, ME. Two lines near \nthe end are some of his most famous ``Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of \nState! Sail on, O Union, strong and great!'' which President Abraham \nLincoln found immensely inspiring.\n  Another of his most famous narrative poems is ``Paul Revere's Ride,'' \nwhich has always been a special favorite of mine. It tells the \nremarkable story of that early American patriot and his dramatic ride \nfrom Boston to Lexington and Concord at the beginning of the \nRevolutionary War. It is one of the most well-known poems in America, \nwhich students have memorized for generations.\n  On this bicentennial anniversary of his birth, I would like to share \nthat poem with my colleagues. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                           Paul Revere's Ride\n\n     Listen my children and you shall hear\n     Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,\n     On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;\n     Hardly a man is now alive\n     Who remembers that famous day and year.\n\n     He said to his friend, ``If the British march\n     By land or sea from the town to-night,\n     Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch\n     Of the North Church tower as a signal light,--\n     One if by land, and two if by sea;\n     And I on the opposite shore will be,\n     Ready to ride and spread the alarm\n     Through every Middlesex village and farm,\n     For the country folk to be up and to arm.''\n\n     Then he said ``Good-night!'' and with muffled oar\n     Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,\n     Just as the moon rose over the bay,\n     Where swinging wide at her moorings lay\n     The Somerset, British man-of-war;\n     A phantom ship, with each mast and spar\n     Across the moon like a prison bar,\n     And a huge black hulk, that was magnified\n     By its own reflection in the tide.\n\n     Meanwhile, his friend through alley and street\n     Wanders and watches, with eager ears,\n     Till in the silence around him he hears\n     The muster of men at the barrack door,\n     The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,\n     And the measured tread of the grenadiers,\n     Marching down to their boats on the shore.\n\n     Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church,\n     By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,\n\n[[Page S2352]]\n\n     To the belfry chamber overhead,\n     And startled the pigeons from their perch\n     On the sombre rafters, that round him made\n     Masses and moving shapes of shade,--\n     By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,\n     To the highest window in the wall,\n     Where he paused to listen and look down\n     A moment on the roofs of the town\n     And the moonlight flowing over all.\n\n     Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,\n     In their night encampment on the hill,\n     Wrapped in silence so deep and still\n     That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,\n     The watchful night-wind, as it went\n     Creeping along from tent to tent,\n     And seeming to whisper, ``All is well!''\n     A moment only he feels the spell\n     Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread\n     Of the lonely belfry and the dead;\n     For suddenly all his thoughts are bent\n     On a shadowy something far away,\n     Where the river widens to meet the bay,--\n     A line of black that bends and floats\n     On the rising tide like a bridge of boats.\n\n     Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,\n     Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride\n     On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.\n     Now he patted his horse's side,\n     Now he gazed at the landscape far and near,\n     Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,\n     And turned and tightened his saddle girth;\n     But mostly he watched with eager search\n     The belfry tower of the Old North Church,\n     As it rose above the graves on the hill,\n     Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.\n     And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height\n     A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!\n     He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,\n     But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight\n     A second lamp in the belfry burns.\n\n     A hurry of hoofs in a village street,\n     A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,\n     And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark\n     Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;\n     That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,\n     The fate of a nation was riding that night;\n     And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,\n     Kindled the land into flame with its heat.\n     He has left the village and mounted the steep,\n     And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,\n     Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;\n     And under the alders that skirt its edge,\n     Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,\n     Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.\n\n     It was twelve by the village clock\n     When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.\n     He heard the crowing of the cock,\n     And the barking of the farmer's dog,\n     And felt the damp of the river fog,\n     That rises after the sun goes down.\n\n     It was one by the village clock,\n     When he galloped into Lexington.\n     He saw the gilded weathercock\n     Swim in the moonlight as he passed,\n     And the meeting-house windows, black and bare,\n     Gaze at him with a spectral glare,\n     As if they already stood aghast\n     At the bloody work they would look upon.\n\n     It was two by the village clock,\n     When he came to the bridge in Concord town.\n     He heard the bleating of the flock,\n     And the twitter of birds among the trees,\n     And felt the breath of the morning breeze\n     Blowing over the meadow brown.\n     And one was safe and asleep in his bed\n     Who at the bridge would be first to fall,\n     Who that day would be lying dead,\n     Pierced by a British musket ball.\n\n     You know the rest. In the books you have read\n     How the British Regulars fired and fled,----\n     How the farmers gave them ball for ball,\n     From behind each fence and farmyard wall,\n     Chasing the redcoats down the lane,\n     Then crossing the fields to emerge again\n     Under the trees at the turn of the road,\n     And only pausing to fire and load.\n\n     So through the night rode Paul Revere;\n     And so through the night went his cry of alarm\n     To every Middlesex village and farm,----\n     A cry of defiance, and not of fear,\n     A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,\n     And a word that shall echo for evermore!\n     For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,\n     Through all our history, to the last,\n     In the hour of darkness and peril and need,\n     The people will waken and listen to hear\n     The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,\n     And the midnight message of Paul Revere.\n\n     --Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/28/senate-section/article/S2352-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    WE THE PEOPLE NATIONAL FINALISTS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the \nPeople Program is funded by the U.S. Department of Education by act of \nCongress.\n  I am proud to announce that the State of Arkansas will be represented \nby a class from Pottsville High School at this prestigious national \nevent. These outstanding students, through their knowledge of the U.S. \nConstitution, won their statewide competition and earned the chance to \ncome to our Nation's Capital and compete at the national level.\n  While in Washington, the students will participate in a 3-day \nacademic competition that simulates a congressional hearing in which \nthey ``testify'' before a panel of judges. Students demonstrate their \nknowledge and understanding of constitutional principles as they \nevaluate, take, and defend positions on relevant historical and \ncontemporary issues. It is important to note that results of \nindependent studies of this nationally acclaimed program reveal that We \nthe People students have knowledge gains that are superior to students \nwho have not participated in the program. Students also display a \ngreater political tolerance and commitment to the principles and values \nof the Constitution and Bill of Rights than do students using \ntraditional textbooks and approaches. With many reports and surveys \nindicating a lack of civic knowledge and civic participation, I am \npleased to support such a superb program that is producing an \nenlightened and engaged citizenry.\n  The names of these outstanding students from Pottsville High School \nare Jimmy Freeman, Amber Fuentes, Dustin Harrell, Zach Murdoch, Brent \nPless, James Schell, Hannah Walker, Hannah Williamson, and Tyler \nWinchell.\n  I also wish to commend the teacher of the class, James Wagner, who is \nresponsible for preparing these young constitutional experts for the \nnational finals.

Mr. President, on behalf of the 29 members of the \nNortheast-Midwest Senate Coalition, I commend Richard Munson for his \ndistinguished service as the director of the Northeast-Midwest \nInstitute. For more than two decades through four Presidential \nadministrations, 10 Congresses, and dramatic changes in our Nation's \npolitical landscape--Mr. Munson's leadership has kept the institute at \nthe forefront of policy innovations to benefit our region.\n  Formed in the mid-1970s, the institute works with the bipartisan \nNortheast-Midwest Senate and Congressional Coalitions to develop and \nimplement policies that promote the economic vitality and environmental \nquality of the region's 18 States. As the institute's lead strategist, \nMr. Munson has collaborated with the coalitions' leaders and task \nforces to identify the region's pressing concerns, deliver high quality \nresearch about policies to address them, and provide information that \nmade a compelling case for legislation.\n  Mr. Munson brought to the institute an unparalleled grasp of the \ninternal workings of Congress. In 1993, he authored the Cardinals of \nCapitol Hill, a story about the men and women who control government \nspending which former House Budget Committee Chairman James Jones said \n``should be required reading for those who want to understand our \ngovernment.'' Mr. Munson also provided expertise in energy efficiency \nand utility regulation, demonstrated in his book, ``The Power Makers,'' \nand more recently, ``From Edison to Enron: The Business of Power and \nWhat It Means for the Future of Electricity.''\n  To complement his own skills and knowledge, Mr. Munson enlisted a \nstaff of seasoned policy entrepreneurs, affording them the flexibility \nand latitude to launch groundbreaking initiatives from Great Lakes \nrestoration to brownfields revitalization to community-based \nagriculture. Much of the institute's success has been rooted in Mr.\n\n[[Page S2353]]\n\nMunson's conviction that economic progress and environmental \nenhancement are inextricably linked.\n  His extensive legacy includes the institute's work to help craft the \nNation's first pollution prevention law instituting the paradigm shift \nto acknowledge that waste generation not only pollutes the environment \nbut also exacts economic costs. In 1991 the Institute held the first \nnational conference on salvaging the Nation's abandoned and underused \nbrownfield sites. The conference spurred a decade of research and \neducation that paved the way for passage of the Brownfield \nRevitalization and Environmental Restoration Act in 2002.\n  Under Mr. Munson's leadership, the institute also concentrated \nrelentlessly on Great Lakes restoration, leading to passage of the \nGreat Lakes Legacy Act. He was instrumental in launching the Great \nLakes Cities Initiative, enabling the region's mayors to share best \npractices and obtain a seat at the policymaking table. And in direct \nresponse to the critical threat of invasive species to the Great Lakes, \nthe Institute created the Great Ships Initiative to engage ports, \nshipping companies, and shippers in combating the problem.\n  With the 2002 farm bill, the institute began collaborating with \nstates and policy partners to promote entrepreneurial agriculture, \nprivate lands conservation, and community-based approaches to reducing \nhunger and improving public health. The institute continues advancing \nthese principles by facilitating the Farm and Food Policy Project, a \ncollaborative effort working toward a more sustainable food and \nagricultural system for the United States.\n  In addition to advancing policy initiatives, Mr. Munson has helped \nthe coalitions resist pressure from other regions to cut funding for \nprograms that are most important to the Northeast and Midwest--and \noversaw the institute's hallmark reports that reveal the flow of \nFederal funds to States. His leadership in the perennial fight for the \nLow--Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, helped the \ncoalitions sustain funding for the program and add an extra $1 billion \nfor LIHEAP in 2006. Working with the coalitions and Senate and House \nmanufacturing task forces, the institute helped rescue the \nManufacturing Extension Partnership from elimination preserving a \nprogram that boosts manufacturing capacity throughout our region.\n  Mr. Munson came to the institute from the Center for Renewable \nResources and Solar Lobby, where he served as executive director from \n1979 to 1983. With his departure from the institute, I wish him luck on \nhis new endeavor as a cofounder of a new company--Recycled Energy \nDevelopment--that seeks to bring to fruition many of the ideas that \nhave been his passion for 30 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/28/senate-section/article/S2353-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   2007 WE THE PEOPLE NATIONAL FINALS\n\n Mr. SMITH.

A bill to prevent the fraudulent use of social security \naccount numbers by allowing the sharing of social security data among \nagencies of the United States for identity theft prevention and \nimmigration enforcement purposes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I will be introducing a piece of \nlegislation today which is a bill to cut at the heart of a rampant \nproblem in this country; that is, identity theft.\n  Last month, a bipartisan group of Senators and I met with Secretary \nChertoff on this very issue. Secretary Chertoff explained that under \ncurrent law, Government agencies are prevented from sharing information \nwith one another that, if shared, could expose cases of identity theft. \nMy bill tears down the wall that prevents the sharing of existing \ninformation among Government agencies. It permits the Commissioner of \nSocial Security to secure information with the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity where such information is likely to assist in discovering \nidentity theft, Social Security number misuse, or violations of \nimmigration law.\n  Specifically, it requires the Commissioner to inform the Secretary of \nHomeland Security upon discovery of a Social Security account number \nbeing used with multiple names or where an individual has more than one \nperson reporting earnings for him or her during a single tax year. It \nseems logical that we would already be doing this, but we are not. In \nthe meantime, identity theft is plaguing innocent victims all across \nthe country. We were reminded of the pervasiveness of this problem by \nthe recent ICE raids of six Swift and Company meat-packing plants \nacross the country last December. In total, agents apprehended 1,282 \nillegal alien workers on administrative immigration violations. Of \nthese, 65 have also been charged with criminal violations related to \nidentity theft or other violations.\n  Unfortunately, for the victims of identity theft, by the time the \nidentity theft is discovered, the damage has already been done. Ranked \nfifth in the Nation for identity theft, citizens of Colorado are no \nstrangers to identity theft. For instance, an 84-year-old Grand \nJunction woman was deemed ineligible for Federal housing assistance \nbecause her Social Security number was being used at a variety of jobs \nin Denver, making her income too high to qualify. A 10-year-old child \nin Douglas County had his identity stolen, and his Social Security \nnumber was being used at 17 different jobs. Others get stuck with big \ntax bills for wages they never earned.\n  Clearly, identity theft is an issue that affects people of all ages \nand walks of life. Yet when the Social Security Administration has \nreason to believe that a Social Security number is being used \nfraudulently, they are prevented from sharing it with the Department of \nHomeland Security. Withholding this information effectively enables \nthieves to continue to perpetrate the crime of identity theft against \ninnocent victims. By simply sharing this information, cases of identity \ntheft could be discovered much sooner. Victims of identity theft \ndeserve to have this existing information acted on, and my bill allows \nfor this to happen. I urge colleagues to support this commonsense \nlegislation.\n  Later on, when we are on S. 4, called Improving America's Security \nAct, which deals with implementation of more of the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations, I plan on offering an amendment that has similar \nlanguage to this bill. This is an issue which is extremely important to \nvictims. It is something we should address. I will give the Senate \nplenty of opportunity to deal with this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Baucus, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Allard, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Smith, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Nelson of Nebraska, Ms. Collins, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. \n        Brownback):\n  S. 700. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax \ncredit to individuals who enter into agreements to protect the habitats \nof endangered and threatened species, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, 16 \nbipartisan\n\n[[Page S2358]]\n\ncosponsors, to introduce the S. 700. Approximately 1 year ago, Senator \nLincoln and I introduced the Collaboration for the Recovery of the \nEndangered Species Act, or CRESA, an earlier bill to amend the \nEndangered Species Act or ESA. S. 700 is an updated version of the \nEndangered Species Recovery Act or ESRA, which we introduced on \nDecember 6, 2006. Like ESRA, S. 700 does not amend the current ESA, but \nbuilds on ideas set forth in the original CRESA. It creates policies \nthat finance the recovery of endangered species by private landowners. \nS. 700 makes it simpler for landowners to get involved in conservation \nand reduces the conflict that often emanates from the ESA. It will be \nan important codification of much-needed incentives to help recover \nendangered species. And, since the introduction of CRESA 1 year ago, \nI'm proud to count over 100 different species and landowner \norganizations and advocates that have partnered with us in support of \nthis important tax legislation.\n  Over 80 percent of endangered species live on private property. Under \nthe current law, however, there are too few incentives and too many \nobstacles for private landowners to participate in conservation \nagreements to help recover species. S. 700, like the voluntary farm \nbill conservation programs that inspired its creation, will make it \nmore attractive for private landowners to contribute to the recovery of \nspecies under the ESA.\n  This bill resulted from effective and inclusive collaboration among \nkey stakeholders most affected by the implementation of the ESA. \nLandowner interests include farmers, ranchers, and those from the \nnatural resource-using communities. For example, some current \nsupporters of S. 700 who contributed invaluable advice are the American \nFarm Bureau and the Society of American Foresters. This could not \nrightly be called a collaborative project without the vital and \nnecessary input received from the Defenders of Wildlife, Environmental \nDefense and the National Wildlife Federation--key environmental groups \nthat made significant contributions. They understand that landowner \nmust be treated as allies to ensure success in the long-run for the \nconservation of habitat and species. Finally, while the genesis of this \nbill has many roots, a passionate catalyst was James Cummins of \nMississippi Fish and Wildlife Foundation, whose great concern for the \noutdoors provided inspiration to move these ideas forward.\n  These experts worked together to craft S. 700, which provides new tax \nincentives for private landowners who voluntarily contribute to the \nrecovery of endangered species. The tax credits will reimburse \nlandowners for property rights affected by agreements that include \nconservation easements and costs incurred by species management plans.\n  For landowners who limit their property rights through conservation \neasements, there will be 100 percent compensation of all costs. That \npercentage declines to 75 percent for 30-year easements and 50 percent \nfor cost-share agreements.\n  It is worth noting that this is the same formula that works \nsuccessfully for farm bill programs such as the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram. Private property owners are appropriately rewarded for crucial \necological services that they provide on their property. The public \nbenefits from these services, which ensure biodiversity. While the \nprimary returns from this investment are protection and recovery of \nendangered species, the public will also undoubtedly gain additional \nbenefits such as aesthetically pleasing open space, a reduction in the \nnumber of invasive species and enhanced water quality.\n  The legislation provides a list of options that give landowners a \nchoice--a crucial element for the success of this proposal. For some \nlandowners, a conservation easement will be the most attractive option. \nEasements are flexible tools that can be tailored to each landowner and \nspecies' interests. An easement restricts certain activities, but it \nstill works well with traditional rural activities such as ranching and \nfarming. For agreements without easements, there is flexibility to do \nwhat is necessary for the concerned species without the need to \nsacrifice property rights into perpetuity.\n  The tax credits provide essential funding that is necessary to \nrespect private property rights. Wildlife should be an asset rather \nthan a liability, which is how it has sometimes been viewed under the \nESA. With wildlife becoming valuable to a landowner, those who may have \nbeen reluctant to participate in recovery efforts in the past will be \nmore likely to contribute with these new incentives. When people want \nto take part in the process and do not fear it, the likelihood of \nconflict and litigation is reduced. For years, this type of conflict \nhas proven costly not only financially to individuals and the \ngovernment, but also in terms of relationships between people who share \nthe land and natural resources. With a new trust and new model for \nfinding conservation solutions, we can improve and expand our \nconservation work.\n  Provisions have been made to accommodate landowners whose taxes may \nbe less than the tax credit provides. Partnerships in the agreements \nwill allow any party to an agreement to receive a credit as long as \nthey pay or incur costs as a result of the agreement. This language \nwill allow creative collaboration among governments, landowners, \ntaxpayers and environmentalists, further increasing the number of \npeople involved in finding new solutions for conservation.\n  Furthermore, this bill also expands tax deductions for any landowner \nwho takes part in the recovery plans approved under the ESA, and allows \nlandowners to exclude from taxable income certain Federal payments \nunder conservation cost-share programs. This will allow both \nindividuals and businesses to deduct the cost of recovery work without \nbureaucratic obstacles.\n\n  This bill not only sets forth the financing for private landowners, \nbut it also makes it easier to implement the agreements. Landowners \nwill receive technical assistance to implement the agreements. Also, to \nremove some legal disincentives to recover species, liability \nprotection may be provided to protect the landowners from penalties \nunder the ESA. This removes the fear of trying to help endangered \nspecies. Currently, more species usually just means more liability for \na landowner.\n  As a result of these incentives, I expect to see a phenomenal \nincrease in the number of success stories. These stories will sound \nfamiliar to those creative collaborators working on the ground now \nwhere we have learned that the types of tools provided in this bill can \nwork if offered consistently.\n  The Endangered Species Recovery Act is very exciting to those of us \nwho value protecting our natural resources. It provides collaborative, \ncreative ways to balance conservation with economic uses of our natural \nresources. It also preserves rural ways of life. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate and House to move ahead with \nthis legislation which will provide a new model for conservation to do \nbetter work. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate \nand House to move ahead with this legislation.\n  I am deeply grateful to my colleagues from Arkansas, Iowa and Montana \nfor their essential expertise and support to create S. 700. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 702. A bill to authorize the Attorney General to award grants to \nState courts to develop and implement State courts interpreter \nprograms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Durbin, to introduce the State Court Interpreter Grant Program \nAct of 2007. This legislation would create a modest grant program to \nprovide much needed financial assistance to States for developing and \nimplementing effective State court interpreter programs, helping to \nensure fair trials for individuals with limited English proficiency.\n  States are already legally required, under Title VI of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, to take reasonable steps to provide meaningful \naccess to court proceedings for individuals with limited English \nproficiency. Unfortunately, however, court interpreting services vary \ngreatly by State. Some States have highly developed programs. Others \nare trying to get programs up and running, but lack adequate funds. \nStill others have no certification program at all. It is critical that \nwe protect the\n\n[[Page S2359]]\n\nconstitutional right to a fair trial by adequately funding State court \ninterpreter programs.\n  Our States are finding themselves in an impossible position. \nQualified interpreters are in short supply because it is difficult to \nfind individuals who are both bilingual and well-versed in legal \nterminology. The skills required of a court interpreter differ \nsignificantly from those required of other interpreters or translators. \nLegal English is a highly particularized area of the language, and \nrequires special training. Although anyone with fluency in a foreign \nlanguage could attempt to translate a court proceeding, the best \ninterpreters are those that have been tested and certified as official \ncourt interpreters.\n  Making the problem worse, States continue to fall further behind as \nthe number of Americans with limited English proficiency--and therefore \nthe demand for court interpreter services--continues to grow. According \nto the most recent Census data, 19 percent of the population over age \nfive speaks a language other than English at home. In 2000, the number \nof people in this country who spoke English less than ``very well'' was \nmore than 21 million, approaching twice what the number was ten years \nearlier. Illinois had more than 1 million. Texas had nearly 2.7 \nmillion. California had more than 6.2 million.\n  The shortage of qualified interpreters has become a national problem, \nand it has serious consequences. In Pennsylvania, a committee \nestablished by the Supreme Court called the State's interpreter program \n``backward,'' and said that the lack of qualified interpreters \n``undermines the ability of the . . . court system to determine facts \naccurately and to dispense justice fairly.'' When interpreters are \nunqualified, or untrained, mistakes are made. The result is that the \nfundamental right to due process is too often lost in translation, and \nbecause the lawyers and judges are not interpreters, these mistakes \noften go unnoticed.\n  Some of the stories associated with this problem are simply \nunbelievable. In Pennsylvania, for instance, a husband accused of \nabusing his wife was asked to translate as his wife testified in court. \nIn recent testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Justice Kennedy \ndescribed a particularly alarming situation where bilingual jurors can \nunderstand what the witness is saying and then interrupt the proceeding \nwhen an interpreter has not accurately represented the witness's \ntestimony. Justice Kennedy agrees that the lack of qualified court \ninterpreters poses a significant threat to our judicial system and \nemphasized the importance of addressing the issue.\n  This legislation does just that by authorizing $15 million per year, \nover five years, for a State Court Interpreter Grant Program. Those \nStates that apply would be eligible for a $100,000 base grant \nallotment. In addition, $5 million would be set aside for states that \ndemonstrate extraordinary need. The remainder of the money would be \ndistributed on a formula basis, determined by the percentage of persons \nin that State over the age of five who speak a language other than \nEnglish at home.\n  Some will undoubtedly question whether this modest amount can make a \ndifference. It can, and my home State of Wisconsin is a perfect example \nof that. When Wisconsin's program got off the ground in 2004, using \nState money and a $250,000 Federal grant, certified interpreters were \nscarce. Now, just two years later, it has 43 certified interpreters. \nMost of those are Spanish, where the greatest need exists. However, the \nState also has interpreters certified in sign language and Russian. The \nlist of provisional interpreters-- those who have received training and \npassed written tests--is much longer and includes individuals trained \nin Arabic, Hmong, Korean, and other languages. All of this progress in \nonly two years, and with only $250,000 of federal assistance.\n  This legislation has the strong support of state court administrators \nand state supreme court justices around the country.\n  Our States are facing this difficult challenge, and Federal law \nrequires them to meet it. Despite their noble efforts, many of them \nhave been unable to keep up with the demand. It is time we lend them a \nhelping hand. This is an access issue, and no one should be denied \njustice or access to our courts merely because of a language barrier, \nso I strongly urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 702\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand the definition of immediate relative for \npurposes of the Immigration and Nationality Act; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Kennedy to \nintroduce the Family Reunification Act, a measure designed to remedy a \nregrettable injustice in our immigration laws. A minor oversight in the \nlaw has led to an unfortunate, and likely unintended, consequence. \nParents of U.S. citizens are currently able to enter the country as \nlegal permanent residents, but our laws do not permit their minor \nchildren to join them. Simply put, the Family Reunification Act will \nclose this loophole by including the minor siblings of U.S. citizens in \nthe legal definition of ``immediate relative.'' This legislation will \nensure that our immigration laws can better accomplish one of the most \nimportant policy goals behind them--the goal of strengthening the \nfamily unit.\n  Congress took an important first step in promoting family \nreunification when it enacted the Immigration and Nationality Act. By \nqualifying as ``immediate relatives,'' this law currently offers \nparents, spouses and children of U.S. citizens the ability to obtain an \nimmigrant visas to enter the country.\n  We can all agree that this is good immigration policy. Unfortunately, \nan oversight in this law has undermined the effectiveness of the \nimportant principle of family reunification. Each year, a number of \nfamilies--in Wisconsin and across the country--are finding that they \ncannot take advantage of this family reunification provision.\n  Today, U.S. citizens often petition for their parents to be admitted \nto the United States as ``immediate relatives.'' As I have said, that \nis clearly allowed under current law. It is not always quite that \nsimple, though. In a small number of cases, a problem arises when these \nU.S. citizens have minor siblings. Since they do not qualify as an \n``immediate relative,'' the minor siblings are denied admission. So, a \nyoung man or woman can bring his parents into the country, but not his \nor her five year old brother or sister. Because the parents are unable \nto leave a young child behind, the child is not the only family member \nwho does not come to the United States. The parents--forced to choose \nbetween their children--are effectively prevented from coming to this \ncountry as well. The result, then, is that we are unnecessarily keeping \nfamilies apart by excluding minor siblings from the definition of \nimmediate relative.\n  For example, one family in my home State of Wisconsin is truly a \ntextbook example of what is wrong with this law. Effiong and Ekom Okon, \nboth U.S. citizens by birth, requested that their parents, who were \nliving in Nigeria, be admitted to as ``immediate relatives.'' The law \nclearly allows for this. Their father, Leo, had already joined them in \nWisconsin, and their mother, Grace, was in possession of a visa, ready \nto join the rest of her family. However, Grace was unable to join her \nhusband and sons in the United States because their six-year-old \ndaughter, Daramfon, did not qualify as an ``immediate relative.'' \nBecause it would be unthinkable for her to abandon her small child, \nGrace was forced to stay behind in Nigeria, separated from the rest of \nher family. That is not what this law was intended to accomplish.\n  It is difficult to determine the full extent of this problem. Because \nminor siblings do not qualify for visas, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (DHS) does not keep track of how many families have been \nadversely affected. What we do know, however, is that the cases in my \nhome State are not unique. Though the number is admittedly not large, \nDHS has notified us that they run into this problem regularly, with the \nnumber reaching into the hundreds each year. So, this change will not \nlead to an influx of many immigrants, but it will reunite a number of \nfamilies who have unnecessarily been kept apart.\n  If only one family suffers because of this loophole, I would suggest \nthat changes should be made. The fact that there have been numerous \ncases, probably in the hundreds, demands that we address this issue \nnow.\n  Many parts of our immigration laws are outdated and in need of \nrepair. The definition of ``immediate relative'' is no different. \nCongress's intent when it granted ``immediate relatives'' the right to \nobtain immigrant visas was to promote family reunification, but the \nunfortunate oversight which Senator Kennedy and I have highlighted has \ninterfered with many families' opportunity to do just that. The \nlegislation introduced today would expand the definition of ``immediate \nrelative'' to include the minor siblings of U.S. citizens. By doing so, \nwe can truly provide our fellow citizens with the ability to reunite \nwith their family members. This is a simple and modest solution to an \nunfortunate problem that too many families have already had to face. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 703\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DEFINITION OF IMMEDIATE RELATIVE.\n\n       Section 201(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act (8 U.S.C. 1151(b)(2)(A)(i)) is amended by inserting ``For \n     purposes of this subsection, a child of a parent of a citizen \n     of the United States shall be considered an immediate \n     relative if the child is accompanying or following to join \n     the parent.'' after ``at least 21 years of age.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 704. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit \nmanipulation of caller identification information; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, American consumers and public \nsafety officials increasingly find themselves confronted by scams in \nthe digital age. The latest scam is known as caller I.D. ``spoofing.'' \nToday, I am introducing a bipartisan bill with Senator Snowe--The Truth \nin Caller I.D. Act of 2007--to put an end to fraudulent caller I.D. \nspoofing.\n  It seems like every week we hear of new threats to our privacy and \nnew ways to use telecommunications networks to endanger consumers' \nfinancial security and physical safety. For several years now, I have \nbeen fighting back against these threats, pushing legislation to combat \nfrauds such as identity theft, the unauthorized sale of consumer \ntelephone records and spyware. It's now time to put an end to the \npractice of caller I.D. spoofing.\n  What is caller I.D. spoofing? It's a technique that allows a \ntelephone caller to alter the phone number that appears on the \nrecipient's caller I.D. system. In other words, spoofing allows\n\n[[Page S2361]]\n\nsomeone to hide behind a misleading telephone number to try to scam \nconsumers or trick law enforcement officers.\n  Let me give you a few shocking examples of how caller I.D. spoofing \nhas been exploited during the past two years:\n  In one very dangerous hoax, a sharp-shooting SWAT team was forced to \nshut down a neighborhood in New Brunswick, NJ, after receiving what \nthey believed was a legitimate distress call. But what really happened \nwas a caller used spoofing to trick law enforcement into thinking that \nthe emergency call was coming from a certain apartment in that \nneighborhood. It was all a cruel trick perpetrated with a deceptive \ntelephone number.\n  In another example, identity thieves bought a number of stolen credit \ncard numbers. They then called Western Union, set up caller I.D. \ninformation to make it look like the call originated from the credit \ncard holder's phone line, and used the credit card numbers to order \ncash transfers, which the thieves then picked up.\n  In other instances, callers have used spoofing to pose as government \nofficials. In recent months, there have been numerous instances of \nfraudsters using caller I.D. fraud to pose as court officers calling to \nsay that a person has missed jury duty. The caller then says that a \nwarrant will be issued for their arrest, unless a fine is paid during \nthe call. The victim is then induced to provide credit card or bank \ninformation over the phone to pay the ``fine.''\n  Furthermore, while these examples are serious enough, think about \nwhat would happen if a stalker used caller I.D. spoofing to trick his \nvictim into answering the telephone, giving out personal information, \nor telling the person on the other end of the line about their current \nwhereabouts. The results could be tragic.\n  According to experts, there are a number of Internet websites--with \nnames like Tricktel.com and Spooftel.com--that sell their services to \ncriminal and identity thieves. Any person can go to one of these \nwebsites, pay money to order a spoofed telephone number, tell the \nwebsite which phone number to reach, and then place the call through a \ntoll-free line. The recipient is then tricked when he or she sees the \nmisleading phone number on his or her caller I.D. screen.\n  In essence, these websites provide the high-tech tools that identity \nthieves need to do their dirty work. Armed with a misleading phone \nnumber, an identity thief can call a consumer pretending to be a \nrepresentative of the consumer's credit card company or bank. The thief \ncan then ask the consumer to authenticate a request for personal \naccount information. Once a thief gets hold of this sensitive personal \ninformation, he can access a consumer's bank account, credit card \naccount, health information, and who knows what else.\n  Furthermore, even if a consumer does not become a victim of stalking \nor identity theft, there is a simple concept at work here. Consumers \npay money for their caller I.D. service. Consumers expect caller I.D. \nto be accurate because it helps them decide whether to answer a phone \ncall and trust the person on the other end of the line.\n  If the caller I.D. says that my wife is calling me, when I pick up \nthe phone I expect my wife to actually be on the other end of the line. \nInstead, we have fraudsters and others who want to abuse the system and \ndisguise their true identities. That defeats the whole purpose of \ncaller I.D.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal \nTrade Commission have been slow to act on this latest scam. In the \nmeantime, many spoofing companies and the fraudsters that use them \nbelieve their activities are, in fact, legal. Well, it's time to make \nit crystal clear that spoofing is a scam and is not legal.\n  How does the bipartisan Truth in Caller I.D. Act of 2007 address the \nproblem of caller I.D. spoofing?\n  Quite simply, this bill plugs the hole in the current law and \nprohibits fraudsters from using caller identification services to \ntransmit misleading or inaccurate caller I.D. information. This \nprohibition covers both traditional telephone calls and calls made \nusing Voice-Over-Internet (VoIP) service.\n  Anyone who violates this anti-spoofing law would be subject to a \npenalty of $10,000 per violation or up to one year in jail, as set out \nin the Communications Act. Additionally, this bill empowers States to \nhelp the Federal Government track down and punish these fraudsters.\n  I invite my colleagues to join Senator Snowe and myself in supporting \nthe Truth in Caller I.D. Act of 2007. We should waste no time in \nprotecting consumers and law enforcement authorities against caller \nI.D. spoofing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Truth in Caller I.D. Act \nof 2007 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 704\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act \nto establish a governmentwide policy requiring competition in certain \nexecutive agency procurements, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators Craig \nThomas, Debbie Stabenow, Chuck Grassley and Tom Harkin in introducing \nthe Federal Prison Industries Competition in Contracting Act. Our bill \nis based on a straightforward premise: it is unfair for Federal Prison \nIndustries to deny businesses in the private sector an opportunity to \ncompete for sales to their own government.\n  We have made immeasurable progress on this issue since I first \nintroduced a similar bill ten years ago. It may seem incredible, but at \nthat time, Federal Prison Industries (FPI) could bar private sector \ncompanies from competing for a Federal contract. Under the law \nestablishing Federal Prison Industries, if Federal Prison Industries \nsaid that it wanted a contract, it would get that contract, regardless \nwhether a company in the private sector could provide the product \nbetter, cheaper, or faster.\n  Six years ago, the Senate took a giant step toward addressing this \ninequity when we voted 74-24 to end Federal Prison Industries' monopoly \non Department of Defense contracts. Not only was that provision enacted \ninto law, we were able to strengthen it with a second provision a year \nlater. In 2004, we took another important step, enacting an \nappropriations provision which extends the DOD rules to other Federal \nagencies. This means that, for the first time, private sector companies \nshould be able to compete against for contracts awarded by all Federal \nagencies.\n  Despite this progress, work remains to be done. We have heard reports \nfrom Federal procurement officials and from small businesses that FPI \ncontinues to claim that it retains the mandatory source status that \nprotected it from competition for so long. This kind of misleading \nstatement may undermine the right to compete that we have fought so \nhard for so long to establish.\n  In addition, FPI continues to sell its services into interstate \ncommerce on an unlimited basis. I am concerned that the sale of prison \nlabor into commerce could have the effect of undermining companies and \nwork forces that are already in a weakened position as a result of \nforeign competition. We have long taken the position as a Nation that \nprison-made goods should not be sold into commerce, where prison wages \nof a few cents per hour could too easily undercut private sector \ncompetition. It is hard for me to understand why the sale of services \nshould be treated any differently than the sale of products.\n  The bill that we are introducing today would address these issues by \nmaking it absolutely clear that FPI no longer has a mandatory source \nstatus, by reaffirming the critical requirement that FPI must compete \nfor its contracts, and by carefully limiting the circumstances under \nwhich prison services may be sold into the private sector economy.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on these important \nissues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 707. A bill to provide all low-income students with the same \nopportunity to receive a Pell Grant by suspending the tuition \nsensitivity provision in the Pell Grant program; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Boxer as \na co-sponsor of the ``Pell Grant Equity Act of 2007'' that would \nprovide all low-income students with the same opportunity to receive a \nFederal Pell Grant by eliminating the current tuition sensitivity \nprovision in the Pell Grant Program.\n  Federal Pell Grants are the cornerstone of our need-based financial \naid system ensuring that all students have access to higher education.\n  However, the Pell Grant program's eligibility formula penalizes low-\nincome students who attend very low-cost colleges by reducing the \namount of the Pell Grant they can receive.\n  The formula bases eligibility for Pell Grant awards on the amount of \ntuition charged by the college and provides a lower ``alternate'' \namount for low tuition colleges, known as the ``tuition sensitivity'' \nprovision.\n  Community college students are significantly impacted by the tuition \nsensitivity provision because of low student tuition fees.\n  In California, due to a drop in tuition fees from $26 per unit to $20 \nunit, community college students enrolling this spring will otherwise \nbe penalized with a $56 reduction in their 2007 Pell Grants and will \nendure another $112 hit in the 2007-2008 academic year if the tuition \nsensitivity provision is not eliminated.\n  Community college students represent approximately 46 percent of \nhigher education students in California\n\n[[Page S2363]]\n\nreceiving Pell Grants and are the only ones negatively impacted by this \nprovision.\n  Any reduction of these vital grants to our lowest income students \nwould have a major impact in their ability to afford college and \ncontinue their education, and we cannot allow this to happen.\n  This bill would ensure that our nation's community college students \nare not unduly penalized for receiving an affordable education at a \nlow-cost college.\n  We must continue to do all we can to make a college education more \naccessible and affordable for all of our Nation's students.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Boxer and I in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 710. A bill to reauthorize the programs for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development for housing assistance for Native \nHawaiians; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to reauthorize \nTitle VIII of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\nDetermination Act. Senator Akaka joins me in sponsoring this measure. \nTitle VIII provides authority for the appropriation of funds for the \nconstruction of low-income housing for Native Hawaiians and further \nprovides authority for access to loan guarantees associated with the \nconstruction of housing to serve Native Hawaiians.\n  Three studies have documented the acute housing needs of Native \nHawaiians--which include the highest rates of overcrowding and \nhomelessness in the State of Hawaii. Those same studies indicate that \ninadequate housing rates for Native Hawaiians are amongst the highest \nin the Nation.\n  The reauthorization of Title VIII will support the continuation of \nefforts to assure that the native people of Hawaii may one day have \naccess to housing opportunities that are comparable to those now \nenjoyed by other Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 710\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure dignity in care for members of the Armed \nForces recovering from injuries; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the ``Dignity \nfor Wounded Warriors Act,'' which I am proud to introduce with Senator \nMcCaskill.\n  Last week, the Nation learned of the serious problems at Walter Reed \nArmy Medical Center including decaying, cockroach-infested facilities \nand an overwhelmed patient-care bureaucracy. As described in a series \nof articles in the Washington Post by Dana Priest and Anne Hull, \nwounded soldiers are returning home from the battle in Iraq only to \nface a new battle to get the care and benefits they have earned.\n  These stories should not have come as a complete surprise to those \nwho have followed the issue closely. We have long known that troops \nreturning from battle face numerous bureaucratic hurdles when they get \nhome. That's why I introduced legislation last year to smooth the \ntransition from active duty to civilian life. The Lane Evans Bill \nexpands and improves electronic medical records, face-to-face physical \nexams, better tracking of veterans, and other approaches to make life \neasier for returning veterans.\n  However, the stories out of Walter Reed last week did shock my \nconscience because, like many Senators, I have made the half-hour trek \nfrom the Capitol to visit Walter Reed. And I saw what the Army wanted \nthe world to see: a shining world-class facility where the wounded can \nheal with state-of-the-art care. I never saw mold growing on the walls, \nor broken elevators, or the lack of adequate support for soldiers and \ntheir families. Walter Reed was supposed to be the flagship of military \nhealth care. Instead it has become an emblem of much that is wrong with \nthe system, and a harbinger of more severe problems that may be hiding \nat other military hospitals and facilities that are not in the \nspotlight.\n  The problems at Walter Reed stem from complex causes, the most \nimportant of which is that the military and VA have not yet prepared \nfor the growing flood of casualties from the Iraq war. Our injured \ntroops did not hesitate to fight for us on the battlefield--we \nshouldn't make them fight again at home in order to receive the care \nthey deserve. That is why Senator McCaskill and I are introducing the \nbipartisan Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act today. The bill will fix \nthe problems at Walter Reed and improve care at our military hospitals \nand facilities.\n  Our bill would fix deplorable conditions at outpatient residence \nfacilities by setting high standards and increasing accountability. \nUnder this bipartisan measure, the standards will be clear. First, \nrecovering soldiers' rooms will be as good or better as the best \nstandard rooms for active-duty troops. Second, our injured heroes will \nnot have to wait more than two weeks for maintenance problems to be \nrepaired. Third, we will have zero tolerance for pest infestations. And \nfinally, emergency medical personnel and crisis counselors will be \navailable to recovering troops 24 hours a day.\n\n[[Page S2364]]\n\n  The bill also tackles accountability problems. In the days following \nthe Post stories, the Army vice chief of staff, and the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Health Affairs both said they were surprised \nby conditions at Walter Reed and directed blame on lower-ranking \nofficers and noncommissioned officers. I also read in the Army Times \nthat soldiers at Walter Reed have been warned not to talk to the media. \nUnder our bill, we won't have to rely on the media to inform the \nCongress and the American people of the conditions at military \nhospitals. It requires that the Inspector General inspect facilities \ntwice a year and report conditions to high-level officials and the \npublic. Under our bill, military leaders will no longer be able to use \nthe excuse that they didn't know conditions on the ground.\n  When injured servicemembers return home, they along with their family \nmembers face a mountain of paperwork and bureaucracy. From the moment a \ndoctor determines a soldier may be unable to return to duty, it takes \nan average of 209 days for the military to figure out what to do with \nthe soldier. The system is broken, and soldiers and their families are \nthe ones who pay the price. Our bill addresses this problem by bringing \nthe far flung parts of the military's Physical Disability Evaluation \nSystem (PDES) under one roof in each branch of the military. It also \nputs much of the system online so that caseworkers and servicemembers \ncan manage their documents electronically. Today, students can apply to \ngo to law school or business school online, without ever having to \ntouch a piece of paper. Navigating the Pentagon bureaucracy should be \nthat easy.\n  Our bill also calls for injury-specific procedures so that the most \nseverely injured servicemembers can skip unnecessary steps. There's no \nreason why a soldier with a gunshot injury to the spine should face the \nsame procedural hurdles in order to prove his injury was service-\nrelated as a soldier with less severe injuries. At the same time, \nnothing in our bill will prevent those servicemembers who wish to stay \nin the military from appealing decisions. Our bill also helps soldiers \nand their families navigate the PDES system with new hotlines, manuals, \nand an ombudsman to help answer questions.\n  Another problem at Walter Reed is casework. The caseworkers are doing \namazing work helping soldiers schedule medical appointments, prepare \npaperwork, and obtain their everyday needs. However, the caseworkers \nare overwhelmed. Some have to care for 50 or more recovering soldiers \nat a time, more than double the ideal ratio. The Dignity for Wounded \nWarriors Act fixes this problem by forcing the Pentagon to work with \neach military hospital to set the ideal ratio of caseworkers to \npatients based on the particular needs of that facility. In the \ninterim, our bill requires a temporary ratio of 1 caseworker for every \n20 recovering servicemembers. This will push the Pentagon to begin \nhiring and training caseworkers right away.\n  This legislation also provides important new support for family \nmembers who often have to endure economic and emotional hardship to \naccompany their loved one through the recovery process and the \ncurrently flawed PDES process. It clarifies that non-medical attendees \nand family members on invitational orders may receive medical care and \nmental health counseling while caring for injured loved ones at \nmilitary facilities. It extends employment and job placement training \nservices to family members. And most important, this bipartisan \nlegislation provides federal protections against a family member on \ninvitational orders being fired. I think we can all agree that a mother \nshould never have to choose between caring for a wounded son or \ndaughter and keeping her job.\n  Secretary Gates promised a thorough investigation by outside experts \nand accountability for those responsible. Our bill builds on that model \nby establishing an Oversight Board of outside experts to review the \nPentagon's progress in implementing this bill. The Board would be \nappointed by Congress and the executive branch and be made up of \nveterans, wounded soldiers, family members and experts on military \nmedicine. The Oversight Board will be an important check to make sure \nthe Defense Department is following through to care for recovering \ntroops.\n  We cannot move fast enough to make sure our wounded troops are \ngetting the care they need. No cost is too great. We must pass the \nDignity for Wounded Warriors Act quickly and follow up with the \nadequate resources to ensure the men and women recovering at military \nhospitals across the world get the best care we can offer.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, it is my honor to join my \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Obama, today in \nintroducing the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act, a bill that serves to \nbetter the experience so many recovering military servicemembers and \ntheir families have in dealing with the military healthcare system and \nits bureaucracy.\n  It is not often that you read something in the paper that makes you \nsick, but this is precisely the feeling I had just over a week ago as I \nread a Washington Post article that spoke of awful living conditions \nand an interminable bureaucracy being experienced by our war wounded \nwho are receiving outpatient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\n  I will not stand aside as those who have fought for our country come \nhome to fight new battles against a crippling bureaucracy just to get \nthe compensation they have more than earned. They shouldn't have to \nlive in substandard conditions while they are recovering from their \ninjuries.\n  Our legislation directly tackles these problems. The principle is \nsimple: our wounded and recovering servicemembers must receive the best \ntreatment. They can't live in substandard housing as they recover. And \nthey must have a user-friendly system to help them apply for the \nappropriate disability and benefits compensation. It's the least we can \ndo for all they have done for us.\n  For example, each military department has a standard for their \ndormitories and barracks. I know that not every dormitory or barracks \nmeets the highest standard that the service sets, but that each service \nis steadily working to reach this standard across their facilities. It \nis my belief, and this bill serves to establish, that the lowest \nstandard acceptable for a returning wounded servicemember should be the \nhighest existing standard in each military service. Facing the daunting \nchallenge of recovering from war wounds--both psychological and \nphysical--our returning servicemembers should not be living among \nvermin and mold. They should not be placed in temporary, cramped, \nmakeshift, ancient or transient quarters. We're not demanding the Taj \nMahal. We are demanding decent living conditions to help these injured \nmen and women.\n  Further, when problems exist in the living quarters of our recovering \nservicemembers, they should be identified and repaired quickly. This \nbill establishes strict measures to facilitate reporting of \nunsatisfactory living conditions and to mandate timely repair. It also \nestablishes measures to ensure that independent parties are inspecting \nliving quarters in order to prevent any syndrome whereby those closely \nengaged in dealing with these facilities are overly focused on \ncompleting the mission with what they have as opposed to what they \nshould have.\n  I was also appalled to learn of the extensive, confusing bureaucracy \nthat greeted our recovering servicemembers in the outpatient care \nprocess. With numerous commands, organizations, advocates, doctors, \ncommanders and any number of others involved in the process, recovering \nservicemembers found themselves navigating a complicated process and \noften without a map. They also have to fill out numerous forms, request \nrecords, check off bureaucratic blocks, get the right language in their \ndoctor's evaluations, document their illnesses, capture the symptoms \nthey are experiencing and more. It is safe to say that the process \nposes a daunting challenge to even a fully healthy individual--but \nimagine the challenge for someone far from home and facing the \nrealities of the wounds of war.\n  Complicating the challenges, those tasked to provide these \nservicemembers and their families with assistance have been faced with \nlarge caseloads and insufficient resources. This legislation requires \nresponsible caseloads for military leaders and caseworkers--and it \nrequires that those providing this assistance not just have\n\n[[Page S2365]]\n\na caseload that guarantees a recovering servicemember the attention \nthey need and deserve, but that these caseworkers are well trained.\n  I also learned that those who come to military treatment facilities \nlike Walter Reed to help their loved ones often face uphill battles. I \nam proud that this legislation reaches out to protect those loved ones \nwho risk their livelihood to care for our recovering servicemembers by \nproviding them medical care as well as protections to secure the jobs \nthey leave behind.\n  Today, I visited Walter Reed, talked with our recovering \nservicemembers, toured the facilities and discussed these issues with \nWalter Reed's leaders. I can confidently say that those treating our \nservicemembers are with me--they want the very best for our recovering \nservicemembers and for their families. I know that the quality of care \nbeing provided at Walter Reed and at many other military hospitals is \nexceptional and I applaud the caregivers.\n  But I also know that we have all failed to provide the best service \nand support to many during the outpatient care process. Their living \nquarters were not the best. The Physical Disability Evaluation System \nthey experience is too bureaucratic. It is time to deliver the best. \nThis legislation seeks to provide it.\n  This is fair legislation. It balances requiring immediate changes \nwith letting the Department of Defense study what is necessary and to \nsubsequently implement incremental change. It empowers our physicians \nby not requiring random timelines for medical processing or medical \ncare, but it requires that care and processing happen with manageable, \nunderstandable and streamlined procedures that equally empowers the \nservicemember. And this bill requires that trained, professional and \ncaring providers be available to recovering servicemembers and their \nfamilies in sufficient numbers and in the appropriate places throughout \nthe care process.\n  In closing, I want to thank Senator Obama for his efforts in teaming \nwith me to produce this important legislation. But mostly I want to \nthank all those serving our nation in uniform today. Their sense of \nduty is remarkable. Their sacrifice is great. Their heroism unmatched. \nThey have given their best to our country and our country is committed \nto giving them the best in return.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 714. A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to ensure that all \ndogs and cats used by research facilities are obtained legally; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pet \nProtection Act of 2007. In 1966, Congress passed the Animal Welfare Act \nto prevent the abuse and mistreatment of animals and to provide \nassurance that family pets would not be sold for laboratory \nexperiments. Although the Animal Welfare Act provides a solid \nfoundation to stop the mistreatment of animals, more needs to be done \nto protect pets and pet owners from the actions of Class B animal \ndealers, also known as ``random source'' dealers.\n  Across the Nation, random source animal dealers acquire tens of \nthousands of dogs and cats, many of them family pets, through deceit \nand fraud. Some of their tactics include tricking animals owners into \ngiving away their dogs and cats by posing as someone interested in pet \nadoption and the outright theft of family pets left unattended. The \ntreatment of the animals captured and sold by random source dealers is \noften shocking and cruel. Hundreds of animals are kept in squalid \nconditions with just enough food and water to keep them alive until \nsold.\n  This bill does not address the larger issue of whether animals should \nor should not be used in research facilities. Medical research is one \nof our primary weapons in the discovery of new drugs and surgical \ntechniques that help develop cures for life-threatening diseases and \nanimal research has been, and continues to be, a fundamental part of \nscientific advances. Instead, this legislation targets the unethical \npractice of selling stolen pets and stray animals to research \nfacilities. While I do not believe that research laboratories \nintentionally seek out fraudulently obtained animals, it does happen. \nAnd it does need to be stopped.\n  My bill will strengthen the Animal Welfare Act by prohibiting the use \nof random source animal dealers as suppliers of dogs and cats to \nresearch laboratories by making funds unavailable to research \nfacilities that purchase animals from a dealer that holds a Class B \nlicense under the Animal Welfare Act. In doing so, it also \nsimultaneously encourages the use of legitimate sources such as USDA-\nlicensed Class A dealers. I urge my colleagues to join me in my efforts \nto curb the abusive practices of random source dealers by supporting \nthis bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. \n        Vitter):\n  S. 715. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to provide expedited \ndisaster assistance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as we all know, there was a tremendous \namount of criticism of the Federal Government's response to Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita last year. Things are better now and the region is \nslowly recovering. But, having luckily survived the 2006 hurricane \nseason with no major storms, and with the 2007 season a few months \naway, we must be sure that if we have another disaster, the Federal \nGovernment's response will be better this time around. Disaster \nresponse agencies have to be better organized, more efficient, and more \nresponsive in order to avoid the problems, the delays, mismanagement, \nand the seeming incompetence that occurred in 2005.\n  Today, I am proud to sponsor legislation to improve the disaster \nresponse of one agency that had a great deal of problems last year, the \nSmall Business Administration (SBA). This bill, the ``Small Business \nDisaster Recovery Improvement Act,'' makes a major improvement to the \nSBA's disaster response and provides them with an essential tool to \nensure that they are more efficient and better prepared for future \ndisasters--big and small. I should note that this bill is a result of \nintensive bipartisan work over the past couple of months on a larger \nSBA Disaster Reforms bill, S. 137, the ``Small Business Disaster \nResponse and Loan Improvements Act,'' which was introduced early in the \n110th Congress. I feel strongly that this provision, an Expedited \nDisaster Assistance Loan Program for businesses, should be passed \nduring this session of Congress, therefore I wanted to also introduce \nit in separate legislation for the 110th Congress. That said, I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues on the Small Business Committee, \nSenators Kerry and Snowe, respectively Chair and Ranking Member of the \nSenate Small Business Committee, as well as with my colleague Senator \nVitter to include this provision along with more comprehensive SBA \nDisaster Assistance reforms that we hope to enact in the coming months.\n  After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit, our businesses and homeowners \nhad to wait months for loan approvals. I do not know how many \nbusinesses we lost because help did not come in time. What these \nbusinesses needed was immediate, short-term assistance to hold them \nover until SBA was ready to process the tens of thousands of loan \napplications it received.\n  That is why this legislation provides the SBA Administrator with the \nability to set up an expedited disaster assistance business loan \nprogram to make short-term, low- interest loans to keep them afloat. \nThese loans will allow businesses to make payroll, begin making \nrepairs, and address other immediate needs while they are awaiting \ninsurance payouts or regular SBA Disaster Loans. However, I realize \nthat every disaster is different and could range from a disaster on the \nscale of Hurricanes Katrina or Rita or 9-11, to an ice storm or \ndrought. This legislation gives the SBA additional options and \nflexibility in the kinds of relief they can offer a community. When a \ntornado destroys 20 businesses in a small town in the Midwest, SBA can \nget the regular disaster program up and running fairly quickly. You may \nnot need short-term loans in this instance. But if you know that SBA's \nresources would be overwhelmed by a storm--just as they were initially \nwith the storms of 2005--these expedited business loans would be very \nhelpful.\n  The Small Business Disaster Recovery Improvement Act will provide an\n\n[[Page S2366]]\n\nessential tool to make the SBA more proactive, flexible, and most \nimportant, more efficient during future disasters. If SBA is not in the \nbusiness of short-term assistance for future disasters, I feel that we \nwill again see businesses fail while waiting for SBA to get its act \ntogether. The agency has implemented some major changes to its Disaster \nAssistance Program but, if the storms of 2005 taught us anything it was \nthat the best laid plans can fail. This Expedited Disaster Assistance \nLoan Program would ensure that SBA has a backup tool to provide \nimmediate assistance to impacted businesses. Again, I look forward to \nworking with both Senator Snowe and Senator Kerry during the coming \nweeks to ensure that the SBA has everything it needs to respond to \nfuture disasters.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 715\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator \nColeman, and Representatives Eshoo and Ramstad, in reintroducing the \nConsortium on the Impact of Technology in Health Services Act.\n  We face a challenging and exciting time in the evolution of America's \nhealth care system. Today, roughly 45 million men and women are over \nage 65. A full doubling of the elderly population is predicted to occur \nby the year 2030--with the first of the baby boom generation turning 65 \nin the year 2011--only four years from now.\n  Nowhere is the aging of the population more apparent than in my home \nState of Rhode Island. We exceed the national average in terms of \ncitizens over the age of 65 as well as those over the age of 85. In a \nState of slightly more than a million people, almost 15 percent of the \npopulation is over the age of 65 today. According to Census Bureau \nestimates, the number of elderly is expected to increase to 18.8 \npercent of Rhode Island's population by 2025.\n  Dramatic increases in life expectancy over the last century can be \nattributed to tremendous advances in health and medical research. These \ndemographic changes also pose new challenges to our health care system \nthat require creative and innovative solutions.\n  In addition to Americans living longer, keeping up with advancements \nin medical science poses unique burdens and challenges for our health \ncare system. We are facing shortages in a number of critical health \ncare fields--nurses, primary care physicians, and geriatricians--to \nname a few. These workforce issues further hinder our ability to keep \nup with the health care needs of aging Americans.\n  Greater use of technology has the potential to enhance the quality of \ncare to our aging population and enable seniors to remain healthy and \nlive independently longer. The overwhelming\n\n[[Page S2368]]\n\nmajority of seniors in my State and across the Nation want to ``age in \nplace''--in their homes--close to their loved ones. Indeed, a growing \nnumber of the baby boom generation support funding aging services \ntechnology research, and believe technology will allow them to live \nlonger and more independently.\n  The application of technology in the aging health care services field \nwould also help mitigate the burden on providers, by allowing \nphysicians, home health care workers, and family members to keep in \nregular contact with patients and loved ones. Better monitoring of \nelderly patients would also serve to identify changes in their health \ncondition before a serious problem arises.\n  The bill we are introducing today would build on groundbreaking \nresearch and public-private partnerships to find evidence-based \napproaches to behavioral assessment and non-intrusive health \nmonitoring. Improving in-home monitoring technologies and remote \ndiagnostics will provide seniors and their caregivers with greater \nindependence and flexibility. A recent study found that Americans, \nparticularly those with chronic conditions, are already utilizing the \nInternet and online tools to better manage their health. Using \ntechnology to enhance health care professionals ability to access vital \nhealth information will not only improve diagnosis and treatment, but \nit will also inform the health decisions of seniors and their families.\n  Smarter applications of technology in caring for the aged could also \naddress some of the growing concerns with skyrocketing budget deficits. \nAs we grapple with Medicare and Medicaid taking up a growing proportion \nof overall federal spending, we need to carefully balance health care \nexpenditures while also improving the quality of care. We need to use \nprecious health care dollars wisely and prudently as we seek creative \nways to continue to provide quality health services to the elderly.\n  The Consortium on the Impact of Technology in Health Services Act \nwill bring together experts from the medical, aging, and technology \nfields to build a vision and a framework for the development and \nimplementation of a 21st century health care system able to meet the \nneeds of our burgeoning aging population.\n  We need to change the way we think about health care for our Nation's \nseniors. We need a model that is oriented toward health promotion and \ndisease prevention. This legislation gives us a jumpstart on developing \nand implementing the tools and strategies to serve the senior \npopulation of America more effectively and with greater cost savings.\n  I am pleased to join with my colleagues in introducing this important \ninitiative and hope the Senate will give it careful consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Tester):\n  S. 717. A bill to repeal title II of the REAL ID Act of 2005, to \nrestore section 7212 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004, which provides States additional regulatory \nflexibility and funding authorization to more rapidly produce tamper- \nand counterfeit-resistant driver's licenses, and to protect privacy and \ncivil liberties by providing interested stakeholders on a negotiated \nrulemaking with guidance to achieve improved 21st century licenses to \nimprove national security; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues from New \nHampshire, Vermont, and Montana, Senators Sununu, Leahy and Tester, to \nreintroduce legislation to address problems with the REAL ID Act of \n2005.\n  Last year, Senator Sununu and I introduced S. 4117, the Identity \nSecurity Enhancement Act, which would repeal the REAL ID Act and \nreinstitute the shared rulemaking process and more reasonable \nguidelines established in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004. We joined together to convey our concerns with \nREAL ID to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and to urge the \nDepartment to ensure that the forthcoming regulations implementing REAL \nID addressed our concerns. Now, on the eve of DHS releasing the \nproposed REAL ID regulations, we once again introduce our legislation \nas a placeholder as Congress and the American people review how DHS \nproposes to implement this costly and controversial law.\n  I plan to hold a hearing on the REAL ID regulations in the Oversight \nof Government Management Subcommittee shortly, and I will develop \ncomprehensive legislation to address any privacy and civil liberties \nissues arising under the Act and any unrealistic burdens placed on the \nstates.\n  From the time the REAL ID Act became law nearly two years ago, \nhundreds of organizations--ranging from the National Governor's \nAssociation (NGA) to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)--have \nvoice their strong opposition to REAL ID. None of these groups were \nheard by Congress before the bill was passed in May 2005 as there were \nno hearings to understand the repercussions of such sweeping \nlegislation.\n  Rather, the REAL ID Act was attached to the Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami \nRelief Act (P.L. 109-13) in Conference. It was wrong to include the \nlegislation that has such a massive impact on State and local \ngovernments without their input. Not having a full debate on the \nmeasure to determine its impact has led an increasing number of State \nlegislatures to introduce and pass legislation to condemn REAL ID and, \nin some cases, prohibit the state from spending money to implement the \nAct.\n  My two primary concerns with REAL ID are that the law places an \nunrealistic and unfunded burden on state governments and erodes \nAmericans' civil liberties and privacy rights.\n  There is nothing realistic about REAL ID. The extremely costly and \ncomplex set of electronic systems that will be required to connect the \nthousands of local Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMVs) to one another \nand to a host of Federal agencies as required under REAL ID may not be \npractical. This would cost $1.42 billion according to a September 2006 \nreport issued by the NGA, the National Conference of State Legislatures \n(NCSL), and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators \n(AAMVA). In addition, the costs to re-issue every current driver's \nlicense under the new screening process is estimated to cost \napproximately $8 billion over five years. Combined with the other \nrequirements imposed on states by REAL ID, such as new design \nrequirements for the ID cards and on-site security, REAL ID will cost \nover $11 billion. Congress has appropriated only $40 million for REAL \nID implementation, which leaves a hefty price tag for the states, \nespecially for legislation that was passed with no review.\n  In addition to the unrealistic burden REAL ID places on states, REAL \nID is a serious threat to our privacy rights and civil liberties.\n  As I said last year, the REAL ID Act will require every driver's \nlicensing agency to collect and store substantial numbers of records \ncontaining licensees' most sensitive personally identifiable \ninformation, including one's social security number, proof of \nresidence, and biometric identifiers such as a digital photograph and \nsignature. If the state databases are compromised, they will provide \none-stop access to virtually all information necessary to commit \nidentity theft.\n  Moreover, the sharing of the aggregated personally identifiable \ninformation of licensees between and amongst various government \nagencies and employees at the federal, state, and local level, as \ncontemplated by the REAL ID Act, potentially allows millions of \nindividuals access to that information without protections or \nsafeguards.\n  Despite these obvious threats to Americans' privacy, the REAL ID Act \nfails to mandate privacy protections for individuals' information nor \ndoes it provide states with the means to implement data security and \nanti-hacking protections that will be required to safeguard the new \ndatabases mandated by the Act.\n  REAL ID exacerbates the threat of identity theft which threatens our \nsecurity by giving us a false sense of security.\n  Unfunded mandates and the lack of privacy and security requirements \nare real problems that deserve real consideration and real solutions. \nCongress\n\n[[Page S2369]]\n\nhas a responsibility to ensure that driver's licenses and ID cards \nissued in the United States are secure--both from would-be terrorists \nand identity thieves--affordable, and practical.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 717\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to optimize the delivery of critical care medicine and \nexpand the critical care workforce; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, why hold off for tomorrow what we can do \ntoday? The current healthcare crisis in our Nation did not happen \novernight. It has been accumulating as a result of a lack of serious \nattention to the most pressing healthcare issues, including healthcare \nworkforce shortages. As a husband and a parent, I pray every day that \nmy wife and children will have access to the quality healthcare they \ndeserve when they need it. As a public official, I believe that it is \nmy responsibility to help make that care available for not only my own \nfamily, but also for the families in the State of Illinois and across \nthe Nation.\n  The growing shortage of critical care physicians undermines the \nquality and availability of health care services in the United States. \nThis shortage can be expected to disproportionately impact rural and \nother areas of the United States that already often suffer from a sub-\noptimal level of critical care services. When a loved one needs a \ncritical care doctor, would we not want one to be available? If \nresearch tells us that their recovery may be better and their recovery \ntime faster, would we not want our loved one to have access to a \ncritical care doctor?\n  The Leap Frog Group has clearly documented that significant \nimprovement in outcomes--in both quality and cost--result when a \ncritically ill or injured patient is seen by an intensivist. With a \ngreater use of intensivists, an estimated 54,000 deaths that currently \noccur in ICUs could be avoided. Unfortunately, only one-third of our \ncritically ill citizens are treated by physicians and nurses \nspecifically trained to manage their complex health issues.\n  In June 2003, Congress asked the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration--HRSA--to examine the healthcare needs of a growing \npopulation and the availability of pulmonary and critical care \nphysicians. In its May 2006 report to Congress entitled ``The Critical \nCare Workforce: A Study of the Supply and Demand for Critical Care \nPhysicians,'' HRSA found that the country does not have enough \nphysicians trained in critical care medicine to treat all those in need \nof the care. The report projected future demand for these services and \nfound that, as a result of having to staff ICUs with critical care \ndoctors, a total of 4,300 intensivist physicians will be needed when \nonly 2,800 are available. The HRSA report recognized that the demand in \nthe United States for critical care medical services is rising sharply \nand will continue to do so.\n  To proactively address the healthcare needs of our nation, I am \npleased to join with my colleague Senator Crapo today to introduce \nlegislation to address the looming shortage of critical care providers. \nOur bill, The Patient-Focused Critical Care Enhancement Act authorizes \na series of modest and sensible measures that--if enacted now instead \nof waiting for this shortage to worsen--can help to obviate the \nproblem.\n  First, the Patient-Focused Critical Care Enhancement Act would direct \nthe Agency for Health Research and Quality to assess the current state \nof and recommend ``best practices'' for critical care medicine. The \nauthorization of demonstration projects on innovations in ICU services \nand on family-centered, multi-disciplinary approaches to critical care \nservices are important for determining how to improve the quality of \nthe care delivered and how to best make use of our existing resources \nof critical care doctors.\n  Our bill would also expand telemedicine opportunities for critical \ncare physicians to promote efforts relating to critical care and ensure \nthat all communities have greater access to this important, lifesaving \ncare. For our rural communities and medically underserved areas, the \nneed for critical care doctors is exacerbated. This bill will hopefully \nexpand the effectiveness of existing critical care providers in \nenvironments where intensivists are in short supply.\n  Finally, to address the supply problem, the bill would allow for the \nNational Health Service Corps to support and encourage critical care \nproviders to practice in medically underserved areas.\n  The Patient-Focused Critical Care Enhancement Act is strongly \nendorsed by the key medical specialty societies and patient groups \ninvolved in critical care medicine, including the American College of \nChest Physicians, the American Thoracic Society, the Society for \nCritical Care Medicine, the Association of Critical Care Nurses and the \nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Foundation.\n  This multipronged approach is to look at both short term and long \nterm solutions to a growing concern. But in today's complex healthcare \nsituation, multiple solutions are a necessity. We do not want to face \nthis shortage in the future in a direr situation as the nursing \nshortage currently is.\n  The answer to the opening question is simple. We must not hold off \nfor tomorrow what we can do today, and we must not wait for our \nhealthcare crisis to worsen. Our country will face a critical care \nworkforce shortage. I want my family to have access to the best quality \ncare when they need it, and this includes having access to a critical \ncare doctor. Passage of the Patient-Focused Critical Care Enhancement \nAct is a step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 718\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Patient-Focused Critical \n     Care Enhancement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to optimize the delivery of \n     critical care medicine and expand the critical care \n     workforce.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Based on the Health Resources and Services Administration's \n     May 2006 Report to Congress, The Critical Care Workforce: A \n     Study of the Supply and Demand for Critical Care Physicians, \n     the Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 2000, an estimated 18,000,000 inpatient days of ICU \n     care were provided in the United States through approximately \n     59,000 ICU beds in 3,200 hospitals.\n       (2) Patient outcomes and the quality of care in the ICU are \n     related to who delivers that care and how care is organized.\n       (3) The demand in the United States for critical care \n     medical services is rising sharply and will continue to rise \n     sharply largely as a result of the following 3 factors:\n       (A) There is strong evidence demonstrating improvements in \n     outcomes and efficiency when intensive care services are \n     provided by nurses and intensivist physicians who have \n     advanced specialty training in critical care medicine.\n       (B) The Leapfrog Group, health care payors, and providers \n     are encouraging greater use of such personnel in intensive \n     care settings.\n       (C) Critical care services are overwhelmingly consumed by \n     patients over the age of 65 and the aging of the United \n     States population is driving demand for these services.\n       (4) The future growth in the number of critical care \n     physicians in ICU settings will be insufficient to keep pace \n     with growing demand.\n       (5) This growing shortage of critical care physicians \n     presents a serious threat to the quality and availability of \n     health care services in the United States.\n       (6) This shortage will disproportionately impact rural and \n     other areas of the United States that already often suffer \n     from a suboptimal level of critical care services.\n\n     SEC. 4. RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services, through the Agency for Healthcare Research and \n     Quality, shall conduct research to assess--\n       (1) the standardization of critical care protocols, \n     intensive care unit layout, equipment interoperability, and \n     medical informatics;\n       (2) the impact of differences in staffing, organization, \n     size, and structure of intensive care units on access, \n     quality, and efficiency of care; and\n       (3) coordinated community and regional approaches to \n     providing critical care services, including approaches \n     whereby critical care patients are assessed and provided care \n     based upon intensity of services required.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Agency for Healthcare Research and \n     Quality shall submit a report to Congress, that, based on the \n     review under subsection (a), evaluates and makes \n     recommendations regarding best practices in critical care \n     medicine.\n\n     SEC. 5. INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO CRITICAL CARE SERVICES.\n\n       The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall undertake \n     the following demonstration projects:\n       (1) Optimization of critical care services.--\n\n[[Page S2371]]\n\n       (A) In general.--The Administrator of the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services shall solicit proposals \n     submitted by inpatient providers of critical care services \n     who propose to demonstrate methods to optimize the provision \n     of critical care services to Medicare beneficiaries through \n     innovations in such areas as staffing, ICU arrangement, and \n     utilization of technology.\n       (B) Funding of proposals.--The Administrator of the Centers \n     for Medicare & Medicaid Services shall fund not more than 5 \n     proposals, not less than 1 of which shall focus on the \n     training of hospital-based physicians in rural or community, \n     or both, hospital facilities in the provision of critical \n     care medicine. Such projects shall emphasize outcome measures \n     based on the Institute of Medicine's following 6 domains of \n     quality care:\n       (i) Care should be safe.\n       (ii) Care should be effective.\n       (iii) Care should be patient-centered.\n       (iv) Care should be timely.\n       (v) Care should be efficient.\n       (vi) Care should be equitable.\n       (2) Family assistance programs for the critically ill.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall solicit proposals and make an award to support a \n     consortium consisting of 1 or more providers of inpatient \n     critical care services and a medical specialty society \n     involved in the education and training of critical care \n     providers.\n       (B) Measurement and evaluation.--A provider that receives \n     support under subparagraph (A) shall measure and evaluate \n     outcomes derived from a ``family-centered'' approach to the \n     provision of inpatient critical care services that includes \n     direct and sustained communication and contact with \n     beneficiary family members, involvement of family members in \n     the critical care decisionmaking process, and responsiveness \n     of critical care providers to family requests. Such project \n     shall evaluate the impact of a family-centered, \n     multiprofessional team approach on, and the correlation \n     between--\n       (i) family satisfaction;\n       (ii) staff satisfaction;\n       (iii) length of patient stay in an intensive care unit; and\n       (iv) cost of care.\n       (C) Outcome measures.--A provider that receives support \n     under subparagraph (A) shall emphasize outcome measures based \n     on the Institute of Medicine's following 6 domains of quality \n     care:\n       (i) Care should be safe.\n       (ii) Care should be effective.\n       (iii) Care should be patient-centered.\n       (iv) Care should be timely.\n       (v) Care should be efficient.\n       (vi) Care should be equitable.\n\n     SEC. 6.

A bill to amend section 10501 of title 49, United States \nCode, to exclude solid waste disposal from the jurisdiction of the \nSurface Transportation Board; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to re-introduce \nlegislation that will close an egregious loophole in federal law. \nCurrently, this loophole permits solid waste management facilities \noperated near railroads to go unregulated--free from meeting any \nminimum level of safety, health, and environmental standards. \nBasically, this loophole prevents state or local law from regulating \nthe operation of these facilities on property owned or controlled by \nrailroads.\n  In fact, just last week, a United States District Court judge \ndeclared this loophole alive and well. By shutting down the State of \nNew Jersey's efforts to regulate solid waste rail facilities, this \nruling allows the continuing proliferation of these unregulated \nfacilities--which are already spreading quickly throughout the \nNortheast United States.\n  These unregulated facilities present an imminent threat to public \nhealth and the environment. My bill, the Clean Railroads Act of 2007, \nwill close this loophole once and for all. Almost 2 years ago, I first \nintroduced legislation to address this problem, and I renew that effort \ntoday.\n  This problem could easily be solved by proper interpretation of \ncurrent federal law. Such an interpretation could be made by the \nfederal Surface Transportation Board (STB), an independent board \ncharged with economic regulation of railroads. However, despite several \nopportunities, the STB has chosen not to define a clear position on \nthis issue. I have urged the Board members to address this problem, as \nthe loophole in federal law has allowed even more of these unregulated \nfacilities to operate.\n  Last week's court ruling has highlighted the need to find a solution \nto this problem immediately, and my bill would do just that.\n  Let me be clear that my concern is not the transport of solid waste \nby rail. Railroads provide a vital role in commerce in the United \nStates and the benefits of rail transportation are numerous, as we in \nNew Jersey know. Further, the transportation of waste via rail is not \nat issue here, and I am not opposed to the operation of solid waste \nmanagement facilities on property owned or controlled by railroads.\n  My chief concern is the lawful management of solid waste facilities. \nIf a solid waste management facility is to be operated on rail \nproperty, it must be regulated like any other such facility. That is \nnot happening today.\n  The threats posed by unregulated waste management facilities \noperating on property owned or controlled by railroads are so great \nthat a broad and diverse coalition of public and private sector \nentities have been formed to oppose these rogue operations. I thank \nthese coalition members for their continued efforts, and will be \nlooking forward to the day in which their fears over this issue can be \npermanently assuaged.\n  Responsible management of solid waste requires safeguards to protect \npublic health and the environment. As Chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee's Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine \nInfrastructure, Safety, and Security, which has jurisdiction over \nrailroads and the Surface Transportation Board, I will work to ensure \nthis loophole does not continue to let the hazards of unregulated solid \nwaste rail facilities affect the lives of New Jerseyans and other \nAmericans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 719\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor an \nextraordinary man, a dedicated public servant, and, now, the Governor \nof my home State, Massachusetts: Deval Patrick. It is particularly \nfitting that we honor Deval today--during Black History Month--because \nnot only is Deval an outstanding choice to lead our State, but he is \nonly the second African American to be elected governor in American \nHistory.\n  Think about that: the second African American to be elected governor \nin any of the 50 States of our great Nation. That is pretty amazing. \nBut what is more amazing is that the people of Massachusetts did not \nelect him because they wanted to make history, they elected him because \nthey knew he was the best man for the job. They recognized that \n``Together We Can'' was more than just a catchy campaign slogan--it's a \nphilosophy about how to treat people and how to lead them. And it \nembodies the kind of leadership our State and our Nation are crying out \nfor at this time.\n  Throughout his entire life, Deval Patrick has been pushing the \nenvelope, striving to achieve what many thought was impossible, \novercoming obstacles that might have made others of lesser conviction \nor determination turn back. After all, this is a man who went from the \nSouth Side of Chicago to the Harvard Law Review.\n  This is a man who was elected President of the Legal Aid Bureau while \nattending Harvard Law School and who defended poor families in \nMiddlesex County, MA prior to graduation. Let me tell you something, I \nattended law school, and I worked in the DA's office prior to my \ngraduation. It is no easy task to balance these competing demands, to \nwork with families day in and day out on issues that their lives depend \non. It is a truly remarkable achievement.\n  Yet, Deval's commitment to public service did not end there. In fact, \nit was just beginning. Deval went on to spend many successful years at \nthe NAACP Legal Defense Fund, devoting his efforts to discrimination \nand voting rights cases. Then, after serving as a Partner at the Boston \nlaw firm of Hill & Barlow, he was appointed Assistant Attorney General \nfor Civil Rights by President Bill Clinton.\n  At the Justice Department, Deval served with distinction in this--the \nNation's top civil rights post--investigating church burnings, \nprosecuting hate crimes and abortion clinic violence; holding public \nemployers accountable for job discrimination; ensuring access to \nhousing free of discrimination; protecting the right to vote; and \nenforcing the Americans with Disabilities Act, and other important \ncivil rights laws.\n  During his time at Justice, Deval proved that he would fight for \njustice, that he would fight for individual rights, and that he was not \nafraid to hold people accountable, even if others found it politically \ndifficult or distasteful.\n  These are just a few of Deval Patrick's tremendous career \naccomplishments that lead him to this point in time as my state's \nnewest Governor.\n  For generations, too many young Americans have grown up with a \ngnawing sense of doubt: that maybe the best that America has to offer \ndoesn't really apply to them. That's why I am so happy that a \ngeneration of children will see men like Deval Patrick in great \npositions of leadership. And it is my great hope that positive examples \nlike his will lead a new generation of people of color to push this \ncountry to ever greater heights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/28/senate-section/article/S2372-2", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2372-S2378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 89--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY COMMITTEES OF THE \n SENATE FOR THE PERIODS MARCH 1, 2007, THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2007, AND \n   OCTOBER 1, 2007, THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2008, AND OCTOBER 1, 2008, \n                       THROUGH FEBRUARY 28, 2009\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN submitted the following resolution; from the Committee \non Rules and Administration; which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                               S.

Con. Res. 14\n\n       Whereas the American Hellenic Educational Progressive \n     Association (AHEPA) was founded on July 26, 1922, in Atlanta, \n     Georgia, by 8 visionary Greek immigrants to help unify, \n     organize, and protect against the bigotry, discrimination, \n     and defamation faced by people of all ethnic, racial, and \n     religious backgrounds perpetrated predominantly by the Ku \n     Klux Klan;\n       Whereas the mission of AHEPA is to promote the ideals of \n     ancient Greece, which include philanthropy, education, civic \n     responsibility, and family and individual excellence through \n     community service and volunteerism;\n       Whereas, since its inception, AHEPA has instilled in its \n     members an understanding of their Hellenic heritage and an \n     awareness of the contributions made by Greece to the \n     development of democratic principles and governance in the \n     United States and throughout the world;\n       Whereas AHEPA has done much throughout its history to \n     foster patriotism in the United States;\n       Whereas members of AHEPA have served in the Armed Forces to \n     protect the freedom of the United States and to preserve the \n     democratic ideals that are part of the Hellenic legacy;\n       Whereas, in World War II, members of AHEPA were parachuted \n     behind enemy lines in Nazi-occupied Greece to help liberate \n     the country;\n       Whereas AHEPA raised more than $253,000,000 for United \n     States war bonds during World War II, for which AHEPA was \n     named an official Issuing Agent for United States War Bonds \n     by the Department of Treasury, an honor that no other civic \n     organization was able to achieve at the time;\n       Whereas the members of AHEPA donated $612,000 for the \n     restoration of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, New \n     York, for which AHEPA received special recognition by the \n     Department of the Interior;\n       Whereas the AHEPA National Housing Program was awarded \n     $500,000,000 by the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development for its Section 202 Program, which has yielded \n     4,370 units in 80 properties across 21 States and 49 cities \n     and has provided dignified, affordable housing to senior \n     citizens;\n       Whereas AHEPA was recognized by the Department of State as \n     an organization that has engaged in ``Track Two Diplomacy'' \n     to foster reconciliation and rapprochement in the Eastern \n     Mediterranean, which is in the best interest of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas members of AHEPA raised $110,000 for the George C. \n     Marshall Statue to be erected on the grounds of the United \n     States Embassy in Athens, Greece, in celebration of the \n     historic relationship between the United States and Greece, \n     and in tribute to an outstanding statesman and Philhellene, \n     General Marshall;\n       Whereas AHEPA financially supports scholarships, \n     educational chairs, medical research, and countless other \n     charitable and philanthropic causes by contributing more than \n     $2,000,000 annually from its national, district, and local \n     levels collectively;\n       Whereas, in the spirit of their Hellenic heritage and in \n     commemoration of the Centennial Olympic Games held in \n     Atlanta, Georgia, members of AHEPA raised $775,000 for the \n     Tribute to Olympism Sculpture, the fan-like structure of \n     which helped to save lives during the bombing at Centennial \n     Olympic Park;\n       Whereas members of AHEPA have been Presidents and Vice \n     Presidents of the United States, United States Senators and \n     Representatives, and United States Ambassadors, and have \n     served honorably as elected officials at the local and State \n     levels throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas President George H.W. Bush cited AHEPA as one of \n     the ``thousand points of light'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the significant contributions of United \n     States citizens of Hellenic heritage to the United States;\n       (2) commemorates the 85th anniversary of the founding of \n     the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association \n     (AHEPA), applauds its mission, and commends the\n\n[[Page S2379]]\n\n     many charitable contributions of its members to communities \n     around the world; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the 85th anniversary of the founding of AHEPA and celebrate \n     its many accomplishments.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this year marks the 85th anniversary of the \nfounding of the American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, \nAHEPA. I rise today to submit with my colleague, Senator Menendez, a \nconcurrent resolution honoring AHEPA's history of service, not only to \nAmericans of Greek descent, but to Americans of all backgrounds and to \nthe United States itself.\n  AHEPA was founded in 1922 to combat the bigotry encountered by Greek \nimmigrants to this country, and to assist these new Americans with \nbuilding and protecting their livelihoods in our great Nation. Eighty-\nfive years later--decades in which generations of Greek-Americans \nworked tirelessly in commerce and fought patriotically on the \nbattlefield to make the United States the prosperous and peaceful land \nit is today--AHEPA continues its mission to promote the shared Hellenic \nand American values of education, philanthropy, civic responsibility, \nand family and individual excellence.\n  This is more than a mission statement, it is a commitment to action \nthat has been fulfilled time and again. AHEPA today awards more than \nhalf a million dollars in academic scholarships annually. Its \nphilanthropic efforts have contributed to the restoration of the Statue \nof Liberty and Ellis Island. It has enhanced the civic participation of \nits members and other U.S. citizens through seminars and conferences on \nkey domestic and international policy issues. And, together with three \naffiliated organizations--the Daughters of Penelope, the Sons of \nPericles and the Maids of Athena--AHEPA has contributed to over a \nbillion dollars in funding for youth- and family-focused projects \nacross the country.\n  As the first Greek-American woman elected to both the House and \nSenate, I am often reminded that the connection between the U.S. \nCongress and the Greek people is not limited to the Greek Americans who \nhave served as members, or the foreign policy issues debated in its \nhalls. Rather, the very inspiration for the Congress as a legislative \nbody are the democratic chambers of ancient Greece.\n  The myriad ties between our two countries--be they cultural, economic \nor geopolitical--comprise a bond that can and should only strengthen. \nAHEPA's long record of service to Greek-Americans and their countrymen \nare both a testament and critical component of that historical bond. It \nis accordingly an honor and a pleasure to submit this concurrent \nresolution recognizing the accomplishments of AHEPA's first 85 years. \nMay there be many, many more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/02/28/senate-section/article/S2379-1", "month": "02", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 271.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Relief Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region\n\n     SEC. __03.
