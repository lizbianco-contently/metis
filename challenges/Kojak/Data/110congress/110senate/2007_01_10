Mr. President, yesterday, we made significant progress on \nthe ethics and lobbying reform bill. This will go a long way toward \nhelping to reduce cynicism about this body. We began debate on the \nbill. The Republican leader and I offered a strong substitute amendment \nthat made numerous important improvements to the underlying bill. And \nthen I offered an amendment to strengthen the bill even further. Then \nwe have had a number of other Senators come to the floor and make \nstatements, offer amendments. And I think that is certainly \nappropriate.\n  Mr. President, I do emphasize this morning this is not a campaign \nfinance reform bill. My personal feeling is campaign finance reform \nneeds a very close going over. We need to hold extensive hearings on \nthis issue. There are a lot of very complicated issues dealing with \ncampaign finance reform, some of which deal with not only the Rules \nCommittee but the Finance Committee because there are tax implications. \nI respectfully submit to my colleagues--both in the majority and \nminority--this is not the place to do rifle shots on campaign finance \nreform. I was a real cynic in the past about doing anything with, for \nexample, 527s. I now think we have to take a look at a lot of these \ncampaign finance issues, including 527s. But it has to be done in a \nthoughtful, probative way. I hope we can do that.\n  This is not a campaign finance bill. Campaign finance is an important \nissue, and we are going to have a full consideration of campaign \nfinance in this Congress. But this bill is not the place for those \namendments.\n  I look forward to Senators continuing to offer amendments today and \nhope we can make more progress in the coming days to wrap up this bill \nnext week. We will wrap up the bill next week, even if it is a long \nweek. If things slow down or there appears to be some stalling, I will \nhave to see if cloture is the only alternative, which it might be. But \nfor now let's keep moving forward. I have had people come to me and say \nthey have some amendments to offer. I think that is very important. \nThis is an open process. People should be able to do that.\n  We are going to be in a period of morning business for an hour, as \nsoon as I and the Republican leader sit down. The majority will control \nthe first half hour and the minority will control the last half hour. \nOnce morning business closes, the Senate will resume the consideration \nof the ethics bill.\n  As I have said, there are a number of amendments pending. And as I \nhave indicated, there are other Members who are interested in offering \namendments today. I hope we will be in a position later this morning to \ntake action on some of these pending amendments. The managers have \nexpressed their desire to work with Members in regard to these two \namendments.\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\n  The two managers of this bill are two of our finest. Senator \nFeinstein in the past has managed bills as a member of the \nAppropriations Committee. Senator Bennett is someone who has a great \nknowledge of Senate procedures. He is, in my opinion, a Senator's \nSenator. He does such a good job in everything he is involved in. We \nhave two very good, thoughtful managers of this bill. If anyone can \nmove this forward, I know the two of them can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S314-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to say to my good friend, \nthe majority leader, I share his view that we ought to make progress on \nthis bill. There are a number of amendments already pending. We will be \nworking together during the course of the morning to get some votes \nscheduled. I share his view that we ought to finish this bill next \nweek. So we will be going forward in a cooperative frame of mind.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It has bipartisan support, \nas illustrated by the fact that the majority leader and myself are \ncosponsors of the substitute he offered yesterday. This is a piece of \nlegislation that ought to be passed and ought to be passed soon in the \nSenate and will be done with a broad bipartisan basis of support.\n  So I look forward to working with my friend during the course of the \nday to get votes in the queue so we can move forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say one thing before the \nRepublican leader leaves. I want everyone to hear what I said before. \nThe first measure Senator McConnell and I introduced, S. 1, will be the \nmost significant lobbying and ethics reform bill since Watergate, if \nnothing else happens. And then we went a step further and, on a \nbipartisan basis, offered the substitute amendment which moves the ball \ndown the field by a long way.\n  This bill is significant, and if nothing else happens other than S. 1 \nand the substitute, this will be a tremendously important piece of \nlegislation in the annals of the history of this country. We have a lot \nof other people who want to improve the bill in their mind, and that is \nwhat this amendment process is all about. But we cannot lose sight of \nthe fact that this is a significant move forward in ethics and lobbying \nreform with the two measures that have been put forward on a bipartisan \nbasis. We have done already, some good work for the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I might add, I agree with everything \nthe majority leader said. This substitute is essentially what passed \nthe Senate last year 90 to 8. The Senate is ready to act or close to \nready to finish this important piece of legislation. We were last year. \nIt was bogged down in the legislative process in dealing with the other \nbody. But we are going to pass this next week with an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote. And the majority leader and I will be working together \nto make that possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S314-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, tonight President Bush will address our \nNation. The subject is one that is on the minds of virtually every \nAmerican. It is Iraq. According to the accounts in the press, President \nBush will be announcing that he will be increasing the number of U.S. \nforces in Iraq, perhaps by 20,000 troops.\n  If these news accounts are correct, that means an additional 20,000 \nAmerican service men and women will be sent into harm's way or ordered \nto remain there for longer tours of duty.\n  This morning on television, on CNN, they interviewed the families of \nsome soldiers who are now headed for their third tour of duty. There \nwas a sad, heartbreaking interview with a mother--her two small \nchildren nearby, and her soldier husband sitting just a chair away. She \nsaid she could not be prouder of her husband. She considered him a hero \nand a brave man and that he would answer the call of duty whenever. But \nshe said, in her words: It is just so frustrating trying to raise this \nfamily with my husband being called to duty over and over and over \nagain.\n\n  Our hearts go out to those families. Our prayers are with them and \nthe troops as this decision is made to escalate this war in Iraq, to \nraise the number of troops from 144,000 to possibly 164,000 or higher.\n  These troops follow these orders because they are the best and the \nbravest. They march off to war, risk their lives, away from those they \nlove because they are sworn to protect this great Nation. We can never \nthank them enough for what they are doing. Every moment of debate that \nwe have on the floor of this Senate about the policy of our Government \ntoward Iraq should not diminish nor detract from our great debt of \ngratitude to these men and women and their families.\n  I will be joining a number of my colleagues this afternoon as we sit \nwith the President for a final briefing before his decision. Sadly, I \nam afraid that decision has already been made. It is the wrong \ndecision. For reasons I do not understand, President Bush has reversed \na position which he took early on. His position was that he would heed \nthe advice and counsel of the men and women in uniform, of the generals \nin the field, of those who were in command and could see the actual \nbattle on a day-to-day basis. The President told us, over and over \nagain, he would only dispatch as many troops as they asked for. But \nclearly that has changed.\n  General Abizaid, who was the leader, the commanding general of \nCENTCOM, who oversaw Iraq and Afghanistan, told us in November he saw \nno reason for more U.S. troops. Let me read what General Abizaid said \nin testimony before Congress just weeks ago:\n\n       I met with every divisional commander, General Casey, the \n     core commander, General Dempsey. We all talked together. And \n     I said, in your professional opinion, if we were to bring in \n     more American troops now, does it add considerably to our \n     ability to achieve success in Iraq?\n\n  General Abizaid went on to say:\n\n       And they all said no. And the reason is, because we want \n     the Iraqis to do more. It's easy for the Iraqis to rely upon \n     us to do this work.\n\n  General Abizaid said:\n\n       I believe that more American forces prevent the Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking more responsibility for their own \n     future.\n\n  Those are the words of the commanding general in Iraq a few weeks \nago. Those were words which the President told the American people \nrepeatedly would be his guidance in making decisions about whether to \nsend more troops into battle. Those are words which the President \ntonight will ignore and reject.\n  There is a sad reality. The sad reality is this: 20,000 American \nsoldiers, too few to end this civil war in Iraq; too many American \nsoldiers to lose. I do not understand the President's logic. I do not \nunderstand how 20,000 troops could significantly make any difference.\n  Will there be a time line for these troops? If this is, in effect, a \nsurge, as the White House has characterized it over and over again, is \nit temporary in nature? Well, if it is a surge that is temporary in \nnature, it betrays another position taken by the White House. How many \ntimes have we been told we cannot talk about an orderly\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\nwithdrawal from Iraq or redeployment? How many times have we been told \nwe do not talk about when we are going to bring American soldiers home \nfor fear the enemy in Iraq will wait us out?\n  If this increase and escalation of troops is temporary in nature, \nthen it betrays the argument which the White House has made now for \nyears. If we are going to add 20,000 troops, how can we guarantee that \nthe enemy will not ``wait us out''?\n  I find it hard to follow the President's logic. I don't understand \nwhy he believes 20,000 troops will change the complexion of a civil \nwar. I certainly don't understand how sending troops in on a temporary \nbasis is going to result in anything of a positive nature. Army Chief \nof Staff Peter Schoomaker said:\n\n       We should not surge without a purpose and that purpose \n     should be measurable.\n\n  What is the purpose? How will it be measured, and what is the \ntimeline for completion? When does the President expect these troops \nand the 144,000 other American troops currently in Iraq to return home? \nThe President may not want to use the word ``escalation,'' but that is \nthe word that fits because if he is going to increase the number of \ntroops, increase the danger to our soldiers, it is an escalation of \nthis war. Like Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, President Bush \nis saying that he is sending more troops because conditions on the \nground demand it.\n  In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson said:\n\n       Our numbers have increased in Vietnam because the \n     aggression of others has increased in Vietnam. There is not, \n     and there will not be, a mindless escalation.\n\n  But that escalation was followed by many others because American \nPresidents were trying to win someone else's civil war and because they \nwere refusing to recognize the fundamental reality.\n  It is that the Iraqis, if we send in 20,000 more troops, will assign \n20,000 troops or more to match. I suggest that that is a departure from \nwhat we have heard from this White House. Every schoolchild in America \ncan recite the mantra: As they stand up, we will stand down. We have \nheard this over and over and over again. The suggestion that, as the \nIraqi soldiers stand up and take responsibility, American soldiers can \ncome home, that has been the promise. But if this is the bargain today, \n20,000 American troops to generate 20,000 Iraqi troops, then we have \nchanged the mantra. The mantra now is, as American troops stand up, \nIraqi troops will stand up. If that is, in fact, the new policy, how \ncan there ever be any end in sight?\n  We understand the reality. After almost 4 years, in a war that has \nlasted longer than World War II, we understand that we cannot win on a \nmilitary basis. The President said it. Secretaries of Defense have said \nit. The generals in the field have said it. The Iraq war can only be \nstabilized and won on a political and economic basis. And to start \nwith, we must disband the militias. The notion that leaders like Sadr \ncan create a militia, a death squad, which can roam the streets of \nBaghdad and the roads of Iraq with impunity, suggests that there will \nbe no stability and no security under these circumstances. The simple \nfact is, there is no sharing of power.\n  When I visited Iraq the second time a few weeks ago with Senator Jack \nReed of Rhode Island, we visited ministries which provide services \nalmost exclusively to one religious sect. The health ministry, under \nthe control of Mr. Sadr, is a ministry which provides few if any \nservices to Sunnis. The Sunni population, which is about a third of the \npopulation of Iraq, doesn't get the hospitals and doctors. This \nministry just helps Shias.\n  I also talked to some people in the field. I said: When it comes to \npolice protection, how does that work?\n  Well, if you go into Baghdad and go into the police station, you will \nquickly learn whether it is a Shia or Sunni police station. Shia police \ndon't arrest Shia civilians, and Sunni police don't arrest Sunni \ncivilians. That is how badly fractured the society of Iraq is today. Is \nthere anyone who believes that 20,000 American troops will change that? \nThat decision has to be made by that Government's leaders to change \nIraq and move it toward a nation and away from warring factions.\n  Some are skeptical. They argue that this division in Islam is 14 \ncenturies old, and it is naive for westerners such as Americans and the \nBrits to believe that the arrival of the best troops in the world is \nsomehow going to quell the flames of this battle that has gone on for \ncenturies. It certainly isn't. It isn't going to change the \ncircumstance without new political leadership. We need to establish \ncivil order in Iraq. We need to make certain that we have leadership in \nthis government that makes hard decisions that moves it toward a true \nnation. That is the answer to the stability of Iraq, not 20,000 \nAmerican soldiers and marines, sailors, and airmen who are now going to \nadd to the ranks of those who risk their lives every day.\n  It is time for the President to also be honest with the American \npeople about the cost of this war. As of this morning, 3,015 American \ntroops have died in Iraq; 7 times that number have come home disabled, \nmaimed, blinded, suffering amputations and traumatic brain injury. That \nis the human legacy which is the paramount concern we all have.\n  There has also been another legacy of cost, almost $2 billion a week \nthat we are spending in the war on Iraq, money taken out of the United \nStates and away from the very real needs of our Nation being spent over \nthere. Yet here in the fourth year of this war, less electricity is \nbeing generated in Iraq than on the day we invaded. There is an \nopportunity for us to provide drinking water, but it, unfortunately, \nhasn't been successful, despite 4 years of effort. Sewage facilities, \njobs, the most basic things, the most basic services by which you judge \na society, those measurements tell us that we have failed to produce in \nIraq as promised.\n\n  That is the reality, despite some $380 to $400 billion having been \nspent by the United States in the 4 years we have been involved in this \nwar. Now the administration is preparing another supplemental request. \nI read in the papers this morning that they are going to try to keep it \nunder $100 billion. They come in and call this war an unanticipated \nemergency appropriation. We are now in the fourth year of unanticipated \nemergency appropriations. Sadly, every dollar we are spending in Iraq \nis a dollar not spent in America and a dollar of debt left to our \nchildren.\n  This President is the first President in the history of the United \nStates, despite all the conflicts Presidents have faced, to call for a \ntax cut in the midst of a war, making our deficit situation even worse. \nThe President needs to be much more honest with the American people in \nterms of the real cost of this war.\n  Let's speak for a moment about the state of our military. Again, they \nare the best and bravest in the world. Meeting with them on my recent \ntrip, I left with pride that they would put on the uniform and risk \ntheir lives for our country. But our military has paid a heavy price, \nnot just in the deaths and casualties but in the fact that they have \nlost combat readiness, equipment. They have been weakened in a world \nwhere we can't afford to be weak. This President refuses to replenish \nthe troops as needed. Our National Guard units in Illinois and across \nthe Nation have about one-third of the equipment they need to respond \nto a domestic crisis or if activated again in Iraq. There is little or \nno effort to replenish these troops as they must be. We struggle, \noffering bonuses and incentives to bring in more recruits and retain \nthose who are currently serving, understanding that our ranks are \nthinning because we have asked so much of these men and women who serve \nus.\n  General Abizaid told the Senate Armed Services Committee in November \nthat the military does not have the capacity to maintain an additional \n20,000 soldiers and marines in Iraq. It will be interesting to see how \nthe President suggests we find these soldiers and marines that he now \nwants to send over in the escalation of this war.\n  General Abizaid said:\n\n       The ability to sustain that commitment is simply not \n     something we have right now with the size of the Army and the \n     Marine Corps.\n\n  That was the general's testimony just a few weeks ago. Yet the \nPresident has decided to ignore the general's statement and to call for \nmore troops. I don't doubt the Pentagon can find somewhere to get \nadditional troops, extending the tours of duty of those who\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\nare currently there, for example; and I don't doubt that our brave men \nand women will bear this ever-increasing burden. But I ask, at what \ncost to our Nation, at what cost to its families?\n  We have to ask as well: How does sending more troops represent the \nchange in direction so clearly called for by the American people when \nthey voted this last November? Tragically, this idea of escalating the \nwar is more of the same. Tonight I expect the President to use the word \n``change'' repeatedly, but I have seen little to give me hope that he \nwill actually implement change or a new direction in our policy in \nIraq.\n  I want Congress and the American people to finally ask the hard \nquestions. For the 4 years of this war, this Congress has been supine. \nIt has refused to stand up and accept its constitutional responsibility \nto hold this administration, as it should hold every administration, \naccountable for its conduct and spending. That is why I am heartened to \nknow that even this week, we will have our first hearings before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, hearings by Chairman Levin and Chairman Biden, in an effort \nto ask some of the hard questions about the policies we have in Iraq.\n  This line of inquiry is long overdue. Simple things need to be asked. \nFirst, some accountability when it comes to the money that is being \nspent. We have all heard about the abuses, the profiteering. It doesn't \nmake America any safer or help our troops at all. It pads the bottom \nline for private companies, many of whom benefit from no-bid contracts, \nbut it doesn't make us any safer. We need to hold the Department of \nDefense accountable, to make sure that taxpayers' money is well spent, \nto make sure that the money being spent for our troops is, in fact, \nproviding them with the best equipment and everything that was \npromised. That inquiry is long overdue.\n  We are also, of course, going to face the reality that this civil war \nin Iraq is getting worse and not better. When 3,000 civilians die in \nthe course of a month, it is an indication of a society that is out of \ncontrol.\n  We will soon be approaching the fourth anniversary of the invasion. I \ncan remember when the vote was cast on the floor of the Senate. It was \nlate at night. It was a week or two before the election. Several of us \nwho had voted against this use of force because of our serious concerns \ndidn't know, of course, what it would mean in the next election or how \nthis would play out ultimately.\n  We stand here today, some 4 years later after that vote, and realize \nthat this decision to invade Iraq was the most serious strategic \nmistake in foreign policy made by this country in the last four \ndecades. One has to go back to the decision in Vietnam to continue to \nescalate that conflict, long after we had any prospect of success or \nvictory, to find an analogy in recent memory.\n  The time came under President Gerald Ford when he faced the reality \nof Vietnam. It is time for President Bush to face the reality of Iraq. \nThe reality is this: America has paid a heavy price. We have paid with \nAmerican blood. We have paid with American sacrifice. We have paid with \nAmerican treasure. We have given the Iraqis so much. We have deposed \ntheir dictator. We put him on trial. He will no longer be on the scene \nin any way, shape, or form since his execution. We have given them a \nchance to draft their own constitution, hold their own free elections, \nestablish their own government. We have protected them when no one else \nwould. America has done everything promised in Iraq. The reality, \nthough, is we have done what we can do. Now it is up to the Iraqis. It \nis up to them to stand and defend their own country.\n  Sending in 20,000 more troops at this moment says to the Iraqis: \nDon't worry. America will always be there to bear the brunt of battle \nso that Iraqis don't have to.\n  That is not the right approach. The best approach is for us to start \nredeploying our troops on a systematic basis so that the Iraqis know \nthat it is their responsibility and their country that they must stand \nand defend. It is time for us not to send more American troops into \ndanger but to bring American troops out of danger and back home. That \nneeds to start and start immediately.\n  Instead of the President's escalation of the war within the next 6 \nmonths, we should begin to redeploy our troops so that it truly becomes \nan Iraqi effort to create an Iraqi nation. Our end goal, as the Baker-\nHamilton Iraq Study Group showed us, should be redeployment, \nrepositioning of the majority of our forces by the first quarter of \n2008. Escalation is not a blueprint for success. It is a roadmap to \nwhere we have already been.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have been wondering what the specific position of the \nDemocratic leadership was on the other side of the aisle relative to \nIraq. If I understand it correctly, it is that we should redeploy--\nwhich, I presume, is a euphemism for withdraw--is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The redeployment would take the troops out of Iraq and, \nperhaps, position them in a nearby country. We would still be involved \nin trade, still be involved in hunting down al-Qaida forces and trying \nto stop terrorism. Yes, our feeling is--and I think the Senate vote on \nthis--we should begin redeploying troops on a 4-to-6-month basis.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I may use the term withdraw, I have \nheard the term withdraw being used, but apparently it doesn't mean the \ntroops would be coming out of Iraq. The Senator further suggested that \nthat should be done immediately, is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Our feeling is that we could not do it immediately. The \nBaker-Hamilton study group suggested that we would basically redeploy \nour troops over a 15-month basis. That would suggest an orderly \nmovement of troops of maybe 10,000 a month. But if you did it \nprecipitously, it would create a danger for our troops and an \ninstability. I think if we had an orderly redeployment, withdrawal, the \nIraqis would get the message that they have to step in as American \ntroops are redeployed.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator used the term ``immediately'' in his \nstatement. That is why I wanted to clarify that. So we should withdraw \nover the horizon, i.e., redeploy, the Senator said, and that withdrawal \nshould be at a pace of about 10,000 troops per month, and that process \nshould begin immediately, I guess, and that it would be completed \nwithin 18 months, being the first quarter of 2008. Is that basically \nthe specifics of how the Senator would approach the situation on the \nground?\n  Mr. DURBIN. What I described to you is the Baker-Hamilton proposal. I \ndid make exceptions for leaving troops there for training purposes and \nfor hunting down al-Qaida terrorists, those specific circumstances. My \nfeeling is that over a 4-to-6-month basis, we need to establish \ntimelines so our troops could start moving away from Iraq and the \nIraqis can step in. I use 10,000 a month because that is the way the \nmath works if you follow Baker-Hamilton. It could be zero troops \nwithdrawn or redeployed in the first 60 days, and 20,000 or 30,000 at \nsome future time.\n  My personal belief is that until the Iraqis understand that we are \nleaving, they will not accept the responsibility to defend their own \ngovernment and country, and they won't make the hard political \ndecisions to put an end to the civil war.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the specifics from the assistant leader. I \nhave not heard specifics from the other side of the aisle. I think it \nis constructive.\n  Can I continue to ask the question, however, to get a sense of what \nthe specific proposals are from the other side. The President is going \nto send up a supplemental estimated to be over $100 billion. We have \nalready had one of approximately $70 billion. So we are talking of a \ntotal supplemental of $170 billion. This additional supplemental would \nbe, I presume, to cover what is being represented in the press as \npotentially a surge in troops and additional spending of significant \ndollars for reconstruction. Is it the position of the Senator that that \n$100 billion is more money than needs to be spent? In other words, if \nthe proposal of the Senator, which is a withdrawal over the horizon, to \nbegin over the next 2 or 3 months, accelerated to the point where it \nwas completed by the beginning of 2008, averaging about 10,000 people \nper month--is it therefore the Senator's position that if you pursue \nthat course\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\nof action, you would not need $100 billion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't serve on the Armed Services Committee, but it is \nmy guess that redeploying troops is also a very expensive endeavor--\nmaybe as expensive as deploying them and holding a position. So I don't \nknow if there will be a savings if there is a redeployment. Although I \nvoted against the use of force resolution that led to the invasion, I \nvoted for every penny this administration asked for for the troops. I \nbelieve--and I think my fellow colleagues on the Democratic side, and I \nam sure on the Republican side--that they don't want to shortchange the \ntroops either as they stay in Iraq or if they are redeployed from Iraq. \nI would judge the supplemental under those circumstances. What will it \ncost to redeploy them safely?\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator; he is always forthright. I will ask a \nfollowup question. Does the Senator believe this supplemental that is \ncoming up, as I believe, should go through the regular order rather \nthan being declared an emergency and have authorization language, or go \nthrough the authorizing committee for review and then go to the \nappropriating committee and then come to the floor?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't speak for the leadership or anybody in the \ncaucus, but I believe that. This notion that we are dealing with an \nunanticipated expenditure in the fourth year of this war is a charade. \nI think it would be better for us to deal with this in the regular \nappropriations process so that we can integrate the cost of the \nsupplemental with the actual expenses of the Department of Defense and \ndo our best to meet the needs of our soldiers and yet not waste \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator's courtesy in allowing me to ask \nhim some questions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the time on the \nmajority side will be reserved, and the Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S317-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S317-S319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONFRONTING A CONUNDRUM\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to discuss again what I consider to \nbe the single largest quality-of-life issue we have confronting us as a \nnation. That is the issue of how we pay for my generation, the baby \nboom generation, which is about to begin to retire and the effect our \nretirement as a generation will have on the capacity of our children to \nbe successful and have a quality of life that is equal to what we have \nhad as a nation.\n  We confront a conundrum. The baby boom generation has been the most \nproductive and most resilient generation in the history of the Nation. \nAs a result, through each decade of its growth, beginning in the 1950s \nwhen it added a lot of elementary schools, right through the 1960s, \n1970s, 1980s, 1990s, and into the 2000s, when it created a huge engine \nof economic activity in this country because there are so many of us, \nso highly educated and so aggressive as a productive engine for the \nwhole Nation, we have been able to contribute to society and to our \nNation the highest quality of life in the history of our Nation--in the \nhistory of the world, for that matter.\n  But now this generation, which is the largest generation in our \nhistory, is going to begin to retire. All of the retirement systems \nwere built up over the years in order to benefit people who retire in \nour Nation, to make sure they can retire with dignity, Social Security, \nMedicare and, to a lesser extent, Medicaid. It was based on the promise \nthat Franklin Roosevelt had, which is that you would have a lot of \npeople working and a few people retiring. In 1950, the concept was that \nyou would have, for example, 13 people working for every 1 person \nretired, so that the working Americans would be able to not only earn a \ngood living for themselves but would also be able to support those \npeople who are retired.\n  Well, that equation fails in the present projected future because the \nbaby boom generation doubles the number of retirees from approximately \n35 million to 70 million, and from a system which had 13 people working \nfor every 1 person retired in the 1950s to about 2 people working for \nevery 1 person retired by 2025. So you go from a pyramid to a rectangle \nand you have those working people trying to support the people who are \nretired. There are not enough people working to do that. So you create \na huge burden and basically a fiscal crisis of inordinate proportion.\n  I have a chart nearby that clearly reflects this problem. This simply \nshows three costs that the Federal Government incurs, which are Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid, the three largest entitlement \naccounts, as they are referred to.\n  Those accounts make up about 8 percent of our gross national product \ntoday. Historically, the Federal Government spends about 20 percent of \nGDP. If it gets much above that 20 percent of the GDP, it becomes an \nextreme burden for the productive side of our economy and you end up \nwith people being able to produce less because the Government is taking \nso much out of their paycheck and productivity drops and quality of \nlife drops.\n  So we have as a nation always sort of maintained within a fairly \nsmall range this concept that the Federal Government should spend about \n20 percent of GDP. That goes way back. This chart takes us back to \n1962. In times of war, that spikes, and it has historically--especially \nin World War II. But that is the traditional amount.\n  However, the problem we confront is that the cost of Social Security, \nMedicare and Medicaid alone--those three items--because of the \nretirement of this huge generation and the price which it will take to \npay benefits for that generation, actually will absorb 20 percent of \nGDP in the mid 2020 period, which is not that far away. It is within 20 \nyears, which is not that far. We will actually have a situation where \nthree Federal programs are using all of the dollars which historically \nthe Federal Government has used in order to support the purposes of the \nFederal Government. So that would mean, theoretically, that the only \nthing you could pay for would be those three programs. You could no \nlonger pay for national defense, which is the first responsibility of \nFederal Government; you could not pay for education, health care, \nenvironmental protection, or all of the things the Federal Government \ndoes that are significant in improving the quality of our standards of \nlife.\n  That, however, doesn't end the problem, because the cost of this \ngeneration continues to go up. In fact, just those 3 programs break \nthrough the 20-percent line and go well up into the high 20 percent--\n28, 29 percent of GDP, as projected--as we head out into 2030 to 2040.\n  Basically, what you see is the fact that we are headed toward a \nsituation where the cost of these three programs alone will essentially \nbankrupt our country. The practical implications of this are that the \nyounger generation, the people working for a living, our children and \ngrandchildren, will have to pay a tax burden that is so high that their \ndiscretionary income won't be able to be spent on educating their \nchildren with a better college education, or on buying a home, or on \nliving a better lifestyle. Their discretionary money will go to taxes \nto support the cost of these three entitlement programs.\n  This is not a sustainable idea. This is not an idea that any \nresponsible person involved in governance could subscribe to. \nCertainly, one generation has no right to pass on to another generation \na set of costs that is going to bankrupt the capacity of the next \ngeneration to live as good a quality of life as the prior generation \nwas living. It is not right, fair, or appropriate.\n  Another thing this chart shows is that, as a practical matter, you \ncannot tax your way out of the situation. A lot of people say: we will \njust raise taxes. You cannot tax your way out of the situation. You \ncannot raise taxes high enough to pay for the costs we are going to \nincur as a result of these entitlement programs having to benefit so \nmany Americans.\n  Why? It is very simple. Historically, Federal taxes have been 18.2 \npercent of GDP. Today we have Federal tax of 18.4, 18.5. So we are over \nthe historic norm today. Once you get Federal taxes up above 20 percent \nand they head toward 23, 24, 25 percent, or even higher, in order to \naccomplish the coverage of these costs, you are essentially going to be \ntaxing productive Americans at a level where you would reduce \ndramatically their productivity..\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\n  It is sort of a downward spiral event. It is akin to killing the \ngoose that is laying the golden egg situation. You cannot lay a tax \nburden on a productive people and expect them to continue to be \nproductive because human nature, the natural response to something such \nas that, is people become less productive. As they see 60, 70, 80 \npercent of their next dollar they earn going to the Federal Government \nor to taxes, they are going to be less inclined to go out and earn that \nnext dollar because they are keeping so little of it. That is just \nhuman nature.\n  So it is a downward spiral event. Once you get taxes above a certain \nlevel, they stop producing revenues because people do tax avoidance \nactivity or, alternatively, they simply stop being productive and \nsociety stops investing, capital formation drops off, jobs stop being \ncreated, and you basically drive yourself into a severe recession or \nyou become less competitive with the rest of the world, which doesn't \nhave the same problem.\n  We cannot tax your way out of this issue. We actually have to address \nthe fundamental, underlying problem, which is that these programs, as \nthey are presently structured, are not sustainable in the future, and \nwe have to figure out a way to make them sustainable.\n  There are many ways to do this. There is no one solution to this \nproblem. There is no magic bullet out there, although with Social \nSecurity it is a much simpler exercise in the sense of moving parts. \nBut there are many ways to continue to deliver high-quality retirement \nservices in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid but have them be \naffordable to the generation who is paying for it.\n  Five years ago, myself, Senator Breaux, Senator Bob Kerrey, Senator \nChuck Robb, Senator Moynihan, and on our side of the aisle, Senator \nCraig Thomas and a number of other Senators, came together to develop a \nplan for Social Security which was bipartisan, which would have solved \nthe problem over the long term, which would have continued the benefit \nstructure which was extremely robust--in fact, a more robust system \nthan what seniors are facing today--yet put it in a position that was \naffordable.\n  Yes, there were revenues included in that package. Any solution is \ngoing to have to involve benefit adjustments and revenues. There is no \nway we can do it on one side. The fact is, we have to face up to this \nsituation. As a society, we have to face up to this need.\n  I guess that is my point today. We are running out of time. I have \nbeen delivering this message for a while. The clock continues to run. \nWe are running out of time. We have an opportunity, a window. It is a \nunique window. There are not a whole lot of advantages to the fact that \nI am no longer chairman of the committee I used to be chairman of, but \none of the advantages is, from my perspective, we now have a divided \nGovernment. We have a Democratic Congress and a Republican Presidency.\n  I happen to believe that any solution to this issue has to be \nabsolutely bipartisan. There can be no question from the American \npeople that a solution on these issues is not done in a bipartisan way \nbecause if the American people think it isn't fair, they are not going \nto be attracted to it; they are going to think it is gamesmanship by \none party or the other.\n  So anything that has to be done has to be done in a bipartisan way. \nWe are in a climate where any solution that is going to occur is going \nto be bipartisan. That is the good news. But that window of opportunity \nisn't going to be open that long. We are going to be heading into a \nPresidential election pretty soon, and in both of the last Presidential \nelections, we have seen outrageous, despicable, in my opinion, \ndemagoguery on the issue of Social Security. The well was poisoned \nbefore the day even started in both those campaigns.\n  The opportunity to aggressively and effectively address this issue, \nto develop a bipartisan solution has to occur sooner rather than later, \nand it has to be done in a way with which the American people are \ncomfortable because it is fair.\n  I put forward a proposal on this issue. I put forward a proposal that \ndeals a lot with this responsibility package called SOS that has about \n30 sponsors. One part of that package was to structure a procedure to \ndeliver results. I believe we should use procedure to drive policy \nbecause I believe that once you put policy on the table, everybody \ntakes shots at it, all the different interests in this city sit around \nand pick it apart. It makes much more sense to use procedure, and the \nprocedure I use is a fast-track, bipartisan commission, where you \nabsolutely have to have bipartisan decisions, you have a supermajority \napproval, and you do it on a fast track and have people who are going \nto be players sitting around a room to try to work it out.\n  That is not the only way to approach this issue. There are a lot of \ndifferent ways to approach this issue. I hope we, as a Congress, and \nour leadership in this body--and I know our leadership is interested in \nthis issue. I talked with people on the other side of the aisle who are \nactive on this issue and active in the leadership, and there is key \ninterest in this issue, but the time to move is now.\n  We are running out of time, and we have to get on with this.\n  I wanted to make this point, again. I stand ready, a lot of Members \non my side stand ready to pursue substantive action in this area. \nHopefully, we can do it.\n  On a second note, this is a point I raised with the assistant leader, \nwe are about to get a $100 billion-plus supplemental on the war. Nobody \nin this Senate in any way is going to vote in a manner that doesn't \ngive our troops what they need when our troops are in the field--at any \ntime, especially when they are in the field.\n  These supplementals are important to make sure we adequately fund \npeople who are putting their lives on the line for us, but the process \nthat has evolved is not right; it is just plain not right. This will be \nthe fourth year--I think it is like the sixth supplemental, maybe it is \nthe seventh or maybe it is the eighth--I have lost track--that a bill \nwill have come up designated as an emergency from the Pentagon and \nbasically bypasses the process of review through the authorizing \ncommittee and, for all intents and purposes, through the Appropriations \nCommittee and comes directly to the floor and spends tens of billions \nof dollars.\n  It is a shadow budget, as I have described it. We have a budget \nprocess around here. Granted, it is not working that well. Hopefully, \nit will work better this year. But we do have a budget process, and the \npurpose of the budget process is to give adequate review and fiscal \ndiscipline so that we are responsible stewards of the taxpayers' money. \nBut when we have this shadow budget that comes up, entirely outside the \nbudget process and continues to come up and has become almost the \nregular order of approach as to how we fund the Pentagon now, you are \nessentially saying budgets don't matter, review of the substance \ndoesn't matter, spending should simply be done as requested, without \nany oversight and without any discipline as to how much is going to be \nspent. I don't think that is the right way to approach this.\n\n  In the last budget, I set aside almost $90 billion for supplementals \nfor the war. The Pentagon wouldn't give us a number. They sent up a \neuphemistic number. They wouldn't even support that number. So we \narbitrarily set $90 billion because that was the average of what the \nsupplemental requests had been over the prior 3 years. Then we \nsubjected it to budgetary restraint, so that if it went over the $90 \nbillion, they had to explain it, they had to justify it. We had to have \na supermajority if we wanted to accomplish it, if somebody wanted to \nchallenge it--but only if somebody wanted to challenge it.\n  What is happening now is we are looking at $170 billion, not $90 \nbillion, of spending in this year. That is almost $130 billion over \nwhat the Pentagon claimed they euphemistically set up as a throwaway \nnumber, which they wouldn't even defend when we had a hearing on this \nsubject.\n  Essentially, what we are seeing is that there has been a decision \ndowntown to do an end run around the budget process and essentially an \nend run around the oversight process. We are also seeing, regrettably, \nthat they are gaming the system, at least in the last supplemental--and \nit is reported that in this supplemental, although I haven't seen the \nnumbers--there is a fair amount of spending which had nothing--well, it \nhad something, but it\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\nwas truly tangential to the war effort. It went to the core issue of \nthe Defense budget, which is still spending over $400 billion. That is \non top of the supplementals. They were using this shadow budget, where \nthey knew they had no restraints, to basically pick up spending which \nshould have been in the core budget and had at least gone through the \nauthorizing process.\n  There were a number of items in there that fell into that category, \nincluding the whole restructuring of the Army. And now we are hearing \nthey may even have joint strike fighters in this next supplemental, two \nof them potentially. At least that is what has been reported. Maybe \nthey will be out by the time it gets here because light has been shined \non them.\n  The fact is, it shouldn't work that way. We know we are in a war. We \nknow, approximately, what that war is going to cost. We should have a \nprocess which reviews it in an orderly fashion, and that is the way it \nwas historically done here.\n  The Vietnam war was appropriated and authorized. Almost all the \nspending went through an authorizing and appropriating process. Almost \nall the appropriations of the Korean war went through the authorizing \nand appropriating process. It is a very predictable number right now, \nor within range of a very predictable number. They don't have to send \n$170 billion up as a supplemental and designate it an emergency to \nfight this war. We know it is going to cost us in that range, and it \nshould go through the authorizing process and then through the \nappropriating process. It shouldn't come up as an emergency.\n  Sure, there may be some amount on top of that which may occur during \nthe year, we may need to put in another X number of dollars, and that \nmay be a legitimate emergency, but the core spending of this war should \nbe accounted for in the regular order and reviewed so it doesn't end up \nbeing a gamesmanship exercise coming to us from downtown which is \nessentially to avoid, ignore, and mute the capacity of the Congress to \nhave an impact on how the spending occurs, whether it is legitimately \npart of the war or legitimately part of the Defense Department.\n  I am concerned about this situation. I have heard mumbling from the \nadministration, at least from OMB, that they are going to try to budget \nfor this stuff that is appropriately not in the war--by ``this stuff,'' \nI mean things that are appropriately not in the war effort but are in \nthe Defense Department's underlying budget--and that they are going to \ntake those out and put them in the underlying Defense budget.\n  They need to do more than that. They need to structure the budget \nthey send up here so that if they want to have a separate account for \nthe war fighting, fine. I can understand that because we don't want to \nbuild it into the base. I am 100 percent for that. But it shouldn't be \na separate budget, an emergency budget, and it should go through the \nauthorizing and appropriations process.\n  We have time to do that. We have a strong authorizing committee. I \nsit on the appropriating committee, and we have an extremely strong \nappropriating committee. We can review the numbers quickly and analyze \nwhether it is fair and appropriate, and I suspect 95, 98 percent of it \nwill be approved. But the fact that we are going to approve it doesn't \nmean it shouldn't at least be reviewed. Basically, muting and \nundermining the legitimacy of the congressional role in funding is, \nundermining, in some degree, the commitment to the war effort itself. \nIt is counterproductive to having popular support for the war effort.\n  I hope that when they send up this next supplemental that they not \ndesignate it as an emergency and that they ask that it go through the \nprocess, but tell us to do it in a quick way, don't spent a month doing \nthis; do it in a week and a half, 2 weeks, and we can do that; \notherwise, I believe we will continue on a path that is harmful not \nonly to the relationship between the executive and the legislative \nbranches, it is harmful to good governance and the good stewardship of \ntax dollars and it is, more importantly, more harmful to the war effort \nitself.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1, which the clerk will report \nby title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1) to provide greater transparency in the \n     legislative process.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 3, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Reid amendment No. 4 (to amendment No. 3), to strengthen \n     the gift and travel bans.\n       Vitter amendment No. 5 (to amendment No. 3), to modify the \n     application of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \n     Indian tribes.\n       Vitter amendment No. 6 (to amendment No. 3), to prohibit \n     authorized committees and leadership PACs from employing the \n     spouse or immediate family members of any candidate or \n     Federal office holder connected to the committee.\n       Vitter amendment No. 7 (to amendment No. 3), to amend the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978 to establish criminal \n     penalties for knowingly and willfully falsifying or failing \n     to file or report certain information required to be reported \n     under that Act.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am privileged to be able to manage \nthe bill for part of today. Senator Feinstein and I--she is the chair \nof the Rules Committee, and I, in my capacity as chair of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, will be alternating on our \nside. I am honored to do that.\n  I would say that after a day, we are off to a good start in our \nconsideration of S. 1, the bill before us. The majority and minority \nleaders, Senators Reid and McConnell, laid down yesterday a bipartisan \nsubstitute amendment that improves what was already a strong bill, S. \n1, and I know a number of other Senators have come to the floor to file \nor offer amendments. It is good to proceed in that way.\n  We have a bill before us which fortunately has strong bipartisan \nsupport, and it is certainly my hope, and I know the hope of managers \non both sides, and the leaders, that we can move along with the \nconsideration of these amendments so that we will complete this bill in \nthe timeframe laid out by the majority leader, which is the end of next \nweek. This will be not just auspicious but a meaningful, bipartisan way \nto begin this 110th Congress.\n  I wish to speak in strong support of the comprehensive substitute \nthat was laid down and offered by the majority and minority leaders \nyesterday. I am pleased to join as a sponsor of that amendment. The \nunderlying text of S. 1 is already a sweeping reform of ethics rules \nand lobbying regulations, and the substitute takes us even further in \nstrengthening those reforms. I would like to focus on a few of the \nadditional improvements made by the substitute.\n  The substitute will clarify and strengthen the provisions in the \nunderlying bill that require, for the first time, lobbyists to report \non campaign contributions and travel they arrange for Members of \nCongress--for the first time. We also will require lobbyists to \ndisclose contributions to Presidential libraries and inaugural \ncommittees. This is an extension of one of the basic building blocks of \nthis reform, which is disclosure, transparency, shining the sunshine on \nwhat is happening here so the public, the media, and Congress itself \nwill be better informed and can take appropriate action. These \ndisclosures will provide a fuller picture of the relationships between \nthose who lobby and those who are lobbied in the Congress and in the \nexecutive branch.\n  The substitute also creates a new criminal penalty for violations of \nthe\n\n[[Page S320]]\n\nLobbying Disclosure Act. While the underlying bill, S. 1, already \ndoubles the amount of civil penalties that may be imposed, a criminal \npenalty will strengthen the hand of the Department of Justice in \npursuing and punishing the most egregious violations.\n  The substitute will also tighten the revolving door rules by \nprohibiting Senators from negotiating for jobs as lobbyists while they \nare still in office. We will also require senior Senate staff to report \nto the Ethics Committee when they are negotiating for employment so \nthat the Ethics Committee can identify any conflicts of interest and \nrequire staff to recuse themselves while they are still employed by the \nSenate from working on issues that may present conflicts of interest \nwith those with whom they are negotiating.\n  The substitute will also provide new rules on evaluation of tickets \nto sporting and entertainment events. Why, one may ask, would we need \nthat provision if the underlying bill already bans gifts from lobbyists \nto Members? The reason is there has been a concern that there could be \nan end run around this ban, and this provision will prevent any \nlobbyist who might think of doing so from selling tickets to Members or \nstaff at a steeply discounted price, which would effectively be a gift \nbecause the discount itself would be a benefit in and of itself.\n\n  The substitute also improves the provisions in S. 1 that provide \ntransparency for the earmark process. The substitute will strengthen \nand clarify the definition of an earmark, to make sure that it includes \ntargeted tax benefits and targeted tariff benefits. These are obviously \nmatters of great importance and of value. A targeted tax benefit, which \nis to say a tax cut or a credit, or a tariff benefit often has as much \nvalue, and many times has more value, than a specific earmarked \nappropriation. So the substitute now strengthens and clarifies the \ndefinition of ``earmark'' to include those benefits.\n  The improved definition makes clear that earmarks, as in the bill, \ninclude earmarks to non-Federal entities when the money is first \nfunneled through a Federal entity. That provision addresses what some \nperceive and have said is a weakness in the earmark provisions in the \nunderlying bill.\n  All of this is an attempt by this body to take hold of the earmark \nprocess that was abused by some in the ethical scandals that have \noccurred here in Congress, and more generally is blamed by others for \nan escalation in the cost of Government without covering those costs.\n  I have always believed you have to be direct and forthright about \nthis issue. It is not that all earmarks are evil. There are good \nearmarks and bad earmarks, and there are limits to the earmarks we want \nto provide simply because we can't afford to provide beyond that. The \nattempt of S. 1 and the substitute laid down by Senators Reid and \nMcConnell is not to stop earmarks but to create transparency, \ndisclosure, and a process by which the full body will be both aware of \nthe earmarks and able to challenge them if an individual Senator or \nSenators desire.\n  The substitute also contains a sense of the Senate on fair and open \nprocedures for conference committees, and this also relates to how \nearmarks are handled. The substitute also amends the Senate rules to \nmake clear that no changes may be made to conference reports after the \nreports have been signed by the conferees. This is obviously the \nconcern, unfortunately based in fact, that, after a conference report, \nincluding one signed by the conferees, either staff or Members in high \npositions have been able to insert items, earmarks, into those \nconference reports, which obviously suppresses not only the public's \nright to know but the Members' right to know. This substitute will now \nmake clear that no changes of that kind can be made.\n\n  I am disappointed that the substitute does not include some \nadditional gift and travel rules. I believe there is strong bipartisan \nsupport for some of the measures I have in mind. That is why I intend \nto support the majority leader when he offers an amendment to pass the \ngift and travel provisions to which I am referring in a separate \namendment. The House already has passed strict gift and travel rules, \nand I personally hope the Senate will follow suit.\n  I am also very pleased that the majority leader has included in this \namendment that I referred to an additional amendment, a strong \nprovision on the use of corporate jets. This is a controversial, \ndifficult matter. It is an issue that Senators McCain, Feingold, Obama, \nand I wanted to pursue last year when we took this up essentially in \nits predecessor form, but we were unable to do so once cloture was \nreached on the bill because the amendment was determined to be \nnongermane.\n  Under current law this is the reality. When a Member of Congress or a \ncandidate for Federal office uses a private plane instead of flying on \na commercial airline, the ethics rules, as well as the Federal Election \nCommission rules, require a payment to the owner of the plane \nequivalent to a first-class commercial ticket. The current rules \nundervalue flights on noncommercial jets and provide, in effect, a way \nfor corporations and individuals to give benefits to Members beyond the \nlimits provided for in our campaign finance laws. The Reid amendment \nwould eliminate that loophole by requiring that the reimbursement be \nbased on the comparable charter rate for a plane.\n  I know there are strong feelings on both sides of that. I appreciate \nthat Senator Reid will put that before the Senate. I look forward to \nsupporting him in it.\n  We have some very strong reform proposals before the Senate. We are \noff to a good beginning. We have a lot more work to do, and I hope my \ncolleagues will come to the floor and offer their amendments so we can \nget this all done by the end of next week.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I note the presence of the Senator from South Carolina \non the floor of the Senate, and I will yield to him at this time. I \nwithdraw my request for a quorum call.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The request is withdrawn. The \nSenator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the pending \namendment aside and I be permitted to offer four amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the request? \nHearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n     Amendments Nos. 11, 12, 13, and 14 to Amendment No. 3 en bloc\n\n  Mr. DeMint.

Mr. President, I thank the Senators from Connecticut and \nUtah for working with me to get the time to offer these amendments. \nWhen similar legislation was considered last year, I voted against it \nbecause I believed it did not do enough in the way of earmark reform. I \nbelieve the same is true for the substitute that is before us today, \nand I am offering these amendments to strengthen the bill and try to \nget it to the point where I can support it.\n  My first amendment would enhance the disclosure requirements for \ncongressional earmarks, for limited tax benefits, and limited tariff \nbenefits to match those proposed in the other body by Speaker of the \nHouse Nancy Pelosi. The earmark definition in the substitute is \nwoefully inadequate. It exempts earmarks for Federal entities as well \nas earmarks in report language.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, more than 95 percent \nof all earmarks in fiscal year 2006 were found in report language, not \nin the bill text. In effect, disclosure requirements in the substitute \ncould conceivably apply to only 5 out of every 100 earmarks.\n  The definition of a targeted tax benefit in the substitute also falls \nshort, as it never explicitly defines what constitutes a limited group \nof taxpayers. Speaker Pelosi's language, however, explicitly defines a \nlimited tax benefit as one that is targeted to 10 or fewer \nbeneficiaries.\n  I do not always agree with Speaker Pelosi, but on this issue we are \nin full agreement. The earmark definition agreed to in the House is by \nfar the most comprehensive definition that is currently being debated, \nand I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  My second amendment would clarify that earmarks that were not in \neither the House or Senate version of the bill are out of scope when \nthey are added in a conference report. As my colleagues know, a lot of \nearmarks find their way into conference reports where they cannot be \nvoted on. This circumvents the legislative process, and it fosters \nabuse of taxpayer dollars. I am pleased that the substitute partly \naddresses this problem by creating a new 60-vote point of order against \nmatters that are out of scope. This was designed to allow Members to \nobject to out-of-scope earmarks and have them removed from the \nconference report, but the Senate Parliamentarian does not believe this \nprovision is enforceable against earmarks specifically.\n  My amendment would clarify that out-of-scope earmarks are subject to \nthis new point of order in the Senate bill as well as rule XXVIII of \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate, which prohibits adding out-of-scope \nmatters in conference. I believe this is the true intent of the \nsubstitute, and I strongly encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  My third amendment would prevent the Government from shutting down \nwhen regular appropriations bills are not enacted. It would do so by \nautomatically triggering a continuing resolution that funds agencies at \ncurrent levels for up to a year. The amendment would begin automatic \nfunding on the first day of a lapse in appropriations, and it would end \non the day the regular appropriations bill becomes law or the last day \nof the fiscal year, whichever comes first. This would eliminate the \nmust-pass nature associated with regular appropriations bills which \noften pressure lawmakers into accepting spending bills with \nobjectionable earmarks.\n  I understand that the Democratic leader intends to get all of the \nappropriations bills done before the end of the fiscal year, but there \nare always unforeseeable events that must be dealt with, and there is \nalways a chance that we will be faced with having to pass a bad bill or \nallowing parts of the Government to shut down. I certainly do not \nsupport Government shutdowns, and I know my colleagues do not either. \nMy amendment would create a safety net that would avoid the crisis \nsituations that often pressure lawmakers into supporting spending bills \nthat they would not otherwise support. This is a commonsense proposal, \nand I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  My fourth amendment would prevent labor unions from using a member's \ndues to lobby Congress without the prior separate and written consent \nof that member. Union dues, like taxes, are compulsory for union \nmembers. We all believe Congress must be transparent and accountable in \nthe way it spends tax dollars, and we should all support making unions \ntransparent and accountable in the way they spend members' dues. \nFederal tax dollars cannot be used for lobbying but compulsory union \ndues can be used for lobbying. This is a real problem because it forces \nunion workers to pay for lobbying with which they may not agree. If \nsomeone is a member of a trade association and they disagree with the \nactions of that group, they can always stop paying their dues. This \nfreedom is not afforded to union workers.\n  I tried on several occasions last year to pass legislation that would \nbar criminals convicted of serious felonies from gaining secure access \nto our ports. This proposal is essential to protecting our Nation from \nfuture terrorist attacks, and it is overwhelmingly supported by \nAmericans. But the measure was killed by several unions that lobbied \nagainst it, and they killed it with dues that they forced union workers \nto pay without their consent.\n  My amendment simply requires consent from union members before his or \nher dues may be used to lobby Congress. My amendment has nothing to do \nwith political contributions. That is a debate for another day. But as \nlong as unions force workers to pay dues as a condition of employment, \nthey should get consent from their members before they use those dues \nto lobby Congress. My amendment would ensure that voluntary \ncontributions will be the only contributions that can go toward \nlobbying Congress.\n  I thank the managers again for working with me to get these \namendments called up so our colleagues can begin reviewing them. I \nwould be pleased to work with the managers in scheduling additional \ntime to debate and vote on these amendments.\n  I yield and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 9\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment No. 9 which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] for himself and Mr. \n     Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered 9 to amendment No. 3.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent to waive the reading of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To place certain restrictions on the ability of the spouses \n                of Member of Congress to lobby Congress)\n\n       On page 51, between lines 12 and 13, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 242. SPOUSE LOBBYING MEMBER.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 207(e) of title 18, United States \n     Code, as amended by section 241, is further amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(5) Spouses.--Any person who is the spouse of a Member of \n     Congress and who was not serving as a registered lobbyist at \n     least 1 year prior to the election of that Member of Congress \n     to office and who, after the election of such Member, \n     knowingly lobbies on behalf of a client for compensation any \n     Member of Congress or is associated with any such lobbying \n     activity by an employer of\n\n[[Page S323]]\n\n     that spouse shall be punished as provided in section 216 of \n     this title.''.\n       (b) Grandfather Provision.--The amendment made by \n     subsection (a) shall not apply to any spouse of a Member of \n     Congress serving as a registered lobbyist on the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank the leaders, the floor managers, \nall those involved in this important debate for putting this front and \ncenter of our business in the new Congress. It is very appropriate we \ndo so.\n  I hope we all recognize, after the last few years, we need a very \nfocused, sincere, determined effort to strengthen the law, strengthen \nenforcement, and rebuild the confidence of the American people in our \ninstitutions.\n  These two amendments that I bring to the Senate I hope will do that. \nThey are part of a package I have introduced, along with three \namendments I introduced and talked about briefly yesterday.\n  Let me get to this first amendment today. It is a very simple, \nstraightforward idea to address what, unfortunately, is a very real \nissue and a very real cause for concern by the American people. That is \nthe practice, in some cases, of spouses of Members of the House and \nSenate being registered lobbyists, making large amounts of money in \nthat profession, lobbying at the same time they are a spouse of a \nMember of the House or a Member of the Senate. My amendment is very \nstraightforward and says we will not allow that.\n  The underlying bill addresses that in a very narrow way, to say that \nspouses in that situation can't directly lobby their own spouse or that \nMembers' office. That is great, but clearly a person in that \nsituation--a Senate spouse, a House spouse--has enormous entre to other \nMembers, to other offices. My amendment is broader and says we are not \ngoing to allow that. Spouses of sitting Members of the House and Senate \ncannot lobby.\n  Unfortunately, I wish history was such that Members could argue this \nis a solution looking for a problem. That is not the case. This \nhappens. It has happened. It has clearly been abused. There have been \ninstances that have been reported that have caused great legitimate \nalarm and concern by the American people of this being abused. This has \ncome to light in the last several years. Spouses making large amounts \nof money, bringing that income to the family bank account--obviously, \nthe Member of Congress is part of it, participates in it--from \nlobbying.\n  There is a situation with two fundamental problems. One is a lobbyist \nspouse clearly having extraordinary access to other Members and their \noffices. That is one real problem. The second real problem is maybe \neven more significant. That is the opportunity for significant moneyed \ninterests, special interests, whatever you want to call it, to be able \nto write a check, a big check, in the form of a salary that goes \ndirectly into a Member's family bank account through the spouse. That \nis a practice that has been used and abused in the recent past. Again, \nthis is not a solution looking for a problem.\n  We, also, point out there is an exception in my amendment. I debated \nwhether to include this exception. I can make an argument that we \nshould not even allow this exception, but to bend over backwards, to be \nfair, to answer some concerns of other Members, I included the \nexception. It says, if this lobbyist spouse was a lobbyist more than a \nyear before the Member was first elected to the Congress, they can \ncontinue with that activity. In other words, someone who legitimately \nbuilt up a career well before that marriage was ever seriously \ncontemplated, can continue. Again, I can make an argument of no \nexceptions, but in the interest of bending over backward to meet some \nlegitimate questions, I included that exception.\n  I hope all Members of the Senate, Republican and Democrat, will \ncarefully look at this amendment and support it. This has been and is a \npractice. It has been used and abused in the past. It has clearly \ncaused serious concerns among the American people. It has been in press \nreports and other disclosures in the last couple of years.\n  To say we are doing wholesale lobbying and ethics reform, and, oh, by \nthe way, we are not going to touch this, we are going to forget about \nthis, would make a folly of the whole exercise. I encourage all Members \nof the Senate to support this concept.\n  Let's make a clear-cut rule. Let's get rid of this clear conflict of \ninterest to potential abuses, unusual access to Members, as well as the \npossibility of special interests basically being able to write a big \ncheck directly into a Member's family bank account.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 10 to Amendment No. 3\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside that amendment and call up my second amendment of the day, \namendment No. 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 10 to amendment No. 3.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the penalty for failure to comply with lobbying \n                        disclosure requirements)\n\n       On page 34, line 5, strike ``$100,000'' and insert \n     ``$200,000''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I think this amendment also addresses an \nimportant issue in this ethics and lobbying reform debate; that is, the \nsignificance of the penalties involved for serious violations.\n  This amendment is very straightforward. It says that registered \nlobbyists who fail to comply with the Lobbying Disclosure Act--and \nafter that is called to their attention, and then they fail to remedy \nthe situation, fail to fix it, fail to follow other aspects of the \nlaw--the maximum penalty can be $200,000. Current law, right now, is \n$50,000. I simply think that is too low for the most serious violations \nof the Lobbying Disclosure Act, considering that in virtually all of \nthese cases the lobbyist is given notice and allowed to correct the \nsituation before we ever get to this sort of very serious penalty.\n  The underlying bill on the floor, as I understand it, will propose to \nincrease the current law penalty from $50,000 to $100,000. I think that \nis obviously movement in the right direction but not far enough. My \namendment would propose changing current law from a maximum penalty of \n$50,000 to $200,000.\n  Again, let me emphasize a couple things. I think there is the wide \nand correct perception by the American people that in a lot of these \ncases you have a law, you have a violation, and it just ends up being a \nslap on the wrist--the cost of doing business to a lobbyist who is \nmaking millions. I think that is true in many cases. That is a real \ndefect in the law. We need to correct that.\n  Secondly, we are talking about a maximum penalty--up to $200,000. It \ndoes not mean it has to be $200,000. And we are talking about a \nsituation where a violation is called to a person's attention and that \nperson fails to comply with the law within 60 days, fails to right the \nwrong by complying with other provisions of the Lobbying Disclosure \nAct.\n  So given all of that, given all of those circumstances, I think a \nmaximum penalty--maximum--of up to $200,000 is very legitimate and is a \nchange that is really overdue.\n  Again, I implore all the Members of the Senate, Democrat and \nRepublican, to take a good, hard look at this amendment. I think when \nthey do, the vast majority will support it. I certainly look forward to \nthat.\n  With that, Mr. President, I look forward to further debate on these \namendments and certainly votes on these amendments, and I have received \ncommitments for that.\n  With that, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back his time.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11:45 \na.m. this morning, the Senate resume consideration of the Vitter \namendment No. 7 and that there be 15 minutes of debate, controlled 5 \nminutes each for the majority and minority managers and 5 minutes for \nSenator Vitter; that at 12 noon, without further intervening action or \ndebate, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to Vitter amendment No. \n7.\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Amendment No. 7 to Amendment No. 3\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 7.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. VITTER. I thank the Chair. Under the previous order, I will talk \nabout this amendment for 5 minutes and then the floor managers will do \nthe same.\n  Mr. President, I explained this yesterday. It is a very \nstraightforward amendment. It simply increases penalties--I think \nappropriately--for willful and knowing misrepresentations on financial \ndisclosure reports.\n  As you know, many people in Government, including U.S. Senators, have \nto file financial disclosure statements. That is section 101 of the \nEthics in Government Act of 1975. It is very basic information about \nnot every detail of our finances, but the broad brush of an \nindividual's finances. This applies to others, certainly, in the \nadministration, executive branch, as well as some in the judicial \nbranch.\n  Section 104 of that act is about the penalties. That says the \nAttorney General can file a civil suit against any individual who \nknowingly and willfully falsifies that sort of document or knowingly \nand willfully fails to report that information. But the maximum fine \nunder that civil suit is $10,000. Mr. President, this can literally be \na slap on the wrist in certain situations. This can literally encourage \npeople to falsify documents or not report certain information \ncompletely or properly because, No. 1, that figure will never be \nnoticed or caught; No. 2, worst case, if it is, it is only $10,000. It \nmay be worth paying that and trying to get away with it versus \ndisclosing certain information.\n  That is unacceptable. This amendment fixes that. It raises the \nmaximum civil penalty from $10,000 to $50,000, and it allows--doesn't \nmandate--the Attorney General to bring criminal charges in certain \nsituations, with a maximum penalty of up to 1 year imprisonment. Again, \nin certain situations, that would be appropriate and the current law in \ncertain situations, I believe, will actually encourage folks to try to \nget away with noncompliance, nondisclosure.\n  Finally, I ask this simple question in support of the amendment: If \nthat is the right approach for the average American citizen, why should \nit not be the right approach for U.S. Senators, House Members, and \nmembers of the executive branch? Why do I say that? Well, if an average \nAmerican citizen knowingly and willfully falsifies tax documents, guess \nwhat. They are in a heap of trouble and they face much greater \npotential consequences than a civil fine of up to $10,000. They \nabsolutely face potential criminal charges. So if it is right and \nappropriate for the average American citizen, certainly the same rule \nshould bear on Members of the Senate, Members of the House, and members \nof the executive branch, no more or less. What is fair is fair. We need \nto be treated like the average American citizen.\n  With that, I yield back my time and look forward to wrapping up this \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we have no problem with this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in about 5 minutes the Senate will vote \non the amendment offered by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter. \nFirst, I thank him for offering this amendment, which concerns the \nEthics in Government Act, a law that falls within the jurisdiction of \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which I am \nprivileged to chair in this session. The penalty provisions for \ndisclosure violations under that act, the Ethics in Government Act, \nhave not been addressed in some time. Senator Vitter's amendment begins \nto do that. I think it does it in an appropriate way. I intend to \nsupport the Senator's amendment.\n  As has been said, and I will repeat it, the amendment will increase \nthe civil penalties that already exist under the act and will create a \nnew penalty for knowing and willful falsification or failure to report, \nand that is a criminal penalty.\n  I note for my colleagues' benefit that the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee intends to take up reauthorization of \nthe Office of Government Ethics this year.\n  I know that some of my colleagues are interested in offering \namendments to this bill, S. 1, related to executive branch ethics. \nObviously, I am happy to work with them on these amendments to see if \nany of those might appropriately be attached to this bill, such as the \none we are voting on now.\n  But I also want to say on behalf of the committee that there may be \nsome other proposed amendments that the committee believes need further \ndeliberate consideration by the committee. I will be happy to work with \nmy colleagues on those, urging them not to go forward on this bill, but \nwith the promise that as we address the Office of Government Ethics \nreauthorization and other matters, that we will be glad to consider \nthose proposals. As the hour approaches, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this progressive amendment by the Senator from Louisiana.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I now yield back all of the remaining \ntime and suggest that we go forward with the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 7 offered by the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), and the Senator from South \nDakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) \nwould have voted ``aye.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Obama). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 93, nays 2, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 2 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--93\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Tester\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S325]]\n\n\n\n                                NAYS--2\n\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Crapo\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n  The amendment (No. 7) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to engage the managers here. It is \nmy understanding I will have time shortly to give a statement on Iraq. \nI don't want to interfere with the legislation on the floor, and I am \nasking whether this would be a good time for that statement to take \nabout maybe 15, 20 minutes.\n  I see no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iraq\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am concerned about the deteriorating \nsituation in Iraq. We need to change course. Let me urge my colleagues \nto consider a few principles for where I believe we should go from \nhere.\n  Like my colleagues, I have received an outpouring of letters, e-\nmails, telephone calls. Montanans are split in how Americans should \nproceed, but one thing is clear: They all want to see an end to it. \nThey want to see our men and women come home.\n  On October 20, a man from Cutbank, MT wrote me to say:\n\n       Yesterday was a very emotional day for me. I currently have \n     a son serving in Iraq who does house-to-house raids and goes \n     out on extended missions. My other son, who just joined the \n     Army, informed me that he too will now be leaving for Iraq. \n     As native Americans, my sons will be honored when they return \n     home. We are proud of them. We are very proud of our native \n     Americans who serve as warriors, but I am deeply concerned \n     with what they face every day over there.\n\n  Amber, a military wife from Great Falls, MT writes:\n\n       I realize that my voice is a voice of millions that call \n     for your assistance. However, I couldn't sleep at night \n     knowing I didn't at least try to do what I think is right. My \n     husband along with many others here in Montana is in Iraq \n     right now, and just recently we lost a soldier from Billings. \n     Help us bring the troops home where they belong with their \n     families who miss them.\n\n  In September, Tom Gignoux, from Missoula, MT, a Marine Corps veteran \nwith a Purple Heart wrote me to say this:\n\n       I no longer support the war in Iraq. I believe that \n     mismanagement of the occupation and reconstruction has made \n     the war unwinnable and is distracting us from the war on \n     terrorism.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe it is time for our combat troops to come \nhome from Iraq. America entered into this war with motivations that \nwere clearly honorable, but they were mistaken. As the 9/11 Commission \nfound, there was no connection between Iraq and the attacks on 9/11. \nThere were no weapons of mass destruction. And the theory that America \ncould, through invading Iraq, establish democracy that would spread \nthroughout the region has proven a cruel joke.\n  If we knew then what we know now, I would not have voted for the war. \nIf we knew then what we know now, I believe the results of that vote \nwould have been different. Indeed, I doubt that we would even be asked \nto take that vote.\n  The administration was not up front with us. They presented faulty \nintelligence and faulty information, especially about weapons of mass \ndestruction. Unfortunately, the quality of congressional decisionmaking \nwas no better than the quality of the information upon which we relied.\n  Going into Iraq was a mistake. The premise was wrong. After September \n11, 2001, we had international support to go after al-Qaida and to find \nOsama bin Laden. That is the mission we should be strongly pursuing--\nmore strongly. Our resources are incorrectly being exhausted in Iraq. I \ncannot go back and change that vote, but I can work in a new direction.\n  I first commend our troops. They are wonderful. They have shown such \ncourage, such exemplary strength. They are terrific. They removed the \ntyrant Saddam Hussein. They addressed the potential threat of weapons \nof mass destruction. They have done their job well. We are all proud of \nthem. Their service has been outstanding. No one can argue against \ntheir contribution to our national security, and their dedication to \ntheir missions goes unmatched.\n  I believe in giving our soldiers, sailors, and airmen the proper \nequipment and tools they need to stay safe and to succeed. A year ago, \nI spoke about our responsibility to get as much funding as possible for \nthe troops. I have criticized spending on high-tech weapons systems at \nthe expense of boots on the ground. I voted in favor of every Defense \nbill and war supplemental since the war began.\n  I heard of families hosting bake sales to buy body armor. I have \ntried to do everything I could to protect our troops. But it is no \nlonger enough.\n  Now our brave troops stand in the crossfire of a civil war. We have \nlost more than 3,000 troops in the escalating conflict. Just this week, \nthe Iraqi Health Ministry reported that more than 17,000 Iraqis died in \nthe second half of 2006. That is more than three times as many who died \nin the first half of 2006. And now, America has spent more time \nfighting this war than we spent in World War II.\n  I understand and sympathize with the Americans who continue to \nsupport this war because they do not want their family and friends to \nhave died in vain. I know what they feel. I struggled with that last \nsummer when my nephew Phillip died in Iraq. On July 29, Marine Cpl \nPhillip Baucus, my brother John's son, was killed during combat \noperations in the Al Anbar province. He was just 28 years old. Phillip \nwas a bright and dedicated young man. He was like a son to me. He had a \nloving wife and a bright future. His death was devastating.\n  I know what it is like to wait on the flight line at Dover Air Force \nBase. I know what it is like to weep over the body of a fallen soldier \nand family member. I know what it is like to escort Phillip back from \nDover to Montana. I know what it is like to pray for a reason, and to \nbecome determined not to lose.\n  I am not the only Montanan who has grieved. We are not a large State, \nbut 14 Montanans have so far lost their lives in Iraq, and we grieve \nfor them all. In fact, we in Montana send more troops to Iraq on a per \ncapita basis than any other State in the Nation. Those men and women \nwho have lost their lives have served a noble purpose. They have taught \nus lessons in courage, and we honor that courage by speaking out. We \nhonor that courage by admitting that what we are doing is not working, \nand we honor that courage by finding a new direction.\n  A change in strategy is not defeat. A change in strategy is a \nrecognition that things are not working. Moving forward, I urge the \nPresident and the Congress to consider four principles. First, we must \nnot escalate the conflict. Second, we must train Iraqis to stand up for \nthemselves. Third, we must start bringing our troops home by the middle \nof this year. Fourth, we must engage Iraq's neighbors and the world \ncommunity to find a more political solution.\n\n  Let me explain in greater detail. First, I do not support the \nescalation in the number of American troops. Throwing more troops at \nthe problem--especially a modest number, up to 20,000--is not a \nsolution. Escalating the war is not a solution. We must not launch a \nstrategy which has no benchmarks for its success. How long and at what \ncost do we add troops to the conflict? It is a mistake.\n  The Iraq Study Group is a prestigious and well-respected group. \nSecretary of Defense Robert Gates was a member. The study group said \nthe current strategy in Iraq is not working. That is what this study \nsays. But to this date, the President has not implemented any of the \ngroup's recommendations.\n  President Bush has stated numerous times that he listens to the \ncommanders on the ground. American commanders on the ground have \nreported that al-Qaida has increasingly gained political influence \namong the Sunnis. General Abizaid told the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee:\n\n       I believe that more American forces prevent Iraqis from \n     doing more, from taking responsibility for their own future.\n\n  I urge the President to listen to what General Abizaid said and not \njust replace commanders who say things he does not want to hear.\n\n[[Page S326]]\n\n  Second, we should not have an open-ended commitment in Iraq. America \nmust make that clear to the Iraqi Government. The war is now costing us \n$2 billion a week. That is $2 billion a week that is not being devoted \nto health care, veterans' benefits, or education.\n  There must be a more specific plan. The plan needs to outline how \nlong our training efforts will continue, and the plan needs to show at \nwhat point the Iraqis will take over security of their own country.\n  Last weekend, Iraq's Prime Minister, Nuri al-Maliki, reiterated the \nneed and his commitment to getting the Iraqi security forces to stand \nup on their own two feet. America should support these efforts. In \nshort, our forces should stand down so the Iraqi forces can stand up.\n  Third, with a new focus on political solutions, the United States \nshould start phased redeployment of combat troops in roughly 6 months, \nwith the goal of having combat forces out of Iraq as soon as possible. \nOur troops are stretched too thin to address emerging threats around \nthe world. There is something called opportunity cost. It is a \ntechnical term. But we are so focused on Iraq that we are not paying \nattention to other trouble spots in the world as much as we should. We \nmust not focus solely on Iraq in blindness to the rest of the world.\n  Our troops are serving their third and fourth tours in Iraq. Some \ndeployments have been extended for 12 to 18 months. Some troops no \nlonger have a year to spend at home between deployments. I have seen \nfirsthand in Montana how the Guard and Reserves are deployed in record \nnumbers. They have served honorably and with my great admiration. But \nwe need them on U.S. soil for homeland defense missions. The Active-\nDuty troops must not be overextended. They need to be ready to deploy \naround the world.\n  Finally, America must engage Iraq's neighbors more than we have. The \nIraq Study Group named a peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict \nas a major potential contributor to the stability in Iraq. I strongly \nagree with that. That will take so much of the terrorists' energy out \nof their sails, frankly, if we could find a meaningful solution to the \nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. The Iraq Study Group said:\n\n       The United States cannot achieve its goals in the Middle \n     East unless it deals directly with the Arab-Israeli conflict \n     and regional stability.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       There must be renewed and sustained commitment by the \n     United States to a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace on all \n     fronts.\n\n  We have taken too many steps backward in that conflict. Our invasion \nof Iraq has simply stirred up things way too much. It has caused \nproblems. America's presence has opened the doors to terrorism and \nsectarian violence.\n  We must reengage and work toward peace and diplomatic solutions. We \nmust seek increased participation of other nations both in a political \nway forward and also in reconstruction work. We should redouble our \nefforts to reach out to that nation and to our allies who also have an \nintense interest in peace in that region and work together toward a \nresponsible exit.\n  In March of 1919, the Emir of Iraq, Feisal ibn Hussein, wrote to \nSupreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter. This is what he said:\n\n       We feel that Arabs and Jews are cousins in race, having \n     suffered similar oppressions at the hands of powers stronger \n     than themselves, and by happy coincidence they have been able \n     to take the first step toward the mutual attainment of their \n     national ideals together. . . .Indeed, I think neither can be \n     a real success without the other. . . .I look forward . . . \n     to a future in which we will help you and you will help us, \n     so that the countries in which we are mutually interested may \n     once again take their places in the community of civilized \n     peoples in the world.\n\n  That is what the Emir of Iraq wrote in 1919.\n  America must renew its commitment to peace in the Middle East. We \nmust work to regain the fleeting sense of optimism that can lead to \npolitical resolution. We must be positive. We must be the leaders that \nwe Americans are. We must work to stop the spilling of blood in the \nland of Abraham.\n  I urge President Bush to listen to the Iraq Study Group. I urge him \nto listen to commanders such as General Abizaid. I urge him to listen \nto the American people. It is time for America to change its course. It \nis time for a new political effort. It is time to bring the troops \nhome.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Prescription Drugs\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am back here today, as I have been \nother days this week, to talk about the Medicare drug benefit and the \ndebate about whether the Government would do a better job of \nnegotiating with drug companies than the prescription drug plans that \nare doing so this very day under law of the last 2\\1/2\\ years. Over the \npast 2 days, I have talked about the fundamental structure of the drug \nbenefit. I talked about the heart of it, of the drug benefit plan, as \ncompetition. Plans, with vast experience in negotiating with drug \nmanufacturers, compete to get the best drug prices for Medicare. That \nis what is happening today to benefit our senior citizens. Plans that \nhave been doing this for 50 years are negotiating with drug companies \nin a competitive way to get the best prices for Medicare senior \ncitizens. To date, the proof is in the pudding. We have lower bids, we \nhave lower beneficiary premiums, lower costs to the Government, and \nlower costs to our States. Most importantly, we have lower prices on \ndrugs, meaning senior citizens get affordable drugs and low-income \npeople do not have to choose between drugs and food. Remember, that was \na goal we had in 2003 we passed this legislation.\n\n  I will give some examples of how this competition has worked. A draft \nPricewaterhouseCoopers study found in 2006 prescription drug plans \nachieved higher savings, 29 percent compared to unmanaged drug benefit \nexpenditures. That is almost 100 percent greater than the 15-percent \nsavings projected by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and \nalmost 50 percent greater than the savings estimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office way back when, in 2003, when we all thought \nif this program worked at all there would be some savings on \nprescription drugs for seniors. However, it has turned out to be much \ngreater savings than we anticipated when we wrote the bill.\n  It isn't often that legislation we write comes back with a better \nbenefit to the taxpayers, better benefit to our seniors or any group or \npopulation. Most often there are what we call cost overruns.\n  I believe it is fair to say that competition is working.\n  Yesterday, I talked about how this whole debate is based on nothing \nmore than a distortion of language in what is called the \nnoninterference clause in the existing legislation. This \nnoninterference language was first included in legislation introduced \nby many of the same people now opposing it, and these people tend to be \nled by Members of the Democratic Party.\n  To be clear, that language, the noninterference language that people \nnow are questioning, that period of time between 1999 and 2003, bills \nintroduced by Members in the other party included this language and \nnow, somehow, they do not like it.\n  I want to be clear that the impressions left by opponents of this \npart of the legislation that we do not have competition, we do not have \nnegotiations, this language in the legislation does not prohibit \nnegotiations to get drug prices down. Negotiations occur between \nprivate plans and the drug manufacturers regularly. You could not get \nthose percentage decreases in prices I just mentioned--those \npercentages that are even greater than percentages we thought when we \nwrote the legislation--you would not get those without negotiation, you \nwould not get those without competition.\n  I, also, pointed out in earlier speeches, so far, proposals to have \nthe Secretary of HHS negotiate drug prices have not been shown to \nactually save\n\n[[Page S327]]\n\nany money. Our beloved Congressional Budget Office tells us that they \ncannot project savings by having a Government bureaucrat negotiate \ninstead of plans negotiating. Nevertheless, here we are, in the new \nCongress, discussing this matter once again.\n  What I want to do today is put forward a picture of what Government \nnegotiations might look like. Admittedly, doing this will require some \nspeculation. Why is that necessary? It is necessary because Democrats \nhave not provided many details on how they actually envision their \nrequirement that the Secretary negotiate how that will work. This is \ndespite the fact that some opponents of the noninterference clause have \ndemagoged this issue for nearly 3 years. After 3 years, they are still \nout there saying the noninterference clause ought to go, but there are \nno details on how their plan will work. They have given us a few clues \nas to their thinking on how they want it to work.\n  For the longest time, I heard it said that the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services should have the power to negotiate drug prices, as \nthe Veterans' Administration does. With the Veterans' Administration as \nour guide, let's talk about the VA's approach to purchasing drugs and \nthen ask you to consider, after you hear this, do you want to do it \nthat way? This discussion will be somewhat technical, but I urge \nlisteners to bear with me because we need to get beyond the Veteran's \nAdministration sound bite. Everyone needs to have a good understanding \nof what this would mean for Medicare.\n  It is a fact that the Veterans' Administration uses different \npurchasing arrangements to get discounts on prescription drugs. But \nthere is a big distinction between these purchasing arrangements. The \nVeterans' Administration has access to what we call the Federal supply \nschedule prices. Under the Federal supply schedule prices, the \nGovernment guarantees by law that it must get the best price in the \nmarketplace. This means that the Federal supply schedule prices cannot \nexceed the lowest price that a manufacturer gives in comparable terms \nand conditions to a non-Federal customer such as the pharmacy benefit \nmanager. Since that is technical, I will go over that once more. Under \nthe Federal supply schedule, the Government guarantees by law that it \nmust get the best price in the marketplace. But what this means is that \nthe Federal supply schedule prices cannot exceed the lowest price that \na manufacturer gives under comparable terms and conditions to a non-\nFederal customer, and that could include health plans, pharmacy benefit \nmanagers, and many others. Under Federal law, manufacturers must list \ntheir drug on the supply schedule to qualify for reimbursement under \nMedicaid.\n  Next, the VA can purchase drugs at the Federal ceiling price. Again, \nthe Government passed a law to guarantee itself an automatic discount \nno one else can get. By law, that price is automatically 24 percent \nless than the average price paid by basically all non-Federal \npurchasers.\n  Isn't that a nice negotiating tactic? Pass a law and guarantee \nyourself a discount. The logical questions are, why not have Medicare \naccess the Federal supply schedule--because people who want to do it \nsuch as the VA, that is where it takes you. Why not give Medicare the \nFederal ceiling price?\n\n  I will refer to a chart because experts have looked at this question, \nand we have assigned the Government Accountability Office to look into \nthis. They had a year 2000 report on this. They say:\n\n       Mandating that federal prices for outpatient prescription \n     drugs be extended to a large group of purchasers, such as \n     Medicare beneficiaries, could lower the prices they pay but \n     raise prices for others.\n\n  In other words, raising prices for everybody else in America that is \npurchasing drugs. You heard that right: Raise prices on everybody else.\n  Who would face the higher prices under ``everybody else''? Small \nbusinesses, their employees, their families, to name a few. Those \nhigher prices would likely force employers to reduce their prescription \ndrug benefit or stop providing health insurance coverage altogether. Of \ncourse, that is an outcome I surely hope people want to avoid, but it \nmay be an outcome that the proponents of doing away with the \nnoninterference clause are not aware of. Or the people that are saying \nwe ought to follow the VA practice may not be aware, that to save the \ntaxpayers some money you are going to raise the price of drugs on \neverybody else in America, according to the Government Accountability \nOffice.\n  The Government Accountability Office reached its conclusion by \nexamining what happened to drug prices after Congress required drug \nmanufacturers to pay rebates to State Medicaid Programs such as the \nFederal supply schedule, the Medicaid rebate program guarantees that \nthe Government gets the best price in the marketplace.\n  What happened after the law was enacted? The best prices went up for \neveryone else. The practical effect was twofold: First, the size of \nrebates for State Medicare Programs got smaller. What the Federal \nGovernment wanted to accomplish to benefit the States did not happen. \nSecond, other purchasers paid higher prices. One might ask why that \nmight happen. Here is why: Drugmakers had to eliminate their best \nprices to private purchasers or face bigger rebates. That happens \nbecause if they gave 1 purchaser a best price, they then had to give \nthe best price to 50 State Medicaid purchasers. One discount to a \nprivate purchaser could mean millions that a manufacturer would be \nforced to pay in rebates to the Government.\n  What do you think the drug companies did to counteract a well-\nintentioned act of Congress which ended with unintended consequences? \nThe drug companies eliminated all the deep discounts so that they did \nnot have to pay as much in mandatory rebates to Medicaid.\n  A 1996 study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office examined \nthe extent to which the Medicaid laws result in higher drug prices to \neveryone else. Listen to what our Congressional Budget Office \nconcluded:\n\n       Best price discounts have fallen from an average of over 36 \n     percent in 1991 to 19 percent in 1994. Hence, although the \n     Medicaid rebate appears on the surface to be attractive, it \n     may have had unintended consequences for private purchasers.\n\n  The Federal Government passes a law to do good, and we find out we \nend up not doing so good. Almost a 50-percent reduction in best-price \ndiscounts; is that good? A nearly 50-percent reduction in the discounts \nreceived by purchasers such as health plans that serve employers and \ntheir employees; is that good? Of course, it is not. What this means is \nwhen those deep discounts went away, the price that everyone else pays \nfor drugs went up. So those mandates, rebates to Medicaid made drug \nprices for everyone else higher.\n  Talk about unintended consequences. And we in the Senate who set \nthese things up had the right intentions for doing it, but it has not \nworked out--unless you want to look at the good it did to the Federal \nTreasury and not count or not discount the harm it did to everyone else \nwho paid higher prices.\n  To state it more simply, when discounts to a large purchasing group \nare based on discounts to another, no one gets a good discount. That is \nwhat the Government Accountability Office said in its 2000 report:\n\n       Extending the Federal Supply Schedule . . . could also \n     raise the prices paid by private and federal purchasers, as \n     increases in prices, manufacturers charged their best \n     customers would, in turn, increase Federal Supply Schedule \n     prices.\n\n  Would opponents of the noninterference clause believe the \ncongressional agencies, such as the CBO and the Government \nAccountability Office, that striking the noninterference clause would \nnot be good? Ironic, isn't it, when the Government used price controls \nto mandate discounts to itself, it actually makes prices go up. I will \ngo through that again. When the Government uses price controls to \nmandate discounts to itself, it actually makes prices go up. No person \nin their right mind concerned about the Federal Treasury or concerned \nabout the cost of drugs to people in this country would say that meets \nthe commonsensical test. But that is what happens.\n\n  During a 2001 hearing before the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, my colleague, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Arlen \nSpecter, posed a question on this very matter. He asked whether adding \nMedicare to the VA and Department of Defense purchasing mix would \nproduce greater\n\n[[Page S328]]\n\nbulk discounts. The Veterans' Administration chief consultant for its \nPharmacy Benefits Management Strategic Health Group answered that \nadding Medicare to the Federal Supply Schedule umbrella would result in \nincreased drug prices for both the Veterans' Administration and the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  So, now, in addition to the Government Accountability Office and the \nCongressional Budget Office, the Veterans' Administration weighs in for \nitself, and the Department of Defense, that doing what repealers of the \nnoninterference clause want to do will actually increase drug prices to \nthe Veterans' Administration and the DOD. And people want to use the \nVeterans' Administration as a pattern to affect Medicare. So that is \nsaying it for the third time.\n  If I could say it for another time, straight from the Veterans' \nAdministration's mouth, itself: Extending VA prices to Medicare would \nmake the VA's own drug prices increase.\n  And for one last time, the basic point they are making is, if you try \nto mandate discounts to everyone, then--what I have said a few minutes \nago--no one gets a discount. Now, I am no economist, but that is basic \neconomics. And not only that but it is common sense.\n  I think I have pretty much laid out why including Medicare in the \nFederal Supply Schedule is not as good an idea as its proponents may \nhave made it out to be.\n  So now I want to go back to how the Veterans' Administration uses \ncompetitive bidding to get the discounts they say they want to use as a \npattern for the Medicare Program.\n  Let me start by giving you an important piece of information. The \nVeterans' Administration has its own pharmacy benefits manager. More \nthan a decade ago, as part of a major initiative to improve the care \ndelivered, the Veterans' Administration formed a pharmacy benefits \nmanager, better known around here as a PBM.\n  So you will probably wonder why they did that. Because, as stated in \nthe VA news release, they wanted to maximize a strategy used by the \nprivate sector. You have people who want to have Medicare do it like \nthe VA does it, but the VA set up a very special program because they \nwanted to learn something from the private sector.\n  A primary responsibility of the PBM for the Veterans' Administration \nwas to develop a national formulary. The Government learned that from \nthe private sector, the very same people they are finding complaints \nabout now. They wanted to set up a national formulary.\n  A formulary is the list of drugs that a plan will cover. Basically, \nif your drug is not on the list, it is not covered.\n  A 2005 article in the American Journal of Managed Care, coauthored by \nthe Veterans' Administration's staff and university-based researchers, \nstated that the Veterans' Administration created the national formulary \nto achieve two main goals.\n  First, the Veterans' Administration wanted to reduce the variation in \naccess to drugs across its many facilities throughout the United \nStates. In other words, they wanted to put a VA bureaucrat between the \ndoctor and the patient. Doctors could not subscribe to everything that \nthey thought that patient might need because if it was not on the \nformulary, they could not prescribe it.\n  Second, the VA wanted to use the formulary as leverage to get lower \nprices for drugs. Let me repeat that because it is important. The \nVeterans' Administration created a national formulary to create the \nleverage it needed to get lower prices for drugs.\n  That goes back to the point I made a couple days ago. The ability to \nget good discounts does not result from the sheer number of people a \npurchaser buys for. The ability to get good discounts comes from how \nthe purchaser leverages those numbers. That leverage comes from a \npurchaser threatening to exclude a drug from the formulary. So it \neventually comes down to threats.\n  The Veterans' Administration uses its formulary to say: Give me a \nbetter price or else--or else we are not going to buy your drugs at \nall.\n  As I said earlier, the Veterans' Administration was intentionally \nadopting a private sector strategy when it started using a formulary to \nget lower drug prices. The Medicare prescription drug plans also use \nformularies to negotiate lower drug prices. The most important thing \nabout the VA formulary is that it is one big national formulary.\n  The biggest difference between the VA and Medicare is that \nbeneficiaries have choices.\n  Let me make that clear. The biggest difference between how the VA \ndoes it and how the plans do it--the plans that are approved by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services for the senior citizens of \nAmerica and Medicare--the biggest difference is the beneficiaries have \nchoices. They can choose their plans with different formularies. So \nMedicare bureaucrats are not coming between the patient and the doctor \nlike VA bureaucrats are coming between the patient and the doctor. You \ncan run into this in your town meetings because I had people come up to \nme and complain about the VA: My doctor says I ought to have this drug \nbecause the drug that the VA wants me to take has side effects.\n  And they come to me and say: How come the VA won't pay for this drug \nbecause it is better for me, according to my doctor?\n  And their answer is: Because the VA wants to save money. So you have \na Government bureaucrat deciding what is best for your health instead \nof your doctor.\n  But the principle behind the prescription drug bill that Senator \nBaucus and I wrote was that we were not going to have the bureaucrat \ngetting in the medicine cabinet of a person, of senior citizens. We \nwanted every therapy available. That is the way it is written, and that \nis the way it is being carried out. So I wonder if people who say you \nought to change this and do it the way the VA does it know how you are \nnegatively affecting the senior citizens of America.\n  The way senior citizens can do it is they have choice. They can \nenroll in a plan that covers their drugs. They can enroll in a plan \nthat allows them to use their neighborhood pharmacy. The VA does not do \nbusiness with every pharmacist in America. So you are hurting your \nlocal pharmacist when you do business that way.\n\n  Under the Veterans' Administration programs, veterans do not have a \nchoice. They cannot choose a different plan, and they have to use the \nVA's own pharmacy, not the pharmacy down the street. Using a limited \nnumber of VA-controlled pharmacies and mail-order pharmacies also helps \nkeep VA costs down.\n  But one of the things we wanted to accomplish in the prescription \ndrug bill, Part D, was to make sure the Government did not use its \nleverage to hurt local pharmacists. And we put several things in--a \nrequirement you had to have a brick-and-motor pharmacist in every plan. \nSo we have some requirements to help pharmacies that the VA does not \neven worry about. And I have to confess to the community pharmacists of \nAmerica, we still have a lot of work to do to help them so they benefit \nfrom this program like we intended. There are some unintended \nconsequences to what we did, even considering the fact we took the \ncommunity pharmacists into consideration.\n  Under the VA program, then, you do not have a local pharmacist to go \nto. When they do not use the local pharmacist the way we do, when they \nuse all these mail-order pharmacies, they hurt the local pharmacist, \nbut they are saving some money.\n  Also, there is limited access to drugs, limited access to retail \npharmacies. That is how the VA works. So do you want to force that upon \nthe senior citizens of America?\n  I would like to go to another chart now. The Los Angeles Times put it \nbest in an article on November 27 of last year. According to the Los \nAngeles Times:\n\n       VA officials can negotiate major price discounts because \n     they restrict the number of drugs on their coverage list. . . \n     .In other words, the VA offers lower drug prices but fewer \n     choices.\n\n  So do you want to offer fewer choices to our seniors? That is not \nwhat we wanted when we wrote the Medicare bill. We wanted to keep CMS \nbureaucrats out of the Medicare medicine cabinet of every senior \ncitizen.\n  So what would it mean if the Government negotiated lower drug prices \nfor Medicare in a national system like the Veterans' Administration? It \nwould\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\nmean having a more limited formulary. And it would mean having the \nVeterans' Administration bureaucrat between you and your doctor.\n  So I would go to a chart that would make this more picturesque and \nmore clear to you. This chart shows what this would mean. It would mean \nthat instead of having 4,300 drugs available to them, beneficiaries \nwould have about 1,200 drugs available. If Medicare used a national \nformulary like the VA, it would mean that 70 percent of the \nprescription drugs could not be covered by Medicare. Only 30 percent of \nthe drugs covered today would be covered.\n  Then let's get into some specific drugs, about major problems we are \ntrying to treat today, such as diabetes or cholesterol. There, too, if \nthe Government negotiated for Medicare like it does for VA, it would \nmean fewer drugs covered by Medicare.\n  In the case of treatment for depression: 65 percent covered; 35 \npercent not covered. In the case of treatment for high cholesterol: 54 \npercent covered, 46 percent not covered. It seems that by looking at \nthese drugs, if the Government used the VA model, our senior citizens \nwould not be as well served.\n  Now, maybe you can make an argument we are not treating our veterans \nright. We appropriate more money every year for veterans health \nprograms. And we have to because the needs are there and we made a \npromise. We have to keep the promise to the veterans. But I think \nveterans watching this could say: Well, why not cover these? Why not \ncover these? Well, I have given the reason. We want to save taxpayers \nmoney. But it is completely opposite what we wanted to accomplish under \nthe Medicare bill to serve our senior citizens: everything being \navailable, and to save the taxpayers money through competitive bidding.\n  This could also mean that beneficiaries could not get their \nprescriptions filled at the most convenient pharmacy for them. That is \nnot what we wanted when writing the bill. We put seniors first. Those \nwho want to repeal it, it seems to me, they are putting bureaucrats \nfirst, or at least they are putting bureaucrats between the doctor and \nthe senior citizen. In many cases, those realities have led Medicare-\neligible veterans to enroll in Medicare drug programs so they will have \ncoverage for drugs not covered by the VA.\n  When I held my town meetings as we were rolling out this new drug \nprogram, I had veterans say: Well, does this mean I have to get out of \nthe veterans program?\n  I said: If you are satisfied with the veterans program, you can stay \nin it. You do not have to do anything. If you decide later on you want \nto get into one of these programs, you can do it without penalty.\n  So they had the best of both worlds. If they were satisfied with the \nVA, keep it. But we have evidence that some of them are leaving the VA \nprogram to join the program of Part D Medicare. Even though many \nveterans have very good drug coverage, almost 40 percent of the \nveterans with VA benefits and Medicare coverage are enrolled in Part D. \nSo when you get beyond the easy sound bites, when you get to the facts, \napplying the VA system to Medicare is neither as easy as it sounds nor \nwill it likely have the effect that the proponents suggest.\n  It now appears that even they have begun to figure this out because \nnow, when the rubber hits the road, when they have to produce \nsomething, they introduce a bill--and I am referring now to a bill of \nthe other body--that explicitly prohibits the Secretary from creating a \nformulary.\n  In fact, the Los Angeles Times reported last week that a House \nDemocratic leadership aide said, ``We felt we couldn't go as far as the \nVeterans Affairs [Department] does.''\n  Under the House Democrats bill, Medicare can't have a formulary. As I \ntried to make clear here today, the drug formulary is the key to \nnegotiating lower drug prices. The House Democrats bill prohibits the \nGovernment from having a national formulary. No formulary means no \nnegotiations, no leverage over drug companies. In reality, the \nDemocratic proposal on negotiation actually prohibits the Government \nfrom negotiating. Under their plan for Government negotiation, the \nGovernment won't be able to say no to a drug company. With no formulary \nto bargain with, the drug companies could say something like this: No, \nwhy should I give you that price if you can't exclude me or charge \nhigher cost sharing?\n  At the same time, the House Democrats bill repeals the prohibition on \nthe Government setting a pricing structure. So if the Government cannot \nnegotiate because it can't have a formulary, if there is no prohibition \non Government price structure, where does that leave us? Sounds like \nprice controls to me. Experience shows that when the Government sets \nprices for itself, when it gives itself mandatory discount, prices go \nup for everyone, higher prices for everyone else. Why would anyone want \nthat sort of a situation?\n  Everyone always asks, why not have Medicare work like the VA program \nto get lower drug prices. I think I have laid out why that idea might \nnot be as good as the proponents have made it sound. Having Medicare \nwork like the VA could mean fewer drugs covered, restricted access to \ncommunity pharmacies, more use of mail-order pharmacies and higher drug \nprices for everyone else. I can't imagine that is what people want.\n  So where does that leave us? The Medicare plans are working today. I \nsay that based upon several polls that show 80 or so percent of the \nseniors are satisfied. The plans are also delivering the benefits to \nMedicare beneficiaries. These private sector plans have the experience \nof negotiating better prices. These Medicare negotiators have proven \ntheir ability to get lower prices. The Medicare plans are negotiating \nwith drug companies using drug formularies within the rules set by law, \nand the formularies are basic for that negotiation.\n  Last week on the Senate floor, the Senator from Illinois said that \nthe law ``took competition out of the program so that [the drug \ncompanies] could charge whatever they want.'' That is not true. We have \nthe 50-year experience of the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program \nnegotiating for every Federal employee to keep costs down to the \ncitizen as well as to the taxpayers. We patterned it something like \nthat. And quite frankly, when we patterned it for the senior citizens \nunder Medicare, I wasn't entirely sure we would get all the plans \ninterested, that we would have the competition we ended up having. It \nhas worked beyond our expectation. And thank God it did, because I am \nnot sure we had that kind of expectation out of it. But it sure worked. \nThank God something worked a little bit better than we anticipated it \nwould work.\n  So we had a Senator saying that we took competition out of the \nprogram. Competition is what this program is all about, and that \ncompetition is working. Costs are lower. Premiums are lower. Let me \nquantify how premiums are lower, because when we were writing the bill \nin 2003, we were figuring at what price, somewhere between $35 and $40 \na month, could we get seniors to join. Over that, we would have \nproblems. Competition has brought it in at $23 last year and $22 this \nyear on average. So these organizations remain in the best position to \nget lower prices for Medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, having recently returned from another \nvisit to Iraq serving as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I \ncome to the floor this afternoon to express my views on the most \npressing issue facing our country today: our path to success in Iraq. \nThe Iraq Study Group recently stated the situation in Iraq is grave and \ndeteriorating. When the current path isn't working, you have to be \nflexible. You have to shift. You have to make a change. And, clearly, \nin Iraq today we have to make a change. The President of the United \nStates, on Friday, said the same thing.\n  In December I met with Iraqi political leaders, U.S. troops and their \nleaders, as well as our diplomats on the ground. Our conversations with \nthis broad range of individuals helped me draw various conclusions that \nare key to evaluating the proposals currently being debated. In light \nof the President's upcoming announcement of his strategy for Iraq, I \nthink it is important to share these conclusions.\n  It is easy to lose sight of the fact that we are in Iraq as part of a \nGlobal War on Terror. There is no question that Iraq has become the key \nbattleground of this war. Failure cannot be an option in either the \noverall war on terror or in Iraq. As the President has correctly \nstated, this is the battle of this generation. With menacing regimes in \nIran and Syria, we cannot dismiss the fact that a failed state in Iraq \nwould lead to much more than chaos and collapse in that nation. It \nwould destabilize a critical region of the world and, most alarmingly, \nwould create a breeding ground for terrorists whose ambitions do not \nstop at Iraq's borders. Americans--all Americans--have a direct stake \nin winning this war.\n  We know the United States will be involved in the war on terror for \nthe foreseeable future. The question is, How do we move forward in \nIraq? How do we fight this war? And, where do we put our troops?\n  From my experience in Iraq, I know now, or at least I believe, that \nwe are fighting it essentially on two fronts. The first is the war we \nintended to fight: a war against terrorists, primarily Sunni extremists \nand foreign jihadists linked to al-Qaida--foreign terrorists. The other \nwar is a war between the Iraqis themselves: Shiite against Sunni, in a \nseemingly endless cycle of grisly violence. Our military must continue \nthe battle against extremists and terrorists, but we have no business \nbeing caught in the crossfires of an Iraqi sectarian conflict.\n  The good news is we have had great success in fighting the war on \nterror, imposing crippling losses on the international jihadist network \nwhich today operates in Iraq. Indeed, during my visit in December with \nmarines from Minnesota stationed in Anbar, they reported they were \nmaking great headway against the insurgency there. I am proud of their \naccomplishments, and I firmly believe these military victories directly \nenhance our security at home. But to secure the ground that these \nmarines have cleared of insurgents in places such as Fallujah, they \nneed Sunni police officers. They need Sunni members of the Iraqi Army. \nThey need reconciliation between Sunni and Shia. So as we continue to \nfight the first war, the war against terrorists, we need also to \naddress the second war, that of Iraqi against Iraqi.\n  The overall consensus I found in Iraq is that we will be unable to \nhold on to the ground we have gained on the first front without \naddressing the second front: Iraqi sectarian violence. This violence is \nspiraling rapidly and is undermining the success we have made against \nthe terrorists. If the Iraqi security forces, both Army and police, are \nto someday soon take over the fighting of the insurgency from U.S. \ntroops, it is clear that intergroup violence must be brought under \ncontrol. The Iraqi security forces must include all Iraqis: Sunni, \nShiite, Kurd, and others. To be certain, our efforts cannot succeed if \nsectarian hatred is not addressed at the highest level of the Iraqi \nGovernment immediately.\n  The only long-term solution for bringing stability to Iraq must be \ncentered on national reconciliation. It is true that after decades of \nSunni violence led by Saddam Hussein and his regime, the Shiites still \nhave unaddressed grievances. But this does not call for, nor permit, \nneighborhood-by-neighborhood ethnic cleansing, nor a refusal to work \ntogether for the future of all Iraqis. Shiites may be able to win \nshort-term victories through the use of violence, but in the long term \nthey will not have a unified country if they continue to do so. Iraqi \nleaders should focus on reining in all sectarian groups under the \numbrella of a national and inclusive political process. This is a \nsolution that can only be led by the Iraqis themselves.\n  With no doubt, this sectarian violence was left to grow unchecked for \nfar too long. Even so, it is not too late to get Iraq back to stable \nfooting. But it will come from dialogue and political compromise \nenforced by a central government prepared to take on militias under the \ncontrol of religious sects, clans, and even common criminals. We must \nget to the point where Iraqi citizens express their views through \npolitical channels instead of through violence. The Iraqis are the \nmasters of their own destiny, and it is important that our strategy \nregard them as such.\n  Since my trip to Iraq in December, I have been calling for the Iraqi \nGovernment to establish a series of benchmarks that will diffuse the \nsectarian violence and stabilize the country politically and \neconomically. These benchmarks would include an oil revenue-sharing \nagreement and economic assistance to areas that have been neglected in \nthe past. The reality is not putting resources in Anbar Province \nbecause it is Sunni, and so as a result, what you get is a feeding of \ninsurgency by the actions of a government that has not been prepared to \naddress the issue of sectarian violence. We will be a better supporter \nof the Iraqi Government if we pressure them to create and adhere to \nthese benchmarks rather than assuming that this fractured Government \nwill take this on by themselves. I fear that up to this point the Iraqi \nleadership has not stepped up to the plate to make the difficult \ndecisions that are necessary to pave the road for a political solution.\n  When I was in Iraq with Senator Bill Nelson from Florida, we met with \nthe Iraqi National Security Adviser to Maliki, Dr. Rubaie, who \ncontended that sectarian violence wasn't the main problem, but the \nproblem was the foreign terrorists and was the Sunni insurgency. That \nis not the case. As a Senator responsible for looking after the best \ninterests of my constituents and all Americans, I take seriously the \nresponsibility of Iraqi political leaders to honor the sacrifices that \nare being made by American soldiers. I refuse to put more American \nlives on the line in Baghdad without being assured that the Iraqis \nthemselves are willing to do what they need to do to end the violence \nof Iraqi against Iraqi. If Iraq is to fulfill its role as a sovereign \nand democratic state, it must start acting like one. It is for this \nreason that I oppose the proposal for a troop surge. I oppose the \nproposal for a troop surge in Baghdad where violence can only be \ndefined as sectarian. A troop surge proposal basically ignores the \nconditions on the ground, both as I saw on my most recent trip and \nreports that I have been receiving regularly since my return. My \nconsultations with both military and Iraqi political leaders confirms \nthat an increase in troops in areas plagued by sectarian violence will \nnot solve the problem of sectarian hatred. A troop surge in Baghdad \nwould put more American troops at risk to address a problem that is not \na military problem. It will put more American soldiers in the \ncrosshairs of sectarian violence. It will create more targets. I just \ndon't believe that makes sense.\n  Again, I oppose a troop surge in Baghdad because I don't believe it \nis the path to victory or a strategy for victory in Iraq. I recognize \nthere are those who think otherwise. The Iraqi\n\n[[Page S331]]\n\nStudy Group, in their report, said that they could, however, support a \nshort-term deployment, a surge of American combat forces to stabilize \nBaghdad or to speed up the training and equipping mission if the U.S. \ncommander in Iraq determines that such standards would be effective.\n  I sat with the President with Democratic colleagues and Republican \ncolleagues. I know that he has weighed this heavily, and I know he has \nlooked at this issue for a long time. Apparently, he has come to the \nconclusion that, in fact, a troop surge would be helpful. I believe his \ncomments will contain--hopefully contain--discussions about benchmarks \nand contain a commitment to do those things to rebuild the economy and \ncreate jobs so that we get rid of some of the underlying causes and \nfrustrations that feed the insurgency. But the bottom line is, again, \nat this point in time, it is sectarian violence that I believe is the \nmajor issue that we face and more troops in Baghdad is not going to \nsolve that problem.\n  As one of the final conclusions to share of my experience in Iraq, I \nwould also like to emphasize the significant role of Iran in fomenting \ninstabilities. Across the board, my meetings with Iraqi officials \nrevealed that the Iranians are driving instability in Iraq by all means \nat their disposal. We had a hearing today in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and one of the speakers, one of the experts said that it may \nbe, and it is probably clear that, the Iranians have a stake in \nAmerican failure in Iraq and its stability in the region, and they feed \non that. Indeed, there are credible reports that Iran is currently \nsupplying money and weapons to both its traditional Shiite allies and \nits historic Sunni rivals, all for the purposes of ensuring a daily \ndeath toll of Iraqi citizens. It is clear the Iranians have concluded \nthat chaos in Iraq is in their direct interest. Iran's role thus far, \nnot to mention their pursuit of nuclear weapons, makes it hard to \nbelieve that they might suddenly become a constructive partner in the \nstabilization of Iraq.\n  I want to point out that my commitment to success in Iraq has not \nchanged, nor my willingness to consider options that would \nrealistically contribute toward our goals there. In my trips to Iraq, I \nhave gone with an open mind as to what next steps could be taken as we \nwork with the Iraqis to stabilize their country. I have said all along \nthat the stakes of our mission in Iraq are such that failure is simply \nnot an option, and I will only support proposals that will steer the \nUnited States toward victory. Abandoning Iraq today would precipitate \nan even greater surge of ethnic cleansing. It would, as I indicated \nbefore, precipitate an episode of instability and chaos in the region \nthat would be in no one's interest. But my most recent trip to Iraq \nalso reaffirmed to me that it is the Iraqis who must play the biggest \nrole in any strategy for success. Our investment must be tied to their \nwillingness to make the tough choices needed to pave the way to \nstability and for them to act on them.\n  I represent Minnesota, but if I represented Missouri, I think I would \nsimply say to Maliki: Show me. Show me your resolve. Show me your \ncommitment. Show me that you can, in fact, do the things that have to \nbe done to deal with the sectarian violence, and then we can talk about \nenhancing and increasing the American effort. I haven't seen it. I \ndon't see it today, and as such, I am certainly not willing to put more \nU.S. troops at risk.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss amendment No. 15, \nwhich is being offered by myself and the Senator from Illinois, Barack \nObama. The amendment is a very simple amendment but a very important \none as we undertake our effort to revise the ethics rules of the \nCongress. The amendment simply requires that each Senate committee and \nsubcommittee make available on the Internet either a video recording, \nan audio recording or a transcript of every meeting that is open and \nthat those documents be made public within 14 days of the meeting's \nadjournment, unless a majority of the committee members decide \notherwise.\n  I was surprised, frankly, to realize how difficult it is for all of \nour constituents to learn about the work we do in this Senate and \nCongress because most of that work occurs in the committees of our \nlegislative Chamber. Most of those committee meetings are not \nbroadcast. There are a few occasionally that get broadcast on C-SPAN or \nthat are picked up by one of the networks, but that is a rare \noccurrence. It is an exception to receive that kind of broadcast. So, \nas far as the public of the United States is concerned, most of the \nwork we do in committees--which is where most of the work actually \noccurs for our legislative activity--is work that actually occurs in \nthe dark.\n  While Senate rules require that committee meetings be open to the \npublic and that each committee prepare and keep a complete transcript \nor electronic recording of all of its meetings, it still remains very \ndifficult for citizens to figure out what actually goes on in our \ncommittee rooms. According to one estimate, a transcript or electronic \nrecording is available online for only about one-half of all Senate \ncommittee and subcommittee hearings. Only for one-half of those \nhearings is there made available a transcript that the public can \nactually access. That number is far too low. There is no reason why, in \nthis day of modern technology and communications, we should not be able \nto achieve a goal of 100 percent.\n  I know we often refer to Justice Brandeis because he was one of those \ngreat jurists who really illuminated our times with some of his wisdom, \nhis jewels that have become almost cliches that captured the moment. I \nremember Justice Brandeis's famous line where he said, ``Sunshine is \nsaid to be the best of disinfectants.''\n  Those words are as true now as ever. We have seen an unprecedented \nlevel of secrecy in the legislative process. We have seen one-party \nconference committees where, just because you happen to be of the other \nparty, you were not allowed to participate in the conference committee \nor you were not even notified that a conference committee was, in fact, \nmeeting. We have seen provisions that are slipped into conference \ncommittee reports that were not passed by either Chamber. Those kinds \nof procedures and tactics are often used. That kind of secrecy is\n\n[[Page S332]]\n\npart of what has caused a lack of confidence of the American people in \nour institutions in Washington, DC.\n  The time for secret government is over. This legislation we have been \nconsidering over the last several days, and hopefully will bring to \nconclusion this week or next week, will be a great first step in making \nsure we are returning government back to the people and integrity back \nto the processes which we oversee in the Congress.\n  I hope my colleagues can join us as we move forward with this \namendment. I will quickly add that the amendment will create no serious \nburden for the committees of our Senate. First, our committees will \nhave until October 1 of 2007 to adjust their practices. Second, they \nhave three options: They can do audio, they can do video, they can do \ntranscript--whichever option they choose--in order to comply with the \nprovisions of my amendment. Third, many of the committees are already \nposting this information online.\n  One central purpose of this bill is to improve transparency in the \nlegislative process. My amendment is an important step in that \ndirection. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank \nSenator Obama for his support of this amendment and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Mark \nPryor to offer an amendment to the ethics bill, the Effective \nProsecutions Act of 2007. Our amendment would strengthen the tools \navailable to Federal prosecutors in combating public corruption. It \ngives investigators and prosecutors the statutory rules and resources \nthey need to assure that corruption is detected and prosecuted.\n  In November, voters sent a strong message that they were tired of the \nculture of corruption. From war profiteers and corrupt officials in \nIraq to convicted administration officials, to influence-peddling \nlobbyists and, regrettably, even Members of Congress, too many supposed \npublic servants are serving their own interests rather than the public \ninterests.\n  Actually, the American people staged an intervention and made it \nclear they would not stand for it any longer, and they expect Congress \nto take action. We need to restore the people's trust by acting to \nclean up the people's government.\n  The Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act will help to \nrestore the people's trust. Similar legislation passed the Senate last \nyear, but stalled in the House. This is a vital first step.\n  But the most serious corruption cannot be prevented only by changing \nour own rules. Bribery and extortion are committed by people who are \nassuming they will not get caught. These offenses are very difficult to \ndetect and even harder to prove. But because they attack our democracy \nitself, they have to be found out and punished. We can send a signal we \ndon't believe in corruption, that we want it punished.\n  I was pleased to join Senator Pryor last week to introduce the \nEffective Corruption Prosecutions Act of 2007, and I hope that all \nSenators will support us and incorporate this important bill into the \nLegislative Transparency and Accountability Act. Our legislation gives \ninvestigators and prosecutors the tools and resources they need to go \nafter public corruption.\n\n  Senator Pryor is a former attorney general. He understands, as I do, \nas I am a former prosecutor, the need for such legislation.\n  First, it would extend the statute of limitations for the most \nserious public corruption offenses, extending it from 5 years to 8 \nyears for bribery, deprivation of honest services, and extortion by \npublic officials.\n  The reason this is important is these public corruption cases are \namong the most difficult and time consuming to investigate, before you \neven bring a charge. They often require use of informants and \nelectronic monitoring, as well as review of extensive financial and \nelectronic records, techniques which take time to develop and \nimplement. Once you bring a charge, the statute of limitations tolls. \nYou do not want it to run out before you can bring the charge.\n  Bank fraud, arson, and passport fraud, among other offenses, all have \n10-year statutes of limitations. Since public corruption offenses are \nso important to our democracy and these cases are so difficult to \ninvestigate and prove, a more modest extended statute of limitations \nfor these offenses is a reasonable step to help our corruption \ninvestigators and prosecutors do their jobs. Corrupt officials should \nnot be able to get away with ill-gotten gains simply because they \noutwait the investigators.\n  This legislation also facilitates the investigation and prosecution \nof an important offense known as Federal program bribery, Title 18, \nUnited States Code, section 666. Federal program bribery is the key \nFederal statute for prosecuting bribery involving State and local \nofficials, as well as officials of the many organizations that receive \nsubstantial Federal money. This legislation would allow agents and \nprosecutors investigating this important offense to request authority \nto conduct wiretaps and to use Federal program bribery as a basis for a \nracketeering charge.\n\n[[Page S333]]\n\n  Wiretaps, when appropriately requested and authorized, are an \nimportant method for agents and prosecutors to gain evidence of corrupt \nactivities, which can otherwise be next to impossible to prove without \nan informant. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, RICO, \nstatute is also an important tool which helps prosecutors target \norganized crime and corruption.\n  Agents and prosecutors may currently request authority to conduct \nwiretaps to investigate many serious offenses, including bribery of \nFederal officials and even sports bribery, and may predicate RICO \ncharges on these offenses, as well. It is only reasonable that these \nimportant tools also be available for investigating the similar and \nequally important offense of Federal program bribery.\n  Lastly, the Effective Corruption Prosecutions Act authorizes $25 \nmillion in additional Federal funds over each of the next four years to \ngive Federal investigators and prosecutors needed resources to go after \npublic corruption. Last month, FBI Director Mueller in written \ntestimony to the Judiciary Committee called public corruption the FBI's \ntop criminal investigative priority. However, a September 2005 Report \nby Department of Justice Inspector General Fine found that, from 2000 \nto 2004, there was an overall reduction in public corruption matters \nhandled by the FBI. The report also found declines in resources \ndedicated to investigating public corruption, in corruption cases \ninitiated, and in cases forwarded to U.S. attorneys' offices.\n  I am heartened by Director Mueller's assertion that there has \nrecently been an increase in the number of agents investigating public \ncorruption cases and the number of cases investigated, but I remain \nconcerned by the inspector general's findings. I am concerned because \nthe FBI in recent years has diverted resources away from criminal law \npriorities, including corruption, into counterterrorism. The FBI may \nneed to divert further resources to cover the growing costs of \nSentinel, their data management system. The Department of Justice has \nsimilarly diverted resources, particularly from United States \nAttorney's Offices.\n  Additional funding is important to compensate for this diversion of \nresources and to ensure that corruption offenses are aggressively \npursued. This legislation will give the FBI, the U.S. attorneys' \noffices, and the Public Integrity Section of the Department of Justice \nnew resources to hire additional public corruption investigators and \nprosecutors. They can finally have the manpower they need to track down \nand make these difficult cases, and to root out corruption.\n  These may sound like dry nuts-and-bolts measures, but what we are \ntrying to figure out is what will actually allow us to investigate and \nprosecute the kinds of crimes that undermine our democracy.\n  If we are serious about addressing the egregious misconduct that we \nhave recently witnessed, Congress must enact meaningful legislation to \ngive investigators and prosecutors the resources they need to enforce \nour public corruption laws. I strongly urge Congress to pass this \nimportant amendment as a major step to restoring the public's trust in \ntheir government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Would the Senator from Vermont yield for some questions?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Certainly.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, my first question is whether the \nDepartment of Justice has asked for this and whether they need these \nadditional resources to deal with the challenges.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I might answer that, last month the FBI \ndirected written testimony to the Judiciary Committee. When GAO looked \nat it, the Department of Justice Inspector General found the numbers \nhad gone way down partly because some of the resources had been \nconverted to other matters. Regarding financial resources, as the \ndistinguished Senator certainly knows, as he is on the Committee on \nAppropriations, enormous amounts of money were diverted to the very \ndifficult setup of the computer system, the central system, and the \nFBI. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars \nliterally went down the drain, and they have had to start all over.\n  I understand from Director Mueller's assertion that there has been an \nincreased number of agents investigating public corruption cases, but \nit also appears that the resources have not been there.\n  If they don't want it, send it back to the Treasury. What I am \nconcerned about, I say to my friend from Utah, and he is my friend, I \nrecall in prosecutor days when legislative bodies would say, Boy, we \nare going to cut down on crime, we are going to give more crimes \nincreased penalties; that will stop crime. And I said, Well, are you \ngoing to give us the resources to catch the people? No, we don't have \nmoney for that, but we will double the penalty.\n  The fact is, if somebody commits a crime, they figure they won't get \ncaught. On some of these sophisticated bribery cases, and I include \ninfluence-peddling cases, they think if they can wait out the short \nstatute of limitations, the 5-year statute of limitations, they can get \naway with it. We will at least increase that to 8 years. It should be \nout there somewhere near sports bribery, which I believe is 10 years.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his answer.\n  It seems to me this is more of an appropriations issue rather than \nsomething that is relevant to this bill. I remember in history that \nMembers of Congress who were involved in ABSCAM were picked up without \nthe additional authority that is in this amendment. I remember Mayor \nMarion Barry, the Mayor of Washington, was videotaped with existing \npowers and existing resources at that time without the additional \ninformation of this amendment. As we have said, both Jack Abramoff and \nDuke Cunningham are in jail under existing procedures and existing \nresources.\n  While I certainly do not want to be here characterized as being \nreluctant to pursue wrongdoing, I am not sure I understand why this \nparticular activity is essential now, whether we have any indication \nthat there is a great deal of Government corruption in both Houses that \nneeds this kind of additional attention. If they need more money \nbecause of additional workload elsewhere, I am more than happy to vote \nfor the more money. I would appreciate it if the Senator from Vermont \nwould give Members the background of why he thinks this additional \nactivity is necessary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The money will still be appropriated. Simply authorizing \ndoes not appropriate money. I don't want to be in a position where the \nCommittee on Appropriations or somebody says we are not authorized. The \ndistinguished Senator could easily say ``zero.'' I don't want them to \nsay it is a great idea but they cannot authorize it.\n  We just agreed to an amendment that makes it a crime that already \nexists and makes it a misdemeanor. The Senator from Utah supports that. \nThis is for prevention of crimes and to make sure they can be \nprosecuted. They are not being prosecuted.\n  The Senator mentions the Jack Abramoff case. We know that is ongoing, \nand there were lots of people who hoped they could wait out the statute \nof limitations on that bad boy. Under this, they will not.\n  I suggest we make these retroactive. I am suggesting we need enough \ntime to investigate. And the FBI has had to divert so much money--first \nthe hundreds of millions lost because they screwed up on the computer \nsystem, and they have had to divert a lot more from it. If they want to \ncome up here and tell us they don't need this, fine. I haven't heard \nthat from the Department of Justice at all. I have heard from the \nInspector General that these investigations have suddenly gone way down \nin the last 4 years. Maybe there has been a great new wave of morality \nin this country and we have only seen the most egregious cases. I \nbelieve in the redemption of everyone, but I am not sure it happens all \nat once.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will look at this amendment with great \ninterest. I appreciate the sincerity with which my friend from Vermont \noffers it.\n  My first reaction to the increase in the statute of limitations is \nthat is fairly reasonable. My only immediate reaction is it gives the \nimpression that there is widespread corruption that is not being \nexamined in the Congress.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This is not just the Congress; we are talking about the \nability\n\n[[Page S334]]\n\nto go after State officials, for example, who are diverting public \nmoney. We are talking about a group that receives Federal funds and \nuses bribery to get it, going after or diverting it when they do. This \nis not just naming 535 Members of Congress but goes further than that.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I appreciate that clarification. I will examine the \namendment with great care.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the pending business, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Leahy amendment is the pending amendment.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 16 to Amendment No. 4\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment be \nset aside so I can offer an amendment to the Reid amendment No. 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have the amendment at the desk, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 16 to amendment No. 4.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To permit certain travel within State)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment insert the \n     following:\n       ``(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph \n     or any other rule, if there is not more than one flight daily \n     from a point in a Member's State to a point within that \n     Member's State, the Member may accept transportation in a \n     privately owned aircraft to that point provided (1) there is \n     no appearance of or actual conflict of interest, and (2) the \n     Member has the trip approved by the Select Committee on \n     Ethics. When accepting such transportation, the Member shall \n     reimburse the provider at either the rate of a first class \n     ticket, if available, or the rate of a full fare coach ticket \n     if first class rates are unavailable between those points.''.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the current Senate rule requires Members \nto pay the cost of a first-class plane ticket for travel on a private \nplane. The amendment does not substantially reform our lobbying laws, \nand this amendment will place an undue burden on Members from rural \nStates, at great expense to the taxpayers.\n  Most Members who take private flights do so to complete official \nbusiness. These flights enable Members from States such as Wyoming, \nMontana, and my State of Alaska access to rural areas. Our State does \nnot have the infrastructure found in more densely populated States \nthroughout the country. Many of our constituents live in communities \nthat cannot be accessed by road. We need to fly to these remote \ncommunities.\n  Despite this rule, or any other rule, these flights are essential and \nwill continue and must continue to take place. This amendment will not \nprovide meaningful reform. It will increase the amount of money Members \nneed from the Treasury to pay for these flights. The taxpayer will foot \nthe bill for the amendment, and the only real change will be more money \nin the pockets of those who own and operate the private planes.\n  Those representing States with less-developed infrastructure and many \ngeographically remote communities--my friends from other rural States \nand even some large States such as California--have this problem. It is \na unique problem. It is essential to take flights into these rural \nareas because there are no roads to get there.\n  In Alaska, almost 80 percent of our towns and villages cannot be \naccessed by road year-round. Even our State capital, Juneau, can only \nbe reached by boat or by plane. There are few scheduled commercial \nflights a week to many villages in our State. Our State uses planes the \nway people in the lower 48 use cars, buses, and taxis.\n  It is literally true. If I took a Senator to Bethel, for instance, \nand wanted to go upriver to visit some of the mines or the small \nvillages, there is only one way to get there, and that is by plane, and \nin many instances a floatplane. But these are still private aircraft \nand would be banned by this amendment--or the actual cost of the \noperation of the plane would be required to be paid, but I would be \npaying that from taxpayers' funds, not from my funds but from the \ntaxpayers' funds if this amendment passed.\n  Flights on private planes are necessary in our State, particularly \nwhen traveling to areas which are only accessible by private planes or \nby long boat rides in the summertime. Along the great rivers such as \nthe Yukon or the Kuskokwim, you could take a boat. It would take you \nseveral days to wind up those rivers to go to a village you might be \nable to fly to in 30 minutes.\n  I use private planes to visit constituents who cannot afford to come \nto Washington to visit with our congressional delegation. On many \noccasions, I am asked to come to these villages to talk to them about \ntheir problems, and I can only go there by private plane. I use private \nplanes to view the conditions in rural communities and villages. For \ninstance, this last October, I visited the village of Kivalina in my \nState to view the catastrophic damage caused by winter storms there.\n  Now, at times we do have available the Air National Guard planes. But \nin times of war such as this right now, to use these National Guard \nplanes puts a substantial burden on the Guard because so many of their \npeople are deployed.\n  Now, I can recall several occasions when I have traveled with other \nMembers on private planes to show them areas of our State which were \nsubject to important legislation. These trips have been invaluable to \nour deliberations on the floor.\n  I recall taking a group of Senators on a CODEL--``congressional \ndelegation;'' that is ``CODEL''--to Prudhoe Bay to help them understand \nAlaska's oil industry. There is no public access to Prudhoe Bay and no \ncommercial flights. We must fly in on an industry plane.\n  We continued the CODEL. After we got there--we went up by their jet--\nwe took a helicopter flight over the Coastal Plain of ANWR. Now, that, \nagain, was about an hour and a half flight, out and back, on a \nhelicopter. That flight was on a private helicopter, owned by some \nentity within the oil industry there at Prudhoe Bay. Had this proposed \namendment been in effect, that trip would not have been possible, as \nthe cost of the trip would have been prohibitive.\n  Now, other people were going up there anyway and we flew up on their \nplane to Prudhoe Bay.\n  On the helicopter, they wanted us to go out and see these conditions \nwhere drilling would take place. But it would not have been possible \nfor the Senators who were our visitors to see this area firsthand. The \narea we went to and had them look at is an area that currently is \nproducing 16 percent of our Nation's energy. If you want to go visit \nthat industry in Oklahoma or somewhere like that, you would go to a \ntown by commercial aircraft and you would get probably in a private car \nand they would drive you out. I doubt that you would have to have a \nhelicopter. But what I am saying is, our conditions require air where \nother people use buses, taxis, or private automobiles.\n  There are countless examples of how we use these airplanes. For \ninstance, about 3 years ago, I went along on a flight that was going to \nBethel, AK. This is an area out in the Kuskokwim Delta area of our \nState. The person who asked me to go with him wanted me to personally \nexperience the use of a capstone variant. A capstone is a system that \nhas revolutionized the airline safety industry in our State. In the \n1990s, for instance, an airplane crashed on average every other day in \nmy State. We had an aircraft-related fatality every 9 days. Capstone \nand these related technologies, which make cockpit technology available \nto the pilot to know what is going on and what the threats are, have \nreduced these airplane crashes by 40 percent.\n  The reason I went along was they wanted me to see that system and to \nexperience it so I would understand it and support the money the FAA \nwas\n\n[[Page S335]]\n\ngoing to ask for in terms of development of these new technologies.\n  I went out to Valdez several times on an industry airplane to review \nthe 1989 oil spill in my State, once in a Coast Guard jet. That was my \nfirst flight to see that fantastically horrible and great disaster. But \nwe went out several times to try to figure out what to do with our \noversight of the oil spill itself. We went out in a private airplane. I \nalso recently took a flight from Point Barrow, which is at the top of \nour State, the farthest north portion of our State, over to Nome, which \nis out on the peninsula, and it is a flight--there is no scheduled \nservice between those two places. It is about 300 miles. If I had not \ntaken that flight on a private plane, I would have gone down to \nFairbanks from Barrow, gone to Anchorage, and then flown back up to \nKotzebue and come down to Nome. It actually saved the taxpayers money. \nThis was an official business trip that saved the taxpayers money by \ngoing the same way on a private plane, and we compensated the owner of \nthat plane under the current rule with the equivalent of a first-class \nfare between those two places, had there been such a scheduled flight \nin the first place.\n  For instance, the flight from Anchorage alone to Nome is 540 miles. \nIt is farther than from here to Chicago. I think that is about 500 \nmiles. Anyway, if this amendment passes, I have to ask the Senate, what \nshould we do, those of us who represent rural areas such as this? I \ndon't think the Senate expects us not to respond to a constituent's \nrequest, particularly an organized area such as a village or a city, to \ncome view the conditions in their area when they believe they need \nFederal assistance. We have to take planes to get to such areas.\n  Last October, I visited several communities along the west coast of \nAlaska that had been damaged by severe storms, and we used a \ncombination of commercial, charter, and private aircraft. We worked out \nwhat was the best advantage to the Government and used different types \nof aircraft as we went on that trip. I saw firsthand the problems of \nerosion that are going on there and learned about the needs of those \nplaces, particularly the problems these villages will face in the \nfuture if continued erosion takes place and they have to move back from \nthese barrier islands on which they live. My charter cost alone, one \nway from Kotzebue to Bethel, was $1,500. That was the charter cost \nwhich we paid on the equivalent because there was no scheduled flight \nthere, a 3-hour flight, more than triple the total cost for commercial \nand private flight combined. Had this amendment been in effect, there \nwould have been no way that I could have justified spending taxpayers' \nmoney for this type of transportation cost.\n  If a Member from another State is going from one town to another and \nsomeone is going to drive there, there is no provision that anybody \nwould have to pay for the cost of going in an automobile to another \ntown. The effect of this amendment now would be that whenever I use an \naircraft that is a private aircraft, I would have to repay from the \nTreasury, by asking for the funds, to an organization with a plane that \nwas going to fly there anyway.\n  I think our current rule is very fair. It says we pay the operator of \nthose airplanes the equivalent first-class fare to travel from point to \npoint in our State. It would be unreasonably expensive to apply the \nprovisions of the pending amendment to our State.\n  It is particularly burdensome because of our Senate rules. I don't \nthink many Members think about this. Our office allowances are based on \npopulation, not the distance we travel within our State. We would have \nto pay from our allowances. And each Senator gets a maximum allowance \nper year from the Senate. This amendment, if enacted, will mean that my \nbudget will run out in the first month or two of the calendar year. It \nwould not permit us to travel to these remote communities throughout \nthe year. It would simply become too expensive to deal with going to \nthese communities to listen to their complaints and to view them and to \nbe able to report to the Senate.\n  I believe that if a plane is going to a village in the direction I \nneed to go, if there is room on that for my staff and me, we should be \nable to get on that plane and go see the problems they want us to see. \nAnd it is reasonable to compensate them at what it would cost to fly on \na commercial flight, if there was one. That is what we have been doing. \nI have never had a complaint from anyone in my years here in the Senate \ntraveling under the existing rule. Taxpayers, however, should not have \nto pay outrageous costs for us to do our business.\n  As a matter of fact, as I said, once we have exhausted our \nallowances, and coming from a State that has a small population but is \nenormous, this is going to be an enormous burden on those of us who \nrepresent our State.\n  I have hesitated to try to get an exemption for Alaska. I am not \ndoing that. The amendment I have before the Senate will continue the \ncurrent rule but would say that we can travel on a privately owned \naircraft to the point where there is not commercial service, but we \nwould have to go to the Ethics Committee and show there is no \nappearance or actual conflict of interest in taking the trip, and the \ntrip would have to be approved by the Ethics Committee. I think that \ngives it a transparency. We not only will report after we take the \ntrip, but we will get approval of the Ethics Committee before we take \nthe trip.\n\n  There is a lack of commercial air service in many areas in the lower \n48 that this would apply to, the larger States in the West in \nparticular. We just do not have frequent flights between our \ncommunities that other States enjoy. We travel great distances to see \nour constituents. When I go west from Anchorage out to Shemya--that is \nthe place where the X-band radar was going to be and where the current \nradars they operate in the North Pacific are, a former large air base \nthat is not very large now--that is 1,200 miles. If I go out farther \nthan that to Adak, it is almost 1,800 miles. If I fly from Anchorage to \nUnalakleet, the charter rate under the Reid amendment would be \nthousands of dollars. I should go to places like that at least once a \nyear. I try to do that.\n  The effect of this prohibition against using these private planes \nunless we pay the charter rate is really very oppressive.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield so I may ask a question?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nSenator's remarks, I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The pending amendment will not improve the system as far \nas those of us from these rural States are concerned. It will hurt our \nconstituents. I think it will punish the taxpayers.\n  Some have suggested that raising the cost of private plane travel is \nimportant because it gives the appearance of fairness. The reason is \nthat citizens cannot fly on private planes, so we should not be able to \nfly on them, either. The difference is that a private citizen in my \nState doesn't have to go to Kivalina, doesn't have to go to Unalakleet, \ndoesn't have to go to these places where changes are taking place as we \nspeak. The whole Arctic is changing because of the current \ncircumstances. I think the Senate is going to hear more about that. But \nas these changes take place, we must go there. We must try to take \npeople from the administration there. We must try to get the Corps of \nEngineers and other agencies to go with us to see what can be done to \nmeet the problems our constituents face.\n  I don't think there are many Senators who would have to visit four or \nfive communities in one weekend that are so far apart. We usually only \nhave a weekend to make trips such as this. If those of us who have to \ndo this have to pay this charter rate, it is not our money, this is \nofficial business. If this amendment passes, I will be asked to spend \npart of the allowance I get to run my Senate office at enormous cost to \npay the full cost of flying the plane on a charter rate even though \nthere are other people in that plane who are already going on company \nbusiness and they are willing to take us along on the basis of paying \nwhat would be the equivalent in terms of a commercial rate.\n  We need transparency. I support that. We want to try to do this \nwithout additional burden to our taxpayers. I think we should disclose \nflights on private planes, and we do. We disclose\n\n[[Page S336]]\n\nthem. Today we disclose. Under the current rule, we disclose whom we \npaid when we go on these flights. From my point of view, we ought to \nlook at this amendment from the point of view of appearances, but it \nreally is not totally appearances. It is necessity. If this amendment \npasses, we will face the difficult choice of either flying to remote \ncommunities at considerable cost to the taxpayer or to the State and \nthe developed communities or failing to do the duty to those we \nrepresent who live in these remote areas. I think Alaska has probably \nthe most pressing problems of any State in terms of the changes that \nare coming back because of global climate change. There is no question \nabout that.\n  We will do everything we can to assist a Senator who faces problems \nsuch as that but not do it in a way that will increase substantially \nthe cost to the taxpayers and reduce our ability to do our jobs as \nSenators. If I have to use this money to take those trips to these \nsmall cities, I will not have the money to do the things I would \nnormally do--for instance, flying from here to Alaska. The same funds \nthat are available to us to pay these charters flights are the funds I \nuse to fly to Alaska.\n  I parenthetically say, Mr. President, when I came here, a Senator was \nallowed two trips a year. One to come down and go back and another to \ngo home. Today, many of us make 10, 15, 20 trips. One time, I made 35 \ntrips home to my State of Alaska because there were so many problems \nand things we had to do. It was not for campaigning or an election \nyear, it was to talk to people about problems they were facing.\n  I don't think this amendment is part of lobbying reform. I understand \nthe need to find some way to deal with it. I, also, believe we should \nhave some exception in the amendments that deals with the problems we \nface, where we cannot travel except by the use of private planes. I \nhope the Senator from California will take occasion to look at this \namendment. I know that being a Californian, there are problems she \nfaces, too, but not on the regular basis that we face, in terms of \ndealing with Alaska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I know there is a unanimous consent \nagreement of the Senator from New Hampshire. Would he allow me to \nanswer the Senator from Alaska?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I will do that.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. On the face of this, I don't have a problem with it.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate the smile. It is a rare one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 17\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to this bill, \nalong with Senator DeMint and a number of colleagues--about 25 of them.\n  Mr. GREGG. This amendment we are offering is what we call the second \nlook at waste amendment. It is a child of the original line-item veto, \nalthough it is not a line-item veto. As the Congress will remember, we \npassed the line-item veto in the early 1990s and gave President Clinton \nthat authority. He actually used that authority. It was challenged in \ncourt and was found to be unconstitutional. But that line-item veto was \npassed rather strongly by this Congress and by the Senate, and it was a \nbipartisan effort, which I hope this will be, to try to allow the \nexecutive branch more opportunity to address omnibus bills around here.\n  This proposal that we put forward is not like the line-item veto \nbecause it doesn't have the same constitutional impact. It is truly a \nsecond look at waste amendment, where we basically say to the executive \nbranch that if you get one of these omnibus bills filled with different \ninitiatives--and these bills can be hundreds of pages long and can \ninvolve hundreds of billions of dollars of spending and massive amounts \nof authorization, and it is not unlikely that there is going to be a \nfair amount of activity put in there because somebody knows it is an \nomnibus bill and they know it is going to have to pass and go forward, \nand even though the language put in may be questionable as to purpose, \npolicy or as to just plain waste, it gets stuck in this--baggage thrown \nin the train as they say--that baggage can never be looked at. The \nPresident has no capacity to take another look at this. Congress ends \nup with the vote--and we get one vote, usually, on these types of \nbills; sometimes in the Senate we get more shots at it. They are not \nscrutinized at an intensity level that they should be.\n  So this second look at waste language essentially says that the \nPresident can, on four different occasions during the year, send up \nwhat amounts to an enhanced rescission package, where if he has gotten \nbills that have had in them things the executive branch deems to be \ninappropriate, most likely wasteful spending or spending that is \nunnecessary or maybe counterproductive even, he can ask the Congress--\nor she, maybe in the next round--to take another look at that spending, \nand there is a fast-track procedure where that goes to a vote.\n  The savings, should they occur as a result of rescission--and it is \npresumed that all rescissions will involve savings--will go to deficit \nreduction. The language itself is essentially modeled after language \nthat was offered as a Democratic substitute by the Democratic \nleadership back when we were debating the original line-item bill \nPresident Clinton ended up having the authority to use. So we have \ntried to structure it in a bipartisan way, using bipartisan language \nand verses--for example, the language originally sent up by the White \nHouse as to how they would have liked to have handled this, which we \nfelt overreached the authority of the executive significantly, and we \nhave basically set that language aside and moved forward with this \nlanguage, which is more restrictive on executive rights. It truly \nretains the right of the legislative branch to control the spending \nissues. But it does ask us, as the legislative branch, to take another \nlook at things that may be of questionable interest. Of course, if both \nHouses don't approve the request from the President, the spending stays \nin place. So it is one of these light-of-day amendments that tracks \nvery closely what is being proposed in both Houses in the area of \nearmarks.\n\n  It is an attempt to address what is a common event, which is a \ncluster or a significant earmark not necessarily individually directed \nbut maybe more expansive, that is put in a bill that the executive \nsimply can't not sign and the Congress can't not pass. So it is an \nattempt to basically bring some transparency, light of day, on some of \nwhat occurs around here and is referred to as occurring in the middle \nof the night.\n  It is an initiative which has very strong support by a large number \nof groups. A few would be the Chamber of Commerce, the Center for \nIndividual Freedom, the Concord Coalition, Americans for Tax Reform--\ngroups that are interested--the National Taxpayers Union--groups that \nare interested in having more discipline over the fiscal process of \nthis Government.\n  All this is is another disciplining mechanism. It actually gives the \nexecutive branch the opportunity to come forward and say, listen, do \nyou want to do this? Did you want to spend this money in this way? If \nthe Congress concludes that, yes, it did, the matter is over. In fact, \nit takes an affirmative action of the Congress to confirm the decision \nof the executive or the request of the executive to pursue this course \nof action of not spending this money. The original Presidential \nproposal would have allowed them to send up numerous rescission \nrequests, which could have tied the Congress up technically and \npractically for months. This avoids that. It is very limited. They can \nonly send up four, and one has to come up with a budget. The original \nrequest from the executive branch would have said that they could \nwithhold spending on something that they decided to send a rescission \nup on for up to 180 days, with the practical effect being they could \nhave withheld spending almost forever.\n  This bill dramatically shortens that to 45 days or until Congress \nacts. It is similar to a BRAC approach, in other words. It says you \ntell us what you think should be rescinded. We will act within a short \ntimeframe. If we disagree or decide not to act in a way that is \nconsistent with your request, then the matter is over and the money \ngets spent. If we agree, the rescission occurs and both Houses must \nconcur in the rescission.\n\n[[Page S337]]\n\n  So this is an exercise in good Government, in transparency, and it is \nan exercise in trying to give the American people the information they \nneed on bills that are very complex and sometimes have a lot of \nquestionable activity buried in them, to give them another chance to \nhave those decisions reviewed. It is an exercise in fiscal discipline \nbecause the money saved goes to deficit reduction.\n  As I said, it has very strong support. I hope that my colleagues will \njoin us in supporting this. I see that the Senator from South Carolina \nhas joined us on the floor. He has been a strong spokesperson for this \ninitiative.\n  I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside without objection.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg), for himself, \n     Mr. DeMint, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Burr, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Thomas, \n     Mr. Sessions, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Lott, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. \n     Hutchison, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Allard, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Bunning, \n     Mr. Vitter, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \n     Graham, and Mr. Voinovich, proposes an amendment numbered 17.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Gregg. This amendment would establish a legislative line-\nitem veto.\n  The American people sent a clear message in November that they were \ntired of a broken system that wasted their hard-earned money on pork \nprojects. They want us to make the tough decisions and end the ``favor \nfactory,'' where taxpayer money goes to the highest bidding lobbyist.\n  The legislative line-item veto strikes at the heart of this ethics \ndilemma. It gives the President the ability to strip special spending \nand earmarks out of a bill and send them back to Congress for an up-or-\ndown vote. By doing this, it allows the administration to work with \nCongress in a constructive way to reduce wasteful spending, to reduce \nthe budget deficit and ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.\n  The Senator's amendment permits the President to submit to Congress \nproposals to cancel specific appropriations, as well as items of direct \nspending and targeted tax benefits. Both the House and the Senate would \nhave to vote on each Presidential proposal, without amendment, within a \nshort timeframe. But the proposed rescission could not take effect \nunless approved by Congress.\n  Mr. President, giving the President enhanced authority to seek \nrescission of new spending will help ensure that taxpayer dollars are \nnot wasted on earmarks that are not national priorities. Since the \nSupreme Court struck down the Line-Item Veto Act of 1996, the number of \nearmarks has significantly increased. The line-item veto has a long \nhistory of bipartisan support. At least 11 Presidents from both parties \nhave called for the authority to address individual spending items \nwrapped into larger bills. These Presidents include Grant, Hayes, \nArthur, Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Nixon, Ford, Reagan, Bush, and \nClinton. Additionally, the Governors of 43 out of 53 States already \nhave this authority.\n  Mr. President, the Senator's proposal is also consistent with the \nConstitution. In its 1998 ruling striking down the Line-Item Veto Act \nof 1996, the Supreme Court concluded that the act ``gave the President \nthe unilateral power to change the text of duly enacted statutes.'' \nHowever, this amendment does not raise those constitutional issues \nbecause the President's rescissions must be enacted by both Houses of \nCongress and signed into law.\n  This amendment has been dramatically curtailed so that even \nsupporters of congressional earmarks can support it because it limits \nthe President to four rescission packages a year. The fast-track \nmechanism is similar to what we use for BRAC, as well as free trade \nagreements. Rather than forcing Americans to accept a foot-tall omnibus \nspending bill with thousands of earmarks, this amendment will give the \nPresident a second look at waste so we can all protect American \ntaxpayers.\n  This is an important amendment. We know that earmarks have gotten way \nout of control and must be reduced. Without this commonsense provision, \nthis bill cannot be serious about addressing earmarks, as well as the \ncorruption that is associated with them.\n  The Senator's amendment is very sound, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I ask \nunanimous consent that following the remarks of Senator Conrad, I be \nrecognized to speak in support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is one of the all-time worst ideas to \nbe brought to the Chamber. First, it has no place on this bill. This \nbill is about ethics reform. What our colleagues have brought is a \nbudget matter, without taking it to the Budget Committee first, without \nhearings, without a chance for review, without a recommendation. As a \nresult, it is subject to a budget point of order which, if other action \nis not taken, I will be constrained to raise at the appropriate time.\n  Why do I say this is a bad idea? Because it has virtually nothing to \ndo with budget discipline, and it has virtually everything to do with \nincreasing the power of the President. That is what this is about.\n  I hope colleagues understand that this provision, if adopted, would \nactually undermine the chances to do something about our long-term \nfiscal imbalances. People listening may wonder: How can that be? How \ncan the line-item veto in any way endanger a long-term agreement on \nentitlements? Let me say why.\n  Tucked away in this little legislative offering that has been \ncasually brought to the floor without going through the Budget \nCommittee first are provisions that would allow the President to target \nany agreement reached on a long-term solution to our entitlement \nchallenges. So we could have--and we are working to achieve now--a \nlong-term agreement to face up to the demographic tsunami that is \ncoming at us. We could engage all of this year in resolving those \nmatters in a bipartisan way--Democrats and Republicans working \ntogether--and then the President could come in the backdoor and cherry-\npick those provisions with which he disagrees.\n  If my colleagues want to undermine the negotiation, the bipartisan \nnegotiation that needs to occur here on long-term entitlements, if they \nwant to endanger that enterprise, adopt this amendment, hand that power \nto the President. If they want to instead engage in a serious \nnegotiation, forget about this amendment, and let's get about the work \nof preparing a plan to deal with our long-term fiscal challenges. But \nif anybody thinks we are going to enter into a seriatim negotiation in \nwhich we first negotiate in good faith on both sides to achieve a long-\nterm solution and then we hand the President the ability to come and \ncherry-pick the whole thing, forget it. That is not going to work.\n  We already know what the President's policies have done to our fiscal \noutlook. The deficits on this President's watch have exploded. He \ninherited a balanced budget. He promptly put us in deficit and then in \nrecord deficits for 2003 and 2004, 2005, the third worst deficit in our \nhistory, and some improvement last year.\n  These have been enormous deficits and deficits that understate the \nproblem because last year while the deficit was $248 billion, the \naddition to the debt was $546 billion. I find when I talk to my \nconstituents that they are very surprised by this enormous difference \nbetween the size of the deficit and the additions to the debt. The \nbiggest reason for the differences is the $185 billion of Social \nSecurity money that was taken last year to pay other bills.\n  I have said to my constituents: If anybody tried to do this in the \nprivate sector--tried to take the retirement\n\n[[Page S338]]\n\nfunds of their employees and use it to pay other operating expenses--\nthey would be on their way to a Federal institution, but it wouldn't be \nthe Congress of the United States, it wouldn't be the White House. They \nwould be headed for the big house because that is a violation of \nFederal law.\n  The combined result, in terms of our debt, of these fiscal policies \nhas been to increase the debt of the country by more than 50 percent \nthrough last year, and we are headed for another $3 trillion of debt \nover the next 5 years if the President's policies are pursued. That is \na combination of increases in spending and reductions in revenue.\n  On the spending side, the President inherited a budget that was \nspending about 18.4 percent of GDP. We are up to 20.4 percent of GDP \nlast year. This is a very significant increase in spending and, of \ncourse, revenue has stagnated.\n  Only last year did we get back to the revenue base that we had in the \nyear 2000. While there has been significant revenue growth in the last \n2 or 3 years, even with that we are only now back to the revenue base \nwe enjoyed in 2000.\n  On the question of whether this line-item rescission is going to make \na difference with respect to the deficit, here is a USA Today editorial \nfrom last year on the line-item veto. The editorial states:\n\n        . . . [T]he line-item veto is a convenient distraction. \n     The vast bulk of the deficit is not the result of self-\n     aggrandizing line items, infuriating as they are.\n\n  And make no mistake, I am for disciplining the notion of these line \nitems, these individual items that Members stick into appropriations \nbills. Senator McCain and I had a legislative proposal last year to \ndiscipline that process. The line-item veto before us makes very little \ndifference.\n\n       The deficit is primarily caused by unwillingness to make \n     hard choices on benefit programs or to levy the taxes to pay \n     for the true cost of government.\n\n  This is the Roanoke Times, a newspaper in Virginia, from last year. \nThey pointed out:\n       . . . [T]he president already has the only tool he needs: \n     The veto. That Bush has declined to challenge Congress in \n     five-plus years is his choice. The White House no doubt sees \n     reviving this debate as a means of distracting people from \n     the missteps, miscalculations, mistruths and mistakes that \n     have dogged Bush and sent his approval rating south. The \n     current problems are not systemic; they are ideological. A \n     line-item veto will not magically grant lawmakers and the \n     president fiscal discipline and economic sense.\n\n  They are not alone in that assessment. Here is the previous CBO \nDirector. He is actually still the CBO Director, will be until his \nsuccessor takes office some time later this week or perhaps some time \nnext week. Here is what he said:\n\n       Such tools, however, cannot establish fiscal discipline \n     unless there is a political consensus to do so. . . . In the \n     absence of that consensus, the proposed changes to the \n     rescission process . . . are unlikely to greatly affect the \n     budget's bottom line.\n\n  Not only do newspaper editorialists and the CBO Director cast doubt \non the significance of this with respect to the question of fiscal \ndiscipline, Senator Gregg said this last year:\n\n       Passage of [the line-item veto] legislation would be a \n     ``political victory'' that would not address long-term \n     problems posed by growing entitlement programs.\n\n  The Budget Committee chairman also said:\n\n       . . . it would have ``very little impact'' on the budget \n     deficit.\n\n  He was being a truthteller then, and I think it is the truth now.\n  George Will, the conservative columnist, made this point:\n\n       It would aggravate an imbalance in our constitutional \n     system that has been growing for seven decades: the expansion \n     of executive power at the expense of the legislature.\n\n  Those are words. Let me put it into a real-life example. If we give \nthis power to the President, what is to prevent him from calling up \nSenator Conrad and saying: You know, Senator, I know you represent a \nState that is rural. I know that rural electric cooperatives are \ncritically important to delivering electricity in your rural areas. I \nknow you have a provision in a recent appropriations bill that would \naddress safety concerns on those systems. You know, we are looking at \nthe line-item rescission package that I might be sending up, and I \nwould like to be able to help you on that proposal you have to improve \nthe safety of rural electric systems, but, you know, separately I have \na judge who is coming up for confirmation. I know you have said some \nharsh things about that judge, that you don't want to approve him. I \ndon't want to suggest in any way these things are linked, but, Senator, \nI need your help on the confirmation of that judge. Separately--I don't \nwant to connect these two at all--I also am reviewing this package of \nrescissions and would very much hope I wouldn't have to include your \nprovision to make rural electric systems in your State more safe and \nmore secure.\n  I think I would get the message. That is exactly what we don't need: \nto hand more power to this President; frankly, as far as I am \nconcerned, to hand more power to any President, more power to put \nleverage on individuals in the Senate and the House to bend to the will \nof the White House. They already have enough power down there.\n  American Enterprise Scholar Mr. Ornstein said this about the line-\nitem veto:\n\n       The larger reality is that this line-item veto proposal \n     gives the President a great additional mischief-making \n     capability, to pluck out items to punish lawmakers he doesn't \n     like, or to threaten individual lawmakers to get votes on \n     other things, without having any noticeable impact on budget \n     growth or restraint.\n       More broadly, it simply shows the lack of institutional \n     integrity and patriotism by the majority in Congress. They \n     have lots of ways to put the responsibility of budget \n     restraint where it belongs--on themselves. Instead, they \n     willingly, even eagerly, try to turn their most basic power \n     over to the President. Shameful, just shameful.\n\n  I think it is shameful. More than shameful, this, I believe, is a \nfundamental threat to the negotiation which must occur in this body and \nin the other body and with the President of the United States. That is \na negotiation on the long-term fiscal imbalances of this country, \nincluding Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and the structural \ndeficit as well.\n  If we are to engage in good faith on that negotiation, we simply \ncan't be subject to a circumstance in which once that negotiation is \ncompleted, the President is free to cherry-pick which part of the deal \nhe will allow to move forward. That would completely undermine the \nability to have this negotiation.\n\n  Let me just end by making these points. One, this proposal represents \nan abdication of congressional responsibility. Two, it shifts too much \npower to the executive branch with little impact on the deficit. Three, \nit provides the President up to a year to submit rescission requests--\nup to a year. It requires the Congress to vote on the President's \nproposals within 10 days. It provides no opportunity to amend or \nfilibuster proposed rescissions--no opportunity to amend. Sometimes I \nreally don't know what our colleagues are thinking. It allows the \nPresident to cancel new mandatory spending proposals passed by Congress \nsuch as those dealing with Social Security, Medicare, veterans, and \nagriculture at the very time we are poised to enter into a negotiation \non those very matters.\n  If there were ever an ill-considered amendment, inappropriate to the \nunderlying legislation, this is it. I urge my colleagues to either \nsupport a budget point of order against this matter because it violates \nthe budget rules very clearly or support a tabling motion to get on to \nthe business of passing this ethics reform proposal. But to mix budget \nissues with ethics reform has the entire matter confused and \nfundamentally threatens the opportunity to do what must be done, which \nis for Democrats and Republicans together to consider long-term \nentitlement reform.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \namendment, but I do think that some of the points that have been made \nare valid. I am supporting this amendment because I believe it is \nimportant that we do everything possible to put restraints on spending \nand go back to the balanced budget we had before terrorists struck our \ncountry in 2001. I think that is so important that passing an amendment \nto try for 4 years--and it does have a 4-year sunset provision--to see \nif we can give the President the authority to do some big overall cuts \nis a good idea, but I did do it with some reservation.\n\n[[Page S339]]\n\n  I supported the line-item veto that was passed by the Congress in \n1996. I supported it because I thought it would provide fiscal \nrestraint. I think it was misused, and I was very pleased when the \nSupreme Court overturned it. I said I would never vote for it again \nbecause I believe the Constitution is very clear that Congress has the \npurse strings. That is how James Madison phrased it in the Federalist \nPapers: the power of the purse is in Congress. That is where the budget \nis passed to go to the President, and I believe we should uphold our \npart of the Constitution.\n  Earmark reform is important, and the most important part that I hope \nwe will pass is transparency. It is important that people be willing to \nstand up and say: Yes, I did this earmark.\n  Let me just tell my colleagues how I operate on the Appropriations \nCommittee with regard to my State. Obviously, as chairman of the \nMilitary Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee and now as its \nranking member, I pass appropriations that come from the President and \nfrom the Pentagon for military installations. But I also take care of \nmy State--that is what I was elected by my constituents to do--and I \nbalance the needs of the cities in my State. So if the biggest need in \nHouston, TX, is the dredging of the port because it is such an economic \nengine for Houston, that is what my major priority for Houston is going \nto be. On the other hand, for Dallas, it is going to be the Dallas Area \nRapid Transit Authority or the Trinity River flood control project, and \nthat is my major priority for Dallas. And it goes on that way. I \nbalance so that the major needs of my cities are met and their highest \npriorities are met. But it doesn't mean they get everything they ask \nfor. The lower priorities will not be met.\n  If we turn this over to the executive branch, how is the employee \nsitting at the Department of Transportation going to know that the \nmajor need of Dallas is DART and the major need of Houston is over in \nthe Interior Department or the Energy Department or the Corps of \nEngineers? How are those two people in Federal agencies who have never \nbeen to Dallas or Houston going to know that the first priority is \nsomething besides what they are giving them? That is my job. That is \nwhat I do. I am proud of it, and I want it to be transparent, and that \nis the reform which we should enact.\n  So I don't want to just continue to hear that earmark reform is pork \nbarrel spending reform. Spending is spending. If it is done in the \nexecutive branch or if it is done by Congress, it is spending, and \nhopefully we have a system that funds the top priorities.\n  I believe there are projects that are not in the national interest \nthat go into appropriations bills. That is why I think some reining in \nof the process through this amendment can be a good thing, and it is \nwhy I have supported it and am supporting it. It does have the \ncapability to give the President the authority to go in and look at \nprojects he believes don't meet the national need, and he is elected by \nthe people of our country. I believe letting him have four different \ntimes to come to Congress and rescind may be too many. I hope that \nnumber could be brought to two. I would think the OMB and the President \nwould be able to see, during two different budget or appropriations \nanalyses, that a project wouldn't meet the President's standards, and \nthen it could come back to Congress and Congress can say we disagree \nwith the President or we agree with the President. It is the coming \nback to Congress that is the change from the original line-item veto \nthat was passed in 1996 and which should allow the Supreme Court to \naffirm this rescission process.\n\n  I think it is worth a try. But I also would say for the record that \nwe are going to have President Bush for 2 years and we are going to \nhave a new President for 2 years, the duration of this amendment if it \npasses and goes into law. I think that will be a good test. Congress \nwill then have the right to come back and say it has worked well, it \nhas cut spending, it has prioritized better. Frankly, maybe some people \nwon't put earmarks in bills if they are not proud that the earmarks \nserve a national interest, and maybe that in itself will bring down the \nnumber of earmarks and the spending.\n  But the bottom line is that we are on a trajectory to have a balanced \nbudget because we are setting budget limits on what we appropriate. We \nalways do that, and then we reconcile. And we have been able to keep \nthe economy strong and bring down the unemployment rate by keeping the \ntax cuts we gave the American people in 2001 and 2003. Unemployment is \nat an all-time low. So I think we are exercising fiscal restraint, \nparticularly in light of the fact that we have had some major hits on \nour country that have required us to spend money--hits such as 9/11, \nthe war on terror, which is the most important security issue facing \nour country, and Hurricane Katrina and the rebuilding of New Orleans \nand Mississippi. We need to do those things and do them well. We know \nthat. Despite all of those added expenditures, we have half the deficit \nthat was built up after our country was hit by terrorists, and we are \non the way to bringing it lower, and that is our goal. It must be our \ngoal. I think this amendment can help us in furthering that goal.\n  So I am going to support it. It has changed since the first time the \nSenator from New Hampshire introduced it. I didn't support it in the \nbeginning. He has made changes that make it more palatable to a Member \nof Congress who is trying to uphold the right of Congress under the \nConstitution, which I believe is my responsibility to do. I must uphold \nthe rights of Congress in order to keep the three branches equal, as \nmuch as we can do that. That is the beauty of our constitutional \nframework, that balance of power.\n  I also have a responsibility to my constituents who elected me to \nmake sure that my State is treated fairly. I am proud of what we have \nbeen able to do, and I want it in the open. I believe reform is \nnecessary, and I am going to support the amendment. But if this \namendment does go into effect, I would urge this President and the next \nPresident who will have this vast authority to use it wisely and \njudiciously because that is the only way it will have the effect we are \nall intending it to have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Gregg \namendment because as a member of the Budget Committee, as we have \nwatched this develop and as we worked on it last year in committee, I \nbelieve it is too broad and not in the public interest.\n  I am not opposed to line-item veto. In Michigan, when I was in the \nState legislature for 16 years, we had and have a line-item veto, but \nit is a very narrowly crafted line-item veto in a very different \nsetting. We have a germaneness rule in Michigan that certainly we do \nnot have here, where topic by topic is taken up separately, or \nlegislation separately. We here work in a larger format where we are \nmany times--most of the time--negotiating very complex legislation, and \nfrequently we have a number of different issues and interests coming \ninto the same bill, and it creates a very different climate in which \nthis is being discussed.\n  Also, this is a very broad application, and I believe too broad. Let \nme give my colleagues an example. The amendment would give the \nPresident unprecedented powers to dramatically weaken any legislation \nwe might put together that would strengthen Social Security or Medicare \nor any other areas of mandatory spending such as veterans' benefits or \nother areas where we have critical needs. Let's suppose for a moment \nthat we come together, and this is the way it is always done, and we \nnegotiate an agreement around Social Security or around Medicare, and \nas always, it is a give and take.\n  Let's say, for instance, around Medicare, it is a provision where the \nindustry receives certain things they would like to see happen, and on \nthe other side, those things that are important for people, for \nseniors, for the disabled, for those trying to be able to afford \nmedicine, we negotiate things there that allow prices to go down or \nmore competition or better benefits. But then it goes to the President, \nand under this particular bill the President will be allowed to go into \nthat legislation and veto certain parts of an agreement that the Senate \nand the House made to come up with something that was balanced, that \nwould allow legislation to happen. The President will be\n\n[[Page S340]]\n\nable to come in, for instance, and decide to keep the provisions of the \npharmaceutical industry, an industry he has been very close to, and at \nthe same time he might then strike out provisions regarding negotiation \nor improved benefits or something else that might help seniors or \npeople and put pressure on the industry to have a more competitive \npricing system.\n  This is something that I believe we should not, in good conscience, \nallow to happen. It is our job to sort through all of the pieces of the \nlegislative process, all the complexities, all the competing needs. If \nwe come up with something that is balanced and supported by this Senate \nand the House of Representatives and it is sent to the President, the \nPresident should not be able to go in and cherry-pick which provisions \nof a compromise he supports or does not support.\n  This particular amendment in this proposal would undermine the very \nintent of Congress. In the case of Medicare, I believe it would create \na situation where it is impossible for us, certainly within this time \nand this administration, to move forward on many positive things that \nare necessary to improve Medicare for seniors or to address Social \nSecurity in a way that keeps Social Security secure for the future.\n  Also, it is important to say that this is not a necessary tool to \nreduce the deficit. In fact, we, on both sides of the aisle, have been \nspeaking about reducing the deficit. On this side of the aisle our \ndistinguished incoming chairman of the Budget Committee has been our \nleader on speaking out through that committee, as has our leader in \nthis Senate. Senator Reid has spoken out and made pay-go a priority, \nfiscal responsibility a priority for us coming into this new year. We \nwill soon adopt what is called pay-as-you-go legislation that basically \nsays, if we decide to spend dollars, whether it is in the form of a tax \ncut or in new spending of some kind, we have to pay for it.\n  It is the same thing that any family or any business has to do: \nfigure out how you are going to pay for it. We are the ones who have \ncommitted, as part of our agenda, our priority: to bring this huge \ndeficit under control and try to get our arms around some fiscal \nresponsibility in this Government. We have put that forward and that \nwill play a major role, reinstituting pay-go.\n  Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nblocked this for 6 years. During that time we have seen deficits go up \nand up and up and decisions being made that have added to the spending \nof this country.\n  We have seen policies that turned a $5.6 trillion surplus created \nunder the Clinton policies into record deficits.\n  Now we understand that we are at a crossroads in this country. It is \nabsolutely critical that we bring fiscal responsibility and we begin to \nturn this around. But this proposal in front of us does not do that. I \nhope we will see strong support on both sides of the aisle for fiscal \nresponsibility and pay-go legislation and begin to make tough decisions \nabout what is in the interests of America, what is in the interests of \nour businesses trying to do business and stay in America, of our \nfamilies who need jobs and health care and want to know they can send \nthe kids to college and breathe the air and drink the water and all of \nthose things that are critical to our quality of life. We have a lot of \ntough decisions to make. But one strategy is not to create this broad \ntool for the President to be able to undermine anything that we are \ndoing together on a bipartisan basis to get to agreement, to be able to \nmove things forward.\n  I am very concerned particularly at this time with this type of \nlegislation. I speak a lot about Medicare. I know the distinguished \nChair is also deeply concerned and involved in health care issues and \nMedicare. We want very much to be able to see change occur, change that \nis good for our seniors, change to make health care coverage and \nprescription drugs more affordable and make sure our businesses, large \nand small, have the capacity to compete effectively in Michigan and be \nable to afford health care for their employees. I am very concerned \nthis kind of proposal would enable the President to come in in support \nof those interests he supports, that I believe are on the opposite side \nof what we are trying to do, unfortunately, in the health care arena, \nand allow him to undermine any effort that we make to go forward \ntogether. People are desperately asking that we move forward and get \nsomething done on the issues that are critical to them, that matter to \nthem.\n  Again, I rise to oppose the Gregg amendment. I encourage colleagues \nto do the same. We stand together and we can move forward together \naround fiscal responsibility. This is not the way to do that. This \ngives unprecedented power and flexibility to the President for him to \nundermine what we need to do together in order to solve big problems \nand get things done for people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have enjoyed this debate on this \namendment. At the risk of sounding like wishy-washy Charlie Brown, I \nagree with both sides; that is, I agree with Senator Conrad absolutely \non the line-item veto. I came to the Congress supporting the line-item \nveto. I voted for the line-item veto. Then I watched how President \nClinton used the line-item veto. What Senator Conrad had to say is \nexactly right. When the Supreme Court struck it down and Senator Byrd \nand Senator Moynihan both talked about how glorious a day it was for \nthe Congress that the line-item veto had been stricken, I took the \nfloor and said: I am converted. I agree with you. I will never vote for \nthe line-item veto again.\n  I remember Senator Moynihan saying,\n\n       If Lyndon Johnson had the line-item veto he would have \n     turned into an emperor.\n\n  We must preserve the rights of the legislature against that kind of \nthing.\n  What Senator Gregg has proposed is not a line-item veto. I know the \npress described it as such, but this will not be the first time the \npress has inaccurately described something that is going on here. Under \nthe terms of Senator Gregg's amendment, the President is limited in the \nnumber of things he can send back to us. They can be overturned with a \nsimple majority vote rather than the standard veto two-thirds. And it \nis not an abrogation of congressional authority. It simply gives the \nPresident the right to say, on selected issues: Do you really want to \ndo this? I have looked this over. I found this, this, and this that \nstrike me as particularly egregious. Do you really want to do this? And \nby a majority vote the Congress can say: Yes, we really do. And it is \ndone.\n  So it is not a line-item veto. It is simply a review of a \nrelatively--not relatively, an absolutely narrow, few number of items.\n  I am not sure I would have crafted it that way. I am not sure this is \ngoing to make much difference. But it does not have the potential for \nthe kinds of mischief that Senator Conrad talked about. I agree with \nSenator Conrad, I am a new convert--not new anymore. I am a firm \nconvert against the line-item veto. But I think the kind of additional \nexecutive review subject to a majority vote to overturn in Congress \nthat Senator Gregg has proposed is not going to threaten the \nfoundations of the Republic or even the stability of this institution. \nFor that reason I will support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may, I listened carefully to the \nremarks of the ranking member, a friend for whom I have great respect \nand with whom I hope to work very closely. I do disagree on this.\n  I have watched Senator Conrad, now, for more than a decade. He is \nusually armed with charts when he comes to the floor or a committee or \na caucus. I have never ever found him to be wrong. I don't think there \nis any person in this body who knows better what he is doing than \nSenator Conrad. I have been just unusually proud of his leadership on \nthe Budget Committee.\n  My objection to this amendment--and I agree with Senator Bennett; I \nwas an original supporter of the line-item veto. This is a different \nday right now. It is a different situation. Different issues are at \nstake in a line-item veto. This is an ethics bill. We are talking about \nlobby reform and earmark reform and we want very much to have a \nbipartisan bill. We are not going to have a bipartisan bill if we get \ninto campaign finance reform and line-item vetoes and a number of other \nissues that are beginning to percolate.\n  It is my hope that we could keep this bill restricted to ethics, \nrestricted to\n\n[[Page S341]]\n\nlobby reform, earmark reform, those things that are properly before \nthis body. That is the only way we are going to get a broad consensus \nthat is going to survive a conference and come back with something all \nMembers can support.\n  I am going to begin to move to table items that are outside of the \ngermane issues of this bill in the hopes that we could keep this broad, \nbipartisan support.\n  The underlying bill from which we have already moved away with the \nsubstitute amendment passed this body early last year by a vote of 90 \nto 8. The substitute amendment seeks to toughen it. Again, the \nsubstitute confines itself to matters within the bill. I must say that \nI think it is ill-advised to come forward with some of these \namendments. At an appropriate time I will rise to begin to move to \ntable them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand we are waiting to lock in \nvotes. I was asking the chairman of the committee if I might speak for \n6 or 8 minutes in morning business while we are waiting to hear back.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for 8 minutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of S. 242 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise at this moment to discuss a vote \nearlier today which began at approximately 12 noon on the Vitter \namendment to the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of \n2007, S. 1.\n  Had I been permitted to vote, I would have voted for the Vitter \namendment. Now, why do I say ``permitted''? Why do I say ``had I been \npermitted to vote''? I say it because even though I was in the Capitol \nBuilding and on my way to the Senate floor, and even though my staff \nhad so advised the Democratic cloakroom and was told that I had time to \nget to the Senate Chamber, the leadership arbitrarily closed the vote \nbefore I could get to the floor. That action prevented me from doing my \nconstitutional duty to represent the people of my State of West \nVirginia. I was not more than 5 minutes from the Senate Chamber.\n  Next year, Mr. President, I will begin my 50th year of service in the \nSenate. In November, I was elected to serve an unprecedented ninth full \nterm in the Senate. And I was also elected, just days ago, by my \ncolleagues to serve as President pro tempore of the Senate, a position \nfourth in line in the order of succession to the Presidency of the \nUnited States.\n  I have cast, as of 11:59 a.m. this morning, 17,779 rollcall votes. \nAnd the vote I was prevented from casting would have made that number \n17,780. The last rollcall that I missed in casting a vote was on March \n30, 2006. It was 5 days after my darling wife of nearly 69 years had \npassed away.\n  And so I rise at this time not to blame anybody or to lecture \nanybody, but I do feel that I owe an explanation to the people of West \nVirginia why I missed the vote. I take these matters very seriously. \nAnd I want to explain to the people, who rightfully expect me to do on \nthis day of January 10--and on every other day that the Senate has \nrollcall votes--they expect me to be here and to answer the rollcall.\n  I well understand the need to avoid undue delays in transacting the \npeople's business. As majority leader of the Senate from 1977 to 1981, \nand from 1987 to 1989, I had to wrestle with such issues myself. It is \nvery difficult to accommodate the schedules of 100 Senators and to get \nthe Nation's business done expeditiously. I know all about that. I have \nbeen down that road. I have had my feet in those tracks before.\n  But I hope that as Senators, who serve in a body that reveres \ntradition, seniority, debate, deliberation, experience, and common \ncourtesy, we try to avoid sacrificing an understanding of individual \nMembers' circumstances and constitutional obligations as we aim for \nefficiency in our work, which we know that the Senate is not expected \nto be, and never will be--never has been--an efficient body. That is \nnot the way legislation is done in a body such as ours where we do have \nfree and open debate.\n  There is no Senate rule mandating the length of time for rollcall \nvotes. I think we have to be careful and considerate in putting \nconstraints on votes. While I wholeheartedly support efforts to avoid \nunduly dragging rollcall votes, I also hope that we will not forget the \ncommon courtesies for which this body has for more than 200 years \nafforded its Members, especially when Senators are making every effort \nto get to the floor and are only a few minutes away from appearing here \nto cast a vote. No real reason exists to deny this Senator a right to \nrepresent his constituents, as I was elected to do.\n\n  Surely we do not need to coldly sacrifice our regard for Members who, \nafter all, are only human and who experience the travails of life which \nbefall many human beings--we have traffic; we have head colds; we have \ninfirmities or unexpected emergencies--when only a slight accommodation \nwould assist them. After all, we do--when I use the pronoun ``we,'' I \ninclude myself--represent real people and we purport to understand \nhuman needs and circumstances. I hope that we will reflect that same \nreasonableness in our treatment of one another and our dealings with \none another here in the Senate and studiously avoid overly arbitrary, \nartificial, sometimes unconscionable and bloodless decrees that are \nsuch an ill fit for a legislative body in which each Member carries \nsuch tremendous burdens and responsibilities under the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that at 5 o'clock today, the \nSenate vote in relation to the following amendments in the order listed \nand that there be 2 minutes between the votes equally divided: the \nVitter amendment No. 5 regarding Indian tribes and the Vitter amendment \nNo. 6 regarding family members; that the time until then be divided as \nfollows: 2 minutes each to Senators Bennett and Feinstein and 5 minutes \nfor Senator Vitter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 6\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield my 2 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from \nLouisiana that would restrict the ability of a campaign to hire the \nspouse or child of a candidate. I just don't see why we would want to \nget into the issue of whom a candidate can put on his or her payroll. \nAs long as it is a fully disclosed expense, which it would be through \ncampaign finance reports and campaign disclosures, then the voters can \njudge whether it is appropriate. In some cases, it may be appropriate; \nin some cases, it may not. Why should we bar the ability of a family \nmember to work for a candidate? I don't see the point of that.\n  This isn't a case where taxpayer dollars are being used and you might \nwant to make sure that you are following some antinepotism rules. This \nis a campaign.\n  As it happens, I have never had a relative on my campaign payroll. I \nshould perhaps make that clear. But many times when people are starting \nout, running for public office the first time, it is family members who \nare willing to\n\n[[Page S342]]\n\nwork on the campaign at very minimal pay in order to help their \nrelative win the race.\n  I don't see this creating a problem. I think it is a mistake for us \nto legislate in this area. I urge opposition to Senator Vitter's \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield to Senator Vitter if he wishes, and then I \nwill wrap up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I urge all Members to vote against the \nmotion to table. I believe I am correct that it will be in the form of \na motion to table.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. VITTER. I urge them to vote against the motion to table. I \nappreciate the legitimate concerns that have been expressed about this \namendment. However, I do think this is not a solution looking for a \nproblem. This is a real problem that we need to solve.\n  The problem is simply this: This has been abused in the past. There \nare clear and documented cases whereby Members, candidates especially, \nuse their political position to add to the family income. If the case \nof a Member or a candidate hiring a family member on a campaign could \ntruly be enforced, if we had a way consistently in all cases to make \nsure that the law was being followed that only bona fide work should be \npaid for at fair market value prices, that would be one thing. That is \nthe law. You can do it, but it is only supposed to be done to \ncompensate actual work at fair market value prices.\n  The fact is, there is no way to police that. There have been plenty \nof situations, unfortunately, in the past where this opportunity was \nused to allow a candidate to use his political position to increase the \nfamily income. This has come to light in the last several years. This \nhas been an unfortunate practice. I think it is part of a whole series \nof abuses that Americans are just fed up with. They see Members of \nCongress, people in politics, using their political position to \nincrease their income or increase their family's income. This is a \nsituation which is wide open for that abuse.\n  Again, it would be one thing if present law were enforced. Present \nlaw says you can do it, yes, but it is only supposed to be for real \nwork, bona fide services at a reasonable compensation level. It is \ncrystal clear that that provision is not and cannot be policed. There \nis no real meaningful way to ensure that. So it is an opportunity which \nhas been used by some folks who use their political position to add to \ntheir family income.\n  This goes to the heart of the concerns of many Americans. It goes to \nthe heart of a lot of issues on the lobbying side. It goes to the heart \nof issues involving campaign finance.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate to solve this problem in the only \nway that is practical, which is to draw a red line, create a clear \nprohibition so that we avoid those abuses which have unfortunately \nhappened in the past.\n  I urge Members of the Senate to vote against the motion to table.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while I am troubled by the potential \nquestions raised by the employment of a family member on a campaign \ncommittee or leadership PAC, I will support the chairman of the Senate \nRules Committee, Senator Feinstein's motion to table the Vitter \namendment No. 6 because it deals primarily with campaign finance \nreforms and because Senator Feinstein has assured me, personally, that \nthe Rules Committee will hold hearings on this specific issue as a part \nof comprehensively addressing campaign finance reform later this year.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I find myself in agreement with the \nSenator from Maine. I don't understand why we are getting into this \nissue at this place and time. I see no evidence of anything improper in \nthis body. To a great extent what I see happening is legislation being \ndeveloped in reaction to things that have happened in the other body, \nnot in this body. I have been very proud of this body because we have \nbeen able to conduct our business in a very respectful manner. If there \nis evidence in this body of any improper and unreasonable payment to \nwhich the Senator seemed to allude, I ask him, please, bring it to the \nRules Committee. I can assure him we will hold a hearing, if necessary. \nWe will pass legislation. But at this time, what we are trying to do is \ncoalesce around a 90-to-8 vote that took place early last year, that \npassed almost unanimously a bill out of this Senate dealing with \nearmarks, dealing with lobbying reform, dealing with ethics reform.\n  We are trying to keep extraneous matters, to the extent that we can, \nout of this bill.\n  With that in mind, I move to table Vitter amendment No. 5 and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent simply to be recognized for the \ntime remaining of my 5 minutes so that I may also address my second \namendment which will be voted on. I misunderstood. I thought the time \nallotments only applied to the amendment I addressed, not the other \namendment. Therefore, I want to address the second amendment as well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 5\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the second of my amendments that will be \nvoted on through a motion to table is with regard to the clear loophole \nin campaign finance law about Indian tribes. We have talked about this \nand debated this. This has been widely recognized for quite some time. \nIt is a loophole in the law that allows tribes to give to candidates \ndirectly, including gambling proceeds, without any necessity of forming \na PAC and going through those rigorous requirements that corporations, \nlabor unions, and other entities have to do. This is a loophole that \nhas been widely recognized and needs to be closed.\n  Certainly no legitimate argument exists that this is beyond the \npresent debate. Think about the single biggest scandal that got us to \nthis debate, the Jack Abramoff scandal. Indian tribes and their \nunfettered access to money, including gambling revenues, was at the \ncenter of the single biggest scandal that brought us to this debate. \nThere is no legitimate argument that the amendment is somehow \nextraneous to the debate. If this is going to be a meaningful exercise \nabout real reform, really cleaning things up, getting serious, not \nprotecting sacred cows, then let's get real about it.\n  One way we get real about it is closing this Indian tribe loophole \nwhich clearly exists and has no legitimate justification. I urge all \nSenators to vote against the motion to table because, again, this goes \nto the heart of the Abramoff matter. We need to properly regulate those \ncampaign contributions in the same way as we do other entities, \ncorporations, labor unions, and the like.\n  With that, I appreciate the deference in allowing me to speak to this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to an amendment to S.1, the Legislative Transparency Act of \n2007, which is proposed by my colleague, Senator David Vitter of \nLouisiana.\n  This amendment amends the Federal Election Campaign Act, FECA, so \nthat Indian tribes would be singled out for the purposes of campaign \nfinance law. In effect, this proposal would prohibit tribal campaign \ncontributions by defining tribes as corporations under our Nation's \ncampaign finance laws.\n  Indian tribes are constitutionally recognized sovereign governments, \nwith whom the Federal Government has a trust relationship. The primary \npurpose of Indian tribes is to provide governmental services to their \nmembers. Corporations are for-profit entities whose primary goal is to \nmaximize profits for its shareholders. Treating Indian tribes as \ncorporations for the purposes of campaign finance sets a dangerous \nprecedent for their treatment in other areas of the law.\n  In addition, I do not support this measure because it would treat \nIndian tribes differently from other similarly situated entities \nregarding their campaign contributions. Indian tribes are exempt from \nthe aggregate limit and\n\n[[Page S343]]\n\nthe reporting requirements on their campaign contributions in the same \nmanner as other unincorporated associations are exempt. While I support \nefforts to require more transparency with respect to the reporting of \nall contributions, I do so with the caveat that all similarly situated \nentities should be subject to the same reporting requirements.\n  If enacted this amendment would limit the ability of tribes to \nparticipate fully in the political process by preventing them from \nmaking campaign contributions.\n  Even though tribes are acknowledged as sovereigns, they have not been \ngranted seats in the U.S. Congress. Instead, they must rely on the \nCongress to represent them. Having served in the United States Senate \nfor 45 years and on the Indian Affairs Committee for the past 28 years, \nI have seen how the Congress has taken actions without considering \ntheir effects on tribes and individual Indians. At times, it even \nseemed that the Congress took action only to appease non-Indians. It \ncauses one to wonder whether the Congress would have taken those \nactions if tribes had been consulted and been allowed to actively \nparticipate in the political process.\n  Due to some bad actions taken by non-Indians, some are calling to \nprevent tribes from fully participating in the electoral process. We \nmust pause and reflect upon the impact that this proposal will have now \nand in the long term. We must ensure that the tribes, who were the \nvictims of illegal acts, are not penalized in the name of reform. To do \nthis, we must fully consider the unique nature of Indian tribes. Tribes \nneed a voice to reflect their unique legal status. Without a seat in \nthe U.S. Congress they must be allowed to use other means to \nparticipate in this process.\n  And once again, we must ensure that Indian gaming is not unfairly \nblamed. Some believe that Indian gaming is providing an improper tribal \nadvantage in the political process. During the 2004 election cycle, \ntribal contributions comprised one-third of 1 percent of total \ncontributions nationwide. Given the facts, it is hard to conceive of an \nunfair tribal advantage.\n  I believe that many critics of full tribal participation in the \nelection process do not understand the unique history, status, and \nrelationship that Indian tribes have with the Federal Government. \nIndian tribes have much to lose in the Federal process. The U.S. \ngovernment has a history of taking from Indian tribes, and taking \nwithout fulfilling our obligations. We must fully consider the tribal \nrole in the Federal process before determining that gaming revenues \ncannot be used in the Federal process or that tribes should not be \nallowed to fully participate. The U.S. Senate committees of \njurisdiction should have the opportunity to hold hearings and fully \nexplore this issue.\n  Therefore, for these reasons I urge my colleagues to join me in \nopposing this proposed measure, and preserving the rights of Indian \ntribes to participate in the political process.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to speak in response to the \namendment offered by Mr. Vitter yesterday that relates to the \napplication of the Federal campaign finance laws to Indian tribes. As \nMr. Vitter suggested, this issue is outside the scope of the bill \npresently before us, and we should consider it at a later date when \noverall campaign fiance matters are being reviewed. I expect there to \nbe a motion to table his amendment until a more appropriate time, and I \nwill support such a motion.\n  More importantly though, I feel compelled to respond to some of the \nstatements made in support of the amendment that are simply factually \ninaccurate. Mr. Vitter offered his amendment to correct what he \ndescribes as a very significant loophole in the campaign finance laws \nfor Indian tribes. He stated that unlike other entities Indian tribes \ncan give money directly from their tribal revenues and are not subject \nto the giving limits that apply to everyone else. Mr. Vitter stated \nthat we should treat Indian tribes exactly as we treat other entities.\n  Contrary to these statements, we do treat Indian tribes exactly as we \ntreat other unincorporated entities.\n  Last year, the Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing on the \napplicability of the Federal campaign finance laws to Indian tribes. \nThe committee held this hearing to counter the significant factual \nerrors that were being reported in the news. In fact, the Federal \nElection Commission felt the need to issue an Advisory on Indian Tribes \nlast year to clarify the misconceptions about the law that regulates \nthe political activity of Indian tribes. The chairman and vice chairman \nof the Federal Election Commission testified before the committee on \nhow the campaign finance laws apply to Indian tribes.\n  So let me convey some important facts about how Indian tribes are \nindeed treated under the campaign finance laws:\n  Indian tribes are treated as ``a group of persons'' under the Federal \ncampaign finance laws. This decision was first made by the Federal \nElection Commission in 1978.\n  Thus, Indian tribes are subject to the contribution limitations and \nprohibitions applicable to all ``persons'' under the law. We treat them \nthe same as all other persons. For the last election cycle, this was \n$2,100 to each candidate, $26,700 per year to a political party's \nnational committee, and $5,000 per year to a political action \ncommittee.\n  Similar to other unincorporated entities, Indian tribes do not have \nto report their political contributions. However, political committees, \nincluding candidate and party committees, that receive contributions \nfrom Indian tribes must report those contributions in their disclosure \nreports.\n  Also, similar to other unincorporated entities, Indian tribes are not \nsubject to the cumulative giving limits applicable to ``individuals.'' \nThis is because Indian tribes are not ``individuals.'' This is the same \nway that other types of organizations are treated, such as partnerships \nor certain limited liability companies.\n  Indian tribes are not treated in any unique manner under the Federal \ncampaign finance laws. They are treated just like other unincorporated \nentities. The concerns raised by Mr. Vitter are not unique to Indian \ntribes. Many entities can give money directly from their revenues, and \nonly ``individuals'' are subject to a cumulative giving limit.\n  Now that is not to say that there shouldn't be any changes to the \ncampaign finance laws, or that there should not be more transparency \nwith regards to political contributions. However, Indian tribes should \nnot be singled out because of misunderstandings about how the Federal \nlaws apply to them. Nor should the sovereignty of Indian tribes or \ntheir ability to represent their tribal members be infringed upon.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, once again, I move to table the Vitter \namendment No. 5 and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nis a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) and \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) \nwould have voted ``no.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It is one factor that has helped erode public confidence in the \nCongress.\n  If there was a way to truly police present law, I would say fine, but \nthe fact is, there clearly is not and there is no way to know if \nservices are being rendered and if a proper amount is being paid. So it \nis and will remain, if this amendment is tabled, a clear conduit of \nabuse of which some Members--I am not saying many or most, some \nMembers--will take advantage. That will continue to hurt this \ninstitution and all of us who don't participate in that practice.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, once again, this is related to \ncampaign spending. It does not belong in this bill. We are trying to \nkeep a bill with which the greatest majority of the Senate can agree.\n  Secondly, I know of no problems related to this issue in this body. \nShould there be any evidence that any Senator has that there are \nproblems, please bring it to the Rules Committee and we will do \nsomething about it.\n  In the absence of that, I move to table the Vitter amendment No. 6, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to starting the vote on this and \ngranting the request for the yeas and nays, we are going to come in at \n9:30 in the morning. There will be a period for morning business for an \nhour. Then we hope to have debate on the Stevens amendment, a serious \namendment, dealing with travel. We hope to be able to complete that \ndebate fairly quickly, in an hour or so. So there will be a vote on \nthat amendment, if things work out the way we hope, at around 11:30 in \nthe morning.\n  There are a number of amendments pending. The managers have done \nextremely well. As I said earlier this morning, we couldn't have two \nbetter people managing this bill. People who have amendments to offer, \nplease come and offer them; otherwise, we are going to get the idea \nthat maybe people are wanting to move forward on this legislation in \nsome other way.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Once again, Mr. President, I move to table the \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. (When her name was called). Present.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) and \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Brownback) and the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Are there any other Senators in the \nChamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 41, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 4 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Bunning\n     Byrd\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Kennedy\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Stabenow\n     Sununu\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Allard\n     Bayh\n     Burr\n     Cantwell\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Roberts\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                        ANSWERED ``PRESENT''--1\n\n       \n     Boxer\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Brownback\n     Crapo\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 17 to Amendment No. 3\n\n   Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Amendment No. 17 by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire is pending.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Second Look \nat Wasteful Spending amendment offered by Senator Gregg to the pending \nLegislative Transparency Act of 2007.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this amendment, as I was to \nbe a cosponsor of the Stop-Over-Spending Act of 2006, which contained a \nsimilar provision.\n  Spending is out of control and it is time that Congress put its money \nwhere its mouth is when it comes to reigning in spending. In addition \nto being a good first step, this amendment is symbolic because it is \nthe first opportunity of this new Congress to do so.\n  I hope the new majority party will use this opportunity to live up to \nits promise of fiscal responsibility and support this amendment.\n  The amendment is simple. In a nutshell, it allows the President to \nidentify individual items of wasteful spending that, for one reason or \nanother, slipped through Congress and send them back for closer \nscrutiny.\n  Once under the microscope for Congress and all of America to see, \nboth houses of Congress will have the opportunity to give the \nindividual proposal an up-or-down vote.\n  If both Houses deem the spending appropriate, the President must \nrelease the funds. On the other hand, if it does\n\n[[Page S345]]\n\nnot survive the scrutiny of both Houses, the spending is rescinded.\n  Importantly, any savings resulting from rescinded items of spending \ngoes to reduce the Federal deficit. With record revenues streaming into \nthe Treasury as a result of the Republican pro-growth tax cuts, we have \nmade significant strides toward cutting the deficit. This amendment \nprovides an opportunity to chip away at the deficit from the spending \nside of the equation.\n  Some of you may recall the Line Item Veto Authority that a Republican \nCongress gave to President Clinton in 1996 and wonder how this differs. \nThis legislation, although similar in purpose, is not nearly as far-\nreaching as the authority given to President Clinton.\n  Under that authority, presidential cancellations went into effect \nautomatically, without Congressional action. Unlike that law, the \nSecond Look at Wasteful Spending legislation requires that Congress \ntake affirmative steps to affirm or deny any rescission package \nproposed by the President. In other words, Congress has the final say \non the President's rescission request.\n  Today's legislation contains several other important limitations on \nthe President's authority. First, the President is limited to the \nsubmission of four rescission packages per year. Second, the \nPresident's rescission requests are limited to discretionary or \nmandatory spending or tax bills introduced on or after the \nlegislation's enactment. Third, the authority sunsets in 4 years to \nallow Congress to reevaluate it after two Presidents have each used it \nfor 2 years.\n  I am pleased that Senator Gregg chose to address this issue during \nthe pending lobbying reform legislation. Both pieces legislation share \nthe goal of bringing greater transparency to the Federal spending \nprocess.\n  While I do not pretend that it will solve all of the long-term fiscal \nproblems--such as long-term entitlement spending--I do believe that it \nis an important and symbolic first step.\n  Even if the authority is never used by the President, its mere \nexistence will have a chilling effect on wasteful discretionary \nspending. Individual Members of Congress will give second thought to \npromoting wasteful items spending that they know will receive a second \nlook.\n  Similarly, it will provide an additional check on new items of \nmandatory spending, each of which has the potential to exacerbate the \ncrisis that is the unsustainable growth in long-term entitlement \nspending. I say crisis because we received testimony in the Budget \nCommittee that, if left unchecked, in under 30 years spending on just \nthree entitlement programs--Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security--\nwill exceed, as a share of GDP, the amount of spending that the entire \nU.S. Government consumes today.\n  In other words, those three programs are unsustainable. To further \nput the issue in perspective, outstanding 75-year Government promises, \nincluding Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, exceed the total \namount of taxes collected in U.S. history by $26 trillion.\n  Again, this amendment is only the first step in reducing spending--\nsomething that the American taxpayers demand and deserve.\n  I am hopeful that the new majority party will take the opportunity to \nsupport its promises of fiscal responsibility and join me in supporting \nthis amendment.\n  It will bring more accountability and transparency to the legislative \nprocess so that Americans will know what is happening and can hold \nMembers of Congress more accountable.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 15, as Modified\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Ted Stevens,\n     President Pro Tempore of the Senate, U.S. Senate, The \n         Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Stevens: Pursuant to section 102(b) of the \n     Congressional Accountability Act, I am pleased to announce \n     that the Board of Directors of the Compliance has completed \n     its biennial report. Accompanying this letter is a copy of \n     our section 102(b) report for the 109th Congress.\n       The section 102(b) report and its incorporated \n     recommendations are an integral part of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act. As a principle function of the Board, \n     this report provides insight into the ever-changing climate \n     that exemplifies the working environment of the legislative \n     branch. As such, the Board views the submission of this \n     report as the primary method of keeping the Act alive beyond \n     its inception. With this submission, the Board presents its \n     prior recommendations and specifically makes recommendations \n     concerning the need for additional tools and mechanisms to \n     increase the Office's efforts to ensure continued safety and \n     health of legislative branch employees and visitors; as well \n     as the need for regulations in the legislative branch for \n     veterans entering and returning to the workforce.\n       With more than ten years of experience living with \n     congressional accountability, the Board and the office are \n     committed to the recommendations we outline in this report. \n     As the sixth such report to Congress, we are seeking \n     appropriate time for review, consultation, and action in the \n     110th Congress.\n\n[[Page S346]]\n\n       On behalf of the Board of Directors, I submit this \n     important document for your review and attention.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Tamara E. Chrisler,\n                                        Acting Executive Director.\n\n       Office of Compliance Section 102(b) Report, December 2006\n\n       This is the sixth biennial report submitted to Congress by \n     the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance of the \n     U.S. Congress, pursuant to the requirements of section 102(b) \n     of the Congressional Accountability Act (2 U.S.C. 1302 (b)). \n     Section 102(b) of the Act states in relevant part:\n       Beginning on December 31, 1996, and every 2 years \n     thereafter, the Board shall report on (A) whether or to what \n     degree [provisions of Federal law (including regulations) \n     relating to (A) the terms and conditions of employment \n     (including hiring, promotion, demotion, termination, salary, \n     wages, overtime compensation, benefits, work assignments or \n     reassignments, grievance and disciplinary procedures, \n     protection from discrimination in personnel actions, \n     occupational health and safety, and family and medical and \n     other leave) of employees; and (B) access to public services \n     and accommodations] . . . are applicable or inapplicable to \n     the legislative branch, and (B) with respect to provisions \n     inapplicable to the legislative branch, whether such \n     provisions should be made applicable to the legislative \n     branch. The presiding officers of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate shall cause each such report \n     to be printed in the Congressional Record and each such \n     report shall be referred to the committees of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate with jurisdiction.\n       Bracketed portion from section 102(b)(1).\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Prior to the enactment of the Congressional Accountability \n     Act of 1995 (CAA), Congress recognized the need to legislate \n     many aspects of the workplace, and it did so by passing laws \n     to address workplace rights and the employment relationship. \n     These laws, however, were not applicable to Congress. \n     Congress had excluded itself and other instrumentalities of \n     the legislative branch from the requirements of these laws. \n     Passage of the CAA, with nearly unanimous approval, in the \n     opening days of the 104th Congress, reflected a national \n     consensus that Congress must live under the laws it enacts \n     for the rest of society.\n       The CAA is not meant to be static. The Act intended that \n     there be an ongoing, vigilant review of federal law to ensure \n     that Congress continue to apply to itself--where \n     appropriate--the labor, employment, health, and safety laws \n     it passes. To further this goal, the Board of Directors of \n     the Office of Compliance (``Board'') was tasked with the \n     responsibility of reviewing federal laws each Congress to \n     make recommendations on how the CAA could be expanded. Since \n     its creation, the Board has duly submitted biennial Reports \n     to Congress, starting in 1996, detailing the limited and \n     prudent amendments that should be made to the CAA. There was \n     also an Interim Report in 2001, regarding Section 508 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In past reports, the Board has \n     taken a broad approach in presenting its recommendations to \n     amend the Congressional Accountability Act, and has \n     encouraged Congress to consider and act upon those \n     recommendations. By including Appendices A through C in this \n     Report, the Board incorporates these prior recommendations as \n     part of this Report: amendments to the Rehabilitation Act, \n     title II and title III of the Civil Rights Act, record-\n     keeping and notice posting, jury duty, bankruptcy, \n     garnishment, and employee protection provisions of \n     environmental statutes. The Board continues to ask that these \n     prior recommendations be implemented.\n       Now that Congress has had substantial time to reflect on \n     the contents of the Board's prior reports, it is critical \n     that Congress continue the example set in 1995 with the \n     enactment of the original provisions of the CAA. Without \n     action on the Board's recommendations, the worthy goal of the \n     Congressional Accountability Act gradually may be eroded.\n       The overwhelming bipartisan support for the CAA's passage \n     in 1995 is a testament to the importance of--and support \n     for--the principles the CAA embodies, both in Congress and in \n     the electorate as a whole. While recognizing the enormous \n     importance of many of the other issues faced today by \n     Congress, the Board is hopeful that issuance of this 2006 \n     Section 102(b) Report will result in legislative action to \n     finally implement these recommendations, so that the CAA \n     remains current with the employment needs of the legislative \n     branch.\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       In this 2006 Report, the Board is prioritizing its \n     recommendations, without in any way diminishing the \n     importance of the recommendations made in prior Reports. In \n     this current Report, the Board focuses on two areas of vital \n     and immediate concern to the covered community--safety and \n     health, and veterans' rights--and urges Congress to take \n     action on them.\n       The Office of Compliance Office of the General Counsel \n     (``OGC'') is responsible for ensuring safety and health of \n     legislative branch employees through the enforcement of the \n     provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act \n     (``OSHA''). This responsibility includes inspection of the \n     covered community, which the Office of the General Counsel \n     performs in collaboration with employing offices. While \n     enormous progress has been achieved by the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol (``AOC'') and other employing \n     offices in improving health and safety conditions, there \n     remain circumstances where progress will be enhanced if the \n     OGC is provided specific tools to perform: whistle blower and \n     similar retaliation protection, temporary restraining orders, \n     investigatory subpoenas, and recognition by the responsible \n     party for health and safety violations in covered facilities. \n     With these tools, the Office of the General Counsel would be \n     better positioned to ensure that the covered community is a \n     safe and healthy one for its employers and employees, as well \n     as its visitors.\n       Congress has enacted laws to ensure that soldiers with \n     civilian employment will not be penalized for their time \n     spent away from their employers while serving in the \n     military. Through the enactment of these laws, Congress \n     ensured that military service will not prevent individuals \n     from remaining professionally competitive with their civilian \n     counterparts. The Veterans' Employment Opportunities Act \n     (``VEOA'') and the Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Act (``USERRA'') currently provide protections \n     for military personnel entering and returning to federal and \n     other civilian workforces. Under VEOA, Congress has enacted \n     protections for these soldiers, so that in certain \n     circumstances, they receive a preference for selection to \n     federal employment. Regulations for these laws have been \n     implemented in the executive branch, and the Board encourages \n     Congress to implement corresponding regulations in the \n     legislative branch.\n\n\n                            Recommendations\n\n     I. Whistle Blower Protection Act Application to the CAA\n       Retaliation protections\n       Over the years, the Office of Compliance has received \n     numerous inquiries from legislative branch employees about \n     their legal rights following their having reported \n     allegations of employer wrongdoing or mismanagement. \n     Unfortunately, these employees are not currently protected \n     from employment retaliation by any law. The retaliation \n     provisions of the CAA limit protection to employees who, in \n     general, exercise their rights under the statute. Whistle \n     blower protections are intended specifically to prevent \n     employers from taking retaliatory employment action against \n     an employee who discloses information which he or she \n     believes evidences a violation of law, gross mismanagement, \n     or substantial and specific danger to public health or \n     safety.\n       The Whistle Blower Protection Act (``WPA'') prohibits \n     executive branch personnel decision makers from taking any \n     action to:\n       (3) coerce the political activity of any person (including \n     the providing of any political contribution or service), or \n     take any action against any employee or applicant for \n     employment as a reprisal for the refusal of any person to \n     engage in such political activity;\n       (4) deceive or willfully obstruct any person with respect \n     to such person's right to compete for employment;\n       (5) influence any person to withdraw from competition for \n     any position for the purpose of improving or injuring the \n     prospects of any other person for employment;\n       (6) grant any preference or advantage not authorized by \n     law, rule, or regulation to any employee or applicant for \n     employment (including defining the scope or manner of \n     competition or the requirements for any position) for the \n     purpose of improving or injuring the prospects of any \n     particular person for employment;\n       (7) appoint, employ, promote, advance, or advocate for the \n     appointment, promotion, advancement, in or to a civilian \n     position any individual who is a relative (as defined in \n     section 3110(a)(3) of this title) of such employee if such \n     position is in the agency in which the employee is serving as \n     a public official (as defined in section 3110(a)(2) of this \n     title) or over which such employee exercises jurisdiction or \n     control as such an official;\n       (8) take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to \n     take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or \n     applicant for employment because of--\n       (A) any disclosure of information by an employee or \n     applicant for employment because of--\n       (i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or\n       (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse \n     of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public \n     health or safety, if such disclosure is not specifically \n     prohibited by law and if such information is not specifically \n     required by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest \n     of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs; or\n       (B) any disclosure to the Special Counsel, or to the \n     Inspector General of an agency or another employee designated \n     by the head of the agency to receive such disclosures of \n     information which the employee or applicant reasonably \n     believes evidences--\n       (i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or\n       (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse \n     of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public \n     health or safety, if such disclosure is not specifically \n     prohibited by law and if such information is not specifically \n     required by Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest \n     of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs;\n       (9) take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to \n     take, any personnel action against any employee or applicant \n     for employment because of--\n\n[[Page S347]]\n\n       (A) the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance \n     right granted by any law, rule, or regulation;\n       (B) testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any \n     individual in the exercise of any right referred to in \n     subparagraph (A);\n       (C) cooperating with or disclosing information to the \n     Inspector General of an agency, or the Special Counsel, in \n     accordance with applicable provisions of law; or\n       (D) for refusing to obey an order that would require the \n     individual to violate a law;\n       (10) discriminate for or against any employee or applicant \n     for employment on the basis of conduct which does not \n     adversely affect the performance of the employee or applicant \n     or the performance of others; except that nothing in this \n     paragraph shall prohibit an agency from taking into account \n     in determining suitability or fitness any conviction of the \n     employee or applicant of any crime under the laws of any \n     State or the District of Columbia, or of the United \n     States.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes appear at end of report.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Over the years, legislative branch employees have proven \n     essential in informing the General Counsel of the possible \n     existence of serious hazards that may affect the safety and \n     health of employees, management representatives, and members \n     of the public that would otherwise not come to his attention. \n     In order to assure the free flow of this information, it is \n     incumbent upon Congress to protect employees from \n     intimidation and retaliation when they exercise their rights \n     to report and allege violations.\n       On July 17, 2006, Senator Chuck Grassley introduced a bill \n     \\2\\ to Congress that would amend the Congressional \n     Accountability Act to give legislative branch employees some \n     of the whistle blower protection rights that are available to \n     executive branch employees. In the executive branch, \n     employees can take allegations of employment reprisal based \n     on whistle blowing to the Office of the Special Counsel or \n     can bring an individual action directly before the Merit \n     Systems Protection Board.\\3\\ As the bill is written, \n     legislative branch employees would bring such matters to the \n     Office of Compliance's dispute resolution program. Although \n     this program provides a mechanism for employees to bring a \n     complaint, the employees would have to prosecute these very \n     technical issues themselves, or incur the cost of hiring an \n     attorney to litigate these issues. Employees of the executive \n     branch do not bear such a burden. To assure that whistle \n     blower protection rights are effectively vindicated, it is \n     imperative that the General Counsel be granted the same \n     authority to investigate and prosecute OSHA-type violations \n     of the CAA, as is provided under other remedial labor laws.\n       Executive agencies that are required to enforce labor and \n     employment rights are often given explicit statutory \n     authority to conduct investigations and litigation respecting \n     charges of employer intimidation and retaliation of \n     employees. For example, the General Counsel of the Federal \n     Labor Relations Authority may investigate discrimination \n     based on the filing of an unfair labor practice.\\4\\ Under the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Secretary of Labor is \n     given very clear authority to investigate and prosecute \n     reprisals.\\5\\ The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is \n     granted authority to initiate charges and conduct \n     investigations into claims of discrimination.\\6\\ The National \n     Labor Relations Act also grants to its General Counsel the \n     authority to issue a complaint upon the filing of an employee \n     charge of retaliation.\\7\\\n       Covered employees who have sought information from the \n     Office of Compliance respecting their substantive rights \n     under the safety and health provisions of the CAA have \n     expressed concern about their exposure when they come forward \n     to provide evidence in such investigations. They have also \n     indicated reluctance or financial inability to shoulder the \n     litigation burden without the support of the Office of the \n     General Counsel investigative process and enforcement \n     procedures.\n       The Board of Directors believes that the ability of the \n     General Counsel to investigate and prosecute retaliation in \n     the OSH process would effectively serve to relieve employees \n     of these burdens. It would also preserve confidence in the \n     CAA and empower legislative branch employees to exercise \n     their rights without fear of adverse action in reprisal for \n     their protected activities.\n       Protection from solicitation of recommendations\n       The Board believes that the subsection (b)(2) rule of the \n     Whistle Blower Protection Act should be made applicable to \n     all legislative branch employing offices, other than the two \n     houses of Congress and the entities listed in section \n     220(e)(2)(A)-(E) of the CAA.\n       The Board urges Congress to discourage ``political'' \n     recommendations in the filling of covered positions. \n     Specifically, subsection (b)(2) of the Whistle Blower \n     Protection Act provides that anyone with personnel authority \n     may not: ``solicit or consider any recommendation or \n     statement, oral or written, with respect to any individual \n     who requests or is under consideration for any personnel \n     action unless such recommendation or statement is based on \n     the personal knowledge or records of the person furnishing \n     it and consists of--(A) an evaluation of the work \n     performance, ability, aptitude, or general qualifications \n     of such individual; or (B) an evaluation of the character, \n     loyalty, or suitability of such individual . . .''\n       The Board recommends that Congress apply this restriction \n     to anyone with personnel authority in any legislative branch \n     employing office, other than the two houses of Congress and \n     the entities listed in section 220(e)(2)(A)-(E) of the CAA.\n     II. Increased safety and health compliance tools\n       Temporary restraining orders\n       The Occupational Safety and Health Act is applied, in part, \n     to the legislative branch through Section 215(b) of the \n     Congressional Accountability Act. Under this section, the \n     remedy for a violation of the CAA is a corrective order \n     similar to such an order granted under the remedial section \n     of the OSH Act. Among other things, the OSH Act authorizes \n     the Secretary of Labor to seek a temporary restraining order \n     in district court in the case of imminent danger. Such \n     enforcement authority is necessary for the General Counsel of \n     the Office of Compliance to ensure that safety and health \n     violations are remedied expeditiously. The General Counsel \n     takes the position that although Section 215(b) of the CAA \n     does not expressly provide preliminary injunctive relief as a \n     remedy, such authority is implied by the Act's terms. Certain \n     employing offices, as well as other stakeholders, however, \n     differ with this interpretation, as the language is not \n     stated directly in the Act. Accordingly, the Board seeks to \n     amend the current language of the Act to alleviate all \n     ambiguity and to make clear the General Counsel's authority \n     to seek such relief.\n       Express authority to seek preliminary injunctive relief is \n     essential to the General Counsel's ability to eliminate \n     promptly all potential workplace hazards. Although a \n     situation has not been presented yet where a court injunction \n     was necessary to resolve a case of imminent danger, the \n     General Counsel can foresee the very likelihood of having to \n     do so. In fiscal year 2006, the General Counsel increased his \n     efforts to remedy two serious violations which posed imminent \n     danger to workers: unabated safety violations which existed \n     in the Capitol Power Plant utility tunnels since before 1999, \n     and the lack of safety shoring for AOC workers in trenches \n     surrounding Library of Congress buildings. Fortunately, the \n     prompt filing of a formal complaint led the AOC to implement \n     immediate interim abatement measures to protect workers in \n     the tunnels from imminent harm. In addition, the filing of a \n     citation for the safety shoring violation prompted the AOC to \n     take immediate steps to install appropriate shoring to \n     protect its employees.\n       In both of these instances, the need for injunctive relief \n     was obviated due to the prompt and voluntary compliance of \n     the AOC. However, in other situations, employing offices may \n     not so readily accept responsibility for correcting an \n     imminent safety hazard. For example, the increased use of \n     contractors to perform construction and repair work on \n     Capitol Hill creates situations where the responsibility for \n     assuring safe conditions may not be as clear, or as readily \n     accepted, by an employing office. Cases of that nature \n     demonstrate the need for the availability of injunctive \n     relief to ensure the immediate and ongoing safety of \n     employees and members of the public pending resolution of \n     issues of responsibility and cost.\n       The Board urges Congress to recognize the General Counsel's \n     need to have the authority to seek preliminary injunctive \n     relief. Although implicitly provided in the Act, the current \n     language under Section 215(b) creates ambiguity as to whether \n     such authority has been granted to the General Counsel. The \n     Board recommends that the CAA be amended to clarify that the \n     General Counsel has the standing to seek a temporary \n     restraining order in Federal district court and that the \n     court has jurisdiction to issue the order.\n       Investigatory subpoenas\n       The General Counsel of the Office of Compliance is \n     responsible for conducting health and safety inspections in \n     covered offices in the legislative branch. In implementation \n     of this mandate, the General Counsel is granted many, but not \n     all, of the same authorities that are granted to the \n     Secretary of Labor under section 8 of the Occupational Safety \n     and Health Act.\\8\\ One of the significant authorities granted \n     to the Secretary of Labor is that of issuing investigatory \n     subpoenas in aid of inspections. Other federal agencies, such \n     as the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Labor \n     Relations Authority, likewise are given such authority in \n     implementation of their authority to investigate complaints. \n     However, the Congressional Accountability Act does not grant \n     to the General Counsel the authority to require the \n     attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence in \n     furtherance of his investigations.\n       While most employing offices do not directly refuse to \n     provide requested information during the General Counsel's \n     investigations, significant delays in providing information \n     are, unfortunately, not unusual. The lack of authority to \n     compel the prompt release of information and witnesses \n     from employing offices hampers the ability of the General \n     Counsel to enforce health and safety regulations. To \n     conduct a thorough workplace inspection, the General \n     Counsel must interview witnesses and examine information \n     that may reside solely within the possession of the \n     employing office, and not otherwise readily available to \n     employees, the public, or the General Counsel. Absent the \n     authority to issue investigatory subpoenas, an employing \n     office may, with impunity,\n\n[[Page S348]]\n\n     refuse or simply stall in responding to the General \n     Counsel's requests for information. Such actions would \n     hinder investigations and may exacerbate potential health \n     and safety hazards. Recently, an employing office argued \n     that the General Counsel was not entitled to the records \n     of results of testing for hearing damage performed on \n     legislative employees. The General Counsel was without an \n     efficient mechanism to gain access to this information.\n       Currently, the only means to compel production of documents \n     or testimony when cooperation is not forthcoming is to issue \n     a citation and a complaint, and institute legal proceedings \n     against the employing office. Besides being costly, this \n     process is counterproductive to the General Counsel's efforts \n     to maintain and further a collaborative relationship with \n     employing offices. In addition, the inherent delays of \n     litigation may have the effect of exposing employees and the \n     public to unabated hazard and significant risk of exposure or \n     injury. Prompt production of information or access to \n     witnesses allows the General Counsel to collaborate with \n     employing offices and make an informed decision and assess \n     risks and hazards. This authority will directly enhance the \n     ability of the General Counsel to carry out his statutory \n     duty to maintain a safe and healthy workplace.\n       The Office of the Architect of the Capitol is responsible \n           for safety and health violations in covered facilities\n       In its Report on Occupational Safety and Health Inspections \n     for the 108th Congress, the General Counsel raised a concern \n     regarding enforcing compliance with the OSH Act where work is \n     performed by contractors hired by the Architect of the \n     Capitol. In the 108th Biennial Report, three specific \n     incidents were cited wherein AOC contractors created \n     hazardous situations that posed significant risk to property \n     in one instance, and severe bodily injury to employees and \n     the public in the other two. The latter two conditions were \n     corrected by the AOC, even though the AOC asserted it had no \n     obligation to do so. In the other situation, a citation was \n     issued by the General Counsel; however, the AOC has contested \n     this citation, asserting that it has limited, if any, \n     responsibility to monitor or ensure compliance with OSHA \n     regulations and safety standards whenever work is performed \n     by contractors.\n       OSHA, rather than the Office of Compliance General Counsel, \n     has jurisdiction over AOC private sector contractors. As the \n     AOC increasingly relies on such contractors to perform its \n     construction and repair work, it is foreseeable that safety \n     and health enforcement in the legislative branch could \n     increasingly devolve to OSHA rather than the Office of \n     Compliance General Counsel. Were the AOC to prevail in its \n     contention that it was not responsible for hazards created by \n     its contractors, the ability of the General Counsel to \n     protect legislative branch employees would be severely \n     undermined. Moreover, divided jurisdiction over the \n     elimination of hazardous conditions that affect legislative \n     branch employees would appear to be contrary to the purpose \n     of the CAA.\n       The General Counsel's jurisdiction to hold an employing \n     office accountable for complying with safety standards does \n     not turn on whether the employing office performs its work \n     directly or through the use of a contractor. Otherwise, the \n     health and safety in much of the legislative branch would \n     depend on the diligence and skill of independent contractors \n     rather than that of the Architect of the Capitol. The \n     Government Accountability Office recently expressed a similar \n     concern that the ``AOC had not fully exercised its authority \n     to have the contractors take corrective actions to address \n     recurring safety concerns'' in regard to construction at the \n     Capitol Visitor Center.\\9\\\n       OSHA has a ``Multi-Employer Citation Policy,'' \\10\\ under \n     which employers can be considered both a ``controlling and \n     exposing employer engaged in construction and repair work.'' \n     This policy requires that these multi-employers be held \n     accountable and responsible for any safety violations in \n     their facilities. Because the AOC is charged with the \n     responsibility for the supervision and control of all \n     services necessary for the protection and care of the Capitol \n     and the Senate and House Office Buildings, the AOC would be \n     considered a multi-employer, under OSHA's definition, and \n     thereby accountable and responsible for any safety violations \n     in its facilities.\\11\\ The Board of Directors encourages \n     Congress to adopt OSHA's policy to ensure the uniform pattern \n     of enforcement throughout the legislative branch.\n       The Board urges Congress to take a realistic look at the \n     safety and health concerns in the covered community. Much \n     work has been done, and progress continues to be made, to \n     ensure that Congress provides a safe and healthy environment \n     for its employees and visitors. In order to ensure this \n     continued progress, there are certain mechanisms that must \n     be in place for the General Counsel of the Office of \n     Compliance to ensure that safety and health risks are at a \n     minimum and are thoroughly and expeditiously addressed. \n     The Board encourages Congress to allow the General Counsel \n     to implement these tools to meet this goal.\n     III. Veterans' rights\n       Veterans' Employment Opportunities Act\n       Since the end of the Civil War, the United States \n     Government has granted veterans a certain degree of \n     preference in federal employment, in recognition of their \n     duty to country, sacrifice, and exceptional capabilities and \n     skills. Initially, these preferences were provided through a \n     series of statutes and Executive Orders. In 1944, however, \n     Congress passed the first law that granted our service men \n     and women preference in federal employment: the Veterans' \n     Preference Act of 1944.\\12\\ The Veterans' Preference Act \n     provided that veterans who are disabled or who served in \n     military campaigns during specified time periods are \n     ``preference eligible'' veterans and would be entitled to \n     preference over non-veterans (and over non-preference-\n     eligible veterans) in decisions involving selections and \n     retention in reductions-in-force.\n       In 1998, Congress passed the Veterans Employment \n     Opportunities Act (``VEOA''), \\13\\ which ``strengthen[s] and \n     broadens'' \\14\\ the rights and remedies available to military \n     veterans who are entitled to preferences in federal \n     employment. In particular, Congress clearly stated in the law \n     itself that certain ``rights and protections'' of veterans' \n     preference law provisions for certain executive branch \n     employees, ``shall apply'' to certain ``covered employees'' \n     in the legislative branch.\\15\\\n       Initially, the Board published an Advanced Notice of \n     Proposed Rulemaking for VEOA regulations on February 28, \n     2000, and March 9, 2000. Upon consideration of the comments \n     received, the Board changed its approach and published a \n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on December 6, 2001. Since that \n     time, the Board has engaged in extensive discussions with \n     stakeholders to obtain input and suggestions into the \n     drafting of the regulations. The Board is mindful that \n     stakeholder input is critical in ensuring that the proposed \n     regulations capture the particular workings and procedures of \n     the legislative branch. To that end, the Board is committed \n     to investing as much time as is necessary to promulgate and \n     implement the VEOA regulations.\n       One of the most critical aspects of drafting these \n     regulations has been to acknowledge the longstanding and \n     significant differences between the personnel policies and \n     practices, as well as the history, of the legislative branch \n     and the executive branch. In particular, the executive branch \n     distinguishes between employees in the ``competitive \n     service'' and the ``excepted service,'' often with differing \n     personnel rules applying to these two services. The \n     legislative branch has no such classification system and \n     hence, no dichotomy.\n       Although the CAA mandates application to the legislative \n     branch of certain VEOA provisions originally drafted for the \n     executive branch, the Board notes the central distinction \n     made in the underlying statute: certain veterans' preference \n     protections (regarding hiring) applied only to executive \n     branch employees in the ``competitive'' service, while others \n     (governing reductions in force and transfers) applied both to \n     the ``competitive'' and ``excepted'' service. For example, \n     the hiring practice in the executive branch includes a \n     numeric rating and ranking process. Such process includes a \n     point-preference for certain veterans. Because no such rating \n     and ranking process exists in the legislative branch, the \n     application of the point-preference had to be adjusted to \n     properly fit the particular practices of the legislative \n     branch.\n       The extensive discussions with various stakeholders across \n     Congress and the legislative branch have raised these issues \n     and have provided a forum in which to discuss how best to \n     address these unsuited areas of the regulations. The \n     suggestions made and comments received by stakeholders have \n     allowed the Board to engage in thoughtful deliberation and \n     careful consideration of the particular needs of the \n     legislative branch. Accordingly, the Board has crafted \n     proposed regulations that it believes will fit the practices \n     and procedures of the varying entities in the covered \n     community.\n       Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights Act\n       The Uniformed Services Employment and Re-employment Rights \n     Act (``USERRA'') was enacted in December 1994, and the \n     Department of Labor submitted regulations for the executive \n     branch in 2005. USERRA's provisions ensure that entry and re-\n     entry into the civilian workforce are not hindered by \n     participation in non-career military service. USERRA \n     accomplishes that purpose by providing rights in two kinds of \n     cases: discrimination based on military service, and denial \n     of an employment benefit as a result of military service.\n       Currently, the Board is engaged in drafting proposed \n     regulations for USERRA's application to the legislative \n     branch. During the 110th Congress, the Board will present its \n     proposed regulations to stakeholders and engage in similar \n     consultations as with the proposed VEOA draft regulations. \n     The Board anticipates that this interactive and collaborative \n     approach will allow the Board, as with the VEOA draft \n     regulations, to ascertain the concerns and particular demands \n     of the legislative branch with respect to application of \n     these regulations.\n       There is a need for both VEOA and USERRA regulations in the \n     legislative branch. Congress has seen fit to provide service \n     men and women certain protections in federal civilian \n     employment, and without adopted regulations, these \n     protections are without legal effect in the legislative \n     branch. The particular procedures and practices in the \n     legislative branch necessitate\n\n[[Page S349]]\n\n     regulations written especially for the legislative branch. \n     The Board encourages Congress to adopt these regulations, \n     once proposed, so that VEOA and USERRA protections can be \n     provided specifically to employees of the legislative branch \n     with regulations suitable to the needs of the covered \n     community.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       As the tenth anniversary of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act of 1995 has now passed, it is time for a \n     comprehensive analysis and update of the law to ensure that \n     it continues to reflect the commitment by the lawmakers of \n     this nation to democratic accountability.\n       With this 102b Report, the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance urges the leadership of both houses of Congress \n     to seriously consider the recommendations included in this \n     report. The Board encourages Congress to look at the recent \n     activities in the covered community to recognize the need for \n     the implementation of these recommendations. In particular, \n     the efforts made by the Office of the General Counsel of the \n     Office of Compliance and the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol to eliminate safety and health hazards that exist in \n     the covered community have been successful due to the \n     collaborative nature of the approach to the problem. However, \n     certain safety issues and certain hazards may only be \n     successfully addressed by the use of other mechanisms, such \n     as specific retaliation protections for whistle blowers, \n     preliminary injunctive relief, investigative subpoenas, and \n     the General Counsel's ability to investigate and prosecute \n     OSH claims of retaliation.\n       A fair workplace consists of fair treatment for its \n     applicants and employees who serve in the military. The \n     legislative branch attracts and employs many men and women \n     who have collateral military responsibility. Congress has \n     enacted laws which ensure that these individuals receive the \n     same treatment as their civilian counterparts. Those service \n     men and women who make application for federal employment in \n     the legislative branch and those individuals returning from \n     active duty must be assured, through appropriate regulation, \n     that their service in the military will not hinder them from \n     serving in their country's legislative branch of government.\n       The Board also encourages the leadership to increase \n     Congress's compliance with section 102(b)(3) of the CAA. \n     Section 102(b)(3) requires that every House and Senate \n     committee report accompanying a bill or joint resolution that \n     impacts terms and conditions of employment or access to \n     public services or accommodations must ``describe the manner \n     in which the provisions of the bill or joint resolution apply \n     to the legislative branch'' or ``in the case of a provision \n     not applicable to the legislative branch, include a statement \n     of the reasons the provision does not apply.'' Congress has \n     made efforts to include such language in proposed bills, and \n     the Board encourages its continued effort.\n       This Board, its executive appointees, and the staff of the \n     Office of Compliance are prepared to work with the \n     leadership, our oversight committees, other interested \n     Members, and instrumentalities in Congress and the \n     legislative branch to make these recommendations part of the \n     Congressional Accountability Act during the 110th Congress.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Susan S. Robfogel, Chair.\n     Barbara L. Camens.\n     Alan V. Friedman.\n     Roberta L. Holzwarth.\n     Barbara Childs Wallace.\n\n\n                               Appendix A\n\n     Employment and civil rights which still do not apply to \n         Congress or other legislative branch instrumentalities\n       The statutes below, with the exception of Section 508 of \n     the Rehabilitation Act, were all first identified by the \n     Board in 1996 as not included among the laws which were \n     applied to Congress through the Congressional Accountability \n     Act of 1995. The absence of section 508 of the Rehabilitation \n     Act was first identified in our 2001 Interim Report to \n     Congress. We here repeat the recommendations--made in our \n     Reports of 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004, as well as those \n     of the Interim 2001 Report--that these statutes should also \n     be applied to Congress and the legislative branch through the \n     Act.\n       The 1998 amendments to section 508 of the Rehabilitation \n           Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d)\n       In November 2001, the Board submitted an Interim Section \n     102(b) Report to Congress regarding the 1998 amendments to \n     the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 in which the Board urged \n     Congress to make those amendments applicable to itself and \n     the legislative branch. The purpose of the 1998 amendments is \n     to: ``require each Federal agency to procure, maintain, and \n     use electronic and information technology that allows \n     individuals with disabilities the same access to technology \n     as individuals without disabilities.'' [Senate Report on S. \n     1579, March 1998]\n       As of this time, some five years later, software and other \n     equipment which is ``508 compliant'' is readily available and \n     in use by some employing offices. The Board encourages \n     consistent use of these technologies so that individuals with \n     impairments may have the same opportunities to access \n     materials as others.\n       The Board reiterates its recommendation that Congress and \n     the legislative branch, including the General Accounting \n     Office, Government Printing Office, and Library of Congress, \n     be required to comply with the mandates of section 508.\n       Titles II and III of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 \n           U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2000a to 2000a-6, 2000b to 2000b-3)\n       These titles prohibit discrimination or segregation on the \n     basis of race, color, religion, or national origin regarding \n     the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and \n     accommodations of ``any place of public accommodation'' as \n     defined in the Act. Although the CAA incorporated the \n     protections of titles II and III of the ADA, which prohibit \n     discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to \n     access to public services and accommodations,\\16\\ it does not \n     extend protection against discrimination based upon race, \n     color, religion, or national origin with respect to access \n     to public services and accommodations. For the reasons set \n     forth in the 1996, 1998 and 2000 Section 102(b) Reports, \n     the Board has determined that the rights and protections \n     afforded by titles II and III of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964 against discrimination with respect to places of \n     public accommodation should be applied to employing \n     offices within the legislative branch.\n       Prohibition against discrimination on the basis of jury \n           duty (28 U.S.C. Sec. 1875)\n       Section 1875 provides that no employer shall discharge, \n     threaten to discharge, intimidate, or coerce any permanent \n     employee by reason of such employee's jury service, or the \n     attendance or scheduled attendance in connection with such \n     service, in any court of the United States. This section \n     currently does not cover legislative branch employment. For \n     the reasons set forth in the 1996, 1998 and 2000 Section \n     102(b) Reports, the Board has determined that the rights and \n     protections against discrimination on this basis should be \n     applied to employing offices within the legislative branch.\n       Prohibition against discrimination on the basis of \n           bankruptcy (11 U.S.C. Sec. 525)\n       Section 525(a) provides that ``a governmental unit'' may \n     not deny employment to, terminate the employment of, or \n     discriminate with respect to employment against, a person who \n     is or has been a debtor under the bankruptcy statutes. This \n     provision currently does not apply to the legislative branch. \n     For the reasons stated in the 1996, 1998 and 2000 Section \n     102(b) Reports, the Board recommends that the rights and \n     protections against discrimination on this basis should be \n     applied to employing offices within the legislative branch.\n       Prohibition against discharge from employment by reason of \n           garnishment (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1674(a))\n       Section 1674(a) prohibits discharge of any employee because \n     his or her earnings ``have been subject to garnishment for \n     any one indebtedness.'' This section is limited to private \n     employers, so it currently has no application to the \n     legislative branch. For the reasons set forth in the 1996, \n     1998 and 2000 Section 102(b) Reports, the Board has \n     determined that the rights and protections against \n     discrimination on this basis should be applied to employing \n     offices within the legislative branch.\n\n\n                               appendix b\n\n     Regulatory enforcement provisions for laws which are already \n         applicable to the legislative branch under the act\n       Record-keeping and notice-posting requirements of the \n           private sector CAA laws\n       As mentioned in its 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004 Reports, \n     experience in the administration of the Act leads the Board \n     to recommend that all currently inapplicable record-keeping \n     and notice-posting provisions be made applicable under the \n     CAA. For the reasons set forth in its prior reports of 1998, \n     2002, and 2004, the Board recommends that the Office be \n     granted the authority to require that records be kept and \n     notices posted in the same manner as required by the agencies \n     that enforce the provisions of law made applicable by the CAA \n     in the private sector.\n       Other enforcement authorities exercised by the agencies \n           that implement the CAA laws for the private sector\n       To further the goal of parity, the Board also recommends \n     that Congress grant the Office the remaining enforcement \n     authorities that executive branch agencies utilize to \n     administer and enforce the provisions of law made applicable \n     by the CAA in the private sector. Implementing agencies in \n     the executive branch have investigatory and prosecutorial \n     authorities with respect to all of the private sector CAA \n     laws, except the WARN Act. Based on the experience and \n     expertise of the Office, granting these same enforcement \n     authorities would make the CAA more comprehensive and \n     effective. By taking these steps to live under full agency \n     enforcement authority, the Congress will strengthen the bond \n     that the CAA created between the legislator and the \n     legislated.\n\n\n                               appendix c\n\n     Employee protection provisions of environmental statutes\n       Since its 1996 Report, the Board has addressed the \n     inclusion of employee protection provisions of a number of \n     statutory schemes: the Toxic Substances Control Act, Clean \n     Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Energy Reorganization \n     Act, Solid Waste Disposal Act/Resources Conservation Recovery \n     Act, Clean Air Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n     Compensation and Liability Act. In its 1996 Section 102(b) \n     Report, the\n\n[[Page S350]]\n\n     Board stated: ``It is unclear to what extent, if any, these \n     provisions apply to entities in the Legislative Branch. \n     Furthermore, even if applicable or partly applicable, it is \n     unclear whether and to what extent the Legislative Branch has \n     the type of employees and employing offices that would be \n     subject to these provisions. Consequently, the Board reserves \n     judgment on whether or not these provisions should be made \n     applicable to the Legislative Branch at this time.''\n       Further, in the 1998 Report the Board concluded that, while \n     it remained unclear whether some or all of the environmental \n     statutes apply to the legislative branch, ``[t]he Board \n     recommends that Congress should adopt legislation clarifying \n     that the employee protection provisions in the environmental \n     protection statutes apply to all entities within the \n     Legislative Branch.''\n       In the 2002 and 2004 Reports, the Board explicitly analyzed \n     these protections and recommended that the employee \n     protection provisions of these acts be placed within the CAA \n     and applied to all covered employees, including employees of \n     the Government Accountability Office, Government Printing \n     Office, and Library of Congress. The Board reiterates those \n     recommendations herein, including its recommendation to \n     eliminate the separation of powers conflict inherent in \n     enforcing these statutes, and urges Congress to include such \n     amendments to the Act.\n\n\n                          Contact Information\n\n       Office of Compliance, Room LA 200, John Adams Building, 110 \n     Second Street, SE, Washington, DC 20540-1999, t/ 202-724-9250 \n     tdd/ 202-426-1912 f/ 202-426-1913.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness but great honor \nthat I rise to commemorate the life and actions of Gerald R. Ford, the \n38 President of the United States. President Ford led our country \nthrough turbulent and uncertain times and did so with a kind of strong \nmodesty that he was known for his entire life. From his days as a star \nof the University of Michigan football team to serving as minority \nleader in the U.S. House of Representatives, Gerald Ford's ability to \nlead was apparent to all. Aside from his leadership qualities, \nPresident Ford was a man beyond reproach and respected by all. These \nqualities made him Richard Nixon's choice to replace his first Vice \nPresident, Spiro Agnew. Following President Nixon's resignation, Gerald \nFord returned honor to the office of the President and restored the \ncountry's confidence in our leaders. Gerald Ford exemplified the best \nof America and served the country in every way. From his heroism in \nWorld War II to his Presidency and graceful retirement, he harkens back \nto a day when love of country and bipartisanship were paramount.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I join with \nall North Carolinians and all Americans in mourning the passing of \nPresident Gerald Ford. I was privileged to call President Ford a dear \nfriend for more than 30 years, and my husband Bob and I continue to \nkeep Betty and the entire Ford family in our thoughts and prayers.\n  President Ford presided over America during some of her most \ndifficult and challenging times. Immediately upon entering the Oval \nOffice, President Ford was confronted with a myriad of problems--a \nfaltering economy, energy shortages, international disputes, and a \nnation disheartened and disillusioned by scandal. He confronted these \nchallenges head-on, and he did so with honesty, integrity, common \nsense, and decency. He was a true American patriot who never failed to \nput the interests of his country above his own political interests. \nAnd, to me, that is the embodiment of a true leader.\n  Long before entering the White House, President Ford had a \ndistinguished and successful career. He diligently represented the \npeople of Michigan in the U.S. House of Representatives for 25 years, \nincluding 8 years serving as House minority leader. Throughout each \nchapter of his career, President Ford displayed extraordinary care and \nthoughtfulness as he worked tirelessly to bring together his \ncolleagues--from both sides of the ideological spectrum--for the \nbetterment of our Nation. And in turn, his colleagues respected him, \nrelied on his wise judgment, and valued his leadership.\n  As my husband Bob says, President Ford was the type of person you \nwould want as your next-door neighbor. He was humble, down-to-earth, \nand accessible. What you saw with President Ford was what you got.\n  In addition to having the honor of serving in President Ford's \nadministration as a Federal Trade Commissioner, I had the privilege of \nspending a good bit of time with President Ford and his dear wife Betty \nwhen my husband campaigned as his running mate in 1976. During this \ntime, I saw a side of the President that I wish every American could \nhave seen.\n  I will never forget the day when President Ford announced that Bob \nwould be his running mate. We were in Bob's hometown of Russell, KS, \nand my mother-in-law wanted very much to serve a home-cooked fried \nchicken dinner to the President. But when President Ford and Bob \narrived at her home, they discovered that Mrs. Dole had accidentally \nlocked herself out of the house. So there was the President of the \nUnited States standing on the front stoop patiently waiting for Mrs. \nDole to find the spare key. She was a nervous wreck, but the President \ndidn't mind one bit--instead, he kindly offered to help her find the \nkey, so together they searched until they found it behind a drainpipe. \nI have always thought this story about a small kindness truly speaks \nvolumes about the sterling character of a man I have long respected and \nadmired. Even as President Ford had the weight of the world on his \nshoulders, he always treated his fellow man with kindness, respect, and \npersonal modesty.\n  President Ford served the United States with courage and distinction, \nand he provided a shining example for all public servants to follow. I \nam so proud to have known this man of character, strength, and \nintellect. I will miss my friend, and I wish the best to Betty, his \nchildren, Michael, John, Steven, and Susan, and the entire Ford family.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to state how proud I was to \nsupport Senate Resolution 19, celebrating the life of the late \nPresident Gerald R. Ford.\n  It was an honor to commemorate the extraordinary legacy of the 38th \nPresident of the United States, Gerald Rudolph Ford, as we have mourned \nthe loss of a treasured national leader and exceptional public servant.\n  President Ford will forever be remembered for his unassailable \nintegrity and decency, at a most difficult and challenging time. He was \ntruly a great American who devoted his life not only to the Nation he \nloved but also to the finest and most ennobling ideals of public \nservice. Throughout the years, President Ford represented a voice of \ncivility and problem-solving--of consensus-building--and healing. \nHistory will record that his contribution to America's story was both \nindispensable and irrefutable.\n  When our Nation looked to him for assurance, his stalwart character, \ndisposition, and judgment instilled a quiet and renewed confidence in \nour country. He restored the public trust in the Presidency and in our \nGovernment, reminded us of the strength and durability of our \nConstitution, and engendered a hope that tempered our anxieties and \nturned our attention once again to the future.\n  During his distinguished 25 years as both a Member and later minority\n\n[[Page S351]]\n\nleader of the U.S. House of Representatives, then-Congressman Gerald \nFord never sought the office of Vice President or President, but when \nin 1974 he faced the daunting task of assuming the highest office in \nthe land, his steadfast dedication to the bedrock principles of \nhardwork, common sense, and duty--so emblematic of his upbringing and \nhis remarkable career in Congress--prepared him to occupy the White \nHouse and served him well over the course of his brief but historic \ntenure.\n  With an unwavering moral compass, a certain grasp of purpose, and an \nalways-steady resolve, President Ford guided us out of conflict abroad \nand quelled our concerns here at home and in doing so brought honor to \nthe Oval Office and reassurance to Americans. It is fitting that in \nfootball as well as in his public life, Gerald Ford was ever the \nkeystone, the center that held those around him together, who \nexemplified the essential underpinning that made progress possible.\n  On a personal note, last summer I had the esteemed privilege of \ncosponsoring--along with Senators Warner, Stevens, and Levin--an \namendment offered by Senator John Warner to the 2007 Defense \nauthorization bill that would name our Nation's newest carrier the \n``USS Gerald R. Ford.'' In fact, the Navy's entire class of future \ncarriers would be known as the Ford class--in honor of the President we \npraise.\n  Later this month, that accolade--which the Senate passed \nunanimously--is expected to come to fruition. Such a bestowal by Navy \nSecretary Winter would be an appropriate tribute to then-Lieutenant \nFord, who, as a sailor in December 1944, encountered a typhoon while \naboard the carrier USS Monterey and demonstrated the virtues that would \nemerge as the hallmark of his unflagging service and sacrifice to our \nNation, such as calm and courage amid turmoil, presence of mind to act \ndecisively despite confusion and chaos, and an unflinching will of \nspirit to help others, even at great personal peril.\n  It has been recounted in the Bob Drury and Tom Clavin book ``Halsey's \nTyphoon: The True Story of A Fighting Admiral, an Epic Storm, and an \nUntold Rescue'' that Lieutenant Ford rescued wounded comrades, beat \nback raging fires, and helped salvage a ship that was ordered to be \nabandoned. Gerald Ford was integral to the effort driven by the simple \nbelief of the skipper, Captain Ingersoll, that ``we can fix this.'' As \npart of Admiral Halsey's Third Fleet, they did not give up the USS \nMonterey in what reportedly was ``one of the worst natural disasters in \nU.S. military history,'' a disaster where much of the fleet was \ndecimated and more men were purportedly killed than in the Battle of \nMidway.\n  Mr. President, this story in many ways embodies the essence of this \ngreat son of Michigan. The story of the USS Monterey is telling in \nthat--like President Ford--it has for years taken a humble and \nunassuming place in the American narrative--and yet over time has \nrightfully grown in stature and acclaim. We also see a disposition and \nvalor in a young sailor that would be brought to bear later in life as \na statesman. Lieutenant Ford's reaction to conflagration and crisis was \nto take action and help tamp it down. Gerald Ford helped bring under \ncontrol the flames that imperiled the USS Monterey. He would do \nsimilarly as President when charged to guide the ship of state--which \nhe did with a fearless, unflappable demeanor. And which he did, to \nparaphrase President Lincoln, ``with firmness in the right as God [gave \nhim] to see the right.'' And through his eloquence of action, Gerald \nFord moved us all to ``strive on to finish the work we [were] in'' . . \n. and helped ``to bind up the nation's wounds.'' And for that we are \neternally grateful.\n  Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with First Lady Betty Ford, \ntheir children, and the entire Ford family. May God bless and keep \nPresident Gerald R. Ford and may God bless the United States of America \nhe so ably led.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S351-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING HOLIDAY WREATHS AT ARLINGTON CEMETERY\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the \npatriotic and exemplary contribution of Morrill Worcester, owner of \nWorcester Wreath Company in Harrington, ME, who for the past 15 years \nhas undertaken what has become an extraordinary tradition--to donate, \ntransport, and oversee the placement of Maine balsam fir holiday \nwreaths on the graves of the exceptional service men and women buried \nand forever extolled at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  It is truly inspiring to see how the actions of one man can transform \ninto such an honorable and moving tribute to America's fallen heroes. \nUnquestionably, I am immensely grateful to have been part of Morrill \nWorcester's dream, which began in December of 1992 when he called my \noffice to ask if he could place his excess wreaths on the graves of \nsoldiers at Arlington National Cemetery. I never could have imagined \nthat what occurred on that day would evolve remarkably into a \nnationwide gesture of unfailing gratitude for our troops.\n  During the season of thankfulness and giving, Morrill Worcester's \ntremendous generosity exemplifies not only the very best of the holiday \nspirit but also the inherent good will and can-do belief which is the \nabiding hallmark of Mainers. And what better way to celebrate the joy \nengendered by that time of year than to pay rightful homage to the \ncountless courageous veterans who made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure \nand protect the many freedoms we cherish everyday. It is on occasions \nsuch as this that I could not be more proud to be both a Mainer and an \nAmerican.\n  This past December Mr. Worcester was joined by 800 volunteers, \nincluding Maine Civil Air Patrol Units, local VFW and American Legion \nPosts, military units, congressional staffers, schoolchildren, Scout \ntroops, and an array of American veterans for the trek down U.S. Route \n1 from Harrington to Washington, DC, with 5,000 Maine balsam fir \nholiday wreaths.\n  In fact, it was on Thursday, December 14, 2006 when the tractor-\ntrailer with the logo ``Wreaths across America'' was parked at the top \nof the 11th section of the cemetery, with more than 500 volunteers \ngathered and ready to grace those monuments to heroism with red \nribbons, making an already beautiful testament to bravery and valor \neven more stunning and glorious.

Mr. President, on April 20, 1999, two students walked into \nColumbine High School and carried out a shooting rampage, killing 12 \nfellow students and a teacher, as well as wounding 24 others, before \ncommitting suicide. A week later, we paused in the Senate to observe a \nmoment of silence in tribute to those who died and to express our \nsympathy for their loved ones. Since this tragic event, many of us, on \nmany occasions, have urged our colleagues to debate and pass sensible \ngun legislation.\n  Between 1999 and 2004, over 117,000 people have been killed by guns, \ncriminals continue to gain easy access to guns and law enforcement \nofficers do not have the tools they need to investigate gun-related \ncrimes. The 109th Congress nonetheless has failed to act and has missed \nnumerous opportunities to enhance the safety of our communities across \nthe Nation. Congress has not reauthorized the 1994 assault weapons ban. \nCongress has not closed the\n\n[[Page S352]]\n\ngun show loophole. Congress has failed to make the necessary \nimprovements to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System \nthat could significantly decrease the likelihood of convicted criminals \ngaining access to guns. And, the President has failed to provide the \nnecessary leadership. Instead we have seen a continual rise in the \nlevels of gun related crime. This increase in crime levels has not been \nrestricted to America's largest cities, but has also permeated \nAmerica's small and mid-sized cities. As Paul Helmke, president of the \nBrady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and former mayor of Fort Wayne, \nIN, describes it:\n\n       For almost six years, many have systematically made it \n     easier for criminals to have access to firearms by weakening \n     enforcement of laws that cut illegal gun trafficking, \n     supporting policies that encourage more firearms on the \n     streets of American cities, putting AK-47s and other \n     military-style semiautomatic weapons back onto our streets \n     and even placing huge restraints on the ability of \n     governments and individuals to hold the gun pushers \n     accountable through the civil court system.\n\n  The 110th Congress has a fresh opportunity to act on a bipartisan \nbasis to pass legislation that will make our streets safer for all \nAmericans. I urge my colleagues to work to enact sensible gun safety \nlegislation for the benefit of our families, communities and police \nofficers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S352-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S352-S354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CREATION OF A U.S. AFRICA COMMAND\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as the Defense Department continues its \nplanning for the creation of an Africa Command, it is important to \nrealize that the creation of a new regional combatant command focused \nexclusively on Africa will have a profound impact on our country's \npresence, policies, and engagement in what is becoming one of the most \ncritical regions of the world. New bases, new personnel, new missions, \nnew efforts, and new relationships will be created, and our potential \nto have a positive impact throughout the continent will be enhanced \ngreatly.\n  We have to be strategic and forward-thinking as we create this new \norganization, though. Because we are making such a profound change to \nour posture on the continent, we need to ensure that the new \norganization will contribute to, not define, the U.S. Government's \noverall strategy and objectives for the continent. We also need to make \nsure that the U.S. military's activities and involvement on the \ncontinent do not overshadow, skew, or otherwise hinder our Government's \nother key objectives.\n  It is clear that challenges in Africa are diverse and complex. We \nhave a number of security-related concerns there, ranging from \nterrorist organizations and safe havens to large-scale corruption, \nregional conflicts, and the disruption of global energy markets. \nContinuing to establishing firm and productive military-to-military \nrelations with a number of African nations is also critical.\n  But we have learned that the way to address the underlying causes of \nthe security challenges throughout the continent is not generally \nthrough military power. In fact, the best way to address the full range \nof security-related concerns in Africa is to focus on the underlying \nconditions that plague governments and societies throughout the \ncontinent. Security threats and instability stem from corruption, \nabsence of human rights, poverty, disease, lagging economies, and \njoblessness. Weak governments are incapable of addressing the dynamics \nthat often contribute to lawlessness or violence, and are often left \nwithout any capacity to help defeat trans-national threats.\n  Our focus as a government, therefore, must be on strengthening \nAfrican governance capacities and legitimacy, as well as the commitment \nto the rule of law, sound democratic mechanisms, and human rights. We \nmust continue to help alleviate the humanitarian suffering that exists \nthroughout the continent, and we must work hard to assist African \ncountries develop sound democratic institutions that are credible and \ncapable, and that have the technical capacity to provide for their \npeople and to govern fairly. Only then will we start to see real \nreturns--real, long-term returns--for our national security.\n  This isn't to suggest that continued military involvement throughout \nthe continent isn't essential. It is. But only if it is a component of \na broader strategy to address these underlying causes of instability. \nU.S. military activities throughout Africa must help support a larger \nframework that seeks to strengthen African governments and balance the \nneed for good governance and security capacity. Our security assistance \nto African nations, and more broadly, the work of the U.S. military \nthroughout Africa, must not interfere with, create an imbalance in, or \nskew the necessary political, economic, and social work that must be \ndone if we are going to see any long-term improvement in areas of \ncritical concern.\n  Accordingly, establishing a new combatant command for Africa presents \nan opportunity to strengthen our national security focus in Africa, but \nit also presents an opportunity to create a military command with the \nprimary mission of supporting diplomatic, development, humanitarian \nassistance, and regional initiatives led by the Department of State, \nUSAID, and other agencies. This command, if designed right, will be \nable to serve as a contributor to broader U.S. Government efforts \nthroughout the continent, and will help provide an additional platform \nfor regional thinking, strategizing, and activity that will advance the \nstrategic interests of our country throughout Africa.\n  To be effective, of course, this command will take careful planning. \nIt will also take a considerable amount of planning on the part of the \nDepartment of State, USAID, and other departments and agencies that \nwill have to adjust to this new organization. It will take intensive \ncoordination and adjustments throughout the civilian interagency and it \nwill be crucial that State, USAID, and other departments and agencies \nare playing a full role in the creation of this command.\n  The mission of this command will need to be relatively broad. Africa \nCommand should establish strong security-oriented relationships with \nour partner nations throughout Africa. These relationships should be \ncoordinated with our embassies and with Washington, but should only be \npart of our broader efforts with any given country. The command's \nefforts should be balanced and should take into consideration the scale \nand scope of diplomatic, development, humanitarian, and human rights \nefforts in each country.\n  The command should also prepare to deal with international \norganizations--particularly the African Union and subregional \norganizations that often play leading roles in regional and continental \npeacekeeping efforts, conflict mitigation activities, and humanitarian \nresponse. Establishing a strong relationship with the AU and other \norganizations will be essential to unlocking the potential for Africans \nto address security challenges throughout their continent.\n\n  The command should also prepare to conduct missions that have often \ntaken a backseat to higher profile or less military-focused efforts. \nHumanitarian assistance--often one of the best ways to win hearts and \nminds in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster or conflict--\nwill need to be at the top of the command's list of priorities. So too \nshould efforts to help rebuild societies after conflict. This might \ntake the form of logistical assistance for humanitarian or development \npersonnel, or potentially a direct role for U.S. military personnel, \nwhen appropriate. Other critical components of the new command's \nmission should include anticorruption efforts, leadership training, \nstrengthening civilian oversight of national militaries, preventing the \nspread of HIV/AIDS, demobilizing or reintegrating ex-combatants, and \nbeing on standby for rapid response to new conflicts or challenges.\n  The Department of Defense does a lot of this already. Many of these \nmissions have been carried out by dedicated men and women in uniform \nwho are stationed in places like Nigeria, Uganda, or at the Combined \nJoint Task Force--Horn of Africa. The challenge, though, is to \nestablish a command that places these initiatives on its priority list, \nand to ensure that these efforts are resourced appropriately, are \ncoordinated with the appropriate departments and agencies, and that \nthey do not distort or disrupt other key initiatives throughout the \ncontinent.\n  With this new mission and these challenges in mind, I would like to\n\n[[Page S353]]\n\nraise a series of issues that I believe to be important as our \ngovernment begins developing this new command.\n  First, as the Department of Defense plans for the creation of an \nAfrica Command, it is essential that it think outside of the \ntraditional model of the regional combatant command. While this new \ncommand will help us defeat terrorist networks that operate, recruit, \nstage, or otherwise seek haven throughout the continent of Africa, this \nnew command should not have combat as its primary mission. It should \nhave as its core mission the task of supporting bilateral, regional, \nand continental diplomatic and development efforts. It also should be \nfocused on bolstering State, USAID, and other government activities--\nproviding resources, information, and logistical support for programs \nthat have often been slowed or stopped because of the very absence of \nthese things.\n  Second, the creation of an Africa Command and the design of its \nmission, objectives, and capacity, must be done in concert with the \nDepartment of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and \nother departments and agencies that are active in Africa. This new \norganization--the first regional command to be focused exclusively on \nAfrica--will obviously be military in nature, but it must cast a new \nmold for regional combatant commands that incorporates interagency \ninterests and responsibilities from the outset, as well as personnel \nfrom throughout the government that can help advance the mission of the \nU.S. Government in Africa. The Department of State and USAID personnel \nshould be embedded deeply into the command and should play important \nleadership roles in the various components of this command. Formal \ncoordination mechanisms, too, must be established between the new \ncommand, our embassies, Washington, and other pertinent regional and \nfunctional commands around the world.\n  Given its potential impact throughout the continent, we should make \nevery effort to ensure that the command represents a unified U.S. \nGovernment effort, and that in the early planning phases of this \ncommand that civilian interagency requirements are absorbed and \nincorporated into the final organization.\n  Third, and more specifically, the planning process for the creation \nof an Africa Command must be met with parallel--and equally \naggressive--discussions within the Department of State. The Department \nof State must realize that an Africa Command will have a significant \nimpact on how it does its business and how it coordinates and \ncollaborates with the Defense Department. It should begin planning for \ninternal bureaucratic changes, as well as posture changes throughout \nthe continent, to account for the fact that the Defense Department's \npresence and focus will be regional, while the Department of State's \nefforts will remain largely bilateral.\n  Africa Command will help alleviate many coordinate challenges between \ndepartments that have existed to date. But it won't change the fact \nthat the State Department still focuses on bilateral relationships and \noften has trouble organizing, coordinating, or planning for regional \ninitiatives or programs. Closer State-DOD relations will come about as \na result of the creation of Africa Command if and when the State \nDepartment begins addressing how it can better organize itself to \naddress regional conflicts, transnational counterterrorism efforts, \nhumanitarian emergencies that spill over borders, and ungoverned \nspaces.\n  We must also recognize the resource disparity between the Defense \nDepartment and the Department of State. This will most likely be an \nimportant issue as this new command is created. But short of \ndramatically increasing the State Department's budget in the next few \nyears to account for an additional and needed focus on Africa, it will \nbe essential that the State Department maintain a leadership role \nthroughout this entire process, and that it adjusts itself to better \nmanage and coordinate all U.S. government efforts throughout the \ncontinent. The State Department should apply its best Africa and \npolitical-military minds to DOD's efforts to create this new command, \nand it should view its role as both client and patron, knowing well \nthat the creation of this new command will require new leadership \nefforts within the State Department.\n\n  Fourth, it is crucial that the Defense Department and the State \nDepartment move faster to establish joint planning mechanisms--both \nstrategic and financial. It has become widely known that Defense and \nState planning mechanisms are not in sync, and that both organizations \nplan, or don't plan, for events, missions, and strategic objectives \ndifferently. This needs to be addressed immediately. The creation of \nAfrica Command will give both departments an opportunity to begin \nsyncing planning capabilities, and may open the window to truly \ninteragency budgeting and strategic planning processes that will align \nall U.S. Government resources to address challenges in places like \nAfrica.\n  This may sound bureaucratic, but it has real implications on how we \nposition our government to address the wide-ranging challenges \nthroughout Africa, and indeed throughout the rest of the world. The \nState Department develops bilateral strategic plans and generates \nresource requirements largely based on bilateral, and sometimes \nmultilateral efforts. The Defense Department views things more \nregionally, establishing regional commands and task forces that can \nevaluate, strategize, and implement programs based on the needs or \nchallenges unique to a given region--challenges that often transcend \nnational borders or programming allocations. Neither department's \nstrategic planning process is perfect, but I would urge both \nDepartments--in addition to USAID, the Department of Treasury, Justice, \nAgriculture, as well as others--to begin evaluating how the strategic \nplanning process can incorporate departmental or agency-specific \nactivities and efforts into comprehensive U.S. Government strategies \nfor the continent, subregions, and partner nations. Creating combined \nplanning processes would also benefit lawmakers that are constantly \nseeking better coordination and a higher return on taxpayer \ninvestments.\n  Fifth, and in a related vein, the President should make absolutely \nclear that ambassadors--chiefs of mission in any given country--are his \nrepresentatives and must be accountable and responsible for all actions \ntaken on behalf of the U.S. Government in any given country. It is \nessential that ambassadors have the ultimate say of what happens in \ncountry, and that he or she has the ability to ``turn off'' any \nprograms, initiatives, or efforts that may adversely affect our \ngovernment's broader goals in or relationship with a given country. \nThat said, the Department of State may want to consider creating a new \nposition for Africa that can help liaise--at a sufficiently senior \nlevel--with the senior Africa Command commander on daily issues. This \nposition would be more than a political advisor. This person would \nideally have the ability to make decisions at the traditional three- or \nfour-star level, and provide a substantive and management-oriented \nperspective on State and DOD efforts throughout the continent. This \nperson would ideally not be based in Washington, and might benefit from \nserving side-by-side with the new combatant commander.\n  The Department of State--both in Washington and at our embassies--\nmust step up and play a stronger leadership role. I would imagine that \nDOD would welcome this. In many countries in Africa the Defense \nDepartment represents the bulk of U.S. efforts or presence. Our \nsecurity assistance programs are wide-ranging and often overshadow \ndevelopment, economic, or political assistance to fragile and poor \ncountries. This is not to suggest that the creation of a new command \nfor Africa is bad. It is not. I authored a successful piece of \nlegislation last year that required the Defense Department to do a \ncomplete feasibility study on this very issue. I believe that it will \nenhance our ability to do important work throughout Africa, and that it \nwill have a positive impact on our national security. But it is \nessential that as we increase our efforts to strengthen the security \ncapabilities of our partners in Africa, we do not undermine critical \nhuman rights and that we work to strengthen democratic institutions. \nThe State Department must prepare to exert its authority and influence \non the new command's activities and ensure that future U.S. Government \nefforts in Africa are balanced and take into consideration the larger \nstrategic efforts in any\n\n[[Page S354]]\n\ngiven country, region, and throughout the continent.\n  Finally, the Congress needs to be prepared to support this new \neffort. It will be essential that Congress take into account the needs \nof the Defense Department and the individual uniformed services as this \nnew command is created. But it is equally essential that Congress take \ninto account the needs of the State Department, USAID, and other \nagencies that are trying to ramp up their efforts throughout the \ncontinent. If anything, the creation of a new combatant command for \nAfrica should signal the dramatically increasing importance of Africa \nto our national security, and that to truly address the range of \nchallenges present there we need to look at an equally aggressive plan \nto strengthen our diplomatic, development, humanitarian, and human \nrights work throughout the continent. This may include addressing how \nthe Congress allocates funds--both to this new command and to the other \ndepartments and agencies that will make the spirit and intent of this \ncommand work.\n  In closing, we must focus greater resources on Africa but we should \nensure that our efforts in Africa do not become primarily military in \nnature, and that the State Department continues to play the primary \nleadership role with respect to our efforts on the continent. Those \nwithin the Defense Department, the State Department, at USAID and other \nkey departments and agencies will need to use this as an opportunity to \nevaluate and enhance the way they do business. The success of this \ngovernmental effort requires it, and our national security depends on \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S354-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COAL TO LIQUIDS FUEL PRODUCTION ACT\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague, the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, in introducing this \nimportant legislation.\n  The geologic deposit known as Illinois Basin Coal--which lies beneath \nIllinois, Indiana and Kentucky--has more untapped energy potential than \nthe combined oil reserves of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. This coal deposit \nunderlies more than 65 percent of the surface of the State of Illinois, \nwith recoverable reserves estimated to be in excess of 38 billion tons \nfrom my State alone. Moreover, with just a glance at a map of Illinois, \none can see that my State is dotted with towns that reflect our 200-\nyear coal mining history--towns with names like Carbondale, Energy, \nCarbon Hill, Coal City, and Zeigler.\n  In some parts of Illinois, however, these names are just shadows of \nthe past. More than 15 years ago, upon the enactment of the Clean Air \nAct Amendments of 1990, coal mining in Illinois was drastically \ntransformed. Given the high sulfur content of Illinois coal, many users \nswitched from Illinois coal to other, lower sulfur coals mined out \nWest. As a result, thousands of Illinois jobs vanished, and with it, \nthe life force of many of these towns. Air quality throughout the \nNation improved drastically, but vast energy resources were rendered \nidle, awaiting new future technologies.\n  Today, we are exploring those new technologies, which promise a \nrenaissance for coal communities. Two east central Illinois towns, for \nexample, are under consideration for the billion-dollar FutureGen \nproject, which many of my colleagues know will be the first near zero-\nemissions coal-fired powerplant in the world.\n  But coal from the Illinois Basin, with its high energy content, is a \nsuperb feedstock not just for power generation, as promised by \nFutureGen, but also for the manufacture of Fischer-Tropsch--FT--fuel. \nCreated in the 1920s by German scientists and used during World War II, \nthe FT process is the major fuel source for vehicles in South Africa. \nIn both nations, the production of diesels from coal was developed as a \nresponse to petroleum embargoes against those nations at various points \nin their history.\n  Meanwhile, in the United States, more than 55 percent of our fuel \nconsumption continues to come from foreign oil, and that number is \ngrowing. Our economy is exposed to potential jeopardy from oil supply \ndisruptions and price shocks. We must diversify our fuel supply, and \nthat means all domestic options should be on the table for \nconsideration.\n  Fischer-Tropsch fuel is interchangeable with standard diesel, \nfunctioning in existing engines with little or no modification. FT \nfuels can be transported in our existing fuel distribution \ninfrastructure. Moreover, FT fuels have far lower emissions than \nstandard diesel. The Department of Defense, the largest consumer of \npetroleum in the United States, has great interest in acquiring this \nfuel. But Fischer-Tropsch is not manufactured in the U.S., and no \nfocused federal initiatives exist to encourage the development of a \nFischer-Tropsch manufacturing base.\n  The bill introduced by Senator Bunning and myself will provide that \nFederal focus. This bill will help to create a new market for abandoned \nand abundant Illinois Basin coal, revitalizing economic development and \njobs in the coal communities of our States. It will help develop the \ncapital infrastructure for producing FT fuels at the levels necessary \nfor preliminary testing by the Department of Defense and for the \nprivate sector. It will explore carbon sequestration for this \ntechnology before we can pursue construction. And it will play a key \nrole in reducing our Nation's dependence on foreign oil.\n  I know that there are no perfect answers in the pursuit of energy \nindependence. There is no single fuel or feedstock that offers \naffordability, reliability, transportability, and sensitivity to the \nenvironment in equal ways. But, as we pursue the best course of action \nfor our energy independence, we cannot delay action until we reach the \nperfect solution. Maintaining our dependency on unstable regions of the \nworld for the fuel that we cannot live without is far too great a risk. \nActions taken today must be accompanied by rigorous concurrent debate \nin preparation for the second and third generation choices of our \nalternative fuel infrastructure.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S354-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S354-S355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          60TH BIRTHDAY OF THE NORTH DAKOTA AIR NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, January 16, 2007, is a special day \nfor North Dakota.\n  It is the 60th birthday of the North Dakota Air National Guard. It \nwill also mark a major milestone in the history of the North Dakota Air \nNational Guard. On that day the 119th Fighter Wing will conduct a \nceremony honoring the final flight of their F-16s, closing out an \nillustrious history of flying fighter aircraft in defense of our \ncountry.\n  On that day, the 119th Fighter Wing will also introduce the public to \nits two new missions, operating Predator unmanned aerial systems and \nflying light transport aircraft.\n  The North Dakota Air National Guard began on January 16, 1947. The \nfirst Air Guard squadron organized in North Dakota was the 178th \nFighter Squadron in Fargo. The first meetings were held in the Army \nNational Guard Armory in downtown Fargo but the squadron moved to \nHector Airport by the end of the year.\n  Duane Larson was the squadron commander during the 1950s. He was \nnicknamed ``Pappy'' because he was the senior fighter pilot. The \nsquadron started calling themselves Pappy Larson and his Happy \nHooligans after an old comic strip. The squadron has been called the \nHappy Hooligans ever since.\n  The Happy Hooligans began operations with the P-51D Mustang. They \nflew the Mustang until 1954. After that they flew F-94s, F-89s, F-102s, \nF-101B Voodoos and F-4D Phantoms. Since 1990, they have flown F-16s.\n  On April 1, 1951, the Hooligans were mobilized for Federal service \nand ordered to active duty during the Korean conflict. When they were \ndemobilized in 1954, they were put on alert to defend against an attack \nby the Soviet Union. At first, the alert consisted of aircraft on the \nmain ramp of Hector Field with aircrew sleeping in a nearby building on \nbase.\n  The alert mission was supposed to be a temporary mission for the \nHappy Hooligans. It was only supposed to last\n\n[[Page S355]]\n\n6 months to a year. It turned into a 52 year stint. From 1954 to 2006, \nthe North Dakota Air National Guard flew alert in more than a dozen \nstates and nearly a dozen nations.\n  In 1998 the Happy Hooligans established a permanent alert detachment \nof F-16s, pilots and ground crews at Langley Air Force Base in \nVirginia. Their mission was to provide air defense for Washington, DC, \nand other locations along the eastern seaboard. That mission came to an \nend on October 12, 2006.\n  I cannot talk about the Happy Hooligans alert mission without \nmentioning the events of 9/11.\n  The attack on the World Trade Center in New York precipitated an \norder for the fighters of 119th Fighter Wing's alert detachment to \nscramble from Langley. Three North Dakota Air National Guard F-16s took \nto the air, but regrettably they were not yet over Washington's \nairspace when American Airlines flight 77 hit the Pentagon. They were \nstill some minutes away. But they then flew, as I understand it, 7 or 8 \nhours that day performing combat air patrol over the skies of \nWashington, DC.\n  In the shock of that morning, I have to tell you that I will never \nforget what it meant to look up to the bright blue September morning \nsky and see F-16 fighter planes flying air cover over the Nation's \nCapitol. We found out later those were the Happy Hooligans from Fargo, \nND.\n  The Happy Hooligans are folks who farm; run drug stores; teach \nschool. They do a lot of things in their community. But they also are \nmembers of an Air National Guard unit that maintains and flies \naircraft. And they do that better than anybody.\n  For almost 60 years the Happy Hooligans have ranked with the best \nfighter pilots in the world. They have flown in contests against the \nworld's top combat pilots, and they have brought the trophies home to \nFargo, ND, as proof that they are the best fighter pilots in the world.\n  Several years ago, USA Today wrote about the Happy Hooligans. It \ncalled them the ``Godfathers of air superiority.'' It said, ``When you \nstrap one of these senior fliers into the cockpit of an F-16 Fighting \nFalcon, the younger boys get out of the way because these are the best \nair-to-air combat fighters in the world.''\n  That article was about one of the three times that the 119th Fighter \nWing won the Air Force's William Tell competition.\n  William Tell is the U.S. Air Force's foremost air-to-air competition. \nIt is the Super Bowl of air superiority. F-16 units are not supposed to \nwin it. Reserve component units are not supposed to win it. F-15 teams \nfrom active Air Force wings are supposed to win it. But someone must \nhave forgotten to tell this to the Happy Hooligans.\n  So this National Guard unit from Fargo, ND, has taken its airplanes \nto the William Tell contest, and they have flown against the world's \ntop combat pilots, and they have brought the William Tell Award home to \nFargo, ND, three times, as proof that they are the best fighter pilots \nin the world.\n  The Happy Hooligans have also won the Hughes Trophy twice. That award \nrecognizes the outstanding air-to-air unit in the country. It too has \nbeen dominated by F-15s. The 119th is the only F-16 unit that has ever \nwon it.\n  Alongside their flying record, the Happy Hooligans also have an \nunmatched safety record.\n  Since 1973, they have flown more than 150,000 hours in F-101s, F-4s \nand F-16s without a single major accident. That amount of flight time \ntranslates to about 17 accident-free years in the air.\n  That is the longest continuous period of safe fighter aircraft \noperations for any Air National Guard fighter unit and one of best \nsafety records in U.S. Air Force history. In March 2006, the 119th \nFighter Wing was recognized for flying its F-16s for a total of 70,000 \nhours in 3,920 individual sorties without mishap. That is also a \nrecord.\n  All those trophies and records are a testament to the thousands of \nmen and women who have served in the North Dakota Air National Guard \nsince 1947. The pilots make the headlines but they would not get off \nthe ground without all the other people in the unit.\n  U.S. defense policy is changing, and the role of the Happy Hooligans \nis going to change with it.\n  But make no mistake about it: the 119th Wing will still lead the way, \ndoing its job for America.\n  The Happy Hooligans are going to accept their new missions of \ncontrolling unmanned aerial vehicles and flying the future Joint Cargo \nAircraft with the same enthusiasm and professionalism as they flew \nfighters. And they will perform those missions better than anyone else \nin the country. Because that is the way they do everything.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S355-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING CORTLANDT DIETLER\n\n Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I would like to recognize \nCortlandt Dietler, a great Coloradan who tonight is receiving the \nNational Western Stock Show's 2007 Citizen of the West award. This is \nan honor befitting a man whose life and career exemplify the Western \nvalues of independence, hard work, and humility.\n  A native Coloradan, Cort is a pioneer in the oil industry and has \nhelped make Denver an energy center for our Nation. He began his career \nwith ARAMCO in Lebanon in 1947, and has been involved with more than 30 \nenergy companies since, many of which he has led or has founded. Today, \nhe is the chairman of TransMontaigne Inc, a petroleum product \ndistribution and marketing company which he founded. He is so respected \nin his industry that his peers have honored him repeatedly; in 1976 the \nDenver Petroleum Club named him the Oil Man of the Year, in 1986 the \nColorado Petroleum Association named him the Pioneer Oil Man of the \nYear, and in 2003 the Independent Petroleum Association of the Mountain \nStates selected him as the Wildcatter of the Year.\n  I have known Cort to be a spirited contributor to his community. He \nlends his expertise to organizations like the Denver Art Museum, the El \nPomar Foundation, and the Buffalo Bill Memorial Association. He is \ngenerous as a philanthropist and has a candid voice on the shared \nchallenges we face.\n  While Cort has worked primarily in the oil industry, he has also \nworked in ranching and with the National Western Stock Show for many \nyears. He and a partner ran a cattle operation in the Eagle River \nValley, near Vail, and bred thoroughbreds for racing.\n  He is being honored today because he epitomizes the values which are \nso central to Western life--he has worked hard, acted ethically, and \nserved his community with humility and honor. Cort belongs among the \nselect group of leaders who have received this award, and I \ncongratulate him on this honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S355-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S355-3", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S355-4", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:43 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2.

In addition, hurricanes Katrina and \n     Rita converted over 200 square miles of wetlands into open \n     water; and\n       Whereas, the communities, economy, natural resources, and \n     cultural heritage of south Louisiana remain vulnerable to the \n     extremes of coastal flooding, hurricanes, and land loss; and\n       Whereas, the protection and restoration of coastal \n     Louisiana will require a long term commitment of funding to \n     establish comprehensive, effective and sustainable coastal \n     protection projects and programs; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana congressional delegation has been \n     working for decades to secure a steady stream of revenue to \n     fund the critical work of coastal protection and restoration \n     in Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, since the inception and development of federal \n     offshore oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico, the \n     state of Louisiana has provided essential onshore support for \n     such production; and\n       Whereas, such support has included numerous components of \n     Louisiana's vital ``energy corridor'' that provide the nation \n     with a third of its domestic oil and gas supply, including \n     the pipeline systems that cross Louisiana's coastal wetlands; \n     and\n       Whereas, the countless communities in south Louisiana that \n     form the backbone and labor force to facilitate the delivery \n     of these crucial energy resources to the rest of the nation \n     are critical factors in such support; and\n       Whereas, the federal government collects over $6 billion \n     each year from the bonus bids, rents and royalties derived \n     from federal leases on the Outer Continental Shelf in the \n     Gulf of Mexico, and under current federal law nearly all of \n     these revenues are deposited into the General Treasury of the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, in recognition of the urgent crisis facing coastal \n     Louisiana and of the support provided by each of the Gulf \n     Coast states that produce oil and gas for the nation, and in \n     further acknowledgment of the significant amount of funding \n     available from oil and gas production on the Outer \n     Continental Shelf, the United States Congress passed the \n     Domenici-Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 \n     on December 9, 2006; and\n       Whereas, this act authorizes oil and gas development in \n     about 8.3 million acres of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, \n     including 2.5 million acres within a section known as Lease \n     Area 181; and\n       Whereas, beginning in the federal Fiscal Year 2007 and in \n     each fiscal year thereafter, this Act directs the secretary \n     of the United States Department of the Interior to share 37.5 \n     percent of the revenues from these new areas with the states \n     of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama for coastal \n     restoration, with such funds to be derived from bonus bids, \n     rents, and royalties on leases within the new areas; and\n       Whereas, beginning in the federal Fiscal Year 2016 and in \n     each fiscal year thereafter, this Act further directs the \n     secretary of the United States Department of the Interior to \n     share 37.5 percent of the revenues with the states of Texas, \n     Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama from all new federal oil \n     and gas leases after the date of enactment in existing U.S. \n     Department of Interior, Mineral Management Service, planning \n     areas throughout the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, the enactment of this Act represents the most \n     significant change offshore oil and gas policy in over fifty \n     years; and\n       Whereas, the dedication of these revenues constitute the \n     beginning of the steady stream of federal funding sought by \n     the Louisiana congressional delegation for decades; and\n       Whereas, such steady stream of federal funding is a truly \n     significant step towards sustainable coastal protection and \n     restoration as an attainable goal for Louisiana: Therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana commends and \n     memorializes the United States Congress for passing the \n     Domenici-Landrieu Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, \n     which provides for sharing of federal offshore oil and gas \n     revenue with Louisiana for coastal protection and \n     restoration.

Menendez, \n        Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 188. A bill to revise the short title of the Fannie Lou Hamer, \nRosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization \nand Amendments Act of 2006; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I join Senator Salazar in introducing \na bill to include Cesar E. Chavez among the names of the great civil \nrights leaders we honor in the title of last year's Voting Rights Act \nReauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006, ``VRARA''. I supported \ntaking this action last year during the Senate Judiciary Committee's \nconsideration of the VRARA when I offered an amendment on behalf of \nSenator Salazar to add the Hispanic civil rights leader to those for \nwhom the law is named. As Senator Salazar reminded us, Cesar Chavez is \nan American hero who sacrificed his life to empower the most vulnerable \nin America. Like Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King, \nfor whom the VRARA is named, he believed strongly in the right to vote \nas a cornerstone of American democracy. I offered the amendment in the \nJudiciary Committee and it was adopted without dissent.\n  In order not to complicate final passage of the Voting Rights Act, \nthe Senate proceeded to adopt the House-passed bill without amendment \nso that it could be signed into law without having to be reconsidered \nby the House. At that time, I committed to work with Senator Salazar to \nconform the law to include recognition of the contribution to our civil \nrights, voting rights and American society by Cesar Chavez.\n  Cesar Chavez's name should be added to the law as important \nrecognition of the broad landscape of political inclusion made possible \nby the Voting Rights Act. This bill would not alter the bill's vital \nremedies for continuing discrimination in voting, but is overdue \nrecognition of the importance of the Voting Rights Act to Hispanic-\nAmericans. Prior to the VRA, Hispanics, like minorities of all races, \nfaced major barriers to participation in the political process, through \nthe use of such devices as poll taxes, exclusionary primaries, \nintimidation by voting officials, language barriers, and systematic \nvote dilution.\n  I urge the Senate quickly to take up and pass this measure as we \nconvene the new Congress and commit ourselves again to ensuring that \nthe great promises of the 14th and 15th amendments are kept for all \nAmericans and that the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments \nAct is fully implemented to protect the rights of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S359-2", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S359-S394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Akaka):\n  S. 236. A bill to require reports to Congress on Federal agency use \nof data mining; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nFederal Agency Data Mining Reporting Act of 2007. I want to thank \nSenator Sununu for once again cosponsoring this bill, which we also \nintroduced in the last Congress. Senator Sununu has consistently been a \nleader on privacy issues, and I am pleased to work with him on this \neffort. I also want to thank Senators Leahy, Akaka, and Wyden, for \ntheir continuing support of the bill.\n  The controversial data analysis technology known as data mining is \ncapable of reviewing millions of both public and private records on \neach and every American. The possibility of government law enforcement \nor intelligence agencies fishing for patterns of criminal or terrorist \nactivity in these vast quantities of digital data raises serious \nprivacy and civil liberties issues--not to mention serious questions \nabout the effectiveness of these types of searches. But four years \nafter Congress first learned about and defunded the Defense \nDepartment's program called Total Information Awareness, there is still \nmuch Congress does not know about the Federal Government's work on data \nmining.\n  We have made some progress. We know from reviews conducted by the \nGovernment Accountability Office that as of May 2004 there were nearly \n200 Federal data mining programs, more than one hundred of which relied \non personal information and 29 of which were for the purpose of \ninvestigating terrorists or criminals. And we have learned a few more \ndetails on five of those programs from a follow-up report that GAO \nissued in August 2005. We also have a brief report from the DHS \nInspector General published in August 2006, and as a result of my \namendment to the DHS appropriations bill we have a July 2006 report \nfrom the Privacy Office at the Department of Homeland Security that \nprovides some interesting policy suggestions relating to data mining.\n  But this information has come to us haphazardly, and lacks detail \nabout the precise nature of the data mining programs being utilized or \ndeveloped, their efficacy, and the consequences Americans could face as \na result. Furthermore, much of the reporting thus far has focused on \nthe Department of Homeland Security. It also appears there has been \nlittle if any government-wide consideration of privacy policies for \nthese types of programs. Indeed, public debate on government data \nmining has been generated more by press stories than as a result of \ncongressional oversight.\n  My bill would require all Federal agencies to report to Congress \nwithin 180 days and every year thereafter on data mining programs \ndeveloped or used to find a pattern or anomaly indicating terrorist or \nother criminal activity on the part of individuals, and how these \nprograms implicate the civil liberties and privacy of all Americans. If \nnecessary, specific information in the various reports could be \nclassified.\n  This is information we need to have. Congress should not be learning \nthe details about data mining programs after millions of dollars are \nspent testing or using data mining against unsuspecting Americans. The \npossibility of unchecked, secret use of data mining technology \nthreatens one of the most important values that we are fighting for in \nthe war against terrorism--freedom.\n  Data mining could rely on a combination of intelligence data and \npersonal information like individuals' traffic violations, credit card \npurchases, travel records, medical records, and virtually any \ninformation contained in commercial or public databases. Congress must \nconduct oversight to make sure that all government agencies engaged in \nfighting terrorism and other criminal enterprises--not just the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, but also the Department of Justice, \nthe Department of Defense and others--use these types of sensitive \npersonal information effectively and appropriately.\n  Let me clarify what this bill does not do. It does not have any \neffect on the government's use of commercial data to conduct \nindividualized searches on people who are already suspects, nor does it \nrequire that the government report on these types of searches. It does \nnot end funding for any program, determine the rules for use of data \nmining technology, or threaten any ongoing investigation that might use \ndata mining technology.\n  My bill would simply provide Congress with information about the \nnature of the technology and the data that will be used. The Federal \nAgency Data Mining Reporting Act would require all government agencies \nto assess\n\n[[Page S360]]\n\nthe efficacy of the data mining technology they are using or \ndeveloping--that is, whether the technology can deliver on the promises \nof each program. In addition, my bill would make sure that Congress \nknows whether the Federal agencies using data mining technology have \nconsidered and developed policies or guidelines to protect the privacy \nand due process rights of individuals, such as privacy technologies and \nredress procedures. With complete information about the current data \nmining plans and practices of the Federal Government, Congress will be \nable to conduct a thorough review of the costs and benefits of the \npractice of data mining on a program-by-program basis and make \nconsidered judgments about whether programs should go forward. Congress \nwill also be able to evaluate whether new privacy rules are necessary.\n  In addition, Congress must look closely at the government's \nactivities because data mining is unproven in this area. Some argue \nthat data mining can help locate potential terrorists before they \nstrike. But we do not, today, have evidence that pattern-based data \nmining will prevent terrorism. In fact, some technology experts have \nwarned that this type of data mining is not the right approach for the \nterrorism problem. Just last month, the Cato Institute released a \nreport--coauthored by a scientist specializing in data analytics and an \ninformation privacy expert--concluding that ``[t]he only thing \npredictable about predictive data mining for terrorism is that it would \nbe consistently wrong.''\n  Some commercial uses of data mining have been successful, but have \narisen in a very different context than counterterrorism efforts. For \nexample, the financial world has successfully used data mining to \nidentify people committing fraud because it has data on literally \nmillions, if not billions, of historical financial transactions. And \nthe banks and credit card companies know, in large part, which of those \npast transactions have turned out to be fraudulent. So when they apply \nsophisticated statistical algorithms to that massive amount of \nhistorical data, they are able to make a pretty good guess about what a \nfraudulent transaction might look like in the future.\n  We do not have that kind of historical data about terrorists and \nsleeper cells. We have just a handful of individuals whose past actions \ncan be analyzed, which makes it virtually impossible to apply the kind \nof advanced statistical analysis required to use data mining in this \nway. That raises serious questions about whether data mining will ever \nbe able to locate an actual terrorist. Before the government starts \nreviewing personal information about every man, woman and child in this \ncountry, we should learn what data mining can and can't do--and what \nlimits and protections are needed if data mining programs do go \nforward.\n  We must also bear in mind that there will inevitably be errors in the \nunderlying data. Everyone knows people who have had errors on their \ncredit reports--and that is the one area of commercial data where the \nlaw already imposes strict accuracy requirements. Other types of \ncommercial data are likely to be even more inaccurate. Even if the \ntechnology itself were effective, I am very concerned that innocent \npeople could be ensnared because of mistakes in the data that make them \nlook suspicious. The recent rise in identity theft, which creates even \nmore data accuracy problems, makes it even more important that we \naddress this issue.\n  I also want to touch on one issue that has proved difficult in many \ndebates about data mining: how to define the term. What is data mining? \nFrom policy debates to government reports, many people have wrestled \nwith this question. While it can be defined more broadly, for the \npurpose of this reporting requirement, data mining is limited to the \nprocess of attempting to predict future events or actions by \ndiscovering or locating patterns or anomalies in data. However, for \npurposes of the reporting requirement in this bill, which seeks \ninformation on those data mining programs most likely to threaten the \nprivacy and civil liberties of Americans, I have limited the definition \nin a couple of other ways. First, the bill's core definition of data \nmining is to conduct a query, search or other analysis of one or more \nelectronic databases to ``discover a predictive pattern or an anomaly \nindicative of terrorist or criminal activity on the part of any \nindividual or individuals.'' Data mining has a number of applications \nat various government agencies outside the context of terrorism and \nother criminal investigations, but I have limited the definition for \npurposes of this legislation in order to get reports on the programs \nmost likely to raise privacy concerns. For example, the May 2004 GAO \nreport identified a number of government data mining programs whose \ngoals are managing resources efficiently or identifying fraud, waste \nand abuse in government programs, and that do not rely on personally \nidentifiable information. I am not seeking reports on programs like \nthese.\n  Second, as I alluded to earlier, the definition explicitly excludes \nqueries to retrieve information from a database that is based on \ninformation--such as address, passport number or license plate number--\nthat is associated with a particular individual or individuals. This \ntype of query is a traditional investigative technique. Although \ngovernment agencies must be careful in their use of commercial \ndatabases, simply querying a Choicepoint database for information about \nsomeone who is already a suspect is not data mining.\n  Most Americans believe that their private lives should remain \nprivate. Data mining programs run the risk of intruding into the lives \nof individuals who have nothing to do with terrorism or other criminal \nactivity and understandably do not want their credit reports, shopping \nhabits and doctor visits to become a part of a gigantic computerized \nsearch engine operating without any controls or oversight, and without \nmuch promise of locating terrorists. As the Cato report put it, ``[t]he \npossible benefits of predictive data mining for finding planning or \npreparation for terrorism are minimal. The financial costs, wasted \neffort, and threats to privacy and civil liberties are potentially \nvast.''\n  At a minimum, the administration should be required to report to \nCongress about the various data mining programs now underway or being \nstudied, and the impact those programs may have on our privacy and \ncivil liberties, so that Congress can determine whether any benefits of \nthis practice come at too high a price to our privacy and personal \nliberties. As Senator Wyden and I have told the Director of National \nIntelligence, we must have a public discussion about the efficacy and \nprivacy implications of data mining. We wrote a letter to him on \nNovember 15, 2006, that included the following:\n\n       [W]e believe there needs to be a public discussion before \n     the implementation of any government data mining program that \n     would rely on domestic commercial data and other information \n     about Americans. There are serious questions about whether \n     pattern analysis of such data can effectively identify \n     terrorists, given the relative lack of historical data about \n     terrorist activities. And as the furor over the Total \n     Information Awareness program demonstrated, the American \n     public has serious--and legitimate--concerns about the \n     privacy ramifications of programs designed to fish for \n     patterns of criminal or terrorist activity in vast quantities \n     of digital data, collected by other entities for entirely \n     different reasons. Pattern analysis runs the risk of \n     generating a large number of false positives, meaning that \n     innocent Americans could become the subject of investigation. \n     Before we go down that path, it is critical that we have a \n     public discussion about the efficacy and privacy implications \n     of this technology. And, if we decide that data mining is \n     effective enough to warrant spending taxpayer dollars on it, \n     we should establish strong privacy protections to protect \n     innocent people from being the subject of government \n     suspicion.\n       Of course, the Intelligence Community should be taking \n     advantage of new technologies in its critical responsibility \n     to protect our country from terrorists, and much of its work \n     must remain classified to protect national security. But we \n     can have a public debate about what privacy rules should \n     constrain data mining programs deployed domestically, without \n     revealing sensitive information like the precise algorithms \n     that the government has developed.\n\n  This bill is the first step in this process--a way for Congress and, \nto the degree appropriate, the public to finally understand what is \ngoing on behind the closed doors of the executive branch so that we can \nstart to have a policy discussion about data mining that is long \noverdue. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. All it asks for is \ninformation to which Congress and the American people are entitled.\n\n[[Page S361]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 236\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with Senators \nFeingold, Sununu and others to introduce the Federal Agency Data Mining \nReporting Act of 2007. This important privacy legislation would begin \nto restore key checks and balances by requiring Federal agencies to \nreport to Congress on their datamining programs and activities. We \njoined together to introduce a similar bill last Congress. Regrettably, \nit received no attention. This year, I intend to make sure that we do a \nbetter job in considering Americans' privacy, checks and balances, and \nthe proper balance to protect Americans' privacy rights while fighting \nsmarter and more effectively against security threats.\n  In recent years, the Federal Government's use of data mining \ntechnology has exploded. According to a May 2004 report by the General \nAccounting Office, there are at least 199 different government data \nmining programs operating or planned throughout the Federal Government, \nwith at least 52 different Federal agencies currently using data mining \ntechnology. And, more and more, these data mining programs are being \nused with little or no notice to ordinary citizens, or to Congress.\n  Advances in technologies make data banks and data mining more \npowerful and more useful than at any other time in our history. These \ncan be useful tools in our national security arsenal, but we should use \nthem appropriately so that they can be most effective. A mistake can \ncost Americans their jobs and wreak havoc in their lives and \nreputations that can take years to repair. Without adequate safeguards, \noversight and checks and balances, these powerful technologies also \nbecome an invitation to government abuse. The government must take \nsteps to ensure that it is properly using this technology. Too often, \ngovernment data mining programs lack adequate safeguards to protect the \nprivacy rights and civil liberties of ordinary Americans, whose data is \ncollected and analyzed by these programs. Without these safeguards, \ngovernment data mining programs are prone to produce inaccurate results \nand are ripe for abuse, error and unintended consequences.\n  This legislation takes an important first step in addressing these \nconcerns by pulling back the curtain on how this Administration is \nusing this technology. It does not by its terms prohibit the use of \nthis technology, but rather provides an oversight mechanism to begin to \nensure it is being used appropriately and effectively. This bill would \nrequire Federal agencies to report to Congress about its data mining \nprograms. The legislation provides a much-needed check on federal \nagencies to disclose the steps that they are taking to protect the \nprivacy and due process rights of American citizens when they use these \nprograms.\n  We need checks and balances to keep government data bases from being \nmisused against the American people. That is what the Constitution and \nour laws should provide. We in Congress must make sure that when our \ngovernment uses technology to detect and deter illegal activity that it \ndoes so in a manner that also protects our most basic rights and \nliberties. This bill advances this important goal, and I urge all \nSenators to support this important privacy legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Martinez, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Voinovich):\n  S. 237. A bill to improve agricultural job opportunities, benefits, \nand security for aliens in the United States and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Senators Craig, Kennedy, Martinez, \nBoxer, Voinovich and I are once again introducing legislation that will \naddress the chronic labor shortage in our Nation's agricultural \nindustry. This bill is a priority for me--and for the tens of thousands \nof farmers who are currently suffering--and I hope we will move it \nforward early in this Congress.\n  The Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security Act, or \nAgJOBS, is the product of more than ten years of work. It is a \nbipartisan bill supported by growers, farmers, and farm workers alike. \nIt passed the Senate last year as part of the comprehensive immigration \nreform bill last spring in the 109th Congress. It is time to move this \nbill forward.\n  The agricultural industry is in crisis. Farmers across the Nation \nreport a 20 percent decline in labor.\n  The result is that there are simply not enough farm workers to \nharvest the crops.\n  The Nation's agricultural industry has suffered. If we do not enact a \nworkable solution to the agricultural labor crisis, we risk a national \nproduction loss of $5 billion to $9 billion each year,\n\n[[Page S362]]\n\naccording to the American Farm Bureau.\n  California, in particular, will suffer. California is the single \nlargest agricultural state in the nation. California agriculture \naccounts for $34 billion in annual revenue. There 76,500 farms that \nproduce half of the nation's fruits, vegetables, and nuts from only 3 \npercent of the Nation's farmland.\n  California farms produce approximately 350 different crops: pears, \nwalnuts, raisins, lettuce, onions, cotton, just to name a few.\n  Many of the farmers who grow these crops have been in the business \nfor generations. They farm the land that their parents and their \ngrandparents farmed before them.\n  The sad consequence of the labor shortage is that many of these \nfarmers are giving up their farms. Some are leaving the business \nentirely. Others are bulldozing their fruit trees--literally pulling \nout trees that have been in the family for generations--because they do \nnot have the labor they need to harvest their fruit.\n  Once the trees are gone, they are replaced by crops that do not \nrequire manual labor. And our pears, our apples, our oranges will come \nfrom foreign sources.\n  The trend is quite clear. If there is not a means to grow and harvest \nour produce here, we will import produce from China, from Mexico, from \nother countries who have the labor they need.\n  We will put American farmers out of business. And there will be a \nripple effect felt throughout the economy: in farm equipment, inputs, \npackaging, processing, transportation, marketing, lending and \ninsurance. Jobs will be lost and our economy will suffer.\n  The reality is that Americans have come to rely on undocumented \nworkers to harvest their crops for them.\n  In California alone, we rely on approximately one million \nundocumented workers to harvest the crops. The United Farm Workers \nestimate that undocumented workers make up as much as 90 percent the \nfarm labor payroll.\n  Americans simply will not do the work. It is hard, stooped labor, \nrequiring long and unpredictable hours. Farm workers must leave home \nand travel from farm to farm to plant, prune, and harvest crops \naccording to the season.\n  We must come to terms with the fact that we rely on an undocumented \nmigrant work force. We must bring those workers out of the shadows and \ncreate a legal and enforceable means to provide labor for agriculture. \nThat realization is what led to the long and careful negotiations \ncreating AgJOBS.\n  The AgJOBS bill is a two part bill. Part one identifies and deals \nwith those undocumented agricultural workers who have been working in \nthe United States for the past 2 years or more. Part two creates a more \nusable H-2A Program, to implement a realistic and effective guest \nworker program.\n  The first step requires undocumented agricultural workers to apply \nfor a ``blue card'' if they can demonstrate that they have worked in \nAmerican agriculture for at least 150 workdays over the past 2 years. \nThe blue card entitles the worker to a temporary legal resident status.\n  The blue card itself is encrypted and machine readable; it is tamper \nand counterfeit resistant, and contains biometric identifiers unique to \nthe farm worker.\n  The second step requires that a blue card holder work in American \nagriculture for an additional 5 years for at least 100 workdays a year, \nor 3 years at 150 workdays a year.\n  Blue card workers would have to pay a $500 fine. The workers can \ntravel abroad and reenter the United States and they may work in other, \nnon-agricultural jobs, as long as they meet the agricultural work \nrequirements.\n  The blue card worker's spouse and minor children, who already live in \nthe United States, may also apply for a temporary legal status and \nidentification card, which would permit them to work and travel.\n  The total number of blue cards is capped at 1.5 million over a five \nyear period and the program sunsets after 5 years.\n  At the end of the required work period, the blue card worker may \napply for a green card to become a legal permanent resident.\n  There are also a number of safeguards. If a blue card worker does not \napply for a green card, or does not fulfill the work requirements, that \nindividual can be deported.\n  Likewise, a blue card holder who commits a felony, three \nmisdemeanors, or any crime that involves bodily injury, the threat of \nserious bodily injury, or harm to property in excess of $500, cannot \nget a green card and can be deported.\n  This program, for the first time, allows us to identify those \nhundreds of thousands of farm workers who now work in the shadows. It \nrequires the farm workers to come forward and to be identified in \nexchange for the right to work and live legally in the United States. \nAnd it gives farmers the legal certainty they need to hire the workers \nthey need.\n  The program also modifies the H-2A guest worker program so that it \nrealistically responds to our agricultural needs.\n  Currently, the H-2A program is bureaucratic, unresponsive, expensive, \nand prone to litigation. Farmers cannot get the labor when they need \nit. AgJOBS offers a much-needed reform of the outdated system.\n  The labor certification process, which often takes 60 days or more, \nis replaced by an ``attestation'' process. The employer can file a fax-\nback application form agreeing to abide by the requirements of the H-2A \nprogram. Approval should occur in 48 to 72 hours.\n  The interstate clearance order to determine whether there are U.S. \nworkers who can qualify for the jobs is replaced by a requirement that \nthe employer file a job notification with the local office of the state \nEmployment Security Agency. Advertising and positive recruitment must \ntake place in the local labor market area.\n  Agricultural associations can continue to file applications on behalf \nof members.\n  The statutory prohibition against ``adversely affecting'' U.S. \nworkers is eliminated. The Adverse Effect Wage Rate is instead frozen \nfor 3 years, and thereafter indexed by a methodology that will lead to \nits gradual replacement with a prevailing wage standard.\n  Employers may elect to provide a housing allowance in lieu of housing \nif the governor determines that there is adequate rental housing \navailable in the area of employment.\n  Inbound and return transportation and subsistence are required on the \nsame basis as under the current program, except that trips of less than \n100 miles are excluded, and workers whom an employer is not required to \nprovide housing are excluded.\n  The motor vehicle safety standards for U.S. workers are extended to \nH-2A workers.\n  Petitions for admission of H-2A workers must be processed and the \nconsulate or port of entry notified within 7 days of receipt. \nRequirements are the same as current law.\n  Petitions extending aliens' stay or changing employers are valid upon \nfiling.\n  Employers may apply for the admission of new H-2A workers to replace \nthose who abandoned their work or are terminated for cause, and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security is required to remove H-2A aliens who \nabandoned their work.\n  H-2A visas will be secure and counterfeit resistant.\n  A new limited federal right of action is available to foreign workers \nto enforce the economic benefits required under the H-2A program, and \nany benefits expressly offered by the employer in writing. A statute of \nlimitations of three years is imposed.\n  Finally, lawsuits in State court under State contract law alleging \nviolations of the H-2A program requirements and obligations are \nexpressly preempted. Such State court lawsuits have been the venue of \nchoice for litigation against H-2A employers in recent years.\n  AgJOBS is the one part of the immigration bill about which there is \nuniform agreement. Everyone knows that agriculture in America is \nsupported by undocumented workers. As immigration enforcement tightens \nup, and increasing numbers of people are prevented from crossing the \nborders or are being deported, the result is our crops go unharvested.\n  We are faced today with a very practical dilemma and one that is easy \nto solve. The legislation has been vetted over and over again. Senator \nCraig, I,\n\n[[Page S363]]\n\nand a multitude of other Senators have sat down with the growers, with \nthe farm bureaus, with the chambers, with everybody who knows \nagriculture, and they have all signed off on the AgJOBS bill.\n  This is our opportunity to solve a real problem.\n  I ask my colleagues to join Senator Craig, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nMartinez, Senator Boxer, Senator Voinovich and me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  I also ask by unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 237\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as otherwise provided, sections 201 and 301 shall \n     take effect 1 year after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, It's a privilege to join Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Craig and my other colleagues today as we \nreintroduce the Agricultural Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits, and Security \nAct. I commend them and Representatives Howard Berman and Chris Cannon \nfor their bipartisan leadership and I'm honored to be part of this \nlandmark legislation.\n  The bill reflects a far-reaching and welcome agreement between the \nUnited Farm Workers and the agricultural industry on one of the most \ndifficult immigration' challenges we face, and we in Congress should \nmake the most of this unique opportunity for progress.\n  America has a proud tradition as a Nation of immigrants and a Nation \nof laws. But our current immigration laws fail us on both counts. Much \nof the Nation's economy today depends on the hard work and the many \ncontributions of immigrants. The agricultural industry would grind to a \nhalt without immigrant farm workers. Yet, the overwhelming majority of \nthese workers lack legal status, and can be easily exploited by \nunscrupulous employers.\n  The legislation we are introducing, called the ``AgJOBS Act,'' is an \nopportunity to correct these long-festering problems. It will give farm \nworkers and their families the dignity and justice they deserve, and it \nwill give agricultural employers a legal workforce.\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\n  It is a realistic compromise that now has broad support in Congress, \nand from business and labor, civic and faith-based organizations, \nliberals and conservatives, trade associations and immigrant rights \ngroups.\n  The Act is a needed reform in our immigration law to reflect current \neconomic realities and meet our national security needs more \neffectively, and do so in a way that respects America's immigrant \nheritage. It provides a fair and reasonable means for illegal \nagricultural workers to earn legal status, and it also reforms the \ncurrent visa program, so that employers unable to obtain American \nworkers can hire needed foreign workers.\n  The AgJOBS Act is good for both labor and business. The Nation can no \nlonger ignore the fact that more than half of our agricultural workers \nare undocumented. Growers need an immediate, reliable and legal \nworkforce at harvest time. Farm workers need legal statues to improve \ntheir wages and working conditions. Everyone suffers when crops rot in \nthe fields because of the lack of an adequate labor force.\n  The AgJOBS Act provides a fair and reasonable process for \nundocumented agricultural workers to earn legal status. Undocumented \nfarm workers are clearly vulnerable to abuse by unscrupulous labor \ncontractors and growers. Their illegal status deprives them of \nbargaining power and depresses the wages of all farm workers. Our bill \nprovides fair solutions for undocumented workers who have been toiling \nin our fields and harvesting our fruits and vegetables.\n  This bill is not an amnesty. To earn the right to remain in this \ncountry, workers would not only have to demonstrate past work \ncontributions to the U.S. economy, but also make a substantial future \nwork commitment. These workers will be able to come forward, identify \nthemselves, provide evidence that they have been employed in \nagriculture and will continue to work hard, and will play by the rules \nin the future.\n  This legislation will modify the current temporary foreign \nagricultural worker program, while preserving and enhancing key labor \nprotections. It achieves a fair balance. It streamlines the H-2A visa \napplication process by reducing paperwork for employers and \naccelerating processing. But individuals participating in the program \nreceive strong labor protections.\n  Our legislation will unify families. When temporary residence is \ngranted a farm worker's spouse and minor children will be able to \nremain legally in the U.S. but they will not be authorized to work. \nWhen the worker becomes a permanent resident, the spouse and minor \nchildren will also gain such status.\n  AgJOBS will also enhance national security and reduce illegal \nimmigration. It will reduce the chaotic, illegal, and all-too-deadly \nflows of immigrants at our borders by providing safe and legal avenues \nfor farm workers and their families. Future temporary workers will be \ncarefully screened to meet security concerns. Enforcement resources \nwill be more effectively focused on the highest risks. By bringing \nundocumented farm workers out of the shadows and requiring them to pass \nthrough security checks, it will enable officials to concentrate more \neffectively on terrorists and criminals.\n  Last year, Senators came together--Democrats and Republicans--to pass \na far-reaching immigration reform bill that included the AgJOBS bill. \nThe American people are calling on us to come together again. They know \nthere is a crisis, and they want action now.\n  President Bush has been a leader on immigration reform, and I'm \nhopeful that he will renew his efforts with members of his party, so \nthat we can continue action quickly this year on comprehensive reform \nlegislation and end this festering crisis once and for all. The House \nof Representatives is now ready to be a genuine partner in this effort.\n  By heritage and history, America is a Nation of immigrants. Our \nlegislation proposes necessary changes in the law while preserving this \ntradition. This bill will ensure that immigrant farm workers can live \nthe American dream and contribute to our prosperity, our security, and \nour values, and I hope very much that it can be enacted as soon as \npossible in this new Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Nelson \n        of Florida, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 238. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to limit the \nmisuse of Social Security numbers, to establish criminal penalties for \nsuch misuse, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nprotect one of Americans' most valuable but vulnerable assets: social \nsecurity numbers.\n  The bill I propose is identical to legislation that I introduced last \nyear. This is the fifth Congress in which I have proposed legislation \nto protect social security numbers. I stand before you again today \nbecause I believe that this issue is too important to ignore.\n  We all know that once a person's social security number is \ncompromised, the path to identity theft is a short one. The Federal \nTrade Commission estimates that as many as 10 million Americans have \ntheir identities stolen each year.\n  The crime takes many forms. Thieves can obtain social security \nnumbers through public records--marriage licenses, professional \nlicenses, and countless other public documents--many of which are \navailable on the internet.\n  These stolen social security numbers then act like virtual keys, \nallowing the thieves to unlock an individual's identity.\n  Thieves open credit cards and charge them to the max. Often, the \nvictim does not even realize what has happened until they are denied \ncredit in the future because of the unpaid debt on the fraudulent \ncredit cards.\n  Thieves open bank accounts in the victim's name and write bad checks.\n  Thieves get driver's licenses or identification cards, and even apply \nfor government benefits in the victim's name.\n  Identity theft is serious. A person whose identity is stolen can lose \nthousands of dollars and take months or even years to regain their good \nname and credit.\n  The damage, loss, and stress of identity theft are considerable.\n  Victims may lose job opportunities, or be denied loans for education, \nhousing, or cars because of negative information on their credit \nreports. They may even be arrested for crimes they did not commit.\n  The ease with which social security numbers can be accessed is \ndistressing, but also, unnecessary.\n  The Social Security Number Misuse Prevention Act would require \ngovernment agencies and businesses to do more to protect Americans' \nsocial security numbers. The bill would: stop the sale or display of a \nperson's social security number without his or her express consent; \nprevent Federal, State and local governments from displaying social \nsecurity numbers on public records posted on the Internet; end the \nprinting of social security numbers on government checks; prohibit the \nemploying of inmates for tasks that give them access to the social \nsecurity numbers of other individuals; limit the circumstances in which \nbusinesses could ask a customer for his or her social security number; \ncommission a study of the current uses of social security numbers and \nthe impact on privacy and data security; and institute criminal and \ncivil penalties for misuse of social security numbers.\n  This legislation is simple and necessary to stop the growing epidemic \nof identity theft that has been plaguing America and its citizens.\n  As we move further into the information age and rely more on \ninformation sharing, this problem will only get worse, unless we take \naction. I urge my colleagues to support the Social Security Number \nMisuse Prevention Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                 S. 238\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Social \n     Security Number Misuse Prevention Act''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act \n     is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S375]]\n\n\nSec. 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of Social \n     Security numbers has contributed to a growing range of \n     illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in \n     some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.\n       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers, \n     and other entities have often used Social Security numbers to \n     confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to \n     the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used \n     to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of \n     individual privacy.\n       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n     individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a \n     Social Security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for \n     Social Security benefits, or to seek employment. An \n     unintended consequence of these requirements is that Social \n     Security numbers have become one of the tools that can be \n     used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy \n     of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because \n     the Federal Government created and maintains this system, and \n     because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to \n     exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate \n     for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of \n     Social Security numbers.\n       (4) The display, sale, or purchase of Social Security \n     numbers in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-\n     open public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale, \n     or purchase would not affect public debate.\n       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or \n     purchase of Social Security numbers in circumstances that \n     create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or \n     financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are \n     assigned.\n       (6) Consequently, this Act provides each individual that \n     has been assigned a Social Security number some degree of \n     protection from the display, sale, and purchase of that \n     number in any circumstance that might facilitate unlawful \n     conduct.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require Federal agencies, and persons engaged in \ninterstate commerce, in possession of data containing sensitive \npersonally identifiable information, to disclose any breach of such \ninformation; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Notification \nof Risk to Personal Data Act.\n  It is vitally important that Congress take immediate action to ensure \nthat individuals are notified when companies, Federal agencies, and \nother institutions suffer security breaches that could jeopardize their \npersonal information.\n  The Notification of Risk to Personal Data Act is a simple, \nstraightforward bill that would require that notice be sent to \nindividuals in the event of a data breach which compromises their \npersonal information.\n  Providing individuals with knowledge that their personal information \nhas been accessed by a hacker will allow them to take action to prevent \nor limit the damage caused by these security breaches.\n  The need for such legislation is, unfortunately, self-evident given \nthe spate of data breaches we have all read and heard about. \nUnfortunately, almost every week we learn of a new breach.\n  For example, there have been major data breaches in just the last few \nmonths at Boeing, UCLA, the Colorado Department of Human Services, \nStarbucks, the Chicago Voters' Database, and Akron Children's Hospital.\n  Given this ongoing problem, it is not surprising that Americans have \nmade it clear that they want Congress to act. A September 2005 CBS \nNews/New York Times national poll on privacy and identity theft found \nthat 89 percent of Americans are ``concerned'' about the theft of their \npersonal identity information and 68 percent of Americans feel that \nCongress should do more to regulate personal data and its collection.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission identity theft affects \napproximately 10 million Americans each year. In 2004, there were \n635,173 identity theft and fraud complaints made to the Federal Trade \nCommission's Consumer Sentinel. In 2004, identity fraud cost Americans \n$52.6 billion dollars. Over the past 2 years, approximately 18 million \nindividuals in this country have been exposed or affected by identity \ntheft.\n  Data breaches threaten individual's economic and emotional well \nbeing. A person whose identity is stolen can lose thousands of dollars \nand it can take months or even years for a person to regain their good \nname and credit. So when a data breach occurs, people have a right to \nfind out as soon as possible.\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\n  That is why I have introduced and tried to pass legislation that \nwould: require that the Federal Government and business entities notify \nindividuals when there has been a security breach involving their \npersonal data; ensure that the notice is provided without unreasonable \ndelay; create very limited exceptions to notification for national \nsecurity and law enforcement purposes, as well as instances in which \nlaw enforcement certifies that there is no threat of harm to the \nindividual; provide civil remedies against those who do not notify \nindividuals and the provisions of the bill would be enforced by State \nattorney generals; and pre-empt all state laws so that there is a \nsingle, nationwide notification requirement.\n  I strongly believe that individuals have a right to be notified when \ntheir most sensitive information is compromised--because it is truly \ntheir information.\n  The instant legislation will give all Americans more control and \nconfidence about the safety of their sensitive personal information. \nThey will know when their data has been compromised so that they take \nthe appropriate steps to protect themselves.\n  In November 2005, the Judiciary Committee approved the Personal Data \nPrivacy and Security Act. That bill included similar notification \nlegislation. Unfortunately, the Senate took no further action and the \nbill expired at the end of the 109th Congress.\n  Since then, the problem of identity theft has worsened--there have \nbeen numerous large scale data security breaches involving companies, \nfederal agencies, and universities.\n  We cannot afford to keep waiting to act. I urge the Senate to pass \nthe Notification of Risk to Personal Data Act to give Americans the \ninformation they need to protect themselves from identity theft.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 239\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Notification of Risk to \n     Personal Data Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Geologic Mapping \nAct of 1992; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing, along with Senators \nDomenici, Bingaman, Enzi, Stevens, Bennett, Murkowski, and Bunning, the \nNational Geologic Maping Reauthorization Act of 2007. This is an act \nthat has been very beneficial to the Nation and deserves to be \nreauthorized.\n  The National Geologic Mapping Act was originally signed into law in \n1992, creating the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program \n(NCGMP). This program exists as a partnership between the USGS and the \nState geological surveys, whose purpose is to provide the Nation with \nurgently-needed geologic maps that can be and are used by a diverse \nclientele. These maps are vital to understanding groundwater regimes, \nmineral resources, geologic hazards such as landslides and earthquakes, \nand geology essential for all types of land use planning; as well as \nproviding basic scientific data. The NCGMP contains three parts; \nFedMap--the U.S. Geological Survey's geologic mapping program, \nStateMap--the State geological survey's part of the act, and EdMap--a \nprogram to encourage the training of future geologic mappers at our \ncolleges and universities. All three components are reviewed annually \nby a Federal Advisory Committee to ensure program effectiveness and to \nprovide future guidance.\n  FedMap geologic mapping priorities are determined by the needs of \nFederal land-management agencies, regional customer forums, and \ncooperatively with the State geological surveys. FedMap also \ncoordinates national geologic mapping standards. StateMap is a \ncompetitive program wherein the States submit proposals for geologic \nmapping that are critiqued by a peer review panel. A requirement of \nthis section of the legislation is that each Federal dollar be matched \none-for-one with State funds. Each participating State has a State \nAdvisory Committee to ensure that its proposal addresses priority areas \nand needs as determined in the NGMA. The success of this program \nensured reauthorization of similar legislation in 1997 and in 1999 with \nwidespread bipartisan support in both the House and Senate.\n  To date, millions of dollars been awarded to State geological surveys \nthrough StateMap, and these Federal dollars have been more than matched \nby State dollars. The high quality geologic maps produced will be used \nby a very broad base of customers including geotechnical consultants, \nFederal, State and local land managers, and mineral and energy \nexploration companies. Information on how to obtain all of these maps \nis provided on the Internet by the National Geologic Map Database, \nallowing ease of access for all users.\n  EdMap has trained over 550 university students at 118 universities \nacross the Nation. The best testament to the quality of this training \nare its beneficiaries--an unusually high percentage of these students \ngo on to careers in Earth Science, becoming university professors, \nenergy company exploration scientists, or mapping specialists \nthemselves. Their EdMap program experience provides them with a \nremarkable self-confidence, having completed a difficult and \nindependent field mapping experience.\n  The National Geologic Mapping Reauthorization Act benefits numerous \ncitizens every day by assuring there is accurate, usable geologic \ninformation available to communities and individuals so that safe, \neducated resource use decisions can be made. I encourage my colleagues \nto support this legislation and am committed to its timely \nconsideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 240\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto cooperative agreements to protect natural resources of units of \nthe National Park System through collaborative efforts on land inside \nand outside of units of the National Park System; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to authorize \nthe Secretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements to \nprotect National Parks through collaborative efforts on lands inside \nand outside of National Park System units. My bill passed the Senate in \nthe 109th Congress, but unfortunately did not have an opportunity to \npass in the House before the end of the Congress. Today, I reintroduce \nthe bill hoping that it can expeditiously pass again in the Senate and \ncontinue on to pass in the House.\n  This legislation is based on very successful watershed protection \nlegislation enacted for the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \nManagement, now commonly referred to as the Wyden amendment. The Wyden \namendment, first enacted in 1998 for Fiscal Year 1999, has resulted in \ncountless Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management cooperative \nagreements with neighboring state and local land owners to accomplish \nhigh priority restoration, protection and enhancement work on public \nand private lands. It has not required additional funding, but has \nallowed the agencies to leverage their scarce restoration dollars \nthereby allowing the Federal dollars to stretch farther.\n  The legislation I introduce today will allow the Park Service to use \na similar authority to attack natural threats to National Parks, such \nas invasive weeds, before they cross onto Parks' land. The National \nPark Service tells me that if they have to wait until the weeds hit the \nParks before treating them the costs for treatment rise exponentially \nand the probability of beating the weeds back drops exponentially.\n  Examples of projects the National Park Service would pursue with this \nauthority, as well as the groups with which they would partner, are \nattached. I am pleased that Senator Akaka is joining me as an original \nco-sponsor of this legislation and I hope my other colleagues will join \nme as co-sponsors of this legislation and in ensuring its swift \npassage. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a list \nof projects be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 241\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with \nrespect to the importation of prescription drugs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor for just a couple \nof minutes to describe a piece of legislation that I and Senator \nOlympia Snowe have introduced today with 30 of our colleagues in the \nSenate dealing with the issue of drug reimportation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to show on the floor of the \nSenate a couple of bottles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to show two bottles that contained Lipitor, \na drug that most of us know is a cholesterol-lowering drug. Lipitor is \nmade by a company in a plant--in this case in Ireland--and in Ireland \nthey put Lipitor in these two bottles, and they send the Lipitor in \nthis bottle to Canada, and they send the Lipitor in this bottle to the \nUnited States.\n  The difference? Well, there is no difference. It is the same pill, \nput in the same bottle, made by the same company, an FDA-approved drug. \nThe difference is the United States consumer pays 65 percent more for \nthis drug than the consumer in Canada.\n  But it is not just Lipitor. And it is not just a plant in Ireland by \nthis company that produces it and sends it to here and then to Canada, \nand charges the American consumer the highest prices. It is virtually \nall of the brand drugs. And in virtually every case, the American \nconsumer is paying the highest prices for prescription drugs--the \nhighest prices in the world.\n  My colleague, Senator Snowe and I and many others in this Chamber--\nSenator Stabenow, Senator Kennedy, Senator McCain, and so many others--\n30 Senators have introduced this legislation that allows the \nreimportation of FDA-approved drugs--produced in FDA-inspected plants--\nallows the reimportation of those lower priced prescription drugs into \nthis country. It allows American consumers to take advantage of the \nglobal economy by buying that FDA-approved drug where it is sold for a \nfraction of the price.\n  One day, some while ago, on a beautiful summer day, outside of Oakes, \nND, I was meeting with a group of farmers. At this farmyard, we were \nsitting on bales of straw and having a long discussion, and there was \none older fellow there in his eighties, early eighties. He said to me: \nMy wife has been suffering from breast cancer for 3 years. She is an \nelderly woman battling breast cancer now for 3 years. For 3 years, we \nhave driven from the southern part of North Dakota into Canada to buy \nTamoxifen for my wife to treat this breast cancer. She needs this \nmedicine to fight the breast cancer, and the only way we can afford it \nis for us to get in the car and drive to Canada and buy Tamoxifen at 20 \npercent of the price we would have to pay in this country.\n  American consumers should not have to do that. They ought to be \nallowed to reimport prescription drugs that are made in FDA-approved \nplants and are FDA-approved drugs.\n  The legislation we have introduced today is necessary. I do not want \nAmerican consumers to have to purchase prescription drugs elsewhere. I \nwant them to be able to purchase them in this country at a fair price. \nThe problem is, we are now paying the highest prices in the world. If \nwe allow the reimportation, it will put downward pressure on prices in \nthis country. That is our real goal.\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\n  Now the Congressional Budget Office has done a study. They tell us \nthat brandname drugs cost 35 to 55 percent less in most other countries \nthan they do in the United States. The AARP, American Association of \nRetired Persons, has done a study showing the drugs most frequently \nused by senior citizens in our country have increased by a 6.3-percent \nprice increase from June 2005 to June 2006--double the rate of \ninflation.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if we pas the \nlegislation we have now introduced today, there will be a savings of \nabout $50 billion in direct savings over the next decade for American \nconsumers, with $6.1 billion of that savings to the Federal budget.\n  So we believe this is important. We have been blocked from getting \nthis legislation through the Congress for some long while. The \nleadership of this institution supports it. The legislation is \nbipartisan--broadly bipartisan.\n  Now let me say one other thing. Some people say, and particularly the \npharmaceutical industry says, this cannot be done safely, it will \njeopardize safety for American consumers. Well, let me say that the \nconsumers in the European countries have been doing this for 20, 25 \nyears. There is something called parallel trading. They have been doing \nit for 20, 25 years without any issues of safety. If you want to buy a \ndrug in Spain, and you live in France, no problem. If you want to buy a \ndrug in Italy, and you live in Germany, no problem. They have been \ndoing that--called parallel trading--for 25 years. Surely, we can \naccomplish that in this country as well.\n  Let me show a couple of charts, briefly.\n  First, Americans are charged the highest prices in the world. This \none chart compares it to Canada: Lipitor, Prevacid, Zocor, Zoloft, \nCelebrex. I will not go through the entire list.\n  Dr. Peter Rost, vice president of marketing for Pfizer, came to \nWashington, and here is what he said:\n\n       The biggest argument against reimportation is safety. What \n     everyone has conveniently forgotten to tell you is that in \n     Europe reimportation of drugs has been in place for 20 years.\n\n  He went on to say there is not any issue of safety.\n  And, finally, the American Association of Retired Persons endorses \nthe legislation we have introduced today. I will not read all of that.\n  But the final chart shows what is happening with respect to spending \non prescription drugs, and where it is heading, and why we ought to do \nsomething to give consumers the opportunity to see fair prices on \nprescription drugs.\n  Miracle drugs offer no miracles to those who cannot afford to buy \nthem. I have no brief against the pharmaceutical industry. I want them \nto keep producing lifesaving, miracle drugs for this country. In fact, \nwe produce a great deal of public spending in the NIH and elsewhere \nthat gives them the research base for which a good number of those \ndrugs is produced.\n  But let me also say that the pharmaceutical industry owes the \nAmerican consumer a fair deal. We should not be paying the highest \nprices in the world for prescription drugs. It is not fair. And if the \npharmaceutical industry is going to use a global economy in order to \nmove its commodities and its various ingredients for prescription drugs \naround the world to produce in Ireland or to produce here or in Puerto \nRico, then the American people ought to be able to use the global \neconomy to get a better price on FDA-approved drugs.\n  We have waited a long while. I have worked on this I guess 6 or 8 \nyears. We have been blocked repeatedly from getting a vote in the \nCongress, both in the House and the Senate. Now we have introduced, \nwith broad, bipartisan support, an identical piece of legislation in \nthe House and in the Senate.\n  I believe we will get a vote in both bodies and pass legislation and \nsend it to the President of the United States. It will save $50 billion \nover the next decade on prescription drug bills for the American \npeople, save the Federal Government $5 billion or $6 billion in \nspending, and give a fair deal to the American people that they will be \nable to buy prescription drugs at a fair price.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to consideration of this measure in the \nSenate. I am pleased on behalf of my colleague Senator Snowe and myself \nand a broad group of Republicans and Democrats in the Senate to push \nthis legislation.\n  I see Senator Sanders is here, and I know she has worked on this \nissue for a long while as well. We have a broad, bipartisan group. We \nare going to push this and get this done in this session of Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Enzi, and Ms. \n        Landrieu):\n  S. 246. A bill to enhance compliance assistance for small business; \nto the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I have long worked to reduce the burden \nthat Federal regulations bear on small businesses. Over the past twenty \nyears, the number and complexity of Federal regulations have multiplied \nat an alarming rate. These regulations impose a much more significant \nimpact on small businesses than larger businesses. A recent report \nprepared for the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy \nfound that in 2004, the per-employee cost of Federal regulations for \nfirms with fewer than 20 employees was $7,647. That was 44.8 percent \nmore than the $5,282 per-employee cost faced by businesses with 500 or \nmore workers.\n  That is why today, I rise with Senators Kerry, Enzi, and Landrieu to \nintroduce the Small Business Compliance Assistance Enhancement Act of \n2007. Our bill would clarify requirements that exist under Federal law \nto ensure that agencies produce useful small business compliance guides \nthat explain, in a readable format, the compliance requirements of \ncomplex rules. This ``small,'' targeted reform, which would not create \nany new rules or requirements, would have a major benefit for small \nbusinesses across the country.\n  In 1996, the Senate passed without opposition the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) to make the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act more effective in curtailing the impact of regulations \non small businesses. One of the most important provisions of SBREFA is \na requirement that agencies produce compliance assistance materials to \nhelp small businesses satisfy regulatory obligations. Unfortunately, \nover the years, agencies have done a poor job of meeting this \nrequirement. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has found that \nagencies have ignored this requirement or failed miserably in their \nattempts to satisfy it. The GAO has also found that the language of \nSBREFA is unclear in some places about what is actually required. \nConsequently, small businesses have been forced to figure out on their \nown how to comply with these regulations. This makes compliance that \nmuch more difficult to achieve, and therefore reduces the effectiveness \nof the regulation.\n  The Small Business Compliance Assistance Enhancement Act of 2007 \nwould close those loopholes and requires agencies to produce quality \ncompliance assistance materials for small businesses. Our bill is drawn \ndirectly from the GAO's recommendations and is intended only to clarify \nan already existing requirement. Similarly, the compliance guides that \nthe agencies will produce are merely suggestions about how to satisfy a \nregulation's requirements without imposing further requirements or \nadditional enforcement measures. Nor does this bill, in any way, \ninterfere or undercut an agency's ability to enforce its regulations to \nthe full extent they currently enjoy. Furthermore, our bill was \nincluded as part of the Small Business Reauthorization and Improvements \nAct that was unanimously reported out of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee in the 109th Congress.\n  All too often, small businesses do not maintain the staff, or possess \nthe financial resources to comply with complex Federal regulations. \nThis puts them at a disadvantage compared to larger businesses, and \nreduces the effectiveness of the agency's regulations. If an agency \ncannot describe how to comply with its regulation, how can we expect a \nsmall business to figure it out? This was the reason the requirement to \nprovide compliance assistance was originally included in SBREFA, and \nthis rationale is just as valid today as it was in 1996.\n  Specifically, our bill would clarify that a small business compliance \nguide\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\nis required whenever an agency determines that a rule will have ``a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small \nentities''. This would avoid confusion about whether the agency should \nproduce a compliance guide.\n  Second, our bill would also clarify how a guide shall be designated. \nUnder current law, agencies must ``designate'' the publications \nprepared under the section as small business compliance guides. \nHowever, the form in which those designations should occur is unclear. \nThis term would be changed to ``entitle.'' Consistent use of the phrase \n``Small Entity Compliance Guide'' in the title could make it easier for \nsmall entities to locate the guides that the agencies develop. This \nwould also aid in using on line searches--a technology that was not \nwidely used when SBREFA was passed. Thus, agencies would be directed to \npublish guides entitled ``Small Entity Compliance Guide.''\n  Third, our bill would clarify how a guide shall be published. SBREFA \ncurrently requires that agencies ``shall publish'' the guides, but it \ndoes not indicate where or how they should be published. At least one \nagency has published the guides as part of the preamble to the subject \nrule, thereby requiring affected small entities to read the Federal \nRegister to obtain the guides. Under our bill, agencies would be \ndirected, at a minimum, to make their compliance guides easily \naccessible and available through their websites. In addition, agencies \nwould be directed to forward their compliance guides to known industry \ncontacts such as small businesses or associations with small business \nmembers that will be affected by the regulation.\n  Fourth, our bill also clarifies when a guide shall be published. \nSection 212 of SBREFA currently does not indicate when compliance \nguides should be published. This means that even if an agency was \nrequired to produce a compliance guide, the agency may claim that they \nhave not violated that requirement since there is no deadline \nestablished for when they had to produce that guide. Under our bill, \nagencies would be instructed to publish the compliance guides \ncoincident with, or as soon as possible after, the final rule is \npublished, provided that the guides must be published no later than the \neffective date of the rule's compliance requirements.\n  Finally, our bill would clarify the phrase ``compliance \nrequirements.'' At a minimum, this term means what a small business has \nto do to satisfy the regulation, and when they will know they have met \nthe requirements. This should include a description of the procedures a \nsmall business might employ. If, as is the case with many OSHA and EPA \nregulations, testing is required, the agency should explain how that \ntesting should be conducted. Our bill makes clear that the procedural \ndescription should be merely suggestive--an agency would not be able to \nenforce this procedure if a small business was able to satisfy the \nrequirements through a different approach.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Compliance \n     Assistance Enhancement Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Small businesses represent 99.7 percent of all \n     employers, employ half of all private sector employees, and \n     pay 44.3 percent of total United States private payroll.\n       (2) Small businesses generated 60 to 80 percent of net new \n     jobs annually over the last decade.\n       (3) Very small firms with fewer than 20 employees spend \n     nearly 50 percent more per employee than larger firms to \n     comply with Federal regulations. Small firms spend twice as \n     much on tax compliance as their larger counterparts. Based on \n     an analysis in 2004, firms employing fewer than 20 employees \n     face an annual regulatory burden of $7,647 per employee, \n     compared to a burden of $5,282 per employee for a firm with \n     over 500 employees.\n       (4) Section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory \n     Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. 601 note) requires \n     agencies to produce small entity compliance guides for each \n     rule or group of rules for which an agency is required to \n     prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis under section \n     604 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (5) The Government Accountability Office has found that \n     agencies have rarely attempted to comply with section 212 of \n     the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of \n     1996 (5 U.S.C. 601 note). When agencies did try to comply \n     with that requirement, they generally did not produce \n     adequate compliance assistance materials.\n       (6) The Government Accountability Office also found that \n     section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \n     Fairness Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. 601 note) and other sections \n     of that Act need clarification to be effective.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To clarify the requirement contained in section 212 of \n     the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of \n     1996 (5 U.S.C. 601 note) for agencies to produce small entity \n     compliance guides.\n       (2) To clarify other terms relating to the requirement in \n     section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \n     Fairness Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. 601 note).\n       (3) To ensure that agencies produce adequate and useful \n     compliance assistance materials to help small businesses meet \n     the obligations imposed by regulations affecting such small \n     businesses, and to increase compliance with these \n     regulations.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n555 Independence Street, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, as the ``Rush Hudson \nLimbaugh, Sr. United States Courthouse''; to the\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesignating the new Federal Courthouse in Cape Girardeau, MO. as the \nRush Hudson Limbaugh, Sr. United States Courthouse.\n  When people talk about the American Dream, the ``Spirit of America'' \nand the people who helped make this country great, all one really has \nto do is mention the name of the late Rush Hudson Limbaugh Sr.\n  Mr. Limbaugh led an extraordinary life in which he practiced law for \nalmost 80 years until his death at age 104 in 1996. At the time of his \ndeath, Mr. Limbaugh was the Nation's oldest practicing lawyer and still \ncame into work about twice a week at the law firm he founded over 50 \nyears before in Cape Girardeau, MO.\n  Known by his peers as a superb trial lawyer with impeccable character \nand integrity, he was a beloved icon of the Missouri legal community, \nespecially in Southeast Missouri where he lived all his life.\n  Born in 1891, on a small farm in rural Bollinger County, he was the \nyoungest of eight children and attended school in a one room primary \nschool house. It is said that a passion for the law first developed in \nRush as a 10-year-old boy when a Daniel Webster Oration that he \nmemorized inspired him to become a lawyer. Fourteen years later, he \nbegan a legal career that lasted eight decades. Throughout those 80 \nyears, his interest in the law and his dedication to his clients never \nwavered.\n  Rush paid his way through college at the University of Missouri at \nColumbia by working on the university farm and doing odd jobs such as \ncarpentry, firing up furnaces, caring for animals and waiting tables. \nWhile in college, his oratory skills won him awards which he later \nutilized with great success in the courtroom.\n  In 1914, he entered law school, and after two years, he skipped the \nthird year and passed the Missouri Bar examination. In 1916, he was \nadmitted into the Missouri Bar and his long distinguished legal career \nbegan in Cape Girardeau.\n  Over his career, Rush argued more than 60 cases in front of the \nMissouri Supreme Court along with many prominent civil cases. He was a \nspecialist in probate law and helped draft the 1955 Probate Code of \nMissouri. He also tried cases before the Interstate Commerce \nCommission, the U.S. Labor Board and the Internal Revenue Appellate \nDivision.\n  From 1955 through 1956, he was President of the Missouri Bar and \nlater served as President of the State Historical Society of Missouri. \nIn addition to this, Mr. Limbaugh was a leading member of numerous \nlegal and civic organizations including the American Bar Association, \nthe Missouri Bar Foundation, the Missouri Human Rights Commission, the \nCape Girardeau Board of Education and the Salvation Army Advisory Board\n  However, Rush's contributions were not just limited to Missouri. In \nthe late 1950's, Rush served as a U.S. State Department special envoy \nto India where he promoted American jurisprudence and constitutional \ngovernment among lawyers, judges and university students in that newly \nformed country. And in the 1960's, he served as Chairman of the \nAmerican Bar Association's special committee on the Bill of Rights.\n  Rush was truly an inspiration and mentor to many aspiring lawyers, \nespecially the ones in his own family. His two sons, Rush Jr. and \nSteven, both practiced law with him for many years. His son, Steven N. \nLimbaugh, currently serves as a Senior Federal Judge in St. Louis. Four \nof his grandsons followed in his footsteps and pursued legal careers \nincluding his grandson Steven Jr. who is now a Missouri Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  Perhaps the best measure of Rush Hudson Limbaugh' legacy as a lawyer \nand as a human being comes from the praise and admiration of his peers \nin the legal community. ``A top notch all-around lawyer; the epitome of \nwhat a lawyer ought to be said one colleague. ``A legend in his time,'' \nsaid another.\n  However, his grandson Steven may have offered the best possible \ndescription of this great citizen: ``He was an extraordinary man, \nexemplary in every way, yet very humble. He was a lawyer's lawyer, a \ncommunity servant and a gentle and kind man whose family was the very \ncenter of his life.''\n  It is only fitting that the new Federal courthouse in Cape Girardeau, \nMissouri be named after this great hero of American Jurisprudence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 247\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. RUSH HUDSON LIMBAUGH, SR. UNITED STATES \n                   COURTHOUSE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The United States courthouse located at \n     555 Independence Street, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, shall be \n     known and designated as the ``Rush Hudson Limbaugh, Sr. \n     United States Courthouse''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     United States courthouse referred to in subsection (a) shall \n     be deemed to be a reference to the ``Rush Hudson Limbaugh, \n     Sr. United States Courthouse''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 248. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend and modify the work opportunity credit, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. President, I am pleased to join my Colleague, Senator \nSnowe, in introducing legislation to improve and permanently extend the \nWork Opportunity and the Welfare-to-Work tax credits. Last year, I was \npleased to help enact legislation that consolidated, streamlined, and \nextended these credits through the end of 2007. Now it is time to make \nthese tax credits permanent.\n  The current extension expires at the end of this year. So immediate \naction is needed to make these credits permanent and make several \nimprovements to the programs to improve their effectiveness. Recurring \nlapses and extensions make administration of this credit burdensome \nboth for the taxpaying employer, who cannot keep track of who is or is \nnot qualified, and for the IRS, which needs to ensure that taxpayers \nare complying with the ever-shifting law. Last year, the program lapsed \nuntil late December, when Congress finally passed a retroactive \nextension.\n  Over the past decade, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, WOTC, and the \nWelfare-to-Work credits have helped more than 2.2 million public \nassistance dependent individuals to enter the workforce. These hiring \ntax incentives have demonstrated their effectiveness. They help to \nlevel the job selection playing field for low-skilled individuals. They \nprovide employers with additional resources to help recruit, select, \ntrain and retain individuals with significant barriers to work. Many \nvulnerable individuals still need a boost in finding employment. And \nthis is particularly important during periods of high unemployment. \nWithout an extension of these programs, the task of transitioning from \nwelfare-to-work will become even harder for individuals who reach their \nwelfare eligibility ceiling.\n  Because of the costs involved in setting up and administering a WOTC \nand Welfare-to-Work program, employers have established massive \noutreach programs to maximize the number of eligible persons in their \nhiring pool. The States, in turn, have steadily improved the programs \nthrough improved administration. WOTC has become an example of a true \npublic-private partnership design to assist the most needy applicants. \nWithout the additional resources provided by these hiring tax \nincentives, few employers would actively seek out this hard-to-employ \npopulation.\n  The new combined WOTC and Welfare-to-Work credits provide employers \nwith a graduated tax credit equal to 25 percent of the first $6,000 in \nwages for eligible individuals working between 120 hours and 399 hours \nand a 40-percent tax credit on the first $6,000 in wages for those \nworking more than 400 hours. In the category of longterm welfare \nrecipients, employers receive a maximum credit of $4,000, or 40 percent \nof qualified first year wages up to $10,000. Employers receive a \nmaximum credit of $5,000, or 50 percent of qualified wages up to \n$10,000, for retaining for a second year individuals in the long-term \nwelfare assistance category.\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\n  In my home State of Montana, many businesses take advantage of this \nprogram, including large multinational firms and smaller family-owned \nbusinesses. Those who truly benefit from the WOTC and Welfare-to-Work \nprogram, however, are low-income families under the Food Stamp Program, \nthe Aid to Families with Dependent Children, AFDC, and Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families, TANF, programs, and also low income U.S. \nVeterans. In Montana, more than 1,000 people were certified as eligible \nunder the WOTC program during an 18-month period, October 2001 through \nMarch 2003, including 476 Food Stamp recipients, 475 AFDC or TANF \nrecipients, and 52 U.S. veterans.\n  The bill that we are introducing today provides for a permanent \nprogram extension of the combined credits. After a decade of experience \nwith WOTC and Welfare-to- Work, we know that employers do respond to \nthese important hiring tax incentives. Permanent extension would \nprovide these programs with greater stability, thereby encouraging more \nemployers to participate, make investments in expanding outreach to \nidentify potential workers from the targeted groups, and avoid the \nwasteful disruption of termination and renewal. A permanent extension \nwould also encourage the state job services to invest the resources \nneeded to make the certification process more efficient and employer-\nfriendly.\n  Finally, there are other changes in the bill that would extend these \nbenefits to more people and help them find work. One change would \nincrease the age of eligibility for those individuals seeking work who \nreside in enterprise zones or empowerment communities. Another change \nwould include referrals from the Ticket to Work program in the \nVocational Rehabilitation category. These two changes are modest \nimprovements to the program.\n  Further, this bill adds a new subcategory with an enhanced credit for \nemployers who hire veterans with service-connected disabilities \noccurring on or after September 11, 2001. As of July 2006, nearly \n20,000 members of our Armed Forces were wounded in action in Operation \nIraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. Many of these veterans \nare now permanently disabled. Of these brave men and women who have \nbeen wounded, nearly 5,000 are members of the National Guard and \nReserves. Our National Guard and Reserves are carrying a huge burden in \nour current conflicts abroad.\n  Many of these wounded veterans come from rural States such as my home \nState of Montana. In Montana, we have the highest proportion of \nveterans per capita of any state. According to the most recent census, \nveterans account for nearly one out of every six people in Montana. And \nveterans and families of veterans constitute a significant portion of \nthe population in rural states throughout the country.\n  When not deployed, many National Guardsmen and reservists in Montana \nsupport their families with second and even third jobs. At any time, \nthey can be deployed overseas, to our borders, or even to aid with \nnational disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires. If they are \ninjured or disabled, however, many become unable to perform the jobs \nthat they did before deployment. They will need to transition into a \nnew job or career. It is our duty to provide the proper means for \nveterans to make that transition. It is our duty to help them to live \nas independent citizens.\n  Since August 2002, the share of veterans collecting unemployment \ninsurance has nearly doubled. During any given year, half a million \nveterans across the Nation experience homelessness. We are not \nproviding enough resources for veterans looking for work. We are too \noften failing our injured and our disabled veterans.\n  Many seriously injured and disabled veterans simply do not know what \nthey are going to do once they return home. We need to help these young \nmen and women. And a modest tax incentive to get them back into the \nworkforce is one place to start.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Snowe to get a permanent work \nincentive for these individuals. And I encourage our Colleagues to join \nus in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 249. A bill to permit the National Football League to restrict the \nmovement of its franchises, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last November, John York, the owner of \nthe San Francisco 49ers, announced his intention to move the team to \nSanta Clara.\n  The 49ers have been an integral part of San Francisco for the past 60 \nyears. The team was founded in 1946 as part of the All-American \nFootball Conference and joined the National Football League in 1950, \nwhen the two leagues merged.\n  The team's name is derived from the city's history, celebrating the \nminers who rushed to San Francisco in search of gold in 1849 and helped \nbuild the city.\n  The team has been a part of San Francisco for so long, and is such a \ncentral part of its culture, that the prospect of the team leaving \nconcerns many of the people of San Francisco.\n  In response, I am introducing the Football Fairness Act that provides \na new and limited antitrust exemption that is designed to slow the \nfrequent movement of National Football League teams and prevent \ncommunities from suffering the financial and intangible costs of these \nmoves.\n  As Mayor of San Francisco, I had the pleasure of witnessing several \n49ers' Super Bowl victory parades.\n  What I remember most about those victories is the way the team's \nsuccess brought the city together. I've also seen other cities unite in \ncelebration of their teams' championships.\n  Our football teams are more than just businesses. They are a common \ndenominator that cut across class, race, and gender to bond the people \nof a city. They are a key component of a city's culture and identity.\n  There are instances where a city cannot support a team, but it is \ndisheartening when a city that can--and does--support a team is \nnevertheless abandoned and the loyalty of the fans discarded.\n  In 1985, then 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo explored the possibility of \nmoving the team to San Jose. As Mayor of San Francisco, I worked with \nthe 49ers and we were able to reach an agreement to keep the team in \nSan Francisco.\n  Today, I remain hopeful that an agreement to keep the team will be \nreached that will benefit the people of San Francisco and the 49ers' \norganization.\n  However, this situation highlights a broader trend of NFL teams \nabandoning cities after those communities invested substantial funds \nand good will into a team.\n  This persistent movement is bad for our cities.\n  In the last 25 years, National Football League teams have moved 7 \ntimes: Oakland Raiders to Los Angeles in 1982, Baltimore Colts to \nIndianapolis in 1984, St. Louis Cardinals to Tempe in 1988, Los Angeles \nRams to St. Louis in 1994, Los Angeles Raiders to Oakland in 1994, \nCleveland Browns to Baltimore in 1996, and Houston Oilers to Nashville \nin 1997.\n  However, during that same time period only 1 Major League Baseball \nfranchise moved. In 2004, with the approval of Major League Baseball, \nthe Montreal Expos became the Washington Nationals.\n  Why has there been stability in baseball, while National Football \nLeague teams have moved so frequently?\n  Unlike the NFL, Major League Baseball has an antitrust exemption \nwhich gives the league and its owners control over the movement of its \nteams.\n  When the Oakland Raiders sought to relocate to Los Angeles in 1982, \nthe National Football League's owners voted to prevent the move. \nHowever, the courts found that the NFL's intervention was a violation \nof antitrust laws, and the League could do nothing to prevent the \nRaiders from moving.\n  Just 12 years later, the Raiders left Los Angeles to return to the \nsame city and stadium it had abandoned.\n  If a city is incapable of supporting a team, it is understandable \nthat a franchise would move. However, of the six cities that have seen \nNational Football League teams leave in the last 25 years, five of \nthose cities later received another NFL franchise.\n  It is clear that NFL teams are not moving because cities cannot \nsupport teams.\n  To address the real costs imposed on communities by the persistent \nand unnecessary franchise movement that we\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\nhave witnessed, I am introducing the Football Fairness Act.\n  The Football Fairness Act is straightforward and it is limited.\n  It would permit the National Football League to review and restrict \nits teams' movement. This should help keep the fans who support the NFL \nfrom being left out of the equation.\n  The Act is targeted. It limits the exemption from antitrust laws \nsolely to the National Football League's ability to prevent the \nmovement of its franchises. Consequently, the Act will not diminish \ncompetition.\n  I urge my colleague to support the Football Fairness Act and help \nprevent the damage done to fans and communities by frequent NFL \nfranchise movement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 249\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Football Fairness Act of \n     2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) National Football League teams foster a strong local \n     identity with the people of the cities and regions in which \n     they are located, providing a source of civic pride for their \n     supporters;\n       (2) National Football League teams provide employment \n     opportunities, revenues, and a valuable form of entertainment \n     for the cities and regions in which they are located;\n       (3) there are significant public investments associated \n     with National Football League facilities;\n       (4) it is in the public interest to encourage the National \n     Football League to operate under policies that promote \n     stability among its member teams and to promote the equitable \n     resolution of disputes arising from the proposed relocation \n     of National Football League teams; and\n       (5) National Football League teams travel in interstate to \n     compete and utilize materials shipped in interstate commerce, \n     and National Football League games are broadcast nationally.\n\n     SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF ANTITRUST LAWS RELATED TO \n                   RELOCATION.\n\n       It shall not be unlawful by reason of any provision of the \n     antitrust laws for the National Football League to enforce \n     rules authorizing the membership of the league to decide that \n     a member club of such league shall not be relocated.\n\n     SEC. 4. INAPPLICABILITY TO CERTAIN MATTERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Nothing contained in this Act shall--\n       (1) alter, determine, or otherwise affect the applicability \n     or inapplicability of the antitrust laws, the labor laws, or \n     any other provision of law relating to the wages, hours, or \n     other terms and conditions of employment of players in the \n     National Football League, to any employment matter regarding \n     players in the National Football League, or to any collective \n     bargaining rights and privilege of any player union in the \n     National Football League;\n       (2) alter or affect the applicability or inapplicability of \n     the antitrust laws or any applicable Federal or State law \n     relating to broadcasting or telecasting, including section 1 \n     of Public Law 87-331 (15 U.S.C. 1291), any agreement between \n     the National Football League or its member teams, and any \n     person not affiliated with the National Football League for \n     the broadcasting or telecasting of the games of the National \n     Football League or its member teams on any form of \n     television;\n       (3) affect any contract, or provision of a contract, \n     relating to the use of a stadium or arena between a member \n     team and the owner or operator of any stadium or arena or any \n     other person;\n       (4) exempt from the antitrust laws any agreement to fix the \n     prices of admission to National Football League games;\n       (5) exempt from the antitrust laws any predatory practice \n     or other conduct with respect to competing sports leagues \n     that would otherwise be unlawful under the antitrust laws; or\n       (6) except as provided in this Act, alter, determine, or \n     otherwise affect the applicability or inapplicability of the \n     antitrust laws to any act, contract, agreement, rule, course \n     of conduct, or other activity by, between, or among persons \n     engaging in, conducting, or participating in professional \n     football.\n       (b) Antitrust Laws.--As used in this section, the term \n     ``antitrust laws'' has the meaning given to such term in the \n     first section of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12) and in the \n     Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 250. A bill to reduce the costs of prescription drugs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries and to guarantee access to comprehensive prescription \ndrug coverage under part D of the Medicare program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague and friend \nSenator Ron Wyden, to introduce legislation which we have sponsored \nsince 2004 to ensure the sound fiscal management of our Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. Together we both supported the enactment of \nthe Medicare Modernization Act in 2003 (MMA), and we remain committed \nto seeing our seniors able to rely on a high quality, affordable \nbenefit.\n  Today millions of American seniors are at last receiving assistance \nwith the high cost of prescription drugs. For so many, that will make a \ndifference between choosing whether to take needed medications and the \nother necessities of life. We have indeed come a very long way. We look \nforward to realizing all the incredible benefits of this coverage as we \nsee the results of more affordable access to prescription drugs--better \nhealth for our seniors, and substantial health care savings.\n  This new benefit marks a milestone for Medicare. And that is an apt \nanalogy because today Part D represents a landmark, not a destination. \nThere is no doubt that this benefit is not all it could or should be, \nbut it is a giant step forward in helping millions of seniors to afford \nmedications which are so essential to health care today. For modem \ndrugs not only treat disease, but actually can prevent its development.\n  While we have seen this landmark progress, it has not come without \ndifficulty. Yet today seniors are saving substantially on their \nprescription drugs and we see reports that four of five enrollees are \npleased with the assistance they are receiving.\n  It is undoubtedly the help they are getting which has resulted in \nsuch satisfaction. Because the confusion, the complexity, and often a \nlack of oversight on the plans has created some serious consumer issues \nwhich we will continue to address. But today the first issue before us \nis the cost of prescription drugs in the plans.\n  Over 3 years ago the Congress was given a price tag for this benefit \nthat was simply unrealistic. Recognizing an absence of cost management, \nI joined with Senator Wyden to address the escalating cost projections \nwe were seeing. Today, some say all is well, as we hear that the \nestimated cost of the benefit declined somewhat from a peak estimate of \nabout $720 billion over 10 years. Yet I must note that some of the \nreasons for that reduction are too quickly glossed over. Enrollment is \nlower than it was estimated to be as more Americans chose to stay in \nprivate coverage. We also saw this past year that we failed to reach \nmany of those low income seniors who most needed help. Today as seniors \nenter their first full year of coverage, we will see a more realistic \nyear--particularly in terms of more beneficiaries facing the donut \nhole.\n  We have heard estimates that the average senior is saving an average \nof $1,000 per year, but we should ask how that savings is being \nachieved. The discovery by many seniors--when they reached the donut \nhole--that their cost of medications was the same or even higher than \nwhat they paid prior to enrolling in Part D--that should be a red flag \nthat we may not be seeing the purchasing power of seniors harnessed for \nthe savings they deserve.\n\n  Back in 2005 the Medicare Actuary had estimated that drug plans would \nnegotiate a discount of about 15 percent off undiscounted retail \nprices. So last year we were curious--just how were they doing in \nMaine? My staff compared prices for the top 24 medications used by \nseniors and found that our plan prices for those medications averaged \nless than 12 percent below the price any senior could already obtain, \nby simply walking into a retail pharmacy. That is not even using \nmembership or association discounts, or using an on-line pharmacy like \nDrugstore.com--where seniors could obtain better prices. That result--\nfinding a single senior could do better than a plan--is certainly \ndisappointing.\n  That points to a system that is working well in terms of subsidy, but \ncertainly needs to improve in terms of negotiating substantial \ndiscounts. But we are told that the cost of the benefit is lower, and \nthat premiums were stable this year. Yet if you ask what stand-alone \ndrug coverage actually costs this\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\nyear, CMS will tell you that those premiums have gone up about 10 \npercent. Not unlike increases in the deductible, the size of the donut \nhole, and out-of-pocket expense. As Senator Wyden and I learned from \nGAO reports we have received, the prices of drugs used by seniors have \ninexorably increased since 2000 at two to three times the inflation \nrate.\n  So the costs of this program will remain a concern. Most of us \nenvisioned that not only would the taxpayer contribute to helping \nseniors with drug expenses, but we would realize substantial savings \nfrom lower prices on prescription drugs.\n  That is why Senator Wyden and I proposed to achieve some balance in \nthe public private partnership which is Part D today, and it is why \ntoday we are again introducing the Medicare Enhancements for Needed \nDrugs Act--the MEND Act. In this drug benefit the HHS Secretary should \nhave a proper role in negotiation. Negotiation, not price setting.\n  It is clear that what the Congress intended to do was to create a \ntrue public-private partnership, utilizing competitive forces to bring \nmore choices to seniors--in drugs, benefit plan designs, pharmacies, \nand more. So seniors can vote with their pocketbooks, and we can see \ntheir choices in the market influence the kind of benefit they receive. \nThat is not the same as a system in which the government sets prices, \nand that is why our legislation specifically bans such a practice. \nUnder our legislation, the Federal Government cannot set either prices \nor formularies--that is absolutely clear.\n  What I believe most of us desire to do is give the present system the \nbest tools to achieve success. That means that the Secretary must have \nan oversight role. He should be examining performance and pointing out \nwhere plans need to improve. But today if he noticed a product on which \npoor discounts were being achieved, and he attempted to discuss that \npublicly, he would likely be accused of interference. Further, if a \nplan reported intransigence in trying to negotiate with a manufacturer, \nthe Secretary could not respond. That makes no sense. It is a \ndisservice taxpayers, beneficiaries, and the plans as well.\n  Our legislation rescinds the ``non-interference'' clause and directs \nthe Secretary to negotiate for any necessary fallback plan, and in \naddition, to respond to requests for help from plans which cannot \nobtain reasonable negotiation.\n  We have also added two additional areas in which the Secretary must \nnegotiate. First, as the CBO has stated that negotiation of single-\nsource drugs could yield savings, our legislation directs the Secretary \nto engage in negotiation regarding those unique products. We also know \nthat some drugs exist because the taxpayer provides substantial support \nto see them developed. The public deserves a fair price on those \nproducts it made possible, so the Secretary should weigh in those \ncases.\n  Finally, our bill protects beneficiaries by assuring that seniors \nwill have access to a comprehensive coverage option--at least one plan \nin each region must provide the option to avoid the coverage gap, \ndreaded ``donut hole''. Today seniors in 11 States simply cannot obtain \nsuch coverage and they must at least have the option of protecting \nthemselves.\n  These are reasonable ways to help plans succeed, and to protect both \nbeneficiaries and taxpayers within the public-private partnership on \nwhich this benefit rests.\n  I call on my colleagues to join us in this effort, so that we may \nimprove the partnership between private enterprise and the Federal \nGovernment in serving our seniors.\n  I ask consent that the bill's text be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 250\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, Senator Snowe and I said we would work to \nimprove the Medicare Part D benefit ever since we voted for its \npassage. Senator Snowe and I think one of the most egregious errors in \nthe Medicare drug benefit was to write into law that the Secretary \ncannot have bargaining power under any circumstances. That is why today \nwe are introducing the Medicare Enhancements for Needed Drugs Act of \n2007. This legislation lifts the prohibition on bargaining power and \nrequires the Secretary to negotiate on behalf of seniors.\n  We believed that one of the most important things missing from the \nPart D benefit was cost containment--and allowing Medicare to negotiate \nfor drug prices would be an important cost containment measure. Our \nlegislation clearly prohibits price setting or the creation of a \nuniform formulary. What our legislation allows Medicare to do is to be \na smart shopper--just as any consumer would be--by allowing Medicare to \ngo in the market and use its clout just like any other big purchaser.\n  Under our proposal, the Secretary could negotiate in any \ncircumstance, but must negotiate in several instances: for single \nsource drugs for which there is no therapeutic equivalent; drugs for \nwhich taxpayer funding was substantial in its research and development; \nand for any fallback plan the Secretary must provide. In addition, our \nlegislation requires the Secretary to provide a fallback plan if there \nis not comprehensive coverage, including coverage for the so-called \ndonut hole, available in a region.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has stated there might be savings \nachieved if the Secretary could negotiate for single source drugs for \nwhich there is no therapeutic equivalent. To be good stewards of \ntaxpayer dollars, to be able to strengthen the program and to help \nseniors truly save, we must look toward using every logical tool to \nlower costs. Not to try to achieve lower prices in areas identified as \npotentially saving the program, taxpayers and seniors would be foolish.\n  I don't know of a single private entity, whether it's a timber \ncompany in my home State of Oregon, or a big auto company, who when \nthey're buying something in bulk doesn't say, hey pal, how about a \ndiscount? So why shouldn't Medicare, if it needs to negotiate, have \nthat authority just in case? Why wouldn't we want to assure that \nMedicare can be a smart shopper?\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as the Senate Finance \nCommittee works on this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 252. A bill to repeal the provision of law that provides automatic \npay adjustments for Members of Congress; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce legislation \nthat would put an end to automatic pay raises for Members of Congress.\n  As I have noted when I raised this issue in past years, Congress has \nthe authority to raise its own pay, something that most of our \nconstituents cannot do. Because this is such a singular power, Congress \nought to exercise it openly, and subject to regular procedures \nincluding debate, amendment, and a vote on the record.\n  But current law allows Congress to avoid that public debate and vote. \nAll that is necessary for Congress to get a pay raise is that nothing \nbe done to stop it. The annual pay raise takes effect unless Congress \nacts.\n  This stealth pay raise mechanism began with a change Congress enacted \nin the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. In section 704 of that Act, Members \nof Congress voted to make themselves entitled to an annual raise equal \nto half a percentage point less than the employment cost index, one \nmeasure of inflation.\n  On occasion, Congress has voted to deny itself the raise, and the \ntraditional vehicle for the pay raise vote is the Treasury \nappropriations bill. But that vehicle is not always made available to \nthose who want a public debate and vote on the matter. Just last year, \nfor example, the Senate did not consider the Treasury appropriations \nbill. Instead, we passed a series of continuing resolutions to fund \ngovernment operations usually addressed in that bill and other \nappropriations bills that were not taken up. Because of that, Senators \nwere effectively prevented from offering an amendment to force an up or \ndown vote on the annual pay raise. And that situation was not unique.\n  As I have noted in the past, getting a vote on the annual \ncongressional pay raise is a haphazard affair at best, and it should \nnot be that way. The burden should not be on those who seek a public \ndebate and recorded vote on the Member pay raise. On the contrary, \nCongress should have to act if it decides to award itself a hike in \npay. This process of pay raises without accountability must end.\n  This issue is not a new question. It was something that our Founders \nconsidered from the beginning of our Nation. In August of 1789, as part \nof the package of 12 amendments advocated by James Madison that \nincluded what has become our Bill of Rights, the House of \nRepresentatives passed an amendment to the Constitution providing that \nCongress could not raise its pay without an intervening election. On \nSeptember 9, 1789, the Senate passed that amendment. In late September \nof 1789, Congress submitted the amendments to the States.\n  Although the amendment on pay raises languished for two centuries, in \nthe 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the \nWisconsin State Senate, I was proud to help ratify the amendment. Its \napproval by the Michigan legislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed \napproval by three-fourths of the States.\n  The 27th Amendment to the Constitution now states: ``No law, varying \nthe compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, \nshall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have \nintervened.''\n  I honor that limitation. Throughout my 6-year term, I accept only the \nrate of pay that Senators receive on the date on which I was sworn in \nas a Senator. And I return to the Treasury any additional income \nSenators get, whether from a cost-of-living adjustment or a pay raise \nwe vote for ourselves. I don't take a raise until my bosses, the people \nof Wisconsin, give me one at the ballot box. That is the spirit of the \n27th Amendment. The stealth pay raises like the one that Congress \nallowed for 2006 certainly violate the spirit of that amendment at the \nvery least.\n  This practice must end and this bill will end it. Senators and \nCongressmen should have to vote up-or-down to raise Congressional pay, \nand my bill would require just that. We owe our constituents nothing \nless.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 252\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to permit the cancellation of certain loans under the \nRobert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to introduce \nthe Disaster Loan Fairness Act of 2007. This legislation strikes \nprovisions contained in the Community Disaster Loan Act of 2005 and the \nEmergency Supplemental spending bill for hurricane relief, which \nprohibited forgiveness of Special Community Disaster Loans authorized \nin those measures.\n  Section 417 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \nAssistance Act requires forgiveness of a loan if an independent audit \ndetermines that its recipient cannot sustain its repayment obligations \nafter a 3-year grace period. The statute recognizes the very real \npossibility that hard-hit communities may need to be excused from \nrepayment. For the first time in the history of the program though, \nforgiveness was specifically prohibited by the Community Disaster Loan \nAct of 2005. These were the strictest terms ever required. Clamping \ndown in the wake of the worst disaster in history did not make sense at \nthe time, and it does not make sense now.\n  In the last Congress, I introduced S. 1872, which eliminated this \nprovision governing the first round of loans authorized in October of \n2005. Louisiana applicants received about $739 million in this first \nround. This bill accomplishes that same objective, and also strikes \nforgiveness restrictions attached to a second round of loans authorized \nin June of 2006, through which Louisianans received about $261 million \nin Orleans, St. Bernard, and St. Tammany Parishes. These recipients in \nthe second round included sheriffs, fire districts, levee districts, \nschool boards, sewage and water boards, port harbor and terminal \nauthorities, regional transit authorities and parish governments.\n\n  Essential operational expenditures must be made to facilitate \nrecovery in the wake of a disaster, including services like police, \nfire protection, transit and sanitation. One of the great ironies of \nthe Community Disaster Loan Program is the fact that it exists largely \nto supplement shortcomings in the Stafford Act. Between 1970 and 1974, \nthe program was administered as a grant program before the Stafford Act \nconverted it to a loan program. FEMA will not reimburse emergency \nresponders for their straight-time salaries, and a large portion of \nthese loans were needed for payroll expenses to essential employees.\n  This bill does not necessarily forgive all loans made to hurricane-\naffected communities. Communities must apply for cancellation, and \nforgiveness is only permitted when an independent review of a city's \nfiscal health finds justification to cancel the debt. Even then, \ncommunities must still repay loan funds used for capital improvements, \ndebt servicing, assessments, intragovernmental services, cost-sharing \nand otherwise reimbursable activities. It is also important to remember \nthat the size of the loans has been limited to a proportion of the \ncommunity's operating budget since these programs were first \nauthorized.\n  The majority of disaster loans have been repaid, and the program is \nused only by areas that have suffered a major disaster. In 29 years, \nthe program has only received 64 applications associated with 21 \ndisasters. Compared to 1,104 disasters declared in total, that is a \nvery small proportion. There were no loans issued under this authority \nfor 6 years prior to FY 2005. These figures indicate that this program \nhas not been abused by jurisdictions that could do without the funds. \nProgram administrators and independent auditors have found cause to \ncancel 93 percent of loan funding distributed to hard-hit areas over \nthe years, but this represents the inevitable fact that disasters can \nbe catastrophic, and areas requiring significant help are less likely \nto be whole again after only 3 years.\n  The City of New Orleans was forced to lay off 3,000 people--over 80 \npercent of its workforce. Let us act now to ensure that other cities \nare not forced to follow, by giving a break to disaster loan recipients \nwho prove unable to repay their debt. They will still have 3 years to \ntry, and some may succeed, but we must adjust to the reality of the \nsituation. It is time we relieve Gulf Coast communities of the burdens \nthey were forced to shoulder in order to keep police cars, fire trucks \nand sanitation trucks rolling, reopen schools and bring cities back to \nlife by getting things working.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide assistance to the State of New Mexico for \nthe development of comprehensive State water plans, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, water is the life's blood for New \nMexico. When the water dries up in New Mexico, so will many of its \ncommunities. As such, the scarcity of water in New Mexico is a dire \nsituation. Unfortunately, the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer \n(NM OSE) lacks the tools necessary to undertake the Herculean task of \neffectively managing New Mexico's water resources.\n  Today, I introduce legislation that would allow New Mexico to make \ninformed decisions about its limited water resources.\n  In order to effectively perform water rights administration, as well \nas comply with New Mexico's compact deliveries, the State Engineer is \nstatutorily required to perform assessments and investigations of the \nnumerous stream systems and ground water basins located within New \nMexico. However, the NM OSE is ill equipped to vigorously and \ncomprehensively undertake the daunting but critically important task of \nwater resource planning. At present, the NM OSE lacks adequate \nresources to perform necessary hydrographic surveys and data \ncollection. As such, ensuring a future water supply for my home state \nrequires that Congress provide the NM OSE with the resources necessary \nto fulfill its statutory mandate.\n  The bill I introduce today would create a standing authority for the \nState of New Mexico to seek and receive technical assistance from the \nBureau of Rec1amation and the United States Geological Survey. It would \nalso provide the NM OSE the sum of $12.5 million in federal assistance \nto perform hydrologic models of New Mexico's most important water \nsystems. This bill would provide the NM OSE with the best resources \navailable when making crucial decisions about how best preserve our \nlimited water stores.\n  Ever decreasing water supplies in New Mexico have reached critical \nleve1s and require immediate action. The Congress cannot sit idly by as \nwater shortages cause death to New\n\n[[Page S394]]\n\nMexico's communities. I hope the Senate will give this legislation its \nevery consideration. I thank Senator Bingaman, Chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee for cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 255\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 22\n\n       Whereas all Americans depend on the United States Postal \n     Service to transact business and communicate with friends and \n     family;\n       Whereas postal customers have a constitutional right to \n     expect that their sealed domestic mail will be protected \n     against unreasonable searches;\n       Whereas the circumstances and procedures under which the \n     Government may search sealed mail are well defined, including \n     provisions under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n     1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.), and generally require prior \n     judicial approval;\n       Whereas the United States Postal Inspection Service has the \n     authority to open and search a sealed envelope or package \n     when there is immediate threat to life or limb or an \n     immediate and substantial danger to property;\n       Whereas the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act \n     (Public Law 109-435) expressly reaffirmed the right of postal \n     customers to have access to a class of mail sealed against \n     inspection;\n       Whereas the United States Postal Service affirmed January \n     4, 2007, that the enactment of the Postal Accountability and \n     Enhancement Act (Public Law 109-435) does not grant Federal \n     law enforcement officials any new authority to open domestic \n     mail;\n       Whereas the signing statement on the Postal Accountability \n     and Enhancement Act (Public Law 109-435) issued by President \n     Bush on December 20, 2006, raises questions about the \n     President's commitment to abide by these basic privacy \n     protections; and\n       Whereas the Senate rejects any interpretation of the \n     President's signing statement on the Postal Accountability \n     and Enhancement Act (Public Law 109-435) that in any way \n     diminishes the privacy protections accorded sealed domestic \n     mail under the Constitution and Federal laws and regulations:\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate reaffirms the constitutional and \n     statutory protections accorded sealed domestic mail.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate \nresolution that will reaffirm the fundamental constitutional and \nstatutory protections accorded sealed domestic mail. I am very pleased \nto have the distinguished chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nand Homeland Security Committee, Senator Lieberman, as a cosponsor, \nSenator Carper, who was the author of the postal reform bill with me in \nthe last Congress, Senator Coleman, and Senator Akaka, all of whom have \nbeen very active on postal issues.\n  On December 20, President Bush signed into law the Postal \nAccountability and Enhancement Act that Senator Carper and I originally \nintroduced in 2004. This new law represents the most sweeping reforms \nto the U.S. Postal Service in more than 30 years.\n  The Presiding Officer and new chairman of the committee knows well \nthat of all the legislation our committee produced last year, in many \nways this was the most difficult to bring to completion.\n  The act, which will help the 225-year-old Postal Service, meets the \nchallenges of the 21st century, establishes a new rate-setting system, \nhelps ensure a stronger financial future for the Postal Service, \nprovides more stability and predictability in rates, and protects the \nbasic feature of universal service. One of the act's many provisions \nprovides continued authority for the Postal Service to establish a \nclass of mail sealed against inspection.\n  The day President Bush signed the Postal Reform Act into law, he also \nissued a signing statement construing that particular provision to \npermit ``searches in exigent circumstances, such as to protect human \nlife and safety.'' While I understand that the President's spokesman \nhas explained that the signing statement did not intend to change the \nscope of this new law, it has resulted in considerable confusion and \nwidespread concern about the President's commitment to abide by the \nbasic privacy protections afforded sealed domestic mail. For some, it \nraised the specter of the Government unlawfully monitoring our mail in \nthe name of national security.\n  Given this unfortunate perception, I wish to be very clear as the \nauthor of this legislation. Nothing in the Postal Reform Act, nor in \nthe President's signing statement, alters in any way\n\n[[Page S395]]\n\nthe privacy and civil liberty protections provided to a person who \nsends or receives sealed mail. In fact, the President's signing \nstatement appears to do nothing more than restate current law, but by \nthe mere act of issuing the signing statement, unfortunately, the \nadministration raised questions about what, in fact, is their intent.\n  Under current law, mail sealed against inspection is entitled to the \nstrongest possible protections against physical searches, the \nprotections afforded by our Constitution which guard against \nunreasonable searches. With only limited exceptions, the Government \nneeds a warrant issued by a court before it can search sealed mail. \nThis is true whether the search is conducted under our Criminal Code to \nobtain evidence of a crime or under the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act, FISA, of 1978 to collect foreign intelligence \ninformation concerning a national security threat. Only when there is \nan immediate danger to life or limb or an immediate and substantial \ndanger to property can the Government search a domestic sealed letter \nor package without a warrant. Let me give a couple of examples. That \ncould occur when there are wires protruding from a package, for \nexample, or odors escaping from an envelope or stains on the outside of \na package indicating that the contents may constitute an immediate \ndanger or threat.\n  Americans depend on the U.S. Postal Service to transact business and \nto communicate with friends and family, and if there is any doubt in \nthe public's mind that the Government is not protecting the \nconstitutional privacy accorded their mail, if there is suspicion that \nthe Government is unlawfully opening mail, then our Nation's confidence \nin the sanctity of our mail system and, indeed, in our Government will \nbe eroded. That is precisely why I am joining with my colleagues in \nsubmitting this resolution today. It makes clear to all law-abiding \nAmericans that the Federal Government will not invade their privacy by \nreading their sealed mail absent a court order or emergency \ncircumstances. Any contrary interpretation of the Postal Reform Act is \njust plain wrong.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this resolution \nwhich reaffirms the constitutional and statutory protections accorded \nto domestic sealed mail. I say to the Presiding Officer, the chairman \nof the committee with jurisdiction over this matter, that I hope we can \nact very quickly and get this resolution approved by the full Senate. I \nbelieve it is important that we go on record without any delay to \nassure the American people that those protections which they value so \nmuch are still in place and have not been altered, given the doubt that \nthe President's signing statement created.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/01/10/senate-section/article/S395-1", "month": "01", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 9.
