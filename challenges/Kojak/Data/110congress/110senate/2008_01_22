Mr. President, with a new year we welcome the newest \nSenator, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, to the 110th Congress. With the \nresignation of our friend, Trent Lott, the former Republican whip, \nGovernor Haley Barbour has appointed Senator Wicker to fill the \nremainder of his term. He could not have made a finer choice.\n  Senator Wicker may be new to this Chamber, but he is no stranger to \nserving the people of Mississippi and the Nation. The son of a \nMississippi State senator and circuit judge, public service has long \nbeen his life's calling.\n  It all began with his service as a House page in 1967 to \nRepresentative Jamie Whitten, the man he would one day succeed in the \nHouse of Representatives. Senator Wicker is one of the few people in \nhistory to have served as a House page for the Congressman he \neventually replaced.\n  His first stint of public service left him wanting more. He served \nhis country in the Air Force and retired from the Air Force Reserves in \n2004 with the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n  He returned to the Hill in 1980 as a staffer to then-Representative \nTrent Lott, a man he would come to know very well. In fact, Senator \nWicker has known and worked with both Senators Cochran and Lott for \nmany years.\n  In fact, he and Senator Cochran were both born in the Mississippi \ntown of----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Pontotoc.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Pontotoc. I wanted to make sure I got that right. I am \nsure Senator Wicker's friendship with both of these men will only \nbenefit him as he takes up his new office.\n  In 1987, at age 36, Senator Wicker was the first Republican ever \nelected to the Mississippi State senate from northern Mississippi since \nReconstruction. In 1994, he was elected to the U.S.\n\n[[Page S14]]\n\nHouse to succeed Jamie Whitten, ending over 53 years of Democratic \npossession of that seat. Senator Wicker quickly became one of the stars \nof the House freshman class of 1994. He was elected the president of \nthat class. He won a seat on the powerful Appropriations Committee, and \nhe served on the leadership team as a deputy whip.\n  Around this time, Senator Wicker also gained a keen understanding of \nhow to handle the press attention that goes with being a Member of \nCongress. Allow me to share with my colleagues a brief story to \nillustrate.\n  It was 3 days after the historic election of 1994 which gave the \nRepublicans control of the House of Representatives for the first time \nin 40 years. Naturally, the 73 Members of the 1994 freshman class--one \nof the largest ever--were getting a lot of media attention.\n  So early that morning, Roger Wicker, the newly elected Congressman, \nwas shaving. Suddenly his daughter burst in and breathlessly yelled, \n``Dad, it's Time magazine on the phone.''\n  This was an important moment. So Congressman Wicker calmly wiped the \nshaving cream off his face and gathered his thoughts. Then he strode \npurposefully into the den and picked up the phone.\n  ``Hello, this is Roger Wicker,'' he said, in his most congressional \nvoice. The voice at the other end of the line responded, ``Mr. Wicker, \nthis is Time magazine calling. For only a $19.95 annual subscription . \n. .''\n  Senator Wicker will surely have some Members of the press who want to \ntalk to him today, and I doubt they will try to sell him magazine \nsubscriptions. Today, Senator Wicker is the story.\n  Senator Wicker, welcome to the U.S. Senate. With a seat in this \nChamber, you not only have a unique view of history but a unique \nopportunity to shape that history for the betterment of the people of \nMississippi and of your country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S14-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 419) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 419\n\n       Whereas the Senate has heard with profound sorrow and deep \n     regret of the untimely death of Diane Wolf, a member of the \n     Senate Preservation Board of Trustees and a former \n     distinguished member of the United States Commission of Fine \n     Arts; and\n       Whereas for over 2 decades Diane Wolf devoted extraordinary \n     personal efforts to and displayed great passion for the \n     preservation and restoration of the United States Capitol \n     Building, and was singularly instrumental in supporting and \n     guiding the early efforts of the United States Capitol \n     Preservation Commission and developing the plans for striking \n     the coins commemorating the Bicentennial of the United States \n     Capitol: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the life and extraordinary contributions of \n     Diane Wolf;\n       (2) conveys its sorrow and deepest condolences to the \n     family of Diane Wolf on her untimely death; and\n       (3) requests the Secretary of the Senate to convey an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the family of Diane Wolf.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the public service \ncontributions of Diane Wolf. I also wish to join in cosponsoring the \nSenate resolution expressing condolences to the family of Ms. Wolf upon \nher unexpected passing. Diane Wolf was a unique and remarkable \nindividual. Diane Wolf was very inspired by our democratic institutions \nand, with an abundance of energy and goodwill, she inspired others to \nshare her appreciation for the blessings of our liberties and the \ninstitutions that protect them. She was an enthusiastic student of the \nform and process of our representative democracy and she greatly \nadmired the structures that house our government, especially the \n``Shrine of Democracy''--the U.S. Capitol.\n  It was her appreciation of the art, architecture, and history of the \nCapitol that initially brought Ms. Wolf to my attention. At that time, \nMs. Wolf served as a member of the U.S. Commission of Fine Art, which \noversees the design of U.S. coins. During my second tenure as majority \nleader of the Senate in 1988, I sponsored and achieved passage of a \nbill establishing the Capitol Preservation Commission and a bill \nauthorizing the Congressional Bicentennial Coin Program. As these \nlegislative items were developed, considered, and passed, Diane Wolf \nprovided a wealth of ideas, expertise, and counsel, and the results of \nher efforts will prove beneficial to Americans and their Capitol for \nperhaps as long as this building shall stand.\n  As stated in the Capitol Preservation Commission law, the purpose of \nthat Commission is to provide for ``improvements in, preservation of, \nand acquisitions for, the United States Capitol'' Additionally, through \nthe Congressional Bicentennial Coin Program, Congress celebrated its \ninception and history by authorizing the minting of three commemorative \ncoins, the surcharges of which were made available to the Capitol \nPreservation Commission for the preservation and improvement of the \nCapitol. As I stated on the Senate floor on October 7, 1988, these \nproceeds would provide historic art, furnishings, and documents for \ndisplay in public areas of the Capitol to be seen by millions of \nAmericans and international visitors for generations to come.\n  Diane Wolf was a very accomplished individual. She earned her \nundergraduate degree cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania, \nbecame a teacher with masters degree in education from Columbia \nUniversity, and later became an attorney after graduating the \nGeorgetown University Law Center. She served as President of the \nCapitol Hill chapter of the Federal Bar Association and was a member of \nthe Senate Preservation Board of Trustees. Ms. Wolf also contributed \nactively to several other national and local civic organizations. She \nserved on boards and councils supporting the National Archives, the \nLibrary of Congress, National Public Radio, the National Trust for \nHistoric Preservation, Georgetown University Law Center, the Woodrow \nWilson International Center for Scholars, the Kennedy Center for the \nPerforming Arts, the National Symphony\n\n[[Page S15]]\n\nOrchestra, the Washington National Opera, and the Smithsonian Council \nfor American Art. In New York City, Ms. Wolf served on the Rockefeller \nUniversity Council and was a benefactor of the Metropolitan Museum of \nArt.\n  Finally, Mr. President, no description of Diane Wolf would be \ncomplete without recognizing the generosity of her spirit, the strength \nof her character, and the cheerful nature of her personality. She met \neveryone with a bright smile, and very often she humbly and quietly \nlent a hand to others, asking nothing in return. She was respected by \nMembers of Congress and their staff, not only for her knowledge and \nadvice, but also for her genuine friendliness, gracefulness, and humor. \nShe was much admired and appreciated by everyone in the Capitol \ncommunity, including secretaries, doorkeepers, elevator operators, and \nCapitol Police alike.\n  Diane Wolf will be missed. I join my Senate colleagues in conveying \nto her family deepest condolences, and with great respect repeat here \nthe words of Adon 'Olam, one of the most familiar hymns in all of \nJewish liturgy:\n\n                               Adon 'Olam\n\n     The Lord of all, who reigned supreme Ere first Creation's \n           form was framed; When all was finished by His will His \n           Name Almighty was proclaimed.\n\n     When this our world shall be no more, In majesty He still \n           shall reign, Who was, who is, who will for aye In \n           endless glory still remain.\n\n     Alone is He, beyond compare, Without division or ally; \n           Without initial date or end, Omnipotent He rules on \n           high.\n\n     He is my God and Savior too, To whom I turn in sorrow's \n           hour--My banner proud, my refuge sure--Who hears and \n           answers with His power.\n\n     Then in His hand myself I lay, And trusting, sleep; and wake \n           with cheer; My soul and body are His care; The Lord \n           doth guard, I have no fear!\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that my following \nstatement appear in the Record as if read contemporaneous with \nconsideration of the resolution honoring the life of Diane Wolf.\n  The Senate was deeply saddened by the sudden loss of Diane. Her \npassion for art and philanthropy lead her to devote her considerable \ntalents to the service of countless organizations and causes. Diane was \nan attorney, teacher, and civic leader. Much of her work was dedicated \nto the preservation of the very building in which we meet.\n  My wife, Catherine, and I worked closely with Diane on her efforts to \npreserve and restore the U.S. Capitol. Diane was passionate about the \nCapitol's history and symbolism. She enjoyed the pomp and circumstance \nof the Presidential inauguration and the annual tradition of the \nPresident's State of the Union Address. Her contributions as a member \nof the board of trustees of the U.S. Senate Preservation Commission \nwere invaluable. It was her support and guidance that led to the \ndevelopment of the commemorative coins which marked the bicentennial of \nthe U.S. Capitol.\n  President Reagan appointed Diane to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts \nin 1985. Her father, Erving, says Diane considered that appointment as \na full-time job. Diane demanded high quality in all endeavors. She \nbelieved a thing worth doing is worth doing well.\n  During her tenure on the Commission she strongly advocated \nredesigning our coins to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Bill \nof Rights and update the Presidential portraits. She believed that \nAmerican coinage could recapture our imagination and become highly \nprized by collectors. This is just one example of how Diane used her \ncreativity, intelligence, and boundless energy to promote art in \nAmerica.\n  Her vision has been realized in recent years, as the Mint produced \nnew designs for the quarter with images representing each of the 50 \nStates.\n  Diane's energy and passion for public service will be missed. The \ninstitutions she served and the lives she touched benefited greatly \nfrom her dedication, generosity, and lively spirit.\n  Catherine and I are fortunate to know Diane's wonderful family. She \ncherished her relationships with her parents, Erving and Joyce, and her \nbrothers Daniel and Matthew. Our thoughts and prayers are with them and \ntheir loved ones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S15-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S15]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WELCOMING SENATOR ROGER WICKER\n\n  Mr. REID.

Today, we welcome his successor, Roger Wicker.\n  Senator Wicker is no stranger to Washington, DC, having served the \npeople of Mississippi's First Congressional District since 1995.\n  In the House, he served as the Republican deputy whip, and he served \non his party's policy committee for some 6 years.\n  His distinguished history in the U.S. Air Force has informed his \nadvocacy on behalf of veterans health care and pensions, as well as \nmilitary construction projects throughout the world. He has also been a \nstrong supporter of health care research and has received numerous \nawards for his advocacy in this regard.\n  His background and expertise on these and other issues will surely \nmake him a welcome addition to our Senate. So on behalf of all \nDemocratic Senators, I extend my congratulations to him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S15-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S15-S16]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DEMOCRATIC STAFF CHANGES\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is good to be back in the Senate. The \npast 4\\1/2\\ weeks have been very pleasurable for me. Since I have been \nthe Democratic leader--which has now been for 3 years--it was the \nlongest period of time I have been able to spend at home, and it was a \ngreat experience for me. Every day I was able to spend it in my home in \nSearchlight.\n  Searchlight, even though it is 60 miles from Las Vegas, is much \ndifferent in temperature. It rains twice as much--not a lot but 8 \ninches a year compared to 4 inches in Las Vegas--but it is much colder. \nIt is 3,600 feet high. It has had a number of days in the recent past \nwhere the temperature has been 8 degrees. That is the lowest it has \never been, but it has hit that low degree on a number of occasions. \nThis trip home, the lowest it got was 18 degrees, but that was on the \nsame occasion when we had 40-mile-an-hour winds, so it was bitter cold.\n  But that is one reason I so love Searchlight. The air is pristine and \nclean and pure. It is refreshing for me to be able to go home. Out my \nwindow, on one side of the house, I have set up two little ceramic \nwater dishes, and water comes on there four times a day. Those little \nanimals have it made.\n  Even though it is wintertime, the quail still come and need a drink \nof water now and then. If you are lucky, you see a coyote--which I saw \non a couple of occasions. As wily and as reclusive as they are, you \nstill see them out wandering around--and all kinds of different birds \nof different hues and colors.\n  It may not be very exciting to most people, but for me, one of the \nexciting events of my trip home was the opportunity to see an animal \nyou rarely see. My wife and I were working in a little study I have \nthere, and we heard three distinct knocks. We didn't know what it was. \nWe got up and looked out the front door--nothing there; we looked out \nthe back--nothing there. I went back to work and a minute or two later \nmy wife says: Get down here. Hurry. So we go to these windows, some \npicture windows, two large rectangular windows that look out on the \narea where the ceramic dishes are, and there was a bobcat. For those of \nus who live in the desert, seeing a bobcat is really almost akin to \nseeing the Abominable Snowman. Rarely does anyone see a bobcat. They do \nmost of their hunting at night. They are very secretive in everything \nthey do. But this afternoon, this bobcat was there drinking water, very \nthirsty. I had never seen a bobcat before. Having been born there, \nraised there, I had never seen a bobcat before. This little animal \nfinished its water, was walking around, saw me in the window and, boy, \nthat little animal hit that window. It was after me and whatever it \ncould see through that window. That was the knock on our window the \nfour times. We have these shutters that when we are not there are down \nso you cannot see in the house. On this day, the shutters were up and \nhe was looking around and saw inside and he wanted to nose around a \nlittle bit and he couldn't do that. Similar to all animals when they \nare frightened, they jump to protect themselves. Fortunately, even \nthough the animal weighs about 30 pounds, he would have at least took a \nbite or two out of me. It was great to see. Finally, I got to see a \nbobcat, but enough of my travel log.\n\n[[Page S16]]\n\n  The Senate is going to be forever different for me now. For more than \na quarter of a century, part of my workplace has evolved around one of \nthe Senate employees: Martin Paone. First, as I was a new Senator, he \nwas always here to help me feel more comfortable and answer, I am sure \nas we look back, dumb questions we all ask as new Senators, but he was \nalways a gentleman, always willing to give us the information. For the \n9 years I have been involved as Democratic leader, he has been \navailable. During the 6 years I spent on the floor as Senator Daschle's \nassistant and whip, Marty was always there giving me guidance and \nadvice. He was always so very helpful. It is important to have someone \nwho understands these complicated rules we have in the Senate. He has \nbeen a terrific coworker and a good friend and I am going to miss him \ntremendously. As I have said, the Senate will never be the same with \nMarty not being here.\n  So it is bittersweet news that Marty is going to be leaving--\nretiring. He has served the Senate for 30 years. His story is a \nremarkable success story. He began his career in the House Post Office \nto help pay his way through graduate school at Georgetown. Later he \nmoved to the Senate Parking Office before joining the Democratic \ncloakroom in 1979. With his tremendous intellect and vast knowledge of \nprocedure, it was no surprise that he moved up the ranks to become \nSecretary for the minority in 1995. It is no exaggeration to say that \nevery single Democrat and a number of Republicans rely upon Marty's \nexpert advice. That has ended. I have been, as I have indicated, one of \nthose who has depended on his expertise. Nothing has happened on the \nSenate floor, no legislation was considered, no parliamentary procedure \nenacted without his influence. Countless staff have come and gone over \nthe years, but he has been a constant, steady presence. I am grateful \nbeyond words and express gratitude for his exceptional service. Ruby is \nsomeone we see as we come to work every day. She has worked here for \nmany years herself. Marty has three beautiful children: Alexander, \nStephanie, and TJ. I have followed their high school athletic careers \nover the last several years. But he is moving on to new things, new \nchallenges. We will all miss him. We wish him nothing but the best and \nknow he will be a tremendous success.\n  Although we are sad to say goodbye to Marty, I am pleased to announce \nwe have chosen Lula Davis as our new Democratic Secretary. She is a \nlong-time veteran of this Chamber. Lula has had more than 25 years of \nSenate service, which began in the office of the legendary Russell Long \nof Louisiana. Since 1993, she has been a member of the Democratic floor \nstaff. In 1997, she was elected as the first woman ever to serve as \nAssistant Democratic Secretary. Much like Marty, Lula has risen to \nbecome indispensable for all of us. She has big shoes to fill, but I \ncan't think of a more capable person to take on this crucial role.\n  Replacing Lula as Assistant Democratic Secretary will be Tim \nMitchell. Tim is quiet, always available, so important to me. I \nappreciate his attention to me on so many different occasions. He has \nserved as floor assistant to the Democratic leader, where he has become \na leading expert on floor procedure and legislative process. With 16 \nyears of Hill experience and as a policy adviser for the Democratic \nPolicy Committee, research director for Senator Daschle, and a \nlegislative assistant to the Senate Banking Committee, Tim could not be \nbetter prepared for some of these new responsibilities.\n  Finally, I am pleased to announce that Jacques Purvis, a member of \nour floor staff, will take on Tim's role as floor assistant. A Howard \nUniversity fellow, Jacques began his career in my personal office. He \nis a wonderful, fine young man. He has shown enormous skill and has a \nbright future ahead of him.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nmoment?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would like to extend my appreciation for the service \nMarty has given your conference. I have found him invariably to be a \nstraight shooter and somebody we could work with to try to make the \nSenate function. I think he and Dave have enjoyed a good working \nrelationship. I, too, want to wish him well and thank him for his many \nyears in the Senate and congratulate Lula on her appointment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to join in this chorus. Prior to my election \nto the House of Representatives, I served as parliamentarian of the \nIllinois State Senate for 14 years. It is a very important role in that \nbody, as Marty's role has been here. You don't spend much time before a \nmicrophone, but you spend a lot of time preparing the Members to say \nthe right things before the microphone, and Marty has done that I think \nin the best possible tradition of the Senate.\n\n  Time and again, Members on our side of the aisle, and I believe on \nthe other side as well, knew they could trust his word, trust his \njudgment, that he understood this institution, not just the rules but \nthe history and the tradition. He served this institution well, as his \nwife has, and I wish him the very best in his new endeavors.\n  I am also happy to hear Lula Davis is going to replace Marty in his \nposition. She has a tough act to follow, as has been said, but she is \nan extraordinary woman, who has served this Senate well for 25 years, \nand I am certain she will continue on in this fine tradition.\n  Mr. President, I yield back to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S16-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S16-S18]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              REFLECTIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Benjamin Franklin once said:\n\n       Be always at war with your vices, at peace with your \n     neighbors, and let each new year find you a better man.\n\n  This year, I know all 100 Senators will work to enable the words of \nFranklin to be meaningful, to make us each a better person and, in a \ncumulative effort, a better Senate.\n  Having come back from my time in Nevada, I think it is an opportunity \nfor me to reflect briefly upon 2007, the first year of the 110th \nCongress. This past year made one thing clear: We in the Senate are at \na constant crossroads, with two paths from which to choose. One path is \nbipartisanship. The other is obstructionism. One path leads to change, \nthe other to more of the same. This is not directed toward Republicans \nonly but certainly Democrats also. Bipartisanship is a two-way street \nand we have to understand that. One path leads to change, the other to \nmore of the same; the other to finger pointing.\n  When we chose bipartisanship last year, we made real progress. For \nwhom did we make real progress? We made it for the American people.\n  With bipartisanship, we passed the toughest ethics bill in the \nhistory of our country to ensure a government as good and as honest as \nthe people we represent. With bipartisanship, we finally passed the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission to support our first responders \nand secure our most at-risk cities. With bipartisanship, we provided \nour veterans with the largest health care funding increase in history.\n  When we sought and found common ground, we passed the first minimum \nwage increase in 10 years to help the hardest working Americans make \nends meet. When we sought and found common ground, we helped struggling \nhomeowners, a few--we have a lot more to do--to at least be aware of \nand avoid foreclosure. When we sought and found common ground, we \nenacted the largest expansion of student financial aid since the GI \nbill. When we sought and found common ground, we passed an energy bill \nthat will lower gas and electricity prices and begin to stem the tide \nof global warming. Could we have done more with that Energy bill? Of \ncourse, we could, and we are going to try in the next few months to \nenlarge upon it.\n  Time and time again, we have proved that bipartisanship works. Far \ntoo often, unfortunately, others chose the other path--the path of \nbeing an obstructionist. We saw that on Iraq. Most Republicans chose to \nstick with the President's policy that has devastated our Armed Forces, \ncompromised our security, and damaged our standing around the world. We \nsaw it on Medicare drug prices. We were unable to get\n\n[[Page S17]]\n\ndone something that is so common sense. The American people say: Why \ncouldn't you do that? What we wanted to do was allow Medicare to \nnegotiate for lower priced drugs. We couldn't get it done. We saw it on \nchildren's health. We tried, and we had good bipartisan cooperation. We \npassed it, but the President vetoed it, and we were unable to override \nthat veto. It is often we see how destructive partisanship can be. So \nlet's hope the old way of doing business is no longer this year's way \nof doing business.\n  Many of last year's problems have grown worse--all we have to do is \nlook at the morning newspaper--and many new ones have arisen. Last \nyear, the subprime lending issue was not part of our mantra. Now it is \nin every speech anyone gives in the political world. We can no longer \nturn to the old playbook of political posturing. We must end that. We \nhave to do better.\n  What are the new and growing challenges? We don't need an economics \nprofessor or philosopher to tell us: A walk through a neighborhood most \nanyplace in this country to see the sea of for sale signs, foreclosures \nare all over this country. All it takes is a trip to a gas station or \neven drive by a gas station to see people are paying over $3 a gallon \nmost everyplace in this country.\n  All it takes is a glance at the headlines in the newspaper to see the \nrising violence and turmoil all across the globe.\n  Like all of my colleagues, I spent a lot of time back home, and we \ntalked about that. Mr. President, in Nevada, things have changed. But \nto show you, in a sparsely populated State such as Nevada, similar to \nthe State of my colleague, the Presiding Officer--Nevada is a sparsely \npopulated State. To show how people are so concerned about this \ncountry, in an hour and a half on Saturday, 30,000 new Democrats \nregistered to vote in Nevada. In an hour and a half, during the \ncaucuses we had, 30,000 new Democrats registered to vote. Think about \nthat. In the State of Nevada, there were 30,000 new Democratic \nregistrants in an hour and a half. Why? Because we have an economy that \nis sliding toward recession. Hundreds of thousands of families are at \nrisk of losing their homes--millions, really, not hundreds of \nthousands. The price of gas and heating homes is skyrocketing to \nalltime highs. New threats of violence, war, and terrorism are emerging \nat home and abroad.\n  Regarding the war in Iraq, it is debatable now how much we are \nspending there. Is it $10 billion or $12 billion a month? And now we \nhave, during this break we have had, a Republican frontrunner for the \nRepublican nomination for President who says we will have to be in Iraq \nfor as long as 40 more years. This war will soon be going into its \nsixth year. We are now an occupying force in Iraq.\n  So together we must address these growing challenges, both foreign \nand domestic.\n  At home, the first thing we have to work on is the economic stimulus \npackage. During the break, I spoke to the Secretary of the Treasury at \nleast eight or nine times. He is concerned, and we are all concerned. \nTo be effective, this stimulus plan must be timely, targeted, and \ntemporary. It must be timely because America needs relief right now. It \nmust be targeted because for too long the Republican approach has been \nto put money in the pockets of corporations and the wealthy rather than \nthe working families who need it most. It must be temporary because, as \nimportant as it is to help people right now, we don't do ourselves or \nour economy any favors by saddling our children and grandchildren with \nmountains of debt, as has happened over the past 7 years.\n  If the President and congressional Republicans work together with us \nto pass this short-term stimulus plan that follows these principles, we \ncan make a real and immediate difference in people's lives and perhaps \nstave off this looming recession. I call upon all of my colleagues--\nDemocrats and Republicans--to come together to pass the stimulus \npackage this work period. We have 4 weeks, and we must do it during \nthis 4-week work period. We will meet with President Bush today to \ncontinue working out this plan.\n  While we await the results of the discussions on the stimulus \npackage, we will begin this year by addressing other important issues, \nsuch as Indian health. We have to do this. The sickest and worst health \ncare in America is on Indian reservations. That is why we are doing \nthis. Native Americans all over America have the highest rate of \ndiabetes, tuberculosis, and other dread diseases. We must address the \nhealth care of the poorest of the poor. They are the poorest of the \npoor--Native Americans.\n  This legislation will allow Indian and tribal health providers to \noffer long-term health care services and even hospice care and will \nprovide diabetes and youth substance abuse programs to urban Indians \nand will encourage State-tribe agreements to improve health service \ndelivery. We would like to finish that as soon as possible. After we \nfinish that, we will return to the foreign intelligence surveillance \nbill.\n  Mr. President, we must pass a FISA law that gives our law enforcement \nofficials the tools they need to fight terrorism, without infringing on \nthe fundamental rights of law-abiding Americans. We have always been \nwilling to work with the President to give him the constitutional \nauthority to meet the post-9/11 challenges. All he had to do was tell \nus what he needed. It wasn't until we read in the New York Times that \nhe was doing things that were contrary to law that we decided we had to \ndo something legislatively. If he had come to us, we would have done \nanything we could to maintain the framework for a constitutional form \nof government to help whatever problems there might be.\n  With the current law set to expire soon, Democrats are resolved to \nreplace it with a new and stronger one. Senator Rockefeller, Senator \nLeahy, and their committees--both Democrats and Republicans--believe \nthe law needs to be changed. Hopefully, we can do that. Last month, I \nrequested a 1-month extension of the current law to allow lawmakers \nadditional time to do just that. The present law expires in just a few \ndays, on February 1. That request I made to extend the law was objected \nto. With just a few days left before the expiration, I will renew my \nrequest for an extension. After we act, the House has to act on this \nbill. They have not done that. The failure to extend the present law \nfor 1 month could lead to the law no longer being something that guides \nwhat happens in this country. Some may want that. I think the majority \nof the Senate doesn't want that. We need time to do that.\n\n  The Defense authorization bill--we have to finish that this work \nperiod. Hopefully, we can do it by unanimous consent. I personally \nthought the veto was unnecessary. I think the Iraqi Government, which \nwe have funded with hundreds of billions of dollars, should stand up \nand be responsible for what has taken place in that country in years \npast.\n  I have had one serviceman from Nevada, who was tortured in the first \nwar, who sought compensation in court, and the Bush administration \njoined in fighting the relief he sought. We tried to do things \nlegislatively to help, and the Bush administration stopped that. He did \nveto it. We are where we are. Iraq's treatment of American servicemen \nduring the first Gulf war was important. The bill should not have been \nvetoed. It was.\n  We will be as agreeable as we can be to get this money. Hopefully, \ntoday we can finish this legislation. It is something we need to do. \nThe Wounded Warrior legislation is in here and an additional pay raise \nfor the troops. We will do what we can on that.\n  There are other things we look forward to this coming year. We want \nto make sure we do something about product safety legislation. We want \nto have toys, for example, that are sold that are safe and that don't \nmake kids sick. We will also look at patent reform.\n  So we have a work-filled legislative session that I have outlined. We \nhave a number of things we cannot put off, and we are going to have to \nspend some long hours here in the Senate. Hopefully, we won't have to \nwork weekends. I hope that is not the case. FISA, for example--I have \nhad a number of Senators say they want to go to these very important \ndiscussions in Doha that start this week. We cannot do that unless we \nsomehow resolve this FISA legislation, either extending it or \ncompleting our work. We may have to finish that work this weekend. We \nhave energy legislation on which we have indicated we are going to move \nforward.\n\n[[Page S18]]\n\nWe won't do it this work period, but we have a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation that came out of the Environment and Public Works Committee \ndealing with global warming; it is the Lieberman-Warner legislation. We \nneed to get to that. We have to be concerned about children's health \nand what we can do in that regard.\n  Can we accomplish these goals? Yes, we can. It won't be easy, and it \ncannot be done if we resort to the same business as usual. We have a \nshortened time period. We have the Presidential election coming up, and \nwe have contested Senate seats that take a lot of the time of incumbent \nSenators and the challengers. Last year, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle broke the 2-year record of filibustering in just 1 \nyear. I hope that isn't the case this year, that we don't break another \nrecord.\n  Our work has begun in this new year and new legislative session. Hope \nsprings eternal, and I repeat what I have said before: If we accomplish \nthings here, there is credit to go around to both Democrats and \nRepublicans. Everybody can claim credit for what we do. If we are not \nable to pass legislation, there is blame to go around for everybody. I \nhope we can move forward on the important legislation that faces this \ncountry and needs to be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S18-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18-S19]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE SECOND SESSION OF THE 110TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first, I welcome back the distinguished \nmajority leader. It is good to see him and good to be at the podium \nagain, refreshed and ready for act 2 of the 110th Congress. Republicans \nare eager to get to work on the unfinished business from last year, and \nwe are determined to address the other issues that have become more \npressing or pronounced since we stood here last.\n  We face a number of urgent challenges domestically and \ninternationally, and there will be a strong temptation to politicize \nthem or put them off as the current administration comes to a close and \na new one prepares to take its place. This would be an irresponsible \npath, and it is one we should not take. We have had a Presidential \nelection in this country every 4 years since 1788. We won't use this \none as an excuse to put off the people's business for another day.\n  We have our differences in this Chamber. But Americans expect that \nwhen we walk into this well we will sort through those differences and \nwork together toward common goals. And here are a few things we should \nbe able to agree on: We need to show America that Government can live \nwithin its means by keeping spending low; that we can protect their \nquality of life without raiding their wallets with higher taxes; that \nwe won't push problems off to future Congresses; and that we will not \ntake chances with their security.\n  As we do all this, we can be confident of success--confident because \nwe have faith in this institution, and confident because of what we \nlearned the last time around. Personally, I think there are a lot of \nlessons we can take away from last year, and that if we're smart we \nwill learn from them. We all know what worked and what didn't work. We \nall know the formula for success and the formula for failure. So this \nyear even more than last year, success and failure will be a choice.\n  I think we can agree, for instance, that we all worked best last year \nwhen we worked together. Last January our Democrat colleagues presented \nus with a minimum wage bill that didn't include needed tax relief for \nsmall businesses. It didn't pass. But when they did include the tax \nrelief these small businesses deserved, it did pass--by a wide margin.\n  Our friends gave us an energy bill that would have meant higher taxes \nand higher utility rates. It didn't pass. But when they agreed to \nremove these objectionable provisions, it did--by a wide margin. Senate \nDemocrats also tried to use a looming AMT middle class tax hike as an \nexcuse for a giant tax hike elsewhere. That didn't get very far. But \nwhen we all agreed to block the AMT expansion without a new tax, \ntogether we prevented a major middle class tax hike.\n  The temptation to partisanship was strongest on issues of national \nsecurity. By the end of the year, the majority had held 34 votes \nrelated to the war in Iraq and its opposition to the Petraeus Plan. Yet \nwhenever Republicans defended the view that Congress should not \nsubstitute its military judgment for the judgment of our military \ncommanders, or cut off funds for troops in the field, we moved forward. \nWith the recent success of the Petraeus Plan, the chances of such votes \npassing this year have not improved. It was wrong to tempt fate when \nour progress in Iraq was uncertain. It would be foolish to do so when \nprogress is undeniable.\n  So there is a pattern here, a pattern for true accomplishment. And \nnow that we know it, we shouldn't hesitate to follow it. Not this \nNovember. Not sometime this summer. But now.\n  As we move into 2008, the problems we face are big, they're real, and \nthey are urgent. And Americans expect competence, cooperation, and \nresults. We know from experience that it's in our power to deliver. And \nit's in everyone's interests that we do. So on behalf of Senate \nRepublicans, I want to begin this session by extending the hand of \ncooperation to our colleagues on the other side. As we begin this \nsecond session, we need to focus on our common goals.\n  We need to come together to protect and defend Americans from harm. \nWe need to come together to meet the economic challenges of the moment. \nAnd we will need to come together to protect Americans' quality of life \nby keeping taxes low, and by working to relieve anxieties about \nhealthcare, tuition, the cost and quality of education, jobs, and the \nfate of entitlements.\n  On the economy, Republicans are encouraged by recent talk on the \nother side of a willingness to work with us on an economic growth \npackage. Now it is time to prove this is more than just talk. We need \nto move ahead with a plan that stimulates the economy right away and \nwhich is consistent with good long-term economic policy.\n  An effective plan will focus on growing the economy and securing \njobs. It will be broad based for maximum effect, and it won't include \nwasteful spending on programs that might make us feel good but which \nhave no positive impact on the economy.\n  Republicans in the 110th Congress have shown that we will use our \nrobust minority to ensure we are heard. And we will use our power to \nreject any growth package that's held hostage to wasteful spending. \nAmericans are concerned about the state of the economy, they are \nlooking to us to act, and acting now will be far less costly than \nwaiting for more troubles to gather. Time is short. We need to put \ntogether a bipartisan package that helps the economy, and do it soon--\nwithout raising taxes and without growing government.\n  In the longer term, Congress can keep the economy stable by keeping \ntaxes low and by assuring families, retirees, and small businesses that \ncurrent rate reductions and tax credits will continue. We can prepare \nfor the future by making sure every child in America gets a good \neducation through reauthorization of the No Child Left Behind Act and \nby completing action on the Higher Education Act.\n  Our friends should also resist the temptation to increase taxes on \ndividends and capital gains; agree early that we would not offset a \npatch for the alternative minimum tax with a massive tax elsewhere; \nextend the current expanded child tax credit; and end the marriage \npenalty for good.\n  We can also boost the economy by boosting trade, which broadens the \nmarket for U.S. goods. Last May, Democratic leaders agreed to allow \npassage of four free--trade agreements if the Administration negotiated \nincreased worker rights and stronger environmental protections. The \nadministration did its part by negotiating the changes. Yet so far, \nonly one of the four FTAs from last year, Peru, has passed. Now it is \ntime for the Democrats to uphold their end of the bargain and pass the \nremaining three FTAs: Panama, South Korea and Colombia.\n  We can help the economy by keeping spending low. Republicans will do \nour part by making sure, as we did last year, that government spending \nbills don't exceed fiscally responsible levels even as they meet the \nNation's highest\n\n[[Page S19]]\n\npriorities. And Democrats can help by keeping spending in these bills \nlow from the start--and resisting the urge to lace them with poison \npill social policy.\n  Working together to strengthen America at home also means increasing \naccess and lowering the cost of good health care. We should empower \nindividuals and protect the doctor-patient relationship by promoting \nresearch into new treatments and cures and by investing in new \ninformation technology like electronic medical records and e-\nprescribing. We can also increase access by letting small businesses \npool resources to get the same deals from insurers big businesses do.\n  In the coming months, Americans will hear a lot of different health \ncare proposals coming out of the campaigns. And while presidential \nelection years are not typically the time when broad based reforms are \nachieved, we shouldn't let disputes among candidates or the failures of \nthe past keep us from delivering something for Americans now. In the \nlong term, Republicans are committed to the goal of every American \nhaving health insurance. But there is no reason we can't find \nbipartisan support this year for other common sense measures that \nremove barriers to access and increase coverage options.\n  We should also be able to agree that too many judicial posts have \nbeen left empty too long. Last year we confirmed 40 judges, including \nsix circuit court nominees, and an attorney general. But we are not on \npace to keep up with historical precedent. The historical average for \ncircuit court confirmations in the last Congress of a divided \ngovernment is 17. President Clinton--who had the second most judicial \nconfirmations in history, despite having to deal with a Republican \nSenate almost his entire time in office--had 15 circuit court \nconfirmations in his last Congress.\n  Clearly, we need to catch up. But we can not confirm judges if they \ndon't get hearings. And since last summer, Democrats have allowed only \none hearing since last summer, one hearing--since last summer, one \nhearing--on a circuit court nominee. Compare that with Senate \nRepublicans in 1999, who held more hearings on President Clinton's \nnominees in the fall of that year alone than Democrats allowed this \nPresident all last year. This pattern is neither fair nor acceptable.\n  As we focus on crucial issues at home, we are reminded that our first \nresponsibility is to keep Americans safe. For some, the passage of time \nhas made 9/11 seem like a distant memory and the people behind it a \ndistant threat. Yet the best argument in favor of our current strategy \nof staying on offense is the fact that not a single terrorist act has \nbeen carried out on American soil since that awful day.\n  We decided early on in this fight that the best strategy would be to \nfight the terrorists overseas so we wouldn't have to fight them at \nhome. This policy has worked. And we must continue to ensure that it \ndoes by giving those who protect us all the tools they need.\n  One of the most valuable tools we have had is the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, which lets us monitor foreign terrorists \noverseas and react in real time to planned attacks. In August, we \nupdated this protection. Yet with only 10 days to go before it expires, \nwe need to pass new FISA legislation that allows the intelligence \ncommunity to continue its work and which assures telecom companies they \nwill not be sued for answering the call to help in the hunt for \nterrorists.\n  Some of our Democratic colleagues delayed consideration of this vital \nlegislation at the end of the last session. And it should have been the \nfirst thing we turned to this session. American lives do not depend on \nwhether we pass the Indian health bill by the end of the month.\n  We also need to renew our commitment to the brave men and women of \nthe Armed Forces whose hard work over a number of years has helped \nchange the story in Iraq in 2007. No issue should bring us together \nmore readily than this one. Yet no issue threatens to divide us more as \nthe November elections draw near. Let the candidates say what they \nwill. The Senate should stand united in supporting the troops--and we \ncan start by affirming that the Petraeus plan is working.\n  We could even go one step further by making a pledge that during the \nsession that begins today, we will not attack the integrity of our \nuniformed officers or subvert the efforts of the troops--all of whom \nhave made sacrifices for us equally, regardless of our political \nparties or theirs.\n  Beyond that, we should be able to agree that we need to invest in the \nfuture of our military. This remarkable volunteer force is built on the \nfinest training, weaponry, and education system in the world. We need \nto support this great national resource not only to retain our strength \nfor today's battles, but in preparation for the unexpected challenges \nthat lie ahead--particularly in the Persian Gulf and in the Pacific, \nwhere our strategic interests will continue to be challenged for many \nyears to come.\n  So we stand at the beginning of a new year. I, for one, am hopeful \nthat it will be a year in which we accomplish much for the people who \nsent us here. We can start by agreeing to protect taxpayer wallets and \nby facing concerns about health care and the other economic pressures \nthat so many American families face. We must act right away to keep our \neconomy strong. And above all we can work together to keep America and \nits interests safe both at home and overseas.\n  We can do all this--we can live up to our duties to work together on \nbehalf of the American people--by learning from last year and working \ntogether.

Mr. President, I also wish to pick up on what our Republican \nleader has just been talking about: that we can, with bipartisanship, \naccomplish a great deal in this Senate and that there is no better \nplace to start than on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. In \nthe Senate, we refer to that by its acronym, FISA, but it needs to be \nour first important piece of business.\n  Certainly, our intelligence community, to whom we have given a very \nbig responsibility, needs certainty with respect to its \nresponsibilities and its rights. It needs permanency, not just 1-month \nextensions. This intelligence community must know the rules of the \nroad. That is why it is so important for us to, within the next week or \nso, reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act with a few \nadditional changes to ensure that we can, in fact, collect this \nintelligence on our enemies.\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\n  Theodore Roosevelt once referred to his opportunities in life and \nsaid the greatest opportunity was work worth doing. And there is no \nmore work worth doing than ensuring that we can gain the intelligence \non the enemy that attacked us in this war.\n  We are at war, both at home and abroad. These radical militant \nIslamists have attacked us, and they continue to threaten us. We all \nknow that the best approach to defeating them is good intelligence and \nthat most of that intelligence, by necessity, is collected overseas--\nthat is why it is called foreign intelligence--and that the basis for \nthe collection of much of this intelligence is the FISA law, or the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As noted, that act expires next \nweek, and that is why it is important for the Senate to act now and the \nreason this reauthorization is actually very simple and straightforward \nand very interesting.\n  Technology has actually outpaced the law. What we found is that we \nare now able to collect intelligence in ways that were never understood \nwhen the FISA law was first written nearly 30 years ago. As a result, \nwe need to change that law to accommodate the intelligence collection \ncapabilities we have today.\n  Before we changed the law last year, U.S. intelligence agencies had \nlost about two-thirds of their ability to collect communications \nintelligence against al-Qaida. Obviously, in this war, we cannot cede \ntwo-thirds of the battlefield to our enemy, to the terrorists.\n  When we enacted the Protect America Act last summer, we regained that \ncapability to collect communications intelligence against al-Qaida by \nconforming the legal procedures to the technology that is available to \nus. Let there be no doubt that the collection of this information, as a \nresult of that work, is critical to our Nation's security. In fact, in \na New York Times op-ed on December 10, Michael McConnell, the Director \nof National Intelligence, noted that ``[i]nformation obtained under \nthis law has helped us develop a greater understanding of international \nQaeda networks, and the law has allowed us to obtain significant \ninsight into terrorist planning.''\n  Similarly, on October 31 of this year, Kenneth Wainstein, the \nAssistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's \nNational Security Division, testified before the Judiciary Committee \nthat ``since the passage of the [Protect America] Act, the Intelligence \nCommunity has collected critical intelligence important to preventing \nterrorist actions and enhancing our national security.''\n  This is important business. It is work worth doing.\n  The Intelligence Committee, in a very bipartisan way, crafted an \nextension of the foreign Intelligence Committee legislation.\n  The Judiciary Committee, on which I sit, took a much more partisan \napproach. The Judiciary Committee bill has a lot of flaws that the \nIntelligence Committee bill does not have. Let me mention a couple of \nthose flaws, suggesting to my colleagues that the bill we should start \nwith as our base bill is the Intelligence Committee bill, not the bill \nthat came out of Judiciary Committee.\n  One of the things the Judiciary Committee bill does is it includes an \n``exclusive means'' provision that would undermine intelligence \ngathering directed at foreign terrorist organizations. The provision \nnot only uses vague terms whose mention is unclear, it also appears to \npreclude use of other intelligence-gathering tools that have already \nproven to be valuable sources of intelligence about al-Qaida.\n  As the official Statement of Administration Policy for this bill \nnotes:\n\n       The exclusivity provision in the Judiciary Committee \n     substitute ignores FISA's complexity and its \n     interrelationship with other federal laws and, as a result, \n     could operate to preclude the Intelligence Community from \n     using current tools and authorities, or preclude Congress \n     from acting quickly to give the Intelligence Community the \n     tools it may need in the aftermath of a terrorist attack in \n     the United States or in response to a grave threat to the \n     national security.\n\n  Another serious flaw of the Judiciary Committee bill is it has a \nprovision that would limit FISA overseas intelligence gathering--to \nquote the legislation itself--\n\n        . . . to communications to which at least one party is a \n     specific individual target who is reasonably believed to be \n     outside the United States.\n\n  The problem, of course, is it is not always possible to identify such \na specific individual in our intelligence collection.\n  And finally let me respond generally to those who would dismiss or \nignore the harm done to our national security by applying layer after \nlayer of bureaucratic hurdles to foreign intelligence investigations. \nThese restrictions, for example, that the Judiciary bill would impose, \nmatter in our agents' ability to collect this intelligence. We know \nthey can undermine critical investigations because we have seen it \nhappen in the past, and let me cite an example that makes this point.\n  In the 1990s, the Justice Department determined--well, first of all, \nit imposed this infamous wall that segregated foreign intelligence and \ncriminal investigations. It determined it was necessary to do this to \nprotect constitutional rights, but it went well beyond what the FISA \nlaw itself required. These rules were created by individuals, and they \nprevented criminal and intelligence agents who were chasing after the \nsame suspects from cooperating with each other, even sharing \ninformation with each other and with the other agents. So the FBI and \nthe CIA had a very difficult time talking to each other. This was part \nof the criticism of the 9/11 Commission after that horrible event.\n  Well, a few years after this wall was built, in the summer of 2001--\nnote the date, summer 2001--an FBI agent in the Bureau's New York field \noffice became aware that Khalid al-Mihdhar, Nawaf al-Hazmi, and two \nother bin Laden-related individuals were present in the United States. \nThey were here. This agent knew these men had been at an important al-\nQaida meeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and instinctively understood \nthey were dangerous. The agent initiated a search for these men and \nsought the help of criminal investigators who have much greater access \nto resources for finding people in the United States. This search was \nprobably the best chance the United States had of disrupting or \npotentially stopping the September 11 attacks.\n  This FBI agent was literally on the trail of the 9/11 hijackers in \nthe summer of 2001. But what happened when the agent sought to enlist \nthe help of criminal investigators and the full resources of the FBI? \nWell, the agent ran into this legal wall separating criminal and \nintelligence investigations, and he was repeatedly told criminal \ninvestigators could not aid in the investigation. Finally, after being \nrepeatedly rebuffed in requests for assistance in searching for Khalid \nal-Mihdhar and the other hijackers, the agent sent the following, \ndisturbingly prophetic, e-mail to FBI headquarters in August 2001. \nAugust 2001.\n\n       Whatever has happened to this, someday someone will die \n     and, wall or not, the public will not understand why we were \n     not more effective in throwing every resource we had at \n     certain problems.\n\n  Well, the officials who created the intelligence investigation wall \nin the 1990s, and who thereby undercut the search for al-Mihdhar and \nthe other hijackers, at least had one excuse. In the summer of 2001, \nfew people appreciated the threat the Nation faced from al-Qaida. Few \nrealized how devastating an al-Qaida terrorist attack could be and how \nmany innocent people could be killed.\n  Today we have no such excuses. We have already suffered one horrific \nal-Qaida attack, and we know much worse attacks are possible. We now \nknow what is at stake. Yet despite this knowledge, some in this body \nare proposing we repeat the mistakes of the past; that we create new \nwalls and other arbitrary legal procedures to the surveillance of al-\nQaida. We know from hard experience terrorist plots are hard to detect, \nand we don't get many chances to stop them. We know what a terrible \nloss of life a terrorist attack can inflict.\n  We know if another terrorist attack occurs, there will be multiple \nreviews and investigations that will identify what went wrong, what \nopportunities were missed, and who was responsible. Members who are \nthinking about supporting the Judiciary Committee bill should think \nhard about the consequences of enacting a set of arbitrary limits on \nthe surveillance of al-Qaida. If that substitute is enacted, it is \nlikely to undermine future critical intelligence investigations, just \nas the wall\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\nbetween intelligence and criminal investigations undermined the search \nfor the 9/11 hijackers. Future investigations will uncover exactly what \nwent wrong, and we will be held accountable for our actions.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Judiciary Committee substitute and \nvote to ensure our intelligence agents have the tools they need to \nconfront the threat posed by al-Qaida and other foreign terrorist \norganizations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I, too, welcome Roger Wicker to the Senate. I have \nknown him a long time. He has been a leader for the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority. He is one of Congress's most knowledgeable Members, and he \nhas been a leader in helping to put American history back in its \nrightful place in our classrooms so our children can grow up learning \nwhat it means to be an American. He was the lead sponsor in the House \nof Representatives on legislation that I introduced in the Senate that \ncreated summer academies for outstanding teachers and students of \nAmerican history.\n  I would also like to congratulate Marty Paone on his service here. We \nall admire him and will miss him.\n  I thank the majority leader for his remarks at the beginning of the \nyear, and I especially wanted to echo the remarks the Republican \nleader, Senator McConnell of Kentucky, made. He pointed out that we \nhave had a Presidential election in this country every 4 years since \n1788. Senator McConnell pointed that out, and he said we would not use \nthis year's election as an excuse to put off the people's business for \nanother day. In other words, it is a Presidential year, and some around \ntown are writing and saying: Well, they will not get much done in \nCongress this year. We are saying on the Republican side of the aisle, \nand I hope it is being said on both sides of the aisle, that there is \nno excuse for Congress to take a year off, given the serious issues \nfacing our country.\n\n  A number of politicians are campaigning for change, we have all \nheard. Republican Senators are ready to help, working with our \ncolleagues, to give the Senate an opportunity to vote for real change. \nWe wish to change the way Washington does business by going to work on \nbig issues facing our country. And not just go to work on them but to \nget principled solutions this year. And because this is the Senate, \nwhere it often takes 60 votes to get a meaningful result, that means we \ninvite the Democrats to work with us in a bipartisan way to get those \nresults.\n  Republicans didn't seek our offices to do bad things to Democrats. We \nare here to do good things for our country, and there is plenty to do. \nWe see what is happening in the housing market, with oil prices, with \nrising health care costs. We know we need to move quickly with a \nbipartisan approach to help get the economy back on track. Our \npreference is to let businesses and people keep and spend more of their \nown money to boost the economy. We want to grow the economy, not the \nGovernment.\n  We know we need, as Senator Kyl was saying, to intercept \ncommunications among terrorists to protect our country. We saw the \nRockefeller-Bond bipartisan proposal passed by 13 to 2 in the \nIntelligence Committee. Our solution is to make sure companies aren't \npenalized for helping us protect ourselves, while at the same time \nsecuring individual rights. We want a strong national defense.\n  We see there are 40 million or so Americans uninsured, and we want to \nchange that. We don't want to take a year off in dealing with health \ninsurance. We want to start this year. As the Republican leader said, \nour goal is that every American have health insurance, starting with \nsmall business health insurance plans, moving on to reforming the Tax \nCode so Americans can afford to buy private insurance. There are a \nnumber of Democratic and Republican proposals on reaching the goal we \nhave in helping every American to have health insurance. We can start \nthis year.\n  There is no need to wait to deal with Medicaid and Medicare spending \nanother year. We all know, at their present pace of growth, those two \naccounts will bankrupt our Government. It is irresponsible to wait. \nThat is a bipartisan conclusion. There are a number of proposals from \nboth sides of the aisle to begin to deal with that, from Senator Gregg \nand Senator Conrad, to Senator Feinstein and Senator Domenici and \nSenator Voinovich as well. We should get started. These are the \nprinciples of fiscal responsibility and limited Government.\n  Last year, we took some important steps to keep jobs from going \noverseas by growing more jobs at home. We see the problem of \ncompetition with China and India. We worked together to pass a bill--\nthe American COMPETES Act--authorizing $34 billion to keep our \nbrainpower advantage. Now let us implement it. Senator Hutchison of \nTexas, Senators Bingaman and Domenici of New Mexico, and many others \nhave worked hard on this. So let us implement more advanced placement \ncourses for low-income students, a million and a half more; more highly \ntrained scientists and engineers coming in to help grow jobs in the \nUnited States; and 10,000 more math and science teachers. That we can \ndo.\n  We know we have to be bipartisan to get a result. Some things are \nbipartisan, and I have mentioned many of them, but some things should \nbe bipartisan that aren't. For example, the Federal Government is \nsaying the Salvation Army can't require its employees to speak English \non the job. Well, Americans, by 80 to 17 percent, believe employers \nshould be able to require their employees to speak America's common \nlanguage on the job. We have legislation to make that clear. It is \nbipartisan to some degree, but not as bipartisan as it ought to be. The \nprinciple is right there above the Senate Presiding Officer's desk. It \nsays: One from many--``e pluribus unum.''\n  Another challenge that should be more bipartisan, because most \nAmericans see the wisdom of it, is addressing a shortage of medical \ncare in rural America caused by lawsuit abuse. OB-GYN doctors are \nabandoning rural areas across America and mothers are driving too far \nfor prenatal health care and to have their babies. We should work \nacross party lines to change that. The solution we have offered is to \nstop runaway lawsuits that make doctors pay $100,000 or more a year for \nmalpractice insurance. That is why they leave the rural areas. This is \nthe principle of equal opportunity.\n  There is plenty of work to do. Thirty years ago, I began my service \nas the Governor of Tennessee. I was a young Republican Governor and the \nState was very Democratic, thank you. So the media ran up to the big \nDemocratic speaker of the house, Ned McWherter, and said: Mr. Speaker, \nwhat are you going to do with this new young Republican Governor? And \nto their surprise, the speaker said: I am going to help him. Because if \nhe succeeds, our State succeeds. And that is the way we worked for 8 \nyears.\n  Now, we are not naive about politics in Tennessee. We had, and have, \nour fights. We argued about our principles. If I had a better schools \nprogram, they had an even better schools program on the other side. But \nwe kept our eye on the ball. In the end, we worked together. In the \nend, we got results. That is why we brought in the auto industry and \ncreated the best four-lane highway system and created chairs and \ncenters of excellence at our universities that still exist, and we \nbegan to pay teachers more for teaching well.\n  I would like nothing more than to move that kind of cooperation from \nTennessee to DC. I sense that from Democrats and Republicans all \nthrough this body. Of course, we will argue. We were elected because we \nhave differences. This is a debating society. But we don't stop with \nour disagreements, we should finish with our results. So we are here to \nchange the way Washington does business, as the Republican leader said, \nand I look forward to a constructive year of helping our country move \nahead with a steady\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\nstream of specific solutions to big problems that get results because \nthey either are bipartisan or because they should be bipartisan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would like to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Tennessee who recently was elected to the leadership on \nthis side of the aisle. His responsibility and mine is to help try to \nfind a way to work together, not by sacrificing our principles but to \ntry to find that common ground rather than what divides us.\n  But first let me also express my congratulations to our new colleague \nfrom Mississippi, Senator Wicker, who had a distinguished career in the \nHouse of Representatives and comes here, I know, with a lot of hopes \nand aspirations. I look forward to working with him as he represents \nhis State and as I represent my State, the State of Texas, and as we \nall work together to represent the United States, hopefully, to provide \nfor the aspirations and dreams of the American people to make it \npossible for them to live their dream. That is what the United States \nhas always been; that is what it should remain.\n  I cannot help but reflect, returning from our holiday recess, I had \nsomebody this morning in the cafeteria say: Welcome back from your \nvacation.\n  I said: Well, I prefer to call it the alternate work period because \nit was not entirely a vacation, although I did get some time off, as \ndid my colleagues. But I trust that we all came back refreshed and \nrejuvenated and ready to take on the challenging work that lies ahead.\n  I have to say, if I heard it once, I heard it a thousand times as I \ntraveled the State of Texas, people are frustrated with Washington, DC. \nThey think Washington is broken. They do not hear about those occasions \nwhen we work together to pass legislation on a bipartisan basis. They \nhear the conflict and the divisiveness and the partisanship, and they \ndo not like it. I had to tell them, each of my constituents when they \nmentioned that: Well, I do not like it very much either. I did not run \nfor the Senate and I do not serve in a position of public trust to come \nup and pick fights.\n  Everybody knows in politics it is always possible to pick a fight, \nbut it does not take any particular genius to do that. What we ought to \nbe doing, and what it takes hard work to do, is trying to find common \nground. There is plenty of common ground.\n  Senator Alexander mentioned a number of tremendous bipartisan \naccomplishments--the America Competes Act. There have been a number of \nopportunities for us to work together in a bipartisan way. I am \nparticularly proud of some legislation that Senator Pat Leahy, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, and I were the cosponsors of that \nthe President signed into law in December, the first reform of the \nFreedom of Information Act in perhaps as much as 25 years.\n  I think perhaps the best anecdote to public skepticism about \nWashington is greater transparency because I believe giving the public \ninformation about how their Government works is a way to empower them \nto hold elected officials and Government accountable. When things \nhappen in secret, behind closed doors, that does not happen. So I am \ndelighted there are plenty of opportunities for us to work together. I \nthink we should embrace them, not run away from them or look for \nopportunities for us to pick fights and to feed that skepticism and \nreally the sense that I think many people expressed to me that they \nfeel as though Washington is increasingly irrelevant when it comes to \ndealing with the challenges that affect our lives.\n  The economy is one that has, of course, come roaring to the forefront \nas an issue on which we need to work together. I was pleased to hear \nSpeaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid say they wanted to work with \nthe President to come up with a stimulus package that is timely, \ntargeted, and temporary, something that would hopefully get the economy \nmoving again as it has been for roughly the last 4 years, where we have \nseen an unbroken record of growth of the economy, increased number of \njobs, some 9 million new jobs created.\n  Frankly, the way that happened is because we allowed the American \ntaxpayer and small businesses to keep more of what they earned so they \ncould invest it, they could spend it on the education for their \nchildren, they could do whatever they wanted to with it because it is \ntheirs. Sometimes I think it is helpful to remind ourselves that the \nmoney that hard-working Americans earn is their money. It is not ours. \nIt is not the Federal Government's money.\n  Sometimes I think when people are in Washington too long they begin \nto think of this as revenue pay-fors, ways to raise funds so that \nGovernment can grow bigger and spend people's money. Well, the American \npeople understand there are some things they cannot do for themselves \nand Government has to do, such as the common defense, and they are \nwilling to pay their taxes for efficient Government that delivers a \nparticular result that Government only can provide.\n  But we ought not to use this stimulus package, the downturn in the \neconomy, as a way to burden the American people with more taxes or find \nnew ways to grow the size of the Federal Government. So I hope we can \ncontinue in a careful and judicious and thoughtful way to find common \nground to work on a stimulus package that the President will sign and \nthat will enjoy bipartisan support.\n\n  Now, there is a lot of skepticism, as I said, about Washington. Part \nof it is that the Government does not spend the tax dollars well, \nefficiently. I have to tell you there is good evidence of that. There \nis a Web site associated with the Office of Management and Budget \ncalled expectmore.gov. I hope people will look at that.\n  What I discovered when I looked at it is that the Office of \nManagement and Budget has reviewed 1,000 different Federal Government \nprograms and found 22 percent of them either ineffective or the Office \nof Management and Budget cannot tell whether they are serving their \nintended purpose.\n  I am not sure which is worse. Either they are proven ineffective or \nelse you cannot tell. Either way that is unacceptable and we need to \nfind a way to deal with those wasteful Washington programs that need to \nbe eliminated. I proposed a Federal sunset commission that is modeled \nafter many of the States, such as my State, the State of Texas, where \nyou have periodic reviews of those programs, and every once in a while \nthe bureaucrats have to come in and justify the reason for the \nprogram's existence.\n  If circumstances have changed, the program is no longer needed, it \ncan be eliminated or the budget, rather than securing an inflationary \nor cost-of-living increase in the size of that program each year \nwithout any real scrutiny or oversight, they start out with a zero-\nbased budget and have to justify each dollar of that budget.\n  So I think a national sunset commission would help us eliminate more \nwasteful Washington spending. As I said, I am proud of the work that \nSenator Leahy and I were able to do in a bipartisan way to reform the \nFreedom of Information Act to give people more information about their \nGovernment so they can hold Government and Government officials \naccountable. But I think there is more that we need to do. Recently, \nearlier this month, the Government launched a new Web site called \nwww.usaspending.gov which allows Americans to search for Federal grants \nand contracts. I am going to propose legislation--I am eager to find \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle with whom I can work; I am \nsure there will be a number of them--to build on this Web site and \nallow taxpayers to see how the Government spends their tax dollars.\n  Now, I wish I could say I thought of this on my own, but the fact is, \nour comptroller in the State of Texas--may I inquire how much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am proud of the work that is being done \nby the State comptroller of Texas, Susan Combs, who has created a Web \nsite wherethemoneygoes.gov. We need to use greater transparency and the \naccountability that goes with it to restore public confidence in how \nGovernment works. I look forward to working with our colleagues across \nthe aisle and hope to find common ground, not to pick fights and find \nout where we differ but to find where we can move this country forward \nand solve some of the problems that confront us.\n\n[[Page S23]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas for \nspeaking to a higher level of bipartisan cooperation in the Senate.\n  I sensed this in returning to Illinois and out on the campaign trail \nfor my colleague, Senator Obama, that this is a sentiment widely \nshared. The American people understand we have a lot of challenges in \nthis country, and they also understand it is easy to gridlock the \nSenate.\n  We had an all-time record number of filibusters initiated by the \nminority side of the aisle this last year. Sixty-two, I believe, was \nthe final count, which eclipsed the 2-year record of 62 filibusters \nthat had been prevailing. Certainly, we all know how to stop this train \nin the Senate. Minority rights are well respected by the Senate rules. \nAnd 15 minutes into our service in the Senate, you might hear the words \n``unanimous consent,'' and realize: Well, I will be darned. If I stand \nup and object, everything stops. And it is a fact.\n  Many Senators have used that for valid and invalid reasons, but it \nhas been used a lot. We have one Senator on the other side of the aisle \nwho takes pride in the fact that he has singlehandedly stopped 150 \npieces of legislation from even being debated and considered on the \nSenate floor. Many of them are not even controversial.\n  I hope we find a way around this. I want to respect every Senator's \nright, but if we truly want bipartisan cooperation, there are ways to \nachieve that. Using filibusters would not be that; objecting to bills \njust categorically would not be that approach either. But the one thing \nthe American people certainly want us to do is to wake up and smell the \ncoffee. And this morning, if you woke up and smelled the coffee, you \nalso smelled something burning on Wall Street. What is burning is the \nDow Jones Industrial Average. I do not know what it is at this moment, \nbut it has been pretty awful starting this day, and it has been pretty \nawful for a long time.\n  It is interesting in American politics that when I first started \nrunning for Congress 25 years ago, the most important information for \nmost voters was how many people were unemployed. And the monthly \nreports on unemployment really kind of fueled the campaign. If a \nPresident had more and more people out of work, there was a downturn in \nthe economy and a downturn in that President's popularity. That was \nhistorically the standard. But over time we have stopped talking about \nthe unemployment figures as much and tend to watch the stock market a \nlot more.\n  I think it has to do with many of us have our retirement savings tied \nup in mutual funds and 401(k)s and IRAs. And so what happens is the \nstock market, at least in the back of our minds, is how I am doing. If \nthe stock market is not doing well, my family is not doing well. So \nwhen the news came out yesterday that the bottom is falling out of \ninternational markets, and the Dow Jones opens with a tremendous slump \nof 400 points or more, people understand something is not right.\n  Last week, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Paulson, called me and \nmany leaders in the Senate and all but acknowledged that we need to do \nsomething, and do it in a hurry, if we are going to try to stop this \neconomy from sliding into a recession.\n  Well, I agree with him completely. If you look at what we have done \nover the past 7 years, to many of us it is no surprise where we are \ntoday. There were many on the Republican side who argued for years and \nyears, and still continue to argue, that tax cuts for the wealthiest \npeople in America are the answer to everything.\n  If you have a surplus, you need a tax cut. If you have a deficit and \nneed to stimulate the economy, you need a tax cut. You always need a \ntax cut. This kind of moralistic position of cutting taxes for the \nwealthiest people in America has been the basic doctrine of the \nRepublicans in leadership for a long time.\n  They have had their way: President Bush's tax cuts, even though they \nhave generated the highest deficits in our history; a greater \ndependence on foreign countries and foreign capital than ever before; \nthe fact that the President made history, in an unusual way, in calling \nfor more tax cuts in the midst of a war.\n  All of these things notwithstanding, our economy is slumping. There \nare a lot of reasons for that. One of the reasons, of course, is we \nhave ignored the obvious. The strength of America is the strength of \nour families. And 40 percent of the families in America do not get \nclose to the numbers that Republicans consider to be the right level \nfor tax cuts.\n  Over 40 percent of the people in this Nation struggle in an effort to \npay their bills and really live paycheck to paycheck.\n  It doesn't take much to derail that family train, whether it is the \nloss of a job or serious illness or some other catastrophe. These \npeople have not been a priority of the Republican leadership in the \nSenate, the House, or the White House. Now comes the time when the \neconomy is slumping, and all of a sudden this group that had been \nignored for so long by Republicans in their tax-cutting priorities is, \nfront and center, the centerpiece for saving the American economy. \nWelcome to real America, I say to my colleagues. These are the people \nwho have been struggling for a long time and waiting to be \nrediscovered. They should be rediscovered.\n  I am troubled to learn--at least some speculation is out there--that \nthis so-called stimulus package is going to be limited so that it still \ndoesn't help those in middle-income status or lower middle-income \nstatus, those working families who really do put up a struggle trying \nto get by. You don't have to spend much time out in the real world to \nmeet them. They are not the legendary welfare kings and queens. These \npeople get up and go to work every morning. They work hard. They don't \nmake a lot of money. They struggle with no health insurance or health \ninsurance that is virtually worthless. They struggle with trying to \nfill up a gas tank. It may be a beat-up old car, but it is their \nlifeline to get to work, to make a paycheck, to keep things going. They \nstruggle with heating bills in a harsh and cold winter. They struggle \nwith the dream of a college education for their kids and pray they will \nhave a better life. These are the real-world struggles of real families \nwho have been largely ignored in this economic debate in Washington.\n  When we get down to a discussion of an economic stimulus package, we \nignore these families again at our peril. Any stimulus package that \nfails to acknowledge their need will fail to stimulate the economy. I \ndon't know what the parameters will be. Targeted, temporary--all of \nthese things make sense. But let's make sure we are doing the right \nthing for the right people.\n  Many people go to work every day making a minimum income. They \nstruggle to get by. At the end of the day, they pay their taxes but \ndon't have a Federal income tax liability. How can that be? They are \npaying their Social Security taxes, they are paying the Medicare \nrequirements, all of the things all workers have to pay. But they don't \nmake enough money because of the size of the family to be liable for \nFederal income tax.\n  Who are these people? I can give an example. We estimate that 40 \npercent of all households may not make enough to qualify for one of the \nproposed stimulus packages. Families of four making less than $25,000 a \nyear would get nothing. A family of four making $25,000 a year, if it \nisn't given a refundable tax credit, will receive nothing by way of a \nstimulus check.\n  What does a family do if they are making $25,000 a year and receives \n$1,600, let's say, from the Federal Government? Well, if you are trying \nto get by on $2,000 a month, $1,600 from the Federal Government may be \nthe answer to your prayers. You may finally be able to turn around and \nbuy something you have put off for a long time. You may be able to \ncatch up on some of your bills. Getting $1,600 when you are making \n$2,000 a month is a big deal.\n  Let's look at the other end of the equation. What if you are making \n$20,000 a month and you get $1,600 more? That is nice. I am sure there \nis something you can do. Will it change your lifestyle? Will it change \nthe economy? It is not as likely.\n  That goes back to something I learned a long time ago from a Jesuit\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\npriest who taught economics at Georgetown University called the \nmarginal propensity to save. For every dollar you are given, what is \nthe likelihood you will spend it and the likelihood you will save it? \nEconomists look at that, and they know that if you are in a lower \nincome group, you are less likely to save, more likely to spend, \nbecause you are living paycheck to paycheck. If you have a lot of \nmoney, you are more likely to save and less likely to spend because you \nare meeting your needs each paycheck. So when we devise a stimulus \npackage, let's make sure we keep that fundamental rule of economics in \nmind. Let's make sure struggling families at lower incomes aren't left \nbehind. The fact that they don't pay income tax doesn't mean they are \ntax free. They do pay taxes for Social Security, for Medicare, other \nthings--sales tax, for example. This is the targeted group when it \ncomes to a real stimulus.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter sent \nto all Members in leadership on January 18 from John Sweeney. John is \npresident of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of \nIndustrial Organizations, the AFL-CIO. John lays out his priorities, \nthe priorities of his organization when it comes to a stimulus package, \na short-term stimulus.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 18, 2008.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid: As Congress \n     considers legislative responses to current and anticipated \n     weakness in the U.S. economy, the AFL-CIO urges you (1) to \n     include in a short-term stimulus package measures that will \n     have the most impact on the economy and get the ``biggest \n     bang for the buck'': and (2) to address the underlying causes \n     of current economic weakness.\n\n\n                          Short-Term Stimulus\n\n       It is encouraging that President Bush has recognized the \n     immediate need for an economic stimulus package. Judging from \n     initial reports, however, it appears that President Bush's \n     proposals are too heavily weighted towards tax cuts over \n     much-needed spending, do not address crucial problems facing \n     working families, and do not target tax benefits to those \n     families who need them most and will spend them fastest.\n       In particular, we are concerned that the President's income \n     tax cut proposal would not be sufficiently stimulative \n     because it fails to target lower-income and middle-income \n     households who, as the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     wrote last week, are likely to spend a larger share of any \n     tax benefit they receive. We are also concerned that the \n     President's proposal to cut business taxes would not be \n     sufficiently timely and, because of the linkages between \n     federal and state tax codes, could trigger economically \n     depressing budget cuts and tax increases by state \n     governments.\n       While we understand that compromise will be necessary to \n     enact a stimulus package within the next month, we urge you \n     to insist on legislative measures that will have the greatest \n     stimulative impact on the economy and would not lead to \n     economically depressing budget cuts and tax increases at the \n     state and local level.\n       (1) Extension of unemployment benefits. The Congressional \n     Budget Office (CBO) and Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com \n     rank unemployment benefits at the top of the list of possible \n     stimulus choices, increasing economic demand by $1.73 to \n     $2.15 for each dollar spent. We urge you to enact a one-year \n     federal unemployment compensation program that provides 20 \n     weeks of extended unemployment benefits in all states; 13 \n     additional weeks in ``high unemployment'' states with an \n     unemployment rate of 6.0% or more; a $50 per week benefit \n     increase; and additional administrative funding. We also urge \n     Congress to provide federal financing for states to expand \n     eligibility to lower-income workers, part-time workers, and \n     workers who leave their jobs for compelling family reasons.\n       (2) Increase in food stamp benefits. Many food stamp \n     recipients are not tax filers and do not receive unemployment \n     benefits, so they would not benefit from a tax rebate or \n     unemployment benefit extension. An increase in food stamp \n     benefits would be one of the most effective forms of economic \n     stimulus, since it would almost certainly be spent in its \n     entirety very quickly, boosting demand for goods and services \n     in the short term.\n       (3) Tax rebate targeted towards middle-income and lower \n     income taxpayers. The individual income tax rebates proposed \n     by President Bush should be retargeted towards middle-income \n     and lower-income taxpayers, who are most likely to spend the \n     money and thereby stimulate economic activity, by making them \n     available to taxpayers who pay payroll taxes but not income \n     taxes. According to Mark Zandi, a one-time uniform tax rebate \n     would increase demand by $1.19 for every dollar spent.\n       (4) Fiscal relief for state and local governments to avoid \n     the economically depressing effect of tax increases and \n     budget cuts. State and local governments are experiencing \n     lower property and sales tax revenues, due to the slumping \n     housing market and slowing economic activity. Tax collections \n     are down in 24 states, and at least 20 states are expected to \n     have budget deficits this year. Since many states have \n     balanced budget requirements, a decrease in revenues can lead \n     to budget cuts or tax increases, both of which intensify the \n     impact of an economic downturn. Congress should provide at \n     least $30 billion in aid to the states in the form of \n     revenue-sharing grants and increases in the Medicaid match. \n     According to Mark Zandi, state fiscal relief would increase \n     demand by $1.24 for every dollar spent.\n       (5) Acceleration of ready-to-go construction projects. \n     Putting Americans to work directly in construction and repair \n     projects is an obvious response to rising unemployment, and \n     would directly create additional demand. Unlike tax rebates, \n     all of this investment would be spent to increase domestic \n     economic activity, none would be spent on imports, and none \n     would be saved.\n       Furthermore, we believe public investment in infrastructure \n     can be targeted and timely. For example, there is a backlog \n     of at least $100 billion in needed repairs to U.S. schools. \n     There are 6,000 bridges that have been declared unsafe, and \n     many of these projects are ready for work to begin \n     immediately.\n       We urge Congress to provide $40 billion for public \n     investment in infrastructure, including school, bridge, and \n     sewage treatment repair.\n\n\n         addressing the longer-term causes of economic weakness\n\n       We are hopeful that Congress and President Bush can enact a \n     short-term stimulus within the next month. However, given the \n     nature of legislative compromise, any stimulus package \n     enacted within that time frame is likely to be only a down \n     payment on what is necessary to address this country's \n     economic problems-even in the short term. Congress may even \n     need to consider a second stimulus package later in the year.\n       Congress must also begin focusing today on the most \n     fundamental underlying causes of our current economic \n     weakness. While it is appropriate for Congress to focus on \n     measures that have an immediate economic impact as it crafts \n     a short-term stimulus package, this is no excuse to put our \n     heads in the sand and do nothing about the underlying longer-\n     term problems afflicting our economy.\n       One of the underlying causes of our current economic \n     weakness is the stagnation of ordinary Americans' incomes. \n     This will probably be the first business cycle in which the \n     typical family will have lower incomes at the end of the \n     recovery than they did at the beginning of the last \n     recession. Wage stagnation, which began in the 1970s, has led \n     to longer working hours, higher consumer debt, and increasing \n     reliance on home equities. But today home values are \n     plummeting, home foreclosures are on the rise, consumer debt \n     is reaching unsustainable levels, and prices for energy, \n     health care, and education are soaring out of reach for many \n     working families.\n       There are various long-term solutions to the underlying \n     problem of wage stagnation, They include fixing our broken \n     labor laws so that workers who want to form a union can \n     bargain with their employers for better wages and benefits; \n     ensuring affordable health care and retirement security; \n     fixing our flawed trade policies; and reactivating the \n     historically successful fiscal and monetary policies that \n     place a higher priority on full employment. Near-term energy \n     investments in the greening of our energy base would also \n     offer both environmental and economic payoffs in the form of \n     good jobs and improved competitiveness.\n       Another underlying cause of our current economic weakness \n     is deregulation of the financial sector. The absence of \n     transparency and effective regulation of the mortgage and \n     financial services industries cries out for urgent attention.\n       Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Reid: though we have \n     framed this discussion in the rather dry and impersonal \n     language of stimulus and macroeconomic impacts, there is a \n     human dimension to this story we can never lose sight of. \n     Many, many working families all over this country are barely \n     hanging on and are deeply worried that the steep economic \n     downdraft will pull them off their perilous perch. The real \n     test for any economic proposal considered by Congress in the \n     coming weeks and months should be: what does it mean for \n     them?\n       Thank you in advance for your consideration of our \n     concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John J. Sweeney,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. If Members look at the list of things John Sweeney has \nhighlighted, he understands what I have just described: the rules of \neconomics, the fact that a lot of working families have not been part \nof the grand bargain in Washington for a long time. John Sweeney says: \nLet's extend unemployment benefits. That certainly is something on \nwhich money is well spent.\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\nEvery dollar you put into unemployment benefits increases economic \nactivity by $1.73, up to $2.15. It is a terrific boost to the economy, \nplus it goes to the people who need it the most, the ones who are out \nof work.\n  Mr. Sweeney also calls for an increase in food stamp benefits. Many \nof these people are not tax filers and don't receive unemployment \nbenefits, so they would benefit. They are struggling with their jobs, \ntrying to get by, and many of them still qualify for food stamps.\n  He also talks about a tax rebate targeted toward middle and lower \nincome taxpayers. He talks about acceleration of construction projects. \nThat is money well spent too. It isn't just the Tax Code we should be \nlooking at. There are other ways to move the economy and do the right \nthing for America.\n  One of the things Mr. Sweeney notes in his letter is that there is a \nbacklog of $100 billion in needed repairs to American schools. He also \nsays there are 6,000 bridges that have been declared unsafe. The \nPresiding Officer certainly knows that issue well, as chair of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee. There is a lot we can do to \nimprove the economy of America by improving the infrastructure. I don't \nhave to remind people what happened in Minnesota not long ago when a \nbridge failed. People died. It is an indication to all of us that we \nhave to be aware of that need.\n  This letter I commend to all colleagues because it is a good starting \npoint when we discuss what we can do to this economy to make a \ndifference, a real stimulus package.\n  This package should be funded at appropriate levels to have an impact \non our gross domestic product. The money should go by way of help to \ntaxpayers and their families who truly are struggling. I just have to \ntell you, if you are making a quarter million a year, the notion that \nthe Federal Government is going to send a rebate check to Members of \nCongress and people who make dramatically more money--wait a minute; \nwhat is this all about? Doesn't it make more sense for us to focus on \nthose folks who are struggling who will spend it, who will energize the \neconomy, than maybe giving enough money for families so that they can \nput a little extra coat of varnish on their yacht? Is that really an \neconomic stimulus? I don't think so.\n  I hope we will be able to help those businesses that will create \ngood-paying jobs in America. That is critically important. I hope we \nwill do this in a way mindful of the need for unemployment insurance \nand food stamps for those who are truly at the bottom and trying to \nmove on with their lives and make a new life for their families.\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities issued a statement and \nsaid that the stimulus plan that some have suggested may fail a test of \nbeing effective if it doesn't help families making under $40,000 a \nyear. Keep in mind that if you are being paid the minimum wage in \nAmerica, you are making a little over $20,000 a year. So even people \nmaking twice the minimum wage and more would receive no help from some \nof proposals made already. We don't need to bypass 45 percent of \nhouseholds, 65 million of them with modest incomes. If a family of four \nhas an income below $41,000 a year, under some of the proposals being \ndiscussed, they receive no help at all. We have to make sure they are \nincluded. We have to make certain the economic stimulus package really \nreaches those who have been left behind by the tax cuts for wealthy \npeople that have been in vogue for so long in Washington.\n  These families are the strength of our country. These are the people \nwho get up every morning and go to work, raise the kids, and make the \nneighborhoods and towns that make America strong. It is time for us to \ntry to come together on a bipartisan basis, get an economy moving \nforward which helps all of us by making certain we don't leave behind \nthose families at the end of the economic ladder who have been ignored \nfor so long.\n  During the course of this break, I visited with a lot of families. It \nis hard to imagine sometimes, for those of us who are lucky enough to \nmake a good living and have good health insurance, what these poor \nfamilies put up with in trying every single month to keep it together. \nIt is a lot of stress and strain. There is no stimulus package we will \npass that will wave a magic wand and make their lives miraculously \nbetter. But woe to us if we pass a stimulus package which ignores the \nreality of economic sacrifice and struggle in America. Woe to us if we \npass a stimulus package which ends up putting money in the hands of \nthose who, frankly, don't need it as much as others. And woe to us if, \nat the end of the day, we stay hidebound to some old theories that have \nnot worked and find our Nation sliding into a recession where we will \nall suffer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, is the Senate in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I rise to speak for less than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 12\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to make two points. First, the Finance Committee held a \nhearing this morning--in fact, it is going on right now--on an economic \nstimulus package, pressing the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, Peter Orszag, on various options that will stimulate the \neconomy the most and what options will help people who need their money \nthe most. That is not just all Americans who pay income taxes but \npeople who don't pay income taxes, people who don't pay payroll taxes \nbut file because they think, as good Americans, they should--they have \nno income tax liability and no payroll tax liability--and also some \nsenior citizens who file income tax returns but who do not have any \nsignificant income tax liability. The fact is, if the rebate alone were \nto be given to anybody who files an income tax return, which was not \nthe case with the 2001 rebate program--that applied only to people who \npaid income taxes--if a rebate were to apply to all filers irrespective \nof whether they paid income tax, that would reach 90-plus percent of \nall Americans. Add to that extending unemployment insurance benefits \nand food stamp benefits, I think that package would really help people \nwho need it the most.\n  There are various ways to put this together. I even suggested as a \npossibility, so as not to spend more than we should on a total package, \nthat whereas the President is suggesting an $800 rebate for individual \nfilers and a $1,600 rebate for couples, that could be significantly cut \ndown, but give a bonus to households that have children so that a \ncouple with two or three children would get an additional, say, $400 \nbonus per child in addition to the, say, $400 or $500 payment an \nindividual would get or, say, an $800 check that a couple would get.\n  My point is, the Finance Committee is exploring different ways to \nmake sure we do what is best. Of course, it will depend on some \nnegotiation with the White House and both Houses of Congress. But I \nwant to make the point clearly that we in the Finance Committee are \ndoing our level best to try to find what works best, to get the \ngreatest bang for the buck, with a view toward getting a stimulus \npackage passed quickly, not loading it up with measures that are going \nto bog it down and prevent passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S25-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S25-S26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INDIAN HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise to speak briefly on the next \norder of business, and that is the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  In the 1939 WPA Guide to Montana, it is written:\n\n       The Indian attitude toward the land was expressed by a Crow \n     named Curly.\n\n  He was from the Crow Indian tribe. Here is what he said:\n\n       The soil you see is not ordinary soil--it is the dust of \n     the blood, the flesh, and the bones of our ancestors. You \n     will have to dig down to find Nature's earth, for the upper \n     portion is Crow, my blood and my dead. I do not want to give \n     it up.\n\n  But over our long national history, we all know, sadly, the Federal \nGovernment repeatedly separated America's original inhabitants from the \nland they so dearly loved and continue to love. As a result of that sad \nand sometimes dishonorable history, as a result of treaties, statutes, \ncourt decisions,\n\n[[Page S26]]\n\nexecutive orders, and moral obligations, the United States owes a \nsingular debt to its Native Americans.\n  In partial fulfillment of that obligation, in 1976, Congress passed \nthe first Indian Health Care Improvement Act. That 1976 law was the \nfirst legislative statement of goals for Federal Indian health care \nprograms. That law established the first statutory requirements for the \nprovision of resources to meet those goals.\n  In that 1976 act, the Congress found that:\n\n       Federal health services to maintain and improve the health \n     of the Indians are consonant with and required by the Federal \n     Government's historical and unique legal relationship with, \n     and resulting responsibility to, the American Indian people.\n\n  Today, when we get to the bill--I think roughly in about an hour from \nnow--at long last, we will have before us the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act of 2007. It has been a long trail that has led us here \ntoday. It is important we made the journey to get here. This bill will \nprovide better health care for nearly 2 million American Indians from \n562 federally recognized American Indian and Alaska Native tribes. We \nneed to improve the health care of Native Americans. Native Americans \nsuffer from tuberculosis at a rate 7\\1/2\\ times higher than the non-\nIndian population. The Native American suicide rate is 60 percent \nhigher than in the general population.\n  Medicare--our program for seniors--spends about $6,800 per person a \nyear. Medicaid--the low-income program for health care--spends about \n$4,300 per person. The Bureau of Prisons spends about $3,200 per person \nfor health care. But the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health \nService spends only $2,100 for health care. That is less than a third \nof Medicare, less than half of Medicaid, and a third less than what the \nFederal Government spends for medical care for prisoners.\n  From the beginning of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976, \nMedicare and Medicaid have played a part in paying for health care \ndelivered to Native Americans. The 1976 act amended the Social Security \nAct ``to permit reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid for covered \nservices provided by the Indian Health Service.'' Today, Medicare, \nMedicaid, and now the Children's Health Insurance Program are a \nsignificant source of funding for health care delivered to Native \nAmericans.\n  I am proud that an important part of the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act before us today is a product of the Finance Committee. \nThat committee's provisions address health care provided to Indians \nthrough Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. Those provisions would increase outreach and enrollment of \nIndians in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. These \nprovisions would protect Indian health care providers from \ndiscrimination in payment for services and require States and the \nSecretary of HHS to consult with Indian health providers, and they \nwould ensure that Medicaid managed care organizations pay Indian health \nproviders appropriately.\n  It is a good package. It is not near enough. It is an abomination--it \nis a tragedy what little attention we pay to Native Americans' health \ncare needs. I wish more people in the country would visit Indian \nreservations. I wish they would visit Indian Health Service hospitals. \nThey would realize the abysmal plight of so many people in America. But \nthis bill helps. It helps provide more resources where people need it--\nnot near enough but more--and I strongly encourage the Senate to pass \nthis bill when we get to it in the next hour or so. Congress should \nreauthorize the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  The United States owes a debt to the Native American population whose \nancestors are tied up with the very soil all Americans share. The \nFederal Government owes a duty to help improve the health of American \nIndians. And we in this Senate have the obligation to pass this act and \nhonor the flesh, the bones, and the blood of our Indian brethren.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S26-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1200, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1200) to amend the Indian Health Care \n     Improvement Act to revise and extend the act.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this is a piece of legislation we have \nreported out of the Committee on Indian Affairs in the Senate. Senator \nMurkowski, the vice chair, and I have worked hard on these issues. We \nhave also made some changes since reporting the bill out of the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs and will offer a substitute that will be \ncosponsored by both of us. We are now clearing that substitute, and I \nwill, at the appropriate time today, I hope, offer the substitute \nversion.\n  Some might wonder why there is a separate Indian health care bill, \nand the answer is relatively simple: because this country has a trust \nresponsibility--a trust responsibility that has grown over a long \nperiod of time and has been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, affirmed \nby treaties with various Indian tribes--a trust responsibility to \nprovide health care for Native Americans.\n  The last comprehensive reauthorization of the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act was 15 years ago in 1992. The act itself has been \nexpired for the last 7 years, and it is long past the time for this \nCongress to reauthorize this program. Even though the act has expired, \nthe Indian Health Service continues to provide Indian health care, \ndespite not having a current authorization. But with advances in \nmedicine and in the delivery and in the administration of health care, \nwe need to finally pass this reauthorization and give the Indian \npopulation of this country the advantage of the expansions we will do \nin this reauthorization bill.\n  This legislation reflects the voices and the visions of Indian \nCountry. It also responds to a number of concerns that have been raised \nby others, including the administration. The enactment of this \nreauthorization has been the top priority of myself and the vice chair \nof the committee, Senator Murkowski. I also wish to say the former vice \nchair of the committee, the late Senator Craig Thomas from Wyoming, at \nthe start of this Congress, worked very hard on this legislation and \ncared very deeply about it. We bring this to the floor, remembering the \nwork of Senator Thomas and recognizing his important work.\n  I wish to describe the need for the legislation as I begin before I \ndescribe the legislation itself. I have in the past couple weeks done \nsome listening tours on Indian reservations, particularly in North \nDakota, and we heard and saw many examples of deplorable conditions in \nIndian health care. It is true there are some health care providers in \nthe Indian Health Service that are making very strong efforts to do the \nbest they can, but they are overburdened and understaffed, underfunded. \nI wish to give some examples of that.\n  I wish to show a picture--a photograph, rather--of someone I have \nshown to the Senate before. This is a woman on the reservation in North \nDakota, the Three Affiliated Tribes near New Town, ND. Her name is \nArdel Hale Baker. Ardel Hale Baker has given me consent to use her \nimage. She had chest pains that wouldn't quit. Her blood pressure was \nvery high. So they went to the Indian health clinic, and she was \ndiagnosed as having a heart attack. The clinic staff determined she \nneeded to be sent immediately to the nearest hospital 80 miles away. \nShe told the staff she didn't want to go in an ambulance because she \nknew she would end up being billed for the trip, and she didn't have \nthe money. So she\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\nsigned a waiver declining the ambulance service, but the Indian Health \nService said you have to take it anyway. We have diagnosed a heart \nattack happening here. You have to take the ambulance.\n  She arrived at the hospital and Ardel Hale Baker at the hospital was \nbeing taken out of the ambulance and transferred to a hospital gurney. \nAs this woman, having a heart attack, was transferred to the hospital \ngurney, a nurse saw a piece of paper taped to her thigh and the piece \nof paper taped to her thigh was a piece of paper that was notifying the \nhealth care provider there wasn't going to be any money for this \npatient. The nurse asked this woman who was then having a heart attack \nwhat the envelope was. She pulled the envelope that was taped to her \nleg off her leg and asked: ``Mrs. Baker, is this yours?'' When they \nlooked at the paper, here was the document. The document was from the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, attached by the folks on the \nIndian reservation, taped to her leg as she left to be put in the \nambulance, and it says:\n\n       Understand that Priority 1 care cannot be paid for at this \n     time due to funding issues. A formal denial letter has been \n     issued. If and when funds become available, the health \n     service will do everything possible to pay for Priority 1 \n     care.\n\n  What this means is this--contract health care, which cannot be \ndelivered on the reservation. This reservation has a clinic. It is open \nfrom 9 until 4 every day, 5 days a week. It is not a hospital, it is a \nclinic. For health care that cannot be delivered at that clinic, you \nhave to refer the patient somewhere else. But that has to be paid for \nwith contract health care funds, and they run out very quickly.\n  We had one reservation tell us they were out of health care contract \nmoney in January, 4 months into the fiscal year. On this reservation, \nthey say don't get sick after June because the contract health care \nmoney is gone. This poor woman was loaded onto a hospital gurney with a \npiece of paper taped to her leg, saying to the hospital that if you \nadmit her, understand that the Indian Health Service will not pay. This \nwoman must pay. Obviously, this woman had no money. It was a way to say \nto the hospital that if you admit this patient, you are on your own.\n  Well, I visited a Sioux reservation at Standing Rock, the McLaughlin \nIndian Health Center, a couple of weeks ago. The Standing Rock \nReservation clinic sees 10 patients in the morning and 10 in the \nafternoon. I believe they only have a physician assistant there. The \nreason given in the memorandum about the 10 and 10 was the clinic had \nonly one medical provider and patients signed up in the morning. \nAnybody arriving after the quotas were made were turned away.\n  Harriet Archambault received her last prescription for serious \nhypertension and stomach medication on October 25, 2007. As the \nmedicine ran out, she attempted five times to sign up at the clinic, \nleaving home early in the morning, driving 18 miles to the clinic but \narriving too late each time. Her name was not on the top 10. She \ncouldn't wait at the clinic for a possible opening because she provided \nday care for three of her grandchildren. So her medication ran out.\n  In a conversation with her sister prior to her death, she said: What \ndo I have to do, die first before I finally get my medication? She \ntried five times to drive the nearly 20 miles to the clinic, and five \ntimes failed and never got her medicine, and she died a month later, \nNovember 27, 2007. Her husband told that story because he wants us to \nunderstand that delivery of health care is about life and death.\n  I have shown a photograph to my colleagues. I wish to do so again. It \nis a photo of a precious young lady who died, Ta'shon Rain Littlelight. \nI was at the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana when I met the \ngrandmother of Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight. This was a beautiful 5-year-\nold girl. She loved to dance. This was traditional dance regalia, and \nshe loved to go to dance contests. Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight died. Here \nis how she died. Her grandmother and mother and aunt told me she died, \nwith the last 3 months of her life in unmedicated, severe pain. She \nwent back and back and back to the Crow Tribe's Indian Health Service \nclinic for health problems. They began treating her for depression. \nDepression. During one of the visits, one of the grandparents of \nTa'Shon said: Well, she has a bulbous condition on her fingertips and \ntoes. That suggests there may be a lack of oxygen to the body, or \nsomething is going on. Can't you check that? Ta'Shon was treated for \ndepression.\n  Finally, one day, August 2006, she was rushed from the Crow clinic, \nwhere she had gone once again to the St. Vincent Hospital in Billings, \nMT. The next day she was airlifted to the Denver Children's Hospital \nand was diagnosed with untreatable, incurable cancer. She lived for 3 \nmore months after the tumor was discovered in what her grandmother said \nwas unmedicated pain. She died in September 2006. Her parents and \ngrandparents asked the question: If Ta'Shon's cancer had been detected \nsooner, would this child perhaps have lived?\n  When diagnosed with terminal illness, the one thing Ta'shon Rain \nLittlelight wanted to do was see Cinderella's castle, so Make-a-Wish \nsent her to Orlando. But the night before she was to see the castle, in \nthe hotel room in Orlando, she died in her mother's arms.\n  The question is, for a young girl such as Ta'shon Rain Littlelight, \nshould she have had the same opportunity in health care others have? Is \nthis what we are willing to accept? Not me. This problem has a human \nface. I could tell a dozen more stories similar to Ardel Hale Baker and \nTa'Shon Rain Littlelight.\n  I sat on Indian reservations for a total of probably 6 hours \nlistening to stories about Indian health care. Let me talk about the \nstatistics, if I might.\n  For tuberculosis, the mortality rate for American Indians and Alaskan \nNatives is seven times higher than the American population as a whole.\n  For alcoholism, the mortality rate is six times higher.\n  For diabetes, it is not double but triple--three times higher.\n  Twenty percent of American Indians and Alaskan Natives over age 45 \nhave diabetes. There are reservations in my State where they estimate \nover 50 percent of the adults have diabetes.\n  American Indians and Alaskan Natives have higher rates of sudden \ninfant death syndrome than the rest of the Nation.\n  Injuries are the leading cause of death for Native Americans ages 1 \nto 44. Injuries include pedestrian accidents, vehicular accidents, and \nsuicides.\n  The cervical cancer rate for Indians and Alaskan Natives is four \ntimes higher than the rest of the population.\n  The suicide rate for American Indians and Alaska Natives between ages \n15 and 34 is triple the national average. For Indian teens in the \nnorthern Great Plains, it is 10 times the national average.\n  I have shown my colleagues a photograph of Avis Little Wind. Avis \nLittle Wind is a young teen who died. Avis Little Wind's relatives gave \nme permission to use her photograph. This is a 14-year-old girl who lay \nin bed in a fetal position for 90 days and then killed herself. Her \nsister had taken her life 2 years previous. Her dad had taken his life. \nFor 90 days, somehow, everybody missed little Avis. The school missed \nwondering what happened. She lay in bed for 90 days and then took her \nlife because she felt there was no hope and no help.\n\n  On that reservation, I went and met with the tribal council, school \nadministrators, and her classmates to try to find out how does a kid, \nage 14, fall out of everyone's memory and everyone's vision? What I \nhave discovered is there are a lot of issues, but there was not any \nkind of health care treatment available for a young girl, age 14, who \nhad these kinds of problems. Even had there been health care available, \nthere would not have been a car to drive her there. There is a basic \nlack of transportation. Aside from the fact they don't have the \ncapability to provide the necessary health care treatment that is \nnecessary to intervene, we have to do better. We have a responsibility \nto do better.\n  I wish to address the question of why it is our responsibility. Why \nis the plight of Native Americans a responsibility to the Federal \nGovernment? The simple answer is we are bound to follow the law set \nforth in the Constitution, in treaties, and in the laws of our land.\n\n[[Page S28]]\n\nWe are bound to follow the trust responsibility that has been imposed \non us by the Constitution, the rulings of the Supreme Court, and by \ntreaties.\n  Now, our predecessors long ago negotiated treaties with Indian tribes \nin which we received, as a Nation, hundreds and hundreds of millions of \nacres of Indian homeland to help build this great Nation of ours. In \nreturn for the enormous cessions of land by the Indians, our country \npromised certain things. We promised to provide things such as health \ncare, education, and the general welfare of Native Americans.\n  This chart I am going to show you shows a provision from one of those \ntreaties, and there are a lot of them, most of them broken by our \ncountry. This is with the northern Cheyenne and Arapaho. It says:\n\n       The U.S. hereby agrees to furnish annually to the Indians \n     who settle upon the reservation a physician.\n\n  It says we have your land and we are going to give you a reservation, \nbut we also understand our responsibility, and we will provide health \ncare. We have failed miserably to hold up our end of the bargain.\n  This bill doesn't provide health care for Native Americans simply \nbecause it is the moral and right thing to do. It is, certainly. It is \na bill that requires us to keep our word. It is an active step to \nfulfill our responsibility, our end of the bargain, struck by our \npredecessors a long time ago.\n  In addition to the treaty obligations, the U.S. obligations to Indian \ntribes are set forth in hundreds of U.S. Supreme Court cases and \nFederal statutes.\n  I wish to especially refer to the next chart. In 1831, the U.S. \nSupreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice John Marshall, recognized \na general trust relationship between the United States and Indian \ntribes. He held that the United States assumed a trust responsibility \ntoward the tribes and their members. He explained the United States not \nonly has the authority to deal with Indian tribes and their members, \nbut also the responsibility and obligation to look after their well-\nbeing.\n  In describing Indian tribes as ``domestic dependent nations,'' he \nalso established the relationship in that ruling between the United \nStates and tribes as similar to one between ``a ward to his guardian.''\n  Now, at the time, these Supreme Court decisions were used by the \nUnited States to justify our actions toward the Indians, such as \nforcing Indians from homelands and placing them on reservations. But we \ncannot now ignore these court decisions merely because we are doing a \npoor job of fulfilling our obligation.\n  At the time of the Supreme Court's decision I described, the United \nStates, through the Department of War, was already providing health \ncare services to Indians on reservations. That practice began in 1803 \nand the United States has been providing such health care for over 200 \nyears.\n  One of the initial reasons for providing health care on reservations \nwas because we were the ones who were transmitting diseases to Indian \nnations and forcing them into environments where diseases would \nprevail. That became evident in 1912 when then-President Taft sent a \nspecial message to Congress summarizing a report that documented the \ndeplorable health care conditions on Indian reservations.\n  In 1913, the Public Health Service reached a similarly distressing \nconclusion about the health of Native Americans. The Snyder Act was \npassed in 1921--I am providing the history so people understand what is \nthe context of health care for Indian nations--one of many laws passed \nby the Congress over the last 100 years to try to address the health \ndisparities between American Indians and the rest of our society: The \nSnyder Act of 1921, Indian Health Facilities Act of 1957, Indian Self-\nDetermination of 1975, and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of \n1976 as it was amended in 1992.\n  President Nixon, in 1970, said in a message to the Congress:\n\n       The special relationship between Indians and the Federal \n     Government is the result of solemn obligations which have \n     been entered into by the United States Government. Down \n     through the years through written treaties . . . our \n     Government has made specific commitments to the Indian \n     people. For their part, the Indians have often surrendered \n     claims to vast tracks of land. . . . In exchange, the \n     Government has agreed to provide community services such as \n     health, education and public safety, services which would \n     presumably allow Indian communities to enjoy a standard of \n     living comparable to that of other Americans. This goal, of \n     course, has never been achieved.\n\n  That is in 1970 from the President of the United States, describing \nour responsibility.\n  Let me talk just for a moment about the proposed legislation, having \ndescribed the reason for us to bring a piece of legislation to the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  We know--and it has been like pulling teeth to find this out--we know \nthere is full-scale health care rationing on Indian reservations. It \nshould be front-page headline news in all the biggest newspapers in the \ncountry, but it is not. If it was happening elsewhere, it would be \nfront-page headlines, but it is not now.\n  Forty percent of health care needs of Native Americans are not being \nmet. We meet 60 percent of the health care needs; 40 percent are unmet. \nSo it is rationed, and that is why Ardel Hale Baker, having a heart \nattack, is wheeled in to a hospital with a piece of paper taped to her \nleg saying: ``This isn't going to be paid for.'' It is health care \nrationing, there is no other way to describe it, no soft way to put a \nshine on it. It is health care rationing. It shouldn't happen, and I \nthink it is an outrage, because it is happening on Indian reservations. \nIt is seldom covered by the 24/7 news hour, but it should be, because \nit is a scandal. I hope this is the first step to begin addressing it.\n  This legislation will be described by some who come to the floor of \nthe Senate as not enough. I agree with that assessment. This is a first \nstep, at last, at long last, that should have been done a decade ago. \nIt is a first step in the right direction, but it is a first step as a \nprecursor to real reform because we need reform.\n  This is a reauthorization 10 years after it should have been done. We \nare reauthorizing and expanding programs that I will describe, but we \nneed to do much more. When we move this legislation through the Senate, \nthrough the House, and it is signed by the President, I intend, with \nthe Indian Affairs Committee, to begin immediately with new and more \naggressive reforms, and it is urgent we do so.\n  This bill expands the types of cancer screenings that are available \nto American Indians. It expands the types of communicable and \ninfectious diseases that health programs can monitor and prevent beyond \ntuberculosis, which now is the emphasis, to include any disease. It \nexpands the recruitment and scholarship programs and authorizes nurses \ncurrently serving in the Indian Health Service to spend time teaching \nstudents in nursing programs. These are critical programs, given that \nthere is a 21-percent vacancy rate for physicians in the Indian Health \nService, and the entire Nation faces a shortage of nurses.\n  There is a new program in this legislation dealing with teen suicide \non Indian reservations. I held hearings on this subject. We have worked \nfor legislation that will provide screenings and mental health \ntreatment, and we begin to address those issues with this legislation.\n  Treatment for diabetes: We held a hearing to examine the threat of \ndiabetes to the health of American Indians. It is an unbelievable \nthreat. Diabetes emerges as the most serious and devastating health \nproblems of our time, and nowhere in this country is it worse than on \nIndian reservations. It affects the Indian population in a dramatic \nway.\n  I ask any of my colleagues, if they wonder about that, go to a \nreservation and see if they have a dialysis unit, and watch the people \nin the dialysis unit getting dialysis, some having lost limbs, having \none leg cut off, another leg cut off, still trying to stay alive. The \nravages of diabetes is an unbelievable scourge in Indian country. It is \na serious problem for our entire country, but nowhere is it worse than \namong American Indians. In some communities, the prevalence reaches 60 \npercent of adults. In the 14-year period from 1990 to 2004, the \ndiabetes rate among Indian kids 15 to 19 years old increased 128 \npercent.\n  We expand and enhance the current diabetes screening program. We \ndirect the Secretary to establish an approach to monitor the disease, \nprovide continuing care among Native Americans,\n\n[[Page S29]]\n\nand authorize the Secretary to establish a dialysis program to treat \nthis threatening disease.\n\n  Health service to Native American veterans: It is well documented \nthat there is no population in this country that has participated with \ngreater distinction or in greater numbers per capita serving in this \nNation's military than Native Americans--none. Many Indians served in \nWorld War I even before our Nation recognized Indians as citizens of \nour country. Think of that, we had American Indians sign up to fight \nfor this country when they were not yet considered citizens of this \ncountry.\n  I was checking recently, and 1962 was the last time when a State \nfinally passed legislation allowing Indians to vote in the State. Think \nof that, go back to 1961 and understand, there were places in this \ncountry where American Indians were not allowed to vote in State \nelections. And until the early part of the last century, they were not \nconsidered citizens. Yet they were signing up to go to war for this \ncountry, to fight for this country.\n  I attended a ceremony on the Spirit Lake Reservation a few months ago \nand passed out medals--Silver Stars, a lot of medals--to three soldiers \nwho are now elderly men who served this country in the Second World War \nwith unbelievable valor, had fought all around this world for this \ncountry and earned these medals--Silver Star, Purple Heart, and various \nothers. They were enormously proud of their country.\n  Go to a reservation and find out what percent of the population of \neligible adults sign up to serve in the military on an Indian \nreservation and you will be surprised. There is no group of Americans \nwho signs up in bigger numbers to serve this country in the military.\n  Senator Murkowski and I have a provision in this bill that deals with \nhealth services to Native American veterans. More than 44,000 American \nIndians out of a total Native American population of less than 350,000 \nat that point served in World War II. Think of that. Out of a \npopulation of 350,000, 44,000 of them served in the Second World War.\n  We had a ceremony in this Capitol Building, honoring the Code Talkers \nwho played a significant role in intercepting and deciphering the codes \nused by the Nazis. We gave the Congressional Gold Medal to those Native \nAmerican Code Talkers.\n  We direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to provide for \nthe expenses incurred by any eligible Native American veteran who \nreceives any medical service that is authorized by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and administered at an Indian Health Service or tribal \nfacility. We want the Indian Health Service to be able to get the \nfunding to provide that health care.\n  This bill also provides a provision dealing with domestic violence. \nMy colleague, Senator Murkowski from Alaska, was particularly \ninstrumental in this provision. We held a hearing to examine the causes \nof and solutions to stopping violence against Native American women.\n  We received testimony that more than one in three American Indian and \nAlaska Native women will be raped or sexually assaulted during their \nlifetime. That is pretty unbelievable. We received reports of rapes \nthat were not investigated. We received reports of circumstances where \nthere isn't even the basics, just a rape kit available to take \nevidence.\n  We have included in this legislation some approaches that I think \nwill be very helpful: community education programs related to domestic \nviolence and sexual abuse, victim support services and medical \ntreatment, including examinations performed by sexual assault nurse \nexaminers, and a requirement for rape kits. I think we have made \nsignificant progress. I thank Senator Murkowski for her special \ninterest in that section of the bill as well.\n  Finally, we have a section of the bill that deals with convenient \ncare service demonstration projects. The reason for that is I don't \nwant to see the rest of the country move toward convenient care, walk-\nin clinics with long hours, 7 days a week, only to have Indian \nreservations be out there with these clinics that serve at times that \nare not very convenient.\n  I have a photograph of a clinic I visited last week on the New Town \nReservation. They are open, I believe, from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m., 5 days \na week. Good for them. They take an hour off for the noon hour, by the \nway, and close it. I think it is 9 a.m., maybe 8. This is the Minne-\nTohe Health Center, of the Three Affiliated Tribes. I visited there \nwithin the last week or so. They are open 6 or 8 hours a day, take an \nhour off for lunch and close it down. If at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, \nyou are having a heart attack there, you are in trouble. If it is \nSaturday and you have a bone fracture, you are in trouble, because you \nare 80 miles from the hospital in Minot, ND.\n  My point is, why not develop a model care system of convenient care \nclinics open long hours, 7 days a week? Let's extend the opportunity \nfor real health care on Indian reservations.\n  We have done a lot of other things in this legislation, including \nestablishing the framework for the next approach on reforming this \nsystem completely, and that is the establishment of a bipartisan \ncommission on Indian health care which will study the delivery of this \nsystem and recommend approaches that we will begin working on \nimmediately in the Indian health care area in our committee.\n  I have described a number of items that are not positive, and I will \nlater today describe some good news, because there are some positive \nthings going on. One of the Indian reservations I visited in the last \nweek has an Indian health care clinic that is dramatically underfunded. \nThe tribal council voted to take $500,000 of the funds that belong to \nthe tribal government and move it to try to support that clinic. That \nis good news. Good for them. That takes a lot of courage and \ncommitment.\n  There are good things happening, and I am going to talk about that a \nlittle later today.\n  The fact is, we have a desperate situation with respect to health \ncare in the Indian nation, and it cannot continue. We cannot allow it \nto continue. In the name of children who should not have died--Avis \nLittle Wind or Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight or others--we cannot allow this \nto continue to happen. This country is better than that.\n  I close by quoting Chief Joseph of the Nez Perce Tribe, located in \nwhat is now Idaho. Chief Joseph, one of the great Indian leaders, was \npretty upset about a lot of things. Here is what he said about broken \npromises:\n\n       Good words do not last long unless they amount to \n     something. Words do not pay for my dead people.\n       Good words cannot give me back my children. Good words will \n     not give my people good health and stop them from dying.\n       I am tired of talk that comes to nothing. It makes my heart \n     sick when I remember all the good words and all the broken \n     promises.\n\n  This legislation on the floor of the Senate is not just some other \nbill. This is a step toward the completion of promises that have been \nmade, not ``we hope to help you,'' but promises--promises that have \nbeen made in treaties, promises that have to be kept as a result of a \ntrust responsibility that exists with American Indians.\n  To make the case finally, let me say this: There is a chart that \nshows how much we spend per person on health care, and that chart \ndescribes something I think all need to know about the commitment of \nCongresses and Presidents for a long period of time.\n  This chart shows we have a responsibility to provide health care for \nFederal prisoners. We incarcerate them because they committed a crime, \nand we stick them in prison. But in their prison cell, we have a \nresponsibility for their health care. That is our job, and we meet that \nresponsibility.\n\n  We also have a responsibility for health care for American Indians, \nbecause of a trust responsibility and because of treaties we signed \nafter we expropriated massive amounts of their land. We don't meet that \nresponsibility. In fact, this chart shows that we spend almost twice as \nmuch per person providing health care for incarcerated Federal \nprisoners as we do providing health care for American Indians. That is \nwhy little 5-year-old Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight dies, because she \ndoesn't have the same access to health care that the rest of us do. It \nis why when a woman goes to the doctor, the doctor shows up at our \ncommittee and testifies, saying: You know, a woman came to me who had \nbeen to the Indian Health Service doctor. She had a knee\n\n[[Page S30]]\n\nso bad--it was bone on bone--it was unbelievably painful. He said it \nwas the kind of knee that, if it belonged to somebody in my family or \nyours, we would get knee replacement surgery. We would have to get knee \nreplacement surgery because we wouldn't be able to live with it that \nway. You can't live with that kind of pain. But she told me she went to \nIndian Health Service, and they told her to wrap the knee in cabbage \nleaves for 4 days and it would be okay. Wrap the knee in cabbage \nleaves. This is a knee which we would get replaced, yet this Indian \nwoman is told to wrap it in cabbage leaves.\n  Are we meeting our responsibility? People are dying. Forty percent of \nthe health care need is unmet. I have described the conditions that \nexist in these health clinics and on reservations. The answer is, we \nare not meeting our responsibility, and at least from my standpoint, \nand I believe I speak for the vice chair, though she will speak for \nherself, it is past time, long past the time when this country should \nkeep its promise.\n  Chief Joseph is long gone, but that doesn't mean we don't have a \nresponsibility to keep our promise to the first Americans. They were \nhere first. To this point, we have had all kinds of circumstances over \nmany years of pushing them to reservations after we took their land, \nthen pushing them off the reservation and saying they had to go to the \ncity. So they got a one-way bus ticket and were told: By the way, we \nwant you to mainstream, to get you off this reservation. So they got a \nticket and were sent to the city, and then we decided that was wrong, \nand we brought them back.\n  What has been happening in this country in public policy dealing with \nAmerican Indians is unbelievable, and it has to stop. Let us meet our \nresponsibility, keep our promises, and provide decent health care to \nthe people who were here first. That is what this bill does.\n  This bill is just a step in the right direction, and it will be \nfollowed by significant reform. When we do that, I will feel that, \nfinally, at long last, this country has kept an important promise to \nthose who were here first.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak briefly at \nthis point. I ask unanimous consent that at the completion of the \nremarks of the Senator from Alaska I be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Salazar). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I so appreciate the passion and the \nadvocacy of my colleague, the Senator from North Dakota, and working \ntogether on the Indian Affairs Committee on an issue in which I think \nboth of us believe very strongly. Both of us believe in the commitment \nwe have to the American Indians and the Alaska Natives, particularly \ninsofar as providing them with a level of access to health care. That \ncommitment is one that in far too many areas we have failed, and that \nis why it is so important that we are able to advance, as the first \nlegislation of this new year, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of \n2007.\n  We just celebrated the birthday of Martin Luther King, and as a \nnation we think about that time in our history when we were not proud \nof how we treated one another based on color of skin and ethnicity. We \nknow that in many parts of this country, we still have far to go, but \nwe are making progress. Yet, as we look to how the American Indians, \nthe Alaska Natives, and so many in our Native communities have been \ntreated when it comes to the basics in health care, that is an area \nwhere I think we need to look very critically and say we can and we \nmust do more.\n  When I first became the vice chair of this committee, Chairman Dorgan \nand I sat down, and he said to me: Lisa, what are your priorities for \nthe Indian Affairs Committee? What is it that you would like to see \nadvanced? He told me what his priorities were. It is awfully nice being \nable to walk into that new relationship and agree that the most \nimportant thing we could do was to work together in a bipartisan effort \nto advance legislation that has been working through the process for a \nnumber of years, for a number of Congresses, and to successfully move \nthat through the Congress.\n  We have worked on this bill through three committees of \njurisdiction--the Indian Affairs Committee, the Finance Committee, and \nthe HELP Committee--before finally bringing this here to the Senate \nFloor. I believe this legislation brings new hope for Indian health. It \nrepresents a step forward, a step toward the goal of providing our \nfirst Americans with health care that is on par with other Americans. \nIt is not the end-all and be-all, but it is a first step, and I am \nencouraged that we have the opportunity to produce this legislation in \nsupport of that goal.\n\n  As my colleague has noted, this day has been far too long in coming. \nEfforts to enact comprehensive reform for the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act began in 1999. This act was extended for 1 year back in \n2001 through legislation introduced by Senator Thune when he was a \nMember of the House of Representatives. Since then, the Indian Affairs \nCommittee has shepherded several reauthorization bills through multiple \nCongresses, through multiple hearings, through multiple markups, but it \nhas yet to be reauthorized despite the very good efforts of a great \nmany.\n  This bill would reauthorize and would amend the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act and applicable parts of the Indian Self-Determination \nand Education Assistance Act, as well as the Social Security Act.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act provides a basic framework for \ndelivery of health care services to American Indians and Alaska \nNatives. As Senator Dorgan has indicated, this is a Federal \nresponsibility arising from the Constitution, arising from the treaties \nand from Federal court cases.\n  The act itself, first enacted back in 1976, was last comprehensively \nreauthorized in 1992. Think about the status of health care back in \n1992 and what has changed. Certainly, in my State of Alaska, we have \nbeen able to do so much more in our remote areas because of what we are \nable to do through Telehealth. Well, back in 1992, I can guarantee you \nwe were not doing then what we are doing now. It is so vitally \nimportant that we provide for this authorization to update a system by \npassing this bill.\n  We recognize there are still some outstanding issues that need to be \nresolved. I would like to think they are not central parts to this \nbill, and I am very confident we can deal with them if our colleagues \nwork with us in the same very bipartisan way that we on the committee \nhave done to advance this.\n  Now, Chairman Dorgan has given good background in terms of an \noverview, the need for reauthorization, and he has highlighted it with \nstories that touch our hearts, as they should. I wish to elaborate a \nlittle bit further on the legislation, how it developed, and give that \noverview as well as some of the key improvements we have in S. 1200.\n  To really understand the framework of the Indian health care system \nunder this act, you have to keep in mind that there is very significant \ninterplay between this act and the Indian Self-Determination and \nEducation Assistance Act. The Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act provides the process whereby Indian tribes and the \ntribal organizations contract or compact to take over administration of \nprograms from the Indian Health Service. It is the interplay between \nthese two statutes that provides a great deal of the backdrop for many \nof the principles that underlie this reauthorization.\n  The act essentially governs programs for the recruitment and \nretention of Indian health professionals, for health promotion and \ndisease prevention, for facilities, urban Indians, and a comprehensive \nbehavioral health system. The act also governs important authorizations \nwhich increase access to care where there is third-party reimbursement. \nIt also sets forth the administrative organization for the Indian \nHealth Service. Finally, it contains reporting requirements and other \nregulatory authority for the Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  The bill is intended to improve Indian health care in three areas: \nFirst, by increasing access to health care; second, by updating the \nauthorized\n\n[[Page S31]]\n\nservices and programs; and third, by facilitating innovative financing \nsystems to help support Indian health.\n  So let's talk about the increase in access to care. In Alaska, we are \ntalking about access to care all over the State. Geographically, as you \nknow, we are very large, populations are very small, and providers are \nvery limited. And this is throughout all systems, not necessarily just \nthe Indian Health Service. This legislation includes programs to \nincrease outreach and enrollment in Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP. We \nneed to have aggressive outreach in order to ensure that the Native \npeople who are eligible for these programs participate in them and so \nthat they can navigate through a relatively challenging enrollment \nprocess.\n  We recognized the critical importance of the Medicare, the Medicaid, \nand the SCHIP programs for Indian patients. There was an Indian woman \nby the name of Ski who lives in southwestern Oklahoma. Along with her \nhusband, she takes care of her three grandchildren and her great-\ngranddaughter. About 4 years ago, Ski's doctor, after checking her x \nrays, found a large spot on her lungs. They also diagnosed her with \nthyroid cancer. Sadly, though, the IHS Contract Health Service, which \nis intended to provide for the kind of specialty care Ski needed, \nnotified her that the funds aren't available to pay for it. This is \nvery similar to some of the stories my colleague has mentioned.\n  Without this additional care, Ski, who is the primary caregiver for \nher grandchildren and great-grandchild, wondered if she would be around \nto watch her children and great-grandchild grow up. Fortunately, Ski \nwon't have to face the prospect of living without health care because \nshe did receive it--not through the Contract Health Service but through \nMedicare. It was these resources which allowed Ski to undergo the \nbiopsy which ruled out lung cancer and to see a pulmonologist and \nreceive testing on a regular basis for the pulmonary fibrosis she was \neventually diagnosed to have. She had complete removal of her cancerous \nthyroid and since that time has been able to receive the follow-up \ntreatments, the testing, and the examinations, all of which we know are \nvery costly but which Medicare helped to cover so that Ski can continue \nher life raising her family.\n  She is fortunate and, unfortunately, somewhat of a rarity. Many \nIndian patients do not have Medicare or Medicaid to help them even \nthough they may be eligible. In the legislation we have, S. 1200, it \nwill help those Indian patients in accessing Medicare, Medicaid, and \nSCHIP through the outreach and the enrollment programs as well as other \nmeans.\n  Now, accessing third-party reimbursement also helps Indian health \nproviders. The Makah Tribe is a good example of why we should include \nthe provisions to assist tribes in participating in Medicare, Medicaid, \nand SCHIP. The Makah Tribe is in Washington State, and they are located \non a very picturesque 44-square-mile Indian reservation filled with \nrich forests, wildlife, birds, and plant life--a very beautiful area.\n  From their home, tribal members can cross the Strait of Juan de Fuca \nand during the summers go fishing or boating in the Pacific. Although \ntheir home is a place of amazing beauty, it is also a very remote part \nof the State which presents some daunting challenges to the delivery of \nhealth services to the tribal members.\n  It has been reported that the tribe operates a small ambulatory \nclinic with over 2,000 users and only two doctors. Due to the \nremoteness of the clinic, the tribe has difficulty recruiting health \ncare professionals, including dentists.\n  Over 70 miles away you have the nearest town with a full-service \nhospital, Port Angeles. But those 70 miles can be treacherous to \nnegotiate. It is a winding road, a difficult road. There are several \ninstances when the road has been washed out by storms, leaving no \naccess to or from the reservation.\n  So there is no surprise that Port Angeles, being a larger town and a \nmore accessible town, has salaries that are more attractive than the \nreservation.\n  The Makah Tribe administers the health care services through a self-\ngovernance compact for which the tribe should receive contract support \ncosts. However, those contract support costs do not cover all of the \nindirect costs of health care services. So this impacts the tribe's \nability to provide for competitive salaries and to provide for that \nfull array of health care services. But despite all of those \nchallenges, the Makah Tribe has remained resourceful. They are in the \nprocess of improving their third-party reimbursements, in particular \nthe Medicare Part B access for eligible people on the reservation.\n  It is these additional reimbursements that assist the tribe in \nessentially hedging against the insufficient contract support costs. So \nwhen you hear of situations like what we are seeing with the Makah, \nrecognize this legislation will serve to benefit the tribal health \nproviders as well as the Indians who are served by allowing for, again, \nthe additional reimbursement for improving access to care.\n  The legislation will also improve access by removing barriers to such \nenrollment such as the waivers of Medicaid copays and allowing the use \nof tribal enrollment documentation for Medicaid enrollment. These are \nvery important to provisions in this legislation. I hope we will hear \nmore of the good stories, the stories like Ski's, rather than the very \ndamning stories we hear of the system currently.\n  Now, in updating health care services in Native communities, the bill \nestablishes permanent authority for home and community-based services, \nand these are services which have been operating in the State of Alaska \nwith very impressive results.\n  I mentioned just a few minutes ago Alaska's size. Many know Alaska \nNatives have to travel enormous distances away from their home \ncommunities to obtain any level of specialized care. Some people think \nwe make this map up, just to show Alaska's shape over the continental \nUnited States--but this is actually true to size--the State of Alaska \ndoes stretch from just about Florida into Arizona and beyond, from \nCanada down to the southern area. Geographically, we are huge.\n  We have another chart that indicates how the distances for an \nindividual coming from, let's say, Unalaska down here where Arizona is \non the map. Unalaska is not only our State's largest fishing port, it \nis the largest, in terms of volume of fish, fishing community in the \nUnited States of America.\n  For an individual who is coming from Unalaska, which just has a small \nclinic, to come to Anchorage, which is where all of the points converge \nin the middle of the map, it is the equivalent of essentially going \nfrom Arizona to Kansas for your medical appointment to come to the \nAlaska Native Medical Center where you can see a specialist.\n  To give another example, the residents of Barrow, at the northern \nmost part of the State, also have to travel to Anchorage to obtain \nspecialty medical services in the Alaska Native Medical Hospital. That \nis the distance of coming from the Canadian border down to Kansas for \nmedical services.\n  If you are coming out of the southeastern part of our State, in many \nof our island communities, again, you are moving from essentially \nAlabama or Florida into Kansas. The distances we deal with to provide \naccess to care are realities for us in the State that other people \ncannot relate to.\n  We are not talking 100 miles, we are talking several hundred miles. \nWhen you put it in context that way, you recognize it is not just the \ntime and the distance traveled, but it is the expense and the distance \ntraveled.\n  Mr. President, as I was mentioning the distances that we deal with, I \nmentioned the time to travel, the expense to travel, but think about \nthe situation if perhaps you are elderly, you are ill, or perhaps you \ndo not know what is wrong, and you have to leave your village to go to \nour cities, our largest cities, which is very intimidating for many of \nour Alaska Natives in the first place.\n  They are away from their family, they are away from their community \nmembers, they are away from their traditional foods, they are away from \ntheir traditional activities. Many of our elders do not speak English, \nso they are coming into town where the language is different. Think \nabout how well you would heal or how well you would feel in truly a \nstrange and foreign place like this.\n  Well, the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation located out in Bethel,\n\n[[Page S32]]\n\nAlaska, in western Alaska, decided this is unacceptable, to have to \npull everybody from the villages so far away. And they developed a \nvillage and a regional service structure to help the elders, to help \nthe Alaska Native patients with chronic diseases to continue living in \ntheir homes or in their community rather than being sent hundreds of \nmiles away to receive special nursing care.\n  It was their pilot program to take over all home and community-based \ncare in their region, which resulted in a reduction in service waiting \ntime for the disabled and the elders in the region and truly improved \nthe patients' health status level. This legislation may enable other \ntribal programs around the country to also engage in home and \ncommunity-based care which would allow Indian patients to remain in \ntheir homes rather than face a lengthy hospital stay or nursing home \nstay in a distant and, again, a strange location.\n  Our legislation also consolidates and coordinates the various tribal \nhealth programs into a more comprehensive approach. As we well know, \nalcohol and drug abuse among many of our Native communities, and \nmethamphetamine abuse, has reached epidemic proportions in some \ncommunities.\n  We had a gentleman, the former chairman of the Northern Arapahoe, Mr. \nRichard Brannan. He testified before our joint hearing before the 109th \nCongress, and then again during the 110th, and told us truly a heart-\nbreaking story of the tragic and painful and terrible unnecessary death \nof a beautiful little Indian girl at the hands of methamphetamine-\naddicted individuals.\n  Chairman Brannan sought our help in providing both prevention and \ntreatment for the drug and alcohol addictions that ravage Native \ncommunities. I am pleased that this bill will authorize such assistance \nand more to help prevent these tragedies from happening to other Indian \nchildren.\n  Now, also during the committee hearing on the methamphetamine plague, \nwe received testimony from tribal leaders about the devastation this \nterrible drug has brought to their communities. Kathleen Kitcheyan, the \nformer tribal chairwoman of the San Carlos Apache Tribe in Arizona, \ndescribed a very personal loss, a tragic loss of a grandson to drugs. \nAnd she stated that on her reservation, they have methamphetamine users \nwho are as young as 9 years old.\n  Think about what is happening to our children. Think about drug abuse \nand the addictions. But to know that children as young as 9 years old \nare being made the victims, we should all be alarmed when we hear \nstories like this. And what is equally horrifying are the residual \neffects of methamphetamine abuse on children. The former chairwoman \ntestified how babies were being born on the reservation, born addicted \nto methamphetamine, with physical deformities. She stated that on her \nreservation a 22-year-old methamphetamine user tried to commit suicide \nby stabbing himself with a 10-inch knife. So many terrible stories. \nThere were 101 suicide attempts on her reservation during the year \n2004, 101 attempts that were directly related to meth.\n  Now, I have described that we are seeing methamphetamine users as \nyoung as 9, but it also afflicts the middle-aged as well as the \nelderly. Once meth has taken hold, few can escape without considerable \nhelp. The Indian Health Service estimates it takes well over 60 days in \ntreatment programs in order to overcome these addictions. So just \nseparating a methamphetamine addict from the drug for a period of a few \nweeks or even a month is not nearly enough to provide effective \ntreatment, not nearly enough to break the addiction. The \nmethamphetamine addicts need the long-term treatment necessary to allow \ntheir mental and their physical state to heal and to recover.\n  For the children, the IHS has 11 federally funded youth regional \ntreatment centers with 300 beds overall. In addition, there are an \nestimated 47 or perhaps 48 tribal and urban residential programs for \nadults. One program, the Native American Rehabilitation Association in \nPortland, OR, which is an urban Indian facility, can also house the \npatient's family so the patient can also receive the very necessary \nfamily support during the recovery.\n  These programs authorized under the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct, and more importantly the Indian and Alaska Natives who are \nsuffering from meth addiction, will benefit from the updates to the \nbehavioral health program in this bill.\n  Now, we heard from Chairman Dorgan that the Indian health system is \nfunded at approximately 60 percent of the need. And with the new health \nhazards, whether it is methamphetamine or whatever the hazard is, that \nface our Native communities, we have to be innovative in finding \nsolutions and resources in building upon the foundations that are set \nforth in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  This legislation will establish the Native American Wellness \nFoundation, a federally chartered foundation to facilitate mechanisms \nto support but not supplant the mission of the Indian Health \nService. It is modeled after legislation which passed the Senate in the \n108th Congress. I am pleased to say we will have an opportunity to \nadvance it in this legislation as well.\n\n  I wish to mention two key provisions that have been briefly \nmentioned. This is regarding the issue of violence against Native \nwomen. In the substitute we hope to advance later, we will provide for \nauthorization of prevention and treatment programs for Indian victims \nand the perpetrators of domestic and sexual violence. We will also \nprovide critical incentives for Indian health providers to obtain \ncertification and training as sexual assault nurse examiners or in \nother areas to serve victims of violence. Both these provisions build \nupon very important work this Congress did in the Violence Against \nWomen Act, by addressing some of the systematic shortcomings to improve \nprosecutions, such as forensic examinations. I will speak on this a bit \nlater.\n  One of the things we heard in testimony before the committee was that \nin many of our IHS facilities, they did not have rape kits available. \nThey could not collect the forensic evidence. If you don't have the \nevidence, you cannot proceed with prosecution. When you hear stories \nsuch as this and ask for confirmation that, in fact, this is the \nsituation, that we simply don't have the kits available--it is \nconfirmed--it is no wonder women feel helpless in even seeking \nassistance after a violent act such as a rape. In addition, simply not \nhaving the training for the nurses at the clinics, these are areas of \ncritical shortcomings and ways we can help to make a difference.\n  There are many good things in this bill, but I do wish to impress \nupon Members this is truly a national bill. It works to benefit Indians \nand Indian health programs in communities across the spectrum. I have \nmentioned that it has been a product that has been in the works for \nyears, a very determined effort on the part of Native health leaders \ntruly from all corners of our Nation. There are over 560 Indian tribes \nin this country, with 225 of those tribes in Alaska alone. Our Indian \ntribes and Indian health care system span the Nation from Maine to \nFlorida, California to Washington, and, of course, to Alaska up North. \nAccording to recent information from IHS, over 1.6 million American \nIndians and Alaska Natives receive services in this system at over 600 \nfacilities. These facilities are all over the board, in terms of what \nthey can provide, ranging from inpatient hospitals, general clinics, \nand health stations.\n  There are some that look beautiful and there are some that you look \nat and say: We can do far better.\n  I mentioned earlier many Natives in the State travel into Anchorage \nfrom outlying areas to receive care at the Alaska Native Medical \nCenter. As you can see behind me, it is a large, beautiful facility. It \nis designed to provide for that advanced level of care and specialty \nfor Alaska Natives from around the entire State. But as one travels \naway from Anchorage, and you get off the road system out into the bush, \nthe facilities vary in size and certainly in service and are certainly \nmuch more modest. We have a picture of the clinic in Atka, AK. It is a \nlittle rough around the edges, certainly, but they are able to provide \nfor the basic needs in that region. I checked to identify some of the \nother challenges the folks in Atka face, in terms of their costs. This \nis a village where gas is selling for $5.09 a\n\n[[Page S33]]\n\ngallon, and home heating oil is going for $4.99 a gallon.\n  We have a picture of the clinic at Arctic Village which is located \nmore in the central or interior part of the State. I checked with them \nthis weekend on the price of gas per gallon. It is 7 bucks a gallon. \nTheir home heating oil costs are $6.36 a gallon. So it is expensive to \nlive out there. It is expensive to heat your home. When you are ill or \nneed help, this clinic is where you go in Arctic Village.\n  We know the need is extensive. The Indian health care system has to \nprovide everything from basic medical to dental to vision services and \nmedical support systems. It has to include the laboratory, nutrition, \npharmaceutical, diagnostic imagining, medical records. Obviously, they \nare not providing that there at Arctic Village.\n  Senator Dorgan had mentioned the history of the Indian health care \nsystem. I will not take the time today to speak to that. I do, before \ntaking a break, wish to take time to talk about some of the updates to \nthe current Indian health care system we have in this legislation. As I \nmentioned, there have been enormous changes to the medical system since \nthe last reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Act in 1992. So in \norder to update and provide for an improvement in the overall status of \nthe American Indian and Alaska Native health and well-being, we have to \nmake sure our facilities access is better.\n  Chairman Dorgan mentioned some of the health statistics and mortality \nrates we see among American Indians and Alaska Natives. We know these \npopulations are dying at higher rates than others within the U.S. \npopulation. On tuberculosis, for American Indians and Alaska Natives \nthe rate is 600 percent higher; alcoholism, 510 percent higher; \ndiabetes, 229 percent higher; unintentional injuries, 152 percent \nhigher; homicides, suicides higher. The statistics are all so troubling \nas we look to what we are providing and whether we are seeing \nimprovement.\n  As I say that, we have seen some gains. With passage of the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act of 1976, there were some pieces of good \nnews insofar as decreases in mortality rates over the past 35 years. \nThe average death rate from all causes for the American Indian and \nAlaska Native population dropped 28 percent between 1974 and 2002. We \nhave seen gastrointestinal disease mortality reduced. Even though the \ndeath rate for Indians is 600 percent higher than the rest of the \nUnited States, we have seen tuberculosis mortality reduced 80 percent, \nand cervical cancer mortality has been reduced. Infant mortality has \nbeen reduced 66 percent. We are seeing good news there. The problem is, \nwe started at such high levels. So, the statistics are still \nunacceptable.\n\n  In addition, we have population growth and economic factors which are \ncreating strong pressure on American Indian and Alaska Native \ncommunities and their health care facilities. From 1990 to 2000, the \npopulation grew at a rate of 26 percent among the American Indian and \nAlaska Native populations. Compared to the total U.S. population, it \ngrew by 13 percent. But we know the health care funding for Native \npeople simply has not kept up with the expanding population and \ninflation.\n  This effective reduction in health care funding creates our current \nhealth status level. We see the survival rate improving, but all we \nneed to do is look at the charts, look at the statistics. We know \nIndians and Alaska Natives still suffer disproportionately from a \nnumber of health problems. We know, for instance, in the area of \ndiabetes, the rates are unacceptably high. While we recognize the \nIndian Health Service is trying to get this diabetes crisis under \ncontrol--they are providing diabetes care to greater numbers of Native \npeople than ever before, and we see some success--is it adequate? Is it \nsufficient?\n  Another area where we are seeing some success is in the area of \nvaccinations. We are getting higher vaccination rates for adults over \n65. These have been instrumental in helping with some of our health \nstatistics. Screenings, such as for fetal alcohol syndrome, have been \nhelping to reduce the burden of preventable disease.\n  One of the aspects we face in increasing efficiencies within the \ndelivery of the health care system, we know we have to use new \ntechnologies, new techniques, and these are contemplated and outlined \nin many areas of the legislation before us. I will go back to Alaska as \nan example of a State that faces very unique challenges in providing \nfor quality health care to the residents in rural Alaska. The majority \nof the 200 rural Alaska Native villages are not connected to a road \nsystem. We don't have the roads. We are 47 out of 50 in ranking of \nStates for the number of road miles, but we rank first out of 50 for \noverall land mass. We simply don't have a road system to speak of in \nmuch of Alaska. When you don't have a road system, you fly. We fly in \nsmall bush planes. During the summer months, we rely on skiffs and \nriverboats to get around. But for the most part, we fly. It is not \nluxury travel. It is a basic need.\n  From the chart I have behind me, you can't see the names of all the \ntowns there, but it is there to demonstrate what we deal with as a \nState. When you look at the IHS budget in Alaska, you may be surprised \nto see the travel budgets are unusually large, oftentimes larger than \nstaff budgets. That gets people's attention. Are we going out to \nconferences? No. This is how we get around in the State of Alaska and \nhow we move our patients, those who need to get to that medical \nspecialist. We move them by airplane. Up in the north there you see a \ncommunity of Barrow. Nuiqsut is a small village outside of Barrow. They \nhave a small clinic. Barrow has a larger one. But in order to receive \nany level of specialty care, an Alaska Native would have to fly about \n700 miles south to Anchorage to the Alaska Native Medical Center. The \ncost of that particular flight is $1,100 for that person coming out of \nNuiqsut.\n  Over to the west, out on St. Lawrence Island, an individual who is \nill in Savoonga and needs to come into Anchorage for medical care is \ngoing to pay about $1,000. This is round trip, not that that makes it \nany better.\n  Down south of Anchorage, off of Kodiak Island--and if you look at the \nred lines, it looks as if it must be much closer to Anchorage and \ntherefore less costly--if you are coming from Old Harbor on Kodiak \nIsland, your airfare is going to be about $1,350 round trip to get you \nto and from.\n  So when we factor in the budgets of doing business, travel costs are \nenormous. This is all about access. We also recognize it is not just \nthe cost. Oftentimes during the winter--this time of year--travel is \nshut down completely. For some of our communities, because of weather \nconditions, fuel barges have not been able to get into the community, \nand they have had to fly fuel in to provide for the diesel generation \nthat provides the power in these villages.\n  Whether it is the ice, the wind, the snow, oftentimes it is just too \ndangerous to make the trip into town. Blue Cross has estimated that it \nis 300 times more expensive to operate a hospital or a clinic in Alaska \nthan it is in the continental United States. These are the expenses we \ndeal with.\n  In the last 10 years, we have seen access to medical specialists and \nhealth care improve. Working with my colleague, Senator Stevens, we \nhave seen a revolution in terms of how health care is delivered to our \nrural villages with the development of an advanced telehealth network. \nWith 99 percent of the telehealth initiative coming from IHS funding \nand managed by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Care Consortium, the \nAlaska Federal Health Care Partnership is a collaboration with the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. \nCoast Guard. They teamed up together to develop the Alaska Federal \nHealth Care Access Network. They developed a special telehealth cart, \nand they deploy these carts to small villages in rural Alaska. They are \nable to provide a very wide variety of clinical services, including \ncardiology, community health aid training, dental and oral health, \ndermatology, ear, nose and throat care, as well as emergency room \nservices.\n  They had a demonstration cart here a couple years back to just kind \nof show us what it is they were doing. I had just come off a trip up \nnorth, and I was due to fly again very soon. My ears were all plugged \nup. I said: Well, show me how this works. Just standing right there, \nthey put a little monitor in my ear, and they were talking to a doctor \nin Anchorage. He said: You just have a little inflammation there. You \nare fine to fly.\n\n[[Page S34]]\n\n  What we are able to do with telehealth is to connect many of our \nAlaska Natives in a very cost-effective way for them to have access to \nqualified health care specialists without necessarily leaving their \nvillage.\n  We continue to evaluate the cost savings we are seeing as a \nconsequence of this telemedicine. The preliminary data suggests that 37 \npercent of the time, telemedicine prevented the need for a patient and \nfamily escort to travel. That saved an estimated $4.4 million in travel \ncosts. So if you can save $4 million in travel, because we have the \ntechnology in front of us, it is a savings for all of us.\n  Tribal health providers in Alaska with their Federal counterparts \nhave been extremely innovative in addressing the unique health care \nchallenges of our State. The Alaska Federal Health Care Access Network \nhas been working with the IHS service areas to expand quality and \naffordable health care to American Indians across the United States.\n  The new opportunities, such as expanded telehealth, found in S. 1200 \nserve important purposes in promoting good investments. Indian tribes \nand tribal organizations have performed admirably in developing their \nhealth care services and facilities. These types of efforts should be \nrewarded and encouraged by passage of this bill.\n  There are some other items I would like to speak to, and I may come \nback to them at another point in time. But before I conclude for now, I \nwant to mention the importance of the program in the sanitation \nfacilities area.\n  I could probably stand all day justifying the need for the \nreauthorization, but one area that has been demonstrated to be one of \nthose very important functions in reducing health disparities is the \nSanitation Facilities Program. This program governs the construction, \noperations, and maintenance of sanitation facilities providing clean \nwater and sanitary disposal systems to Indian and Alaska Native \ncommunities.\n  For us in Alaska, the issue of sanitation is one we have been \nstruggling with for far, far too many years. One in three families--one \nin three families--in rural Alaska has no sanitation facilities. We are \nnot talking about upgraded sanitation facilities; we are saying no \nsanitation facilities. What we have in many of our villages, still, \nunfortunately, is a system we refer to as the honey-bucket system. It \nis not a very refined system. In fact, it is a system that, for those \nof us in the State, we look at with shame and say: For Alaska Natives, \nfor Alaskans to have to rely on this as their sanitation system is \noffensive. It is close to Third World conditions, and here we are in \nthe United States of America, and you have a system where human waste \nis collected in a bucket and hauled outside and dumped in a collection \nfacility. In some areas, it is less than a collection area; it is \ndumped in a lagoon. You can walk through some of these communities, and \nyou have waste that is spilled along the wayside.\n  I have in the Chamber this picture of these two little Native boys. \nIt is like the equivalent of taking out the trash--taking out the honey \nbucket. If you do not think this does not contribute to some of our \nhealth issues in rural Alaska, you have not looked at the facts.\n  In testimony before the committee, we had Steven Weaver. He is from \nthe Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. Steve Weaver has been very \ninstrumental working with us in order to eliminate the honey bucket. \nBut he spoke at that hearing to the challenges families face in \ncommunities without sanitation facilities. He said: Other folks in \nAmerica have the convenience of running water and inside flushing \ntoilets, but in too many of our Native communities we have to haul the \nclean water into the homes and then haul the honey buckets out of the \nhomes as part of the household chores, part of the daily living.\n\n  I was in a community several years back and visited the health clinic \nthere. It was a very small health clinic. It was one of the villages \nthat still do not have running water. There was a honey bucket in the \ncorner of the health clinic. When you think about the need for \nsanitation, particularly in your clinic, and you realize there is no \nrunning water and the human waste must be discarded by walking it out \nthe door, the health consequences in communities without running water, \nwithout sewer are very real.\n  The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium reported that infants in \ncommunities without adequate sanitation are 11 times more likely to be \nhospitalized for respiratory infections in comparison to all U.S. \ninfants and 5 times more likely to be hospitalized for skin infections \nthan those in communities with adequate sanitation.\n  We have about 6,000 homes without potable water, about 18,650 homes \nthat need improvements or upgrades for water, sewer, or solid waste.\n  This legislation, S. 1200, will maintain the Sanitation Facilities \nProgram. For us in a State such as Alaska, this is vitally important.\n  Mr. President, at this time I am prepared to defer to Senator Gregg. \nHe has been waiting some time. I do have additional comments I will \nmake throughout the day, but I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nStevens be recognized for up to 10 minutes following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, is the request for a presentation on the \nbill without amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have no knowledge of what the request is \nother than a request for 10 minutes of remarks.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will agree to that request with the \nunderstanding it is on the bill without an amendment. I would also like \nto add to the request that Senator Bingaman be recognized to offer an \namendment immediately following the presentation by Senator Stevens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak on a subject which is not \nrelated to this bill. I congratulate the managers for bringing this \nbill forward.\n\n\n                            Stimulus Package\n\n  Mr. President, the subject I rise to speak about is one that is \nfairly topical to today's events, obviously, with what is happening in \nthe international markets and in the stock market and with the Federal \nReserve System, and that is the issue of how we as a Congress should \nproceed relative to what has been called a stimulus or growth proposal.\n  I want to put down what I would call a red flag of reason, let's call \nit, as we move forward on this stimulus package. Let's first understand \nwhat the problem is we are confronting.\n  The economy has a serious overextension of credit. This overextension \nof credit occurred because, as often occurs, there was a period of \nexuberance in the credit markets.\n  Now, I have had the good fortune to be involved in Government and in \nthe private sector for a number of years, and I have seen this type of \nsituation arise at least two major times during my career, once when I \nwas Governor of New Hampshire. What happens is people who make loans \nsuddenly find they have a lot of cash available to them to make loans, \nand they go out and start making loans based on speculation that it can \nbe repaid rather than on the capacity of the individual they are \nlending the money to to repay it or based on speculation that the \ncollateral for that loan will always maintain its value as originally \nassessed when, in fact, that collateral may be overstated.\n  This usually comes at the end of what is known as a business cycle, \nwhen basically you have a lot of people out there who probably have not \nbeen through a downturn before in their lives who basically put out \ncredit at a rate that is irrationally exuberant--to use the terms of \nMr. Greenspan on another subject of the late 1990s bubble--and as a \nresult, credit is put out that, in this instance, was put out at a rate \nand to individuals who basically did not have the capacity to repay it \nunder the terms of the credit, and with collateral that did not support \nit.\n  This exuberant expenditure of credit or promotion of credit was \ncompounded by the fact that we had an inverted pyramid created. That \nitem of credit, that loan that was made, which was\n\n[[Page S35]]\n\nmade on collateral which didn't support it and which was made to an \nindividual who probably didn't have the ability to repay it under the \nterms that it was made on, that item was then sold and it was sold \nagain, and then it was turned into some sort of synthetic instrument \nwhich was multiplied and created more sales of the item. So you have \nbasically an inverted pyramid, where that initial loan, which had \nproblems in and of itself on the repayment side and on the collateral \nside, was compounded by a reselling of the loan over and over again in \na variety of different markets and through a number of different \ninstruments, which essentially exaggerated the implications that that \nloan should not be repaid. So that is what has happened. The loans \ncan't be repaid, in many instances, or the collateral isn't there, in \nmany instances, so these loans start to get called and they start to be \nforeclosed on. Because they can't be repaid, the lenders find \nthemselves in a situation where they have to obtain liquidity from \nsomewhere else. So they start to contract their lending to basically \npeople who can repay because they must maintain a strong balance sheet, \nthey must maintain their capital reserve, and as a result it feeds on \nitself and you have a liquidity crisis.\n\n  That is a classic business cycle. It is a classic end to a business \ncycle, and that is what we are in today. It is unfortunate and it \ncauses great personal harm and trauma and it obviously disrupts the \neconomy and people and it affects people's lives. People are damaged by \nthis. Its roots basically go to the fact that there were people lending \nmoney to people who should not have been lent money under the terms \nthey were lent it without the collateral they needed for support.\n  So how do we react to that? How do we keep that from snowballing into \na massive slowdown in the economy or a possible potential recession? \nWell, the discussion is to stimulate the economy through some sort of \nfiscal policy and the Federal Government taking action--what is known \nas fiscal policy. There is also, of course, the monetary side. Today \nthe Federal Reserve cut the rates by 75 basis points, and as a result, \nthe market reacted, although it was hugely down when they started. I \nhaven't looked at it recently. I don't know that it reacted in a \npositive way to that cut in rates.\n  On the fiscal side, there is a lot of discussion about stimulating \nthe economy. I guess my red flag of reason I am putting out here is, if \nwe are going to stimulate the economy through fiscal policy, let's at \nleast do it correctly. Let's not do it in a way that damages the \neconomy or the future or that basically gets you a short-term political \nheadline but doesn't get you the impact you need, which is to help \npeople through a difficult economic period.\n  The proposals which are out there, most of which I have seen, have \nfallen into two categories. One is stimulate the economy by giving \npeople money to spend and the other is to stimulate the economy through \nenergizing small business and large business to invest in economic \nactivity. The problem we have with a stimulative event, which is \nbasically giving people $100, $200, $300, $400, whether you give it to \nthem directly or whether you give it to them through the tax laws, is \nthat money will be spent, but does it stimulate our economy? I am not \nso sure. So much of the product we buy in America today, that we \nconsume in America today is produced outside the United States: Maybe \nit stimulates the Chinese economy, but I am not so sure it stimulates \nour economy. What may be raising the Chinese economy may raise the \nnational economy and that helps us out, but as a practical matter, I am \nnot sure it gets a big bang for the bucks expended, and, most \nimportantly, what happens when you take that sort of action is you \nborrow this money. This money doesn't appear from nowhere that you are \ngoing to put out into the marketplace and say: Here, American citizen, \nwe are going to return you X dollars through a direct payment--probably \nan inverted tax payment of some sort, for people of low income who \naren't basically paying taxes are going to get some sort of payment; \nmiddle-income people will get a lesser payment or some marginal \npayment. That money has to be borrowed. That money gets borrowed from \nour children. The practical effect of borrowing that money, if it is a \n$150 billion one-time event, is it compounds because there is interest \non top of that and it grows into a lot more money. Then our children \nand our children's children end up having to pay it back. So do you get \nthe value? Is there a value there that is large enough to justify \nputting this debt on our children's backs for this type of stimulus \nevent? I think we have to look at that very seriously.\n  There are proposals out there that we should essentially waive the \nSocial Security payment, for example; that we should say we are not \ngoing to require people to make their Social Security withholding \npayment for 1 month or 2 months or whatever the number would be that we \nwould settle on. That, as a policy matter, has very serious \nimplications for our children and our children's children. Essentially, \nthe Social Security system is supposed to be an insurance system, where \nyou as a working American pay into the system so when you retire, you \nhave paid into the system money which is then returned to you through \nSocial Security payments for your retirement. It is and historically \nhas been viewed as an insurance policy approach, with the Federal \nGovernment managing the insurance. Yes, nobody is going to argue the \nfact that the Social Security system in the outyears does not have the \nresources to repay the liabilities that are on the books. That is a big \nissue for us and it is a function of the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration. But you only radically, quite honestly, aggravate that \nproblem by borrowing from the Social Security Administration to \nessentially fund the short-term fix of a stimulus package.\n  First, you have created a brandnew event, which has never happened in \nmy knowledge, of taking Social Security dollars and moving them over \nfor the purposes of an expenditure which is a day-to-day operation of \nGovernment expenditure. You are basically formally saying the Social \nSecurity dollars which are paid in, in taxes, can be used for something \nother than the purposes of creating obligations which will be paid back \nin the form of retirement payments. You are saying Social Security \ndollars will go directly--without any obligation being shown on the \nSocial Security balance sheet--will be taken off the Social Security \nbalance sheet and put directly into the day-to-day operation of \nGovernment for the purposes of paying people a stimulus event of $500 \nor $600. The implications of that are huge, from a public policy \nstandpoint.\n\n  We are basically totally readjusting our approach as a nation toward \nSocial Security. You are basically saying Social Security is a dollar \nin, dollar out purpose, with absolutely no fund and that there is no \noffsetting balance being set up for Social Security payments, which is \nused later to pay down the Social Security responsibility. That is a \nterrible precedent. It may be a theoretical debate, but it is one heck \nof a big precedent to create that sort of new paradigm relative to \nSocial Security.\n  Again, what do you get for it? You get a momentary stimulus which may \nor may not help our economy, because as we all know, most of that \nconsumer event is going to occur with the purchase of products produced \noutside the country, to a large degree, and you don't get any long-term \naction which is essentially going to improve the financial viability of \nthe Social Security system. In fact, you significantly aggravate it \nbecause, again, you compound that event, and compounding interest has \nan amazing effect in the area of what will end up as the total cost of \nthat one-time event. Ask the notch babies about that. So this is a \npolicy choice which I think would be truly destructive to the \nhistorical role of Social Security in our Government and would be \nequally probably nonproductive as a stimulus to our economy and \nprobably do more damage than good.\n  There is also the proposal that we extend unemployment insurance for \nanother 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks. Well, that has some arguably \npositive benefits if you are into a recession, but we are not in a \nrecession. We have essentially what has historically been deemed full \nemployment in this country, which is we are at about 5 percent of \nunemployment. When you extend unemployment and you have full \nemployment, you are basically creating an atmosphere where people who \nare on\n\n[[Page S36]]\n\nunemployment have no incentive to go out and find a job, even though \nthere may be a job available because you are at pretty much a full \neconomy. So are you being destructive to the system or are you actually \nreducing productivity to the system when you make that choice? I would \nsay that is a very debatable issue and one which needs to be looked at \nbefore we take this action.\n  I understand that politically it is a great press release: We are \ngoing to extend unemployment for 2 weeks for people who are out of \nwork. Yes, that is a great press release, but if you have earned \nliterally at full employment, which is where we appear to be right now, \nor pretty close to it, then to extend unemployment at this time could \nbe counterproductive, significantly counterproductive to keeping the \neconomy going, because it would not allow people to go out and find \njobs for whom jobs may be available.\n  Now, if we do move into recession, which is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has used his \nallotted 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Stevens is to be recognized \nfollowing Senator Gregg and then Senator Bingaman, both of whom I \nbelieve are here. Certainly, if the Senator wishes I would not object, \nbut both I think have been waiting for some period of time on the bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate that, and I will try to make this brief and \nwrap up in less than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. So we have that issue, which is fairly significant. The \nreal goal of a stimulus package should be to create an atmosphere where \nwe actually improve the underlying pillars of the economy, and that \nmeans we improve productivity, we improve the incentive of people to be \nproductive and go out and create jobs, and that can be done if we need \nto do this, and that is very much an issue--that can be done through \ninitiatives which are productive, or which are on the productive side \nof the ledger rather than just on the spending side of the ledger.\n  I know, historically, people have said: Well, inject money into the \neconomy and that will make it move. That was before we got to an \ninternational economy, where essentially injecting money into the \neconomy so consumers can spend money basically moves the Chinese \neconomy, not necessarily ours. What makes much more sense is if we are \ngoing to inject money into this economy through some sort of Federal \ninitiative, we should do it in a way where we create economic benefit \nto our economy, by making it more productive and thus creating more \njobs and creating more incentive for entrepreneurs. There are a lot of \nways to do that. As we proceed down this road to discuss this issue of \nstimulus, I will continue to discuss that point and get specific on \nways we could do that.\n  So I wished to raise this sort of red flag of reason before we step \non to this slippery slope of a stimulus package which could easily end \nup being primarily a spending package, for the purposes of addressing \nwhatever anybody happens to deem to be a good political spending issue, \nthat before we step on that slope, we take a hard look at what we will \nend up with in the way of producing benefit for people today versus \nproducing debt that our children will have to repay and maybe \nundermining our economy generally for the long term.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak today in support of \nmy colleague, Senator Murkowski, and explain my strong support for the \npassage of S. 1200 which will reauthorize the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act.\n  It has been 15 years since the Indian Health Care Act was \nreauthorized and almost 10 years during which reauthorization bills \nwere introduced in the Congress but received no action. Great advances \nin the models for the delivery of health care have occurred during this \ntime which need to be incorporated into the Indian health care system. \nThis bill does that. The health needs of Alaska Natives in our State \nand American Indians throughout the country continue to grow. It is \nimportant we pass this bill.\n  Ten years ago, we opened the Alaska Native Medical Center in \nAnchorage. It is the only tertiary care hospital in the Indian health \ncare system. At the same time, we created the Alaska Native Tribal \nHealth Consortium, and Alaska Natives took over the management of the \nentire Native health care system in our State.\n  I believe much has been done in the last decade. Alaska now has the \nbest health care system in the entire country. The reason, in my \njudgment, is that the system is operated by the Alaska Native people, \nwho have shaped it to fit their own needs. But Alaska Native health \nleaders across our State have told me again and again that they believe \nthis legislation needs to be passed because it contains new provisions \nto aid delivery of health care to the Indian people. It is necessary to \ncontinue their critically important work.\n  This Indian Health Care Improvement Act is a comprehensive bill. \nEvery aspect of what it takes to improve a true system of care to the \nAlaska Natives and the American Indians is in this bill.\n  The health status of Alaska Natives and American Indians is poorer \nthan that of the average American. It is poorer than what the average \nAmerican receives. Many of our people live in remote communities with \nlittle economic base, high unemployment rates, and low income levels. \nThese conditions create a ``perfect storm'' of health care obstacles \nfor Alaska Native people. These people must travel farther than others \nthroughout our country to receive health care services. They are less \nhealthy than the average American, and they have more medical issues \nthey face because of the circumstances under which they live.\n  In Alaska, many communities are not served by roads. For instance, a \npregnant woman living in Adak, way out on the Aleutian chain--almost \n1,200 miles from Anchorage--must travel by air to deliver her child. \nShe must fly to Anchorage to do that. As she does, she will have flown \nmore than 5 hours, and she will be flying on a plane that is only \navailable 2 to 3 days a week. As it is almost everywhere in Alaska, the \nweather conditions are really great problems and can delay the start of \nsuch a trip for a week or more. Of course, all of these concepts \nincrease the cost of health care, but it is the availability of health \ncare that counts, and it is really difficult for our people to get to \nthe areas where health care can be provided to them.\n  The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and the Native health \norganizations in our State have worked hard to improve the health \nstatus of our Native people. Rates for diseases, such as tuberculosis, \nhave dropped dramatically, and we have improved access to health care \nand basic public health measures, such as childhood vaccinations, and \ninstallation of water and sewer systems in rural Alaska has also \nimproved our health care. Between 1950 and 2007, Alaska Native life \nexpectancy rose from 46 years to 64 years of age. Those are \nimprovements brought about by health care.\n  However, in Alaska, as in other parts of the country with Indian \npopulations, many infectious diseases have increased, and other health \nproblems have taken the place of those we have eliminated. Respiratory \nillness outbreaks threaten the lives of Native babies and toddlers and \nfill our hospital beds in the Yukon-Kuskokwim area of our State every \nwinter. Noninfectious conditions, such as suicide, violent injury, and \nintentional injury, still plague Alaska Natives at a very high rate. As \nthe population ages, rates of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes \nthreaten the gains we have made in life expectancy.\n  The Alaska Native health system has been innovative and pioneered \naccess to and delivery of health services to the Native people in \nAlaska. Yet huge disparities continue to exist. This bill needs to be \npassed and funding increased to address these health disparities to \nsave and improve lives in Alaska and to reduce the cost of health care \nthroughout our area and Indian Country.\n  Title I of this Indian health care bill provides support for Native \npeople to receive training as health workers. Each year, Alaska Natives \nand American Indians complete their education,\n\n[[Page S37]]\n\nsupported in part by programs authorized under title I, and return back \nto their home to take positions as nurses, doctors, social workers, \nbehavioral health specialists, and administrators--all to improve the \nhealth care system.\n  The Alaska Community Health Aide Program, which is an important \nexample, is an outstanding example of innovation in the delivery of \nhealth care in remote communities.\n  When I came to the Senate, there was hardly any health care in our \nAlaska villages. They received their health care by the wife or a \nspouse of the superintendent of the Indian school or native school, \ncalling in to Anchorage, their one central hospital. There were no \nhealth aides. We created and pioneered the concept of community health \naides.\n  Through the many years since that time, Alaska Native health leaders \nworked with the Indian Health Service to train community members to \nprovide tuberculosis treatment during epidemics in Alaska, and the \nprogram has provided more than 500 community health aides, with all \nlevels of health care in over 178 remote villages where there is no \nother type of health care provider.\n  Recently, the Community Health Aide Program was expanded by the \nAlaska Native health system, making specifically trained behavioral and \ndental health aides available to people living in villages. Today, \nAlaska's telemedicine system, with installations in 235 sites across \nAlaska, allows the community health aides to have direct access to \nphysicians and dentists in regional hub hospitals in Anchorage and \nFairbanks. They can use telemedicine to contact outside specialists who \ncan assist them in the various clinics throughout the country. I will \nspeak of a few of these people.\n  Jennifer Kalmakof, a community health aide from Chignik Lake, is an \nexample of how important the aides are in their communities. Jennifer \nwon the 2007 Vaccine Alaska Coalition's Excellence in Immunization \nAward, presented to her at the Alaska Public Health Summit this past \nDecember. She made it her mission to increase and improve and maintain \nimmunizations at the local level. She started her own system to keep \ntrack of infants, children, elders, and adults, using her own money to \nbuy tackle boxes in which she organized clinic vaccines and kept them \nin her own refrigerator. She pioneered keeping track of the type of \nassistance these people need in terms of immunizations and various \ntypes of vaccinations.\n  Title II of the bill addresses the range of services authorized, \nrecognizing the change which has already occurred in our non-Native \nhealth system, where the emphasis has shifted from health care to home- \nand community-based care--such as provided by the young woman I \nmentioned--especially for long-term care services. All Alaska Natives \nneed to have access to these home-based services, and the assisted \nliving and nursing homes that recognize the cultural needs of Alaska \nNative elders need to also be available.\n  Title III of the bill addresses safe water and sanitation needs. \nThere continues to be enormous unmet needs for investment in safe water \nand sanitation systems in Alaska Native communities. Currently, 26 \npercent of rural Alaska Native homes lack adequate water and wastewater \nfacilities.\n  For instance, Andrew Dock lives with his large family in Kipnuk, AK. \nIn his household, there are two adults, six boys, and three girls. The \nyoungest child is 1, and the oldest is 22. There is no piped-in water \nin this village and not even a central watering point. In the winter, \nwater is obtained by chopping ice from tundra ponds with a steel ice \npick and hauling it to his home in three 30-gallon gray garbage cans in \na sled pulled by a snow machine. In the summer, he obtains water by \ncollecting rainwater from domestic rooftops. It is also possible to \nhaul water from a lake at Tern Mountain, which is a 13-mile boat trip. \nHauling water is a daily chore--one to three trips a day to support \ndrinking, cooking, and washing clothes. He hauls over 1,000 gallons of \nwater per week to just keep safe water for the Dock household.\n  In Kipnuk, sanitation is accomplished by 5-gallon honey buckets in \neach home. I know Senator Murkowski talked about this. Buckets are \nself-hauled twice a day through the living space of the family and \ndeposited in a collection hopper nearby. Buckets must be emptied into \nanother bucket when they become too full to carry without spilling in \nthe home.\n  Collection of the hoppers is often delayed, and there can be as many \nas five buckets waiting next to the hopper to be emptied.\n  More than 6,000 homes in rural Alaska are without safe drinking \nwater, and nearly 14,000 homes require upgrades or improvements to \ntheir water, sewer, or solid waste systems to meet minimum sanitation \nstandards.\n  There is also an immense unmet need for health care facilities \nthroughout the Indian Health Care system, including in remote parts of \nAlaska. In Barrow, the northernmost point in the United States, $143 \nmillion is needed to build the only hospital in an area the size of \nIdaho. And in Nome, $148.5 million is needed to build the only hospital \nin an area the size of Virginia.\n  Other parts of the bill address the ability of native health \norganizations to bill third parties for health care services delivered \nto native beneficiaries also covered under public or private insurance \nprograms. These funds provide critical additional funds to make up for \nshortfalls in Indian Health Service funding, including for emergency \ncare.\n  While the typical emergency response time from emergency 911 call to \nhospital care is generally clocked in minutes, in Alaska it is clocked \nin hours. In 2005, a young man in Bethel, Alaska, was stabbed in the \nstomach during an early morning fight and needed to be air-ambulanced \nto Anchorage, more than an hour away by jet. Due to weather and \nmechanical issues, the patient finally arrived at the hospital in \nanchorage about 7 hours after the first emergency call. A one-way air \nambulance flight from Bethel to Anchorage costs more than $13,000.\n  Finally, the bill addresses behavioral health needs of native people. \nThe life expectancy of people with mental health issues is 25 years \nless than those without mental health issues. In Alaska that means that \nwhile we continue to make strides towards improving life span, we have \nnot yet been able to adequately address this issue due to program and \nfunding limitations.\n  The combination of substance abuse and mental illness is associated \nwith much higher rates of multiple diseases and early death. One in \neleven Alaska native deaths is alcohol-induced, and alcohol was the \nfourth leading cause of death from 1993 to 2002 in Alaska. Alcohol \ncontributed to 85 percent of reported domestic violence cases and 80% \nof reported sexual assault cases between 2000 and 2003. Suicide among \nAlaska natives remained steadily at two times the non-native rate in \nAlaska from 1992 to 2000.\n  Integrated behavioral health programs can make a difference in this \npicture. Maniilaq, the native health organization in northwest Alaska, \noperates a very successful behavioral health program called the \nMapsivik Treatment Camp, which provides alcohol treatment for families \nin a remote location. It is a year-round program that integrates the \nfamily into cultural and behavioral health treatment models. The camp \nhas been successful in reducing recidivism and helping to heal whole \nfamilies. And the Raven's Way program operated by the Southeast Alaska \nRegional Health Consortium for adolescents has now graduated more than \n1,000 kids. Many of these graduates have gone on to lead healthier \nlives, become hardworking adults, and some have even become native \nleaders.\n  In conclusion, the need to pass this legislation now is clear, and I \nurge my colleagues to support passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act \nwas first enacted in 1976. It has enabled us to develop programs and \nfacilities and services that are models of health care delivery with \ncommunity participation and with cultural relevance.\n  We have accomplished a substantial amount under the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act. American Indians and Alaska Natives today have \nlower mortality rates from diseases, such as heart disease and \ncerebrovascular disease, malignancy, and HIV infection,\n\n[[Page S38]]\n\nthan they did before. Under the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, the \ninfant mortality rate has decreased since 1976 from 22 per 1,000 to 8 \nper 1,000.\n  In spite of the notable improvements, there are still shocking health \ndisparities that remain for Indian people. Let me give you some \nexamples from my home State of New Mexico.\n  First, let me say that over 10 percent of our population in New \nMexico is American Indians. We have the second highest percentage of \nNative Americans of any State in the country.\n  Native American women in New Mexico are three times as likely to \nreceive late or no prenatal care compared to national rates. Native \nAmerican New Mexicans are more than three times more likely to die from \ndiabetes compared to other New Mexicans. Death rates for Native \nAmerican New Mexicans from motor vehicle crashes are more than double \nthose of non-Indians. That is largely explained because American \nIndians on tribal lands have accidents that are far from trauma \ncenters, and therefore they do not have rapid access to lifesaving \ncare.\n  These disparities in mortality rates contribute to a shortened life \nexpectancy for Indians compared to other Americans. National statistics \nshow that Indians live, on average, 6 years less than do other \nAmericans. That discrepancy is as high as 11 years for some South \nDakota tribes.\n  The Indian Health Service is one of the primary sources of health \ncare for Native Americans. For years, the Indian Health Service has \nstruggled to meet the needs of the Indian population, but in doing so \nthey have faced enormous challenges. There are aging facilities, staff \nshortages, funding shortfalls, and all of these present challenges to \nthe Indian Health Service. When facilities and staff are not sufficient \nto meet the needs, contract health services need to be purchased at the \nprevailing rates. Funds supporting contract health services generally \nrun out by about midyear, and that leaves the Indian Health Service \nwith no alternative but to ration care. Life-and-limb saving measures \nare selected by necessity over such things as health promotion and \ndisease prevention.\n\n  So what resources would be adequate to meet these challenges? To \nanswer that question, I call my colleagues' attention to information \nthat has been provided by the Congressional Research Service.\n  Let me put up a chart that makes the comparison that I think is \nuseful. This is a graphic illustration of 10 years of health care \nexpenditures per person in various of the programs we support. The top \nline, the red line, is Medicare, primarily individuals 65 or older in \nthis country. Medicaid is the level of funding per capita we provide \nunder Medicaid. The Indian Health Service number is this blue line \nwhich is the lowest line on the chart. The sum of all public and \nprivate sources of health care dollars divided by the number of users \nnationally, or the average health care expenditure per American, is \ndepicted in the green line. So we can see that the average American \ngets substantially more per recipient spent on them for health care \nservices than does the average Indian American.\n  In 2004, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights produced a report \nentitled ``Broken Promises: Evaluating the Native American Health Care \nSystem.'' This report contained four important findings.\n  No. 1, they found annual per capita health expenditures for Native \nAmericans are far less than the amount spent on other Americans under \nmainstream health plans. That is exactly what this chart says.\n  No. 2, they find annual per capita expenditures fall below the level \nprovided for every other Federal medical program. And, again, that is \ndemonstrated very well on this chart.\n  No. 3, they found annual increases in Indian Health Service funding \nhave failed to account for medical inflation rates or for increases in \nIndian population.\n  And, No. 4, they found that annual increases in Indian health care \nfunding are less than those for other health and human services \ncomponents.\n  This 2004 report concluded:\n\n       Congress failed to provide the resources necessary to \n     create and maintain an effective health care system for \n     Native Americans. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act has \n     not been reauthorized since.\n\n  That report was done in 2004. Reauthorization of this legislation is \nlong overdue. As many of my colleagues have already said, we need to \nact now to ensure its swift passage because of the very serious funding \nshortages within the Indian Health Service.\n  Senator Thune and I are offering an amendment to provide for an \nexpansion of section 506 of the Medicare Modernization Act, which \nprotects Indian Health Service contract health services funding. This \ncontract health services funding is utilized by the Indian Health \nService and tribes to purchase health care services that are not \navailable through the IHS and tribal facilities. These are health \nservices such as critical medical care and speciality inpatient and \noutpatient services.\n  Nationally, the Indian Health Service and tribes contract with more \nthan 2,000 private providers in order to get these services. \nUnfortunately, because of the very low funding levels available for \ncontract health services, funding often runs out in midyear, as I \nindicated before.\n  Making this problem even worse, prior to section 506 of the Medicare \nModernization Act, there was no limitation on the price that could be \ncharged for contract health services. In many instances, providers were \ncharged commercial rates or even higher rates for those services, far \nin excess of the rates that were being paid by Medicare, by Medicaid, \nby the Veterans' Administration, and by other Federal health care \nprograms.\n  Section 506 of the Medicare Modernization Act provided that Medicare \nparticipating hospitals had to agree to accept contract health services \npatients and had to agree that Medicare payment rates would serve as a \nceiling for contract health services payment rates to those hospitals.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3894\n\n  Mr. President, I send a Bingaman-Thune amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Thune, proposes an amendment numbered 3894.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide \n for a limitation on the charges for contract health services provided \n                   to Indians by Medicare providers)\n\n       At the end of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. LIMITATION ON CHARGES FOR CONTRACT HEALTH SERVICES \n                   PROVIDED TO INDIANS BY MEDICARE PROVIDERS.\n\n       (a) All Providers of Services.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1866(a)(1)(U) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395cc(a)(1)(U)) is amended by \n     striking ``in the case of hospitals which furnish inpatient \n     hospital services for which payment may be made under this \n     title,'' in the matter preceding clause (i).\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall apply to Medicare participation agreements in effect \n     (or entered into) on or after the date that is 1 year after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) All Suppliers.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1834 of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395m) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(n) Limitation on Charges for Contract Health Services \n     Provided to Indians by Suppliers.--No payment may be made \n     under this title for an item or service furnished by a \n     supplier (as defined in section 1861(d)) unless the supplier \n     agrees (pursuant to a process established by the Secretary) \n     to be a participating provider of medical care both--\n       ``(1) under the contract health services program funded by \n     the Indian Health Service and operated by the Indian Health \n     Service, an Indian Tribe, or Tribal Organization (as those \n     terms are defined in section 4 of the Indian Health Care \n     Improvement Act), with respect to items and services that are \n     covered under such program and furnished to an individual \n     eligible for such items and services under such program; and\n       ``(2) under any program funded by the Indian Health Service \n     and operated by an urban Indian Organization with respect to \n     the purchase of items and services for an eligible Urban \n     Indian (as those terms are defined in such section 4),\n     in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary \n     regarding payment methodology and rates of payment (including \n     the acceptance of no more than such payment rate as payment \n     in full for such items and services.''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall apply to items and services furnished on or after the \n     date\n\n[[Page S39]]\n\n     that is 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Bingaman-Thune amendment would build \non section 506 to ensure that these requirements, the requirements that \n506 apply to hospitals that were contracted with by the IHS, apply not \njust to hospitals but to all participating Medicare providers and \nsuppliers. In other words, the amendment would ensure that scarce \ncontract health services dollars are used more efficiently, providers \nwould be ensured a greater likelihood of receiving contract health \nservices payments and would be provided continuity in the payment \nlevels with other Federal programs.\n  The Bingaman-Thune amendment is supported by a wide range of Indian \nhealth advocates, including the National Indian Health Board, the \nNavajo Nation, and First Nations Community Health Source in New Mexico.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to join Senator Thune and myself in \nsupporting this important amendment.\n  In conclusion, I underscore that passage of this overall legislation, \nthe Indian Health Care Improvement Act, is critically needed and long \noverdue. I congratulate the Senator from North Dakota for his \npersistence in getting this legislation brought to the floor, and I \ncongratulate and thank our majority leader, Senator Reid, for \nscheduling this as the first item of business in this second session of \nthis Congress. It speaks volumes about the importance Senator Reid \nattaches to this legislation.\n  I hope my fellow Senators will join me in strongly supporting passage \nof the legislation once the Bingaman-Thune amendment has been adopted.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \noffering the amendment. I know he offers it on behalf of himself and \nSenator Thune from South Dakota. I fully support the amendment. This \namendment will provide maximum opportunity to stretch the Indian health \ncare dollars. The amendment is a thoughtful amendment that will, in my \njudgment, strengthen the underlying bill.\n  I am very interested in supporting it. We are working to see if we \ncan get a vote on this amendment today. I believe the majority leader \nwishes to begin voting today, and I hope perhaps we can arrange consent \nto have a vote on this amendment later this afternoon.\n  I also thank the majority leader for bringing this bill to the floor \nof the Senate. When I was vice chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee \nand Senator John McCain was chairman, we worked on this bill. We tried \nvery hard to get it to the floor, but we were not successful. This is \nthe culmination of lot of work and important work, in my judgment, to \nget it to the floor. I appreciate the cooperation of the majority \nleader for giving us the opportunity to get it to the floor.\n  My hope is we will have the cooperation of other Members of the \nSenate. If there are amendments to be offered, we wish they would come \nand offer those amendments. We would like to get amendments and time \nagreements and try to find a way to complete this legislation.\n  I also failed to mention earlier that the Senate Finance Committee \nhad a referral on this bill. They did some very important work. Senator \nBaucus, Senator Grassley, and other members of the Senate Finance \nCommittee were very helpful, as has been Senator Kennedy and Senator \nEnzi on the HELP Committee, and Senator Kyl and others.\n  This bill is bipartisan. We are trying very hard to get this \nlegislation completed. As I indicated earlier, this is long past the \ntime when this should have been done. People are literally dying for \nlack of decent health care that most of us take for granted, most of us \nexpect and receive. That is not the case with respect to Native \nAmericans. We desperately need to change this situation.\n  My hope is, if there are those who are intending to offer amendments \ntoday, that they come to the floor and offer the amendments. We know of \na number of amendments. I appreciate the cooperation of Senator \nBingaman in offering his amendment now. If there are others, I hope we \ncan proceed.\n  Mr. President, I wish to briefly speak about another issue we have \nbeen dealing with. My colleague from New Hampshire spoke briefly, and I \nthink in the absence of others being in the Chamber, I wish to speak as \nin morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, some of my colleagues have spoken today \nabout the difficulty in the economy. I am concerned about it, as are \nvirtually all Americans at this point. The stock market seems to be \nbouncing around like a yo-yo. The economy is slowing and consumer \nspending is down. Recently, there was a substantial increase in \nunemployment in a single month--and a whole series of items that \nsuggest there are real economic problems.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire said: I am concerned about a stimulus \npackage. So am I, but in my judgment, we need to err on the side of \ntaking action rather than err on the side of doing nothing. The Federal \nReserve Board this morning cut interest rates by 75 basis points. That \nis a blunt instrument of monetary policy to try to address what is seen \nas a serious weakness in this economy.\n  I want to say this: No matter what we do--and we almost certainly \nwill produce some sort of stimulus package--I believe a stimulus \npackage should provide some tax rebates to middle and lower income \npeople. It also ought to provide an extension of unemployment benefits. \nWe have done that during previous economic downturns. I think a \nstimulus package should provide investment tax credits for businesses \nwith an end date and other temporary tax incentives to persuade \nbusinesses to make capital investments now when the economy would \nbenefit most from it. So we should do two things: We should put money \nin the hands of consumers, middle to lower income consumers, and we \nalso should stimulate businesses to make needed capital investments \nearlier rather than later in order to prime the pump with respect to \nthe economy.\n  I also think it is important to consider, even as we talk about \nstimulus, making investments in this country's infrastructure. There is \nnothing that puts people back to work more quickly than money that goes \nto building roads and bridges and making other improvements in this \ncountry's infrastructure that are so desperately needed. Many of us are \nworking on and talking about that issue. But that ought to be a part of \na second phase of a stimulus package. To ignore that, in my judgment, \nis to ignore significant job-creating opportunities at a time when we \ndesperately need those opportunities.\n  Having said all of that, I believe we need to act to provide \nconfidence to the American people about the future--after all, that is \nwhat the business cycle is about. If people are confident about the \nfuture, they manifest that confidence. They take the trip they wanted \nto take. They buy the car they wanted to buy. They do the things that \nmanifest confidence in the future. That represents expansion.\n  If they feel as if the future has some troublesome aspects, they say: \nI am going to defer taking the trip, I am going to defer buying that \ncar or piece of equipment, I am going to defer purchasing that piece of \nfurniture, and then the economy contracts.\n  There are some in Washington with an overinflated sense of self who \nthink this is a ship of state with an engine room. And you get out of \nthe engine room and you dial the knobs and the switches and the \nlevers--M-1 B, taxes and all of these things--and somehow the ship of \nstate just sails right on forward.\n  That is not the case at all. This ship of state moves or fails to \nmove based on the people's expectation about the future. If they are \noptimistic, they do things that express that optimism, and the economy \nexpands.\n  I wish to talk for a moment about some of the fundamentals. We can \ngenuflect here and even do some dancing in the Senate Chamber about the \nissue of stimulus packages, but if we don't address the fundamentals, \nwe are not going to get out of this problem.\n  Every single day, 7 days a week, all year long, we import $2 billion \nmore in goods than we export. So we run up a\n\n[[Page S40]]\n\nbill of $700 billion plus a year in trade deficits. Our trade situation \nis an abysmal failure. Do you think the rest of the country doesn't \nknow that? Do you think that has no impact on the falling dollar? Of \ncourse it does. It is one of the reasons the dollar is falling.\n  In addition to that, we have a fiscal policy that has been reckless. \nLast year, we had a $196 billion request from the President in front of \nus, none of it paid for--add it to the debt, he says--for Iraq and \nAfghanistan and restoring military accounts. Well, that is $16 billion \na month, $4 billion a week, and none of it paid for. That is on top of \nthe yearly deficit, which is understated. It uses all the Social \nSecurity money as if it were other revenue in order to show a lower \ndeficit.\n\n  The American people know better and so do the financial markets. They \nsee the combination of a reckless fiscal policy and a trade policy that \nis deeply in debt. They see a country whose fundamentals are out of \nline. These electronic herds, called the currency buyers or currency \ntraders, when they see these things and they run against the currency, \na country is in trouble. We have to get our fundamentals in order. We \nneed to fix our trade policy, stop these hemorrhaging deficits, and we \nneed to fix our fiscal policy.\n  We can't say yes to a President who says let's fight a war and do tax \ncuts for wealthy Americans at the same time. Let's fight a war, spend a \nlot of money doing it--two-thirds of a trillion at this point but \nheading north--and none of it paid for; all of it borrowed. This from a \nconservative President. This Congress has to stop saying yes to that. \nThis reckless fiscal policy has helped set the stage and table for part \nof what we have seen the last couple of weeks, the jitters and concerns \nabout where this country is headed and the economic difficulty we are \nnow in.\n  Let me talk about something my colleague from New Hampshire talked \nabout, and that is the underlying issue of the so-called subprime loan \nscandal. That is a fascinating thing. Someday somebody will do a book \nabout that and just about that issue. Here is what happened, and we \nknow better. Everybody knows better.\n  You wake up in the morning and go to brush your teeth and perhaps you \nhave a television set on. You are sort of getting ready for work and \nyou see a television ad. We see them every morning, and the ads say: Do \nyou have bad credit? Do you have trouble getting a loan? Have you been \nmissing payments on your home loan? Have you filed for bankruptcy? It \ndoesn't matter. Come to us; we will give you a loan.\n  We have all seen these ads, and you think to yourself: Well, how can \nthey do that? How can they advertise that if you have bad credit you \ncan borrow money from them? The fact is, you can't do that. But that is \nwhat we were doing all across this country. Here is what was happening. \nMortgage brokers were making a fortune in big fees by selling subprime \nmortgages. The companies that were writing these mortgages, the largest \nof which was Countrywide Financial, were saying to people: You know \nwhat, take our low-interest mortgage, with a teaser rate at 2 percent. \nIt won't reset for 3 years. By the way, if you have an existing home \nloan, so you can get rid of that and we will lend you money you can pay \nback at a 2-percent interest rate, and it will not reset for 3 years, \nduring which time the market is going to go up and you can flip it and \nsell it. In any event, what we will do is decide that on your home loan \nyou don't have to make any principal payments at this point, just \ninterest. We will add the principal later on.\n  Or they will say, borrow this money from us, and we will make the \nfirst 12 months' payments. For the first year, you make no payments at \nall.\n  OK, that practice was totally, completely and thoroughly \nirresponsible by a bunch of greedy folks. They are talking to people, \ncold-calling them and saying, we would like to put you in a better \nmortgage but not telling them, of course, there is a prepayment \npenalty. They are telling you monthly mortgage payments that didn't \ninclude real estate taxes, insurance costs, and so forth. So they were \nquoting borrowers 2 percent teaser rates with prepayment penalties that \ndidn't include the escrow. So they put these people in these loans.\n  Now, were the victims partly at fault? Sure. By victims, I am talking \nabout those who took these loans out. But these were high-powered \nsalespeople working for big companies that were putting bad products in \nthe hands of a lot of unsuspecting people.\n  Then what do they do? They have these subprime loans packaged up with \nother loans. It is sort of like the old days when they used to put \nsawdust in sausage in the meat plants and mix it all up as filler. Then \nthey would cut it up and you would never know where the filler was and \nwhere the sausage was. Well, similar to that, they would take the good \nloans and the subprime loans and they would mix them all together and \nput them in securities--securitize them. Then they would sell the \nsecurities to these hedge funds, among others. So hedge funds were \nbuying securities. They didn't have the foggiest idea what they were \nbuying because the rating agency said it looked okay. These agencies \nwere dead from the neck up.\n  Everybody was greedy, and now the whole tent comes collapsing down. \nNow, you say, how could that be? Well, it was because people were \nloaning money to people who were never going to be able to repay it. \nThe CEO of Countrywide, the largest company doing this, made hundreds \nof millions of dollars selling the stock back. It looks like \nCountrywide is going to go belly up, so Bank of America comes in and \nbuys Countrywide. No idea why, but the big guys, they all waltz off \nsmiling ear to ear, sparkling teeth and big smiles. Why? Because they \nmade a lot of money--hundreds of millions of dollars. Meanwhile, all \nthese folks can't repay their mortgages and are left to try to pick up \nthe pieces and then we wonder what on Earth happened here.\n  In the midst of all this, this morning I was listening to a TV show \nwith a man named Jim Cramer, who talks about stock prices. He has a TV \nshow. Half the time he is yelling. I don't have the foggiest idea why \nhe thinks that is the approach to use to thoughtfully talk about stock \nprices, but apparently it is successful. So he says this morning that \none of the ways we should deal with the problem in the economy is to \nstart trying to provide some recompense or some money to the insurers \nof bonds and other things that are going to get hit--derivatives, he \nsaid. And I thought, I understand that language. He is talking about \ncredit default swaps.\n\n  That sounds like a flatout foreign language, but it can't be because \nI don't speak a foreign language. Credit default swaps. So what Jim \nCramer was talking about on the television this morning is that in \norder to bail out this country, his approach is we ought to provide \nabout 50 percent of taxpayer money to the losses for those who have \ncredit default swaps. Let me talk a moment about what this means \nbecause, as I said, it sounds completely foreign.\n  Hedge funds in this country are largely unregulated. I, Senator \nFeinstein, and many others have tried for a long time to say that is \ndangerous for this country. Hedge funds are somewhere around $1 to $1.5 \ntrillion. Now, that is not so much, considering mutual funds are about \n$9 trillion. The total of the stocks and bonds in the stock market and \nbond funds are about $40 billion. So hedge funds are about $1 to $1.5 \ntrillion. But hedge funds represent one-half of all the trades on the \nstock market. Think of that--$1 trillion plus unregulated--and they \ncomprise half the trades on the stock market.\n  Now, because of the very heavy use of the leverage, it is a fact that \nhedge funds can lose much more than they are worth. If somebody goes \ninto a casino in Las Vegas with a pocketful of money and grinning, \nthinking they are going to win a lot of money but end up losing it all, \nin most cases the only thing they lose is the money they have. That is \nnot the case with heavily leveraged hedge funds.\n  That is why the episode with Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge \nfund that had the smartest people working for them, was so important \nthat over a decade ago the Federal Reserve Board had to try to save \nLong-Term Capital Management. That hedge fund was unbelievably \nleveraged, over $1 trillion. Its collapse would have affected the \nentire American economy.\n  So here is what we have. We have this language now called credit \ndefault\n\n[[Page S41]]\n\nswaps. The credit default swap is a derivative, and it is an insurance \npolicy on a bond or some other instrument. The person who sells the \nswap is actually writing a policy that collects a premium, and it says \nif nothing goes wrong with the underlying instrument, the person who \nsold the swap gets the premium and looks like a genius. If, however, \nthe bond or the underlying instrument collapses, then the swap seller \nhas to make good. The notional amount--understand this--the notional \namount, the aggregate of bonds, loans, and other debt called by credit \ndefault swaps in the United States, is now $26 trillion.\n  I have spoken before on the floor of the Senate about creating a \nhouse of cards, every child has done it, and then pulled out a card on \nthe bottom. Everyone understands what happens to the house of cards. We \nnow have roughly $1-$1.5 trillion in hedge funds, as I understand it, \ndoing one-half of the stock trades on the stock exchanges. In most \ncases, hedge funds have a notional value of $26 trillion in credit \ndefault swaps, and the question is: Where is all this exposure? How \nmuch exposure? We don't know. Most hedge funds are unregulated, and a \nwhole lot of folks in this Chamber have wanted to keep it that way, \ndespite the efforts of some of us who believe it is dangerous to our \neconomy to pretend this kind of risk does not exist.\n  It is interesting to me that we are in this situation and troubling \nto me we are in a situation that all of us knew was going to be \ndifficult. You can't run a $2-billion-a-day trade deficit without \nconsequence. Warren Buffett always pointed out with the housing bubble \nthat every bubble bursts. It is one of the immutable laws. The question \nisn't whether, it is when. He makes the same point about the trade \ndeficit. The trade deficit is unsustainable. The question isn't whether \nwe will see consequences, the question is when will those consequences \nexist.\n  The consequences are beginning to exist now, with the declining value \nof the dollar and the combination of all the other issues--the highest \ndeficits in human history, the trade deficit, a fiscal policy that is \ncompletely and thoroughly reckless, combined with the scandal that \nexists with respect to subprime loans and the massive amount of \nunregulated hedge fund credit swap defaults. I mean it is staggering to \nsee what we have done. Again, the credit default swap is a notional \nderivative whose value is dramatic and the consequences of which could \nbe dramatic for the entire economy.\n  Most regulators were looking the other way and doing so deliberately. \nIf ever one wonders whether thoughtful and effective regulation is \nnecessary, look at all this. If anyone has ever wondered whether you \ncan get by with a trade deficit of $2 billion a day, look at where we \nfind ourselves now. If anyone ever wonders if you can spend money you \ndon't have on things you don't need, look at this country's fiscal \npolicy and its consequences for the country.\n  Having said that, all of us want the same thing for this country's \nfuture. We want a country that grows and provides economic opportunity. \nWe want a country where the fundamentals are fair and put in order. \nThat means a trade deficit that is eliminated, or at least close to \neliminated, and a trade policy that works for this country's interest. \nIt means a fiscal policy that pays our bills, and it means effective \nregulation in areas where you have substantial potential risk for the \nentire economy, and that means regulation of certain hedge funds' \ntransactions and derivatives now well outside the view of public \nregulators.\n  So I think this is going to be a very difficult time for this \ncountry. It is one thing for us to take a shower in the morning, put on \na suit and drive to work and talk about it, it is another thing for the \npeople who go home tonight and say: Sweetheart, I have lost my job, not \nbecause I didn't do a good job, but they are laying people off where I \nwork. That is a consequence for that family in which unemployment is \n100 percent.\n  We face some pretty daunting challenges. My hope with this President \nand with Republicans and Democrats working together, as the Speaker of \nthe House and the majority leader of the Senate said last week, with \nall of us working together, combined with the Federal Reserve's \nmonetary policy, that we can develop some thoughtful approaches in \nfiscal policy that might lead us in a constructive direction to say to \nthe American people we believe you can honestly look at the future and \nhave a positive view. But they won't believe that if they feel we are \nnot serious about the fundamentals. The American people aren't going to \nbe fooled. If we don't fix our trade policies and get rid of these \nunbelievable deficits, if we don't put our fiscal house in order and \nstop doing what the administration suggests we do, we are in big \ntrouble.\n  We had a Treasury Secretary named Paul O'Neill--the first Treasury \nSecretary under this President. If ever there was a straight shooter in \nGovernment, it was Paul O'Neill. He came here as an executive from an \naluminum company. He was blunt-spoken, an interesting guy, and I \nhappened to like him a lot. Paul O'Neill got fired. In fact, Dick \nCheney is the one who fired him, at the request of the President. When \nfired, he was told that deficits don't matter. Deficits don't matter.\n  Well, we now understand they do matter and we have to do something \nabout it. This fiscal policy is out of control. Our trade policy is \nbroken and we have had regulators who looked the other way while we had \ngrand theft in this area of the subprime scandal, and it is time we \ntell the American people we are serious about addressing these issues \nand we are going to do it now.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act. I, first, wish to thank our \nchairman, Senator Dorgan, for his passion and commitment. I have had \nthe opportunity to listen to some of the floor debate and opening \ncomments and very much appreciate the way you have laid out the \nincredible need for this legislation and the fact it is long overdue.\n  It is a promise that has not been kept, and hopefully today we are \ngoing to move forward in keeping that. Also, thank you to my friend and \nranking member, Senator Murkowski, for her eloquence as well in laying \nout the legislation. It is wonderful to see the partnership that has \nhappened on this legislation.\n  I also wish to remember our colleague, former Senator Craig Thomas, \nwho I know was a wonderful friend to Indian Country and cared very \ndeeply about these issues. We certainly take a moment again to remember \nhim and send our best wishes to his family in remembrance of his \nleadership on this issue as well.\n  Just over 31 years ago, this bill, the original bill, was signed into \nlaw by the late President Gerald R. Ford, who I am proud to say resided \nand represented the great State of Michigan. It had the purpose of \nbringing the health status of Native Americans up to the level of other \nAmericans.\n  This program, the Indian Health Services Program, funds health \nservices to about 1.8 million Native Americans from our Nation's more \nthan 500 federally recognized American Indian and Alaskan Native \ntribes. I am proud to have many of them in Michigan.\n  The Federal Government provides those health care services based on \nour trust responsibility to Indian tribes derived from Federal \ntreaties, statutes, court rulings, Executive actions, and from our own \nConstitution, which assigns authority over Indian relations to the \nCongress.\n  Reauthorization of the various Indian health care programs has \nlanguished for 15 years in this body, so our work today is vital. It is \na vital component, it is long overdue, as our chairman has reminded us \nover and over again in bringing this issue forward for years.\n  It is a vital component in improving and updating health care \nservices in Indian Country. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act will \nmodernize and improve Indian health care services and delivery. We know \nthis is an incredibly important step. We know more\n\n[[Page S42]]\n\nneeds to be done, but we know this is an incredibly important step.\n  The bill will also allow for in-home care for Indian elders and will \nprovide much-needed programs to address mental health and other issues \nrelated to the well-being of Indian communities.\n  More importantly, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act will address \nmany health care disparities in Indian Country. For example, infant \nmortality rates are 150 percent greater for Indians than for Caucasian \ninfants.\n  Those in the Indian communities are 2.6 times more likely to be \ndiagnosed with diabetes. Tuberculosis rates for Native Americans are \nfour times the national average. The life expectancy for Native \nAmericans is nearly 6 years less than the rest of the U.S. population.\n  What this bill, unfortunately, cannot do is mandate the necessary \nfunding from our budget every year to uphold our country's trust \nresponsibility to provide adequate health care to our tribal members. \nBut we intend to make sure that happens.\n  As it stands, the Indian Health Services annual funding does not \nallow it to provide all the needed care for eligible Native Americans. \nThat is what we are speaking to today, that sense of urgency we have in \nmaking that happen.\n  As of today, funding levels are only at 60 percent of the demand for \nservices each year, which requires IHS tribal health facilities, \norganizations, and urban clinics to ration care so the most critical \ncare and the needs are funded first and foremost, which, in turn, \nresults in the tragic denial of needed services for too many men, \nwomen, and children, old and young in Indian country.\n  As unbelievable as it may sound, health care expenditures to Native \nAmericans are less than half of what America spends on Federal \nprisoners.\n  Preventative health care is so important for Indian Country due to \nthe high incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity \nwithin these communities. IHS funding shortfalls for medical personnel \nhave only further contributed to the severe gaps in health care \ndelivery in Indian Country. In 2005, there were job vacancy rates of 24 \npercent for dentists, 14 percent for nurses, 11 percent for physicians \nand pharmacists, according to IHS data.\n  I am very pleased and proud to be a cosponsor of this important \nlegislation, as it establishes objectives to address these health \ndisparities between Native Americans and other members of the American \ncommunity. It will enhance IHS ability to attract and retain qualified \nhealth care professionals for Indian Country.\n  As a government, I am also hopeful we will commit the additional \nresources to Indian health care for this year and every year in the \nfuture. The time has long passed for this reauthorization. I am very \nproud our leader, Senator Reid, has determined this to be a priority \nfor the Senate. I am proud of the work that has been done. It is truly \ntime to get this done now.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment at the desk, Vitter amendment No. 3896.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have not had a chance to visit with the \nSenator from Louisiana. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3896\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 3896 at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \ncommittee amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3896.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To modify a section relating to limitation on use of funds \n                      appropriated to the Service)\n\n       Strike section 805 of the Indian Health Care Improvement \n     Act (as amended by section 101(a)) and insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 805. LIMITATION RELATING TO ABORTION.\n\n       ``(a) Definition of Health Benefits Coverage.--In this \n     section, the term `health benefits coverage' means a health-\n     related service or group of services provided pursuant to a \n     contract, compact, grant, or other agreement.\n       ``(b) Limitation.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), no \n     funds or facilities of the Service may be used--\n       ``(A) to provide any abortion; or\n       ``(B) to provide, or pay any administrative cost of, any \n     health benefits coverage that includes coverage of an \n     abortion.\n       ``(2) Exceptions.--The limitation described in paragraph \n     (1) shall not apply in any case in which--\n       ``(A) a pregnancy is the result of an act of rape, or an \n     act of incest against a minor; or\n       ``(B) the woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical \n     injury, or physical illness that, as certified by a \n     physician, would place the woman in danger of death unless an \n     abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical \n     condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I offer an important amendment with \nregard to abortion and the pro-life cause. It is a very appropriate day \nthat we talk about this because as we speak tens of thousands upon tens \nof thousands of people, particularly young people, from all around the \ncountry are marching in Washington, on the Mall, at the Supreme Court, \nin a positive, vibrant march for life. In offering this amendment, I \nalso want to thank all of my original amendment cosponsors: Senators \nAllard, Brownback, Thune, and Inhofe.\n  This amendment is very simple. This amendment codifies, solidifies \nthe Hyde amendment policy in this important Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act. It establishes, reasserts, the policy of the Hyde \namendment with regard to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and \nputs that Hyde amendment language in the authorization language for \nthis important part of Federal law.\n  Let me explain why it is necessary. For many years the Hyde amendment \nhas been honored, including in this Federal program, but in a very \nroundabout and precarious way. For many years this program and this \nauthorization have included language that says: This program will be \ngoverned by whatever abortion language is contained in the current \nHealth and Human Services appropriations bill. And for those years, \nCongress has included Hyde amendment language in that appropriations \nbill to which this program points. That has worked, sort of, in \naccomplishing having the Hyde amendment in Federal law with regard to \nIndian health care, but it puts it in a tenuous and precarious posture. \nIt puts it up for debate and possible change of policy every year, \nevery time we debate a new Health and Human Services appropriations \nbill. Therefore, it doesn't make the policy very solid, very secure, or \nvery clear.\n  My amendment is very simple. It would simply place that Hyde \namendment language directly in the Indian health care language and say: \nNo Federal funds in this program will be used to perform abortions \nexcept in the rare exceptions delineated in the original Hyde \namendment.\n  This is very appropriate. Why should we go to this in such a \nroundabout and tenuous and precarious way? I think we should place that \nclear policy, which has been accepted over many years, since the \noriginal Hyde amendment debate, directly in the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act and not have it sort of get there maybe every year \nthrough such a torturous and tenuous and precarious route.\n  It is very simple. On this day, where tens of thousands upon tens of \nthousands of Americans, particularly young\n\n[[Page S43]]\n\npeople--and that is so heartening--are marching on Washington in a \npositive march for life, will we clearly reaffirm that Hyde amendment \nlanguage in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act? I suggest all of us \nshould do that. I suggest that would be a positive statement for life, \nfor positive values for the future. Voting for the amendment will \naccomplish just that.\n  I have talked to the chairman of the committee, and he has indicated \nthat a vote will be forthcoming further on in the debate of this bill. \nI welcome that. I welcome everyone on both sides of the aisle joining \ntogether around this consensus amendment to make a positive statement \nfor life, to reaffirm what has been Federal policy for several years, \nthe Hyde amendment, and to move forward, hopefully together, in a \npositive spirit, making that positive statement for life.\n  In closing, this is a very important issue and a very important \namendment, a very important vote to millions of people around the \ncountry who care deeply about life. Because of that, this will be a \nvote focused on and graded by several key national groups; \nspecifically, the National Right to Life Committee, Concerned Women of \nAmerica, and the Family Research Council.\n  I have letters from all three of these groups making clear their \nstrong support of the Vitter amendment and also making clear that this \nvote on this amendment will be graded in their activity monitoring the \nCongress. I ask unanimous consent that three letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    National Right\n\n\n                                      to Life Committee, Inc.,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 2007.\n     Re Vitter Amendment to S. 1200 (abortion funding).\n\n       Dear Senator: The Senate is expected to soon consider S. \n     1200, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Amendments of \n     2007. The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) urges you \n     to vote for an amendment that Senator Vitter will offer, \n     which would codify a longstanding policy against funding of \n     abortions with federal Indian Health Service (IHS) funds \n     (except to save the life of the mother, or in cases of rape \n     or incest).\n       For Medicaid, federal funding of abortion was restricted \n     beginning in 1976 by enactment of the Hyde Amendment to the \n     annual HHS appropriations bill. However, because the IHS is \n     funded through the separate Interior appropriations bill, \n     which has never contained a ``Hyde Amendment,'' the IHS \n     continued to pay for abortion on demand long after the Hyde \n     Amendment was enacted. The Reagan Administration curbed the \n     practice administratively in 1982, as a temporary fix. \n     Subsequently, in an IHS reauthorization bill in 1988, \n     Congress enacted 25 U.S.C. Sec. 1676, which said that any \n     abortion funding limitations found in the HHS appropriations \n     measure in effect at any given time will also apply to the \n     IHS. That requirement, which would be continued by Section \n     805 of S. 1200 as reported, provides no real assurance that \n     federal IHS funds will not be used to pay for abortion on \n     demand in the future, because the language of future HHS \n     appropriations bills depends upon a host of legislative and \n     political contingencies. Rather than merely extending such a \n     convoluted arrangement, NRLC urges adoption of Senator \n     Vitter's amendment, which would simply codify the \n     longstanding policy: No federal funds for abortion, except to \n     save the life of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest. \n     The substance of Senator Vitter's amendment is based directly \n     on the version of the Hyde Amendment that has been in effect \n     since 1997, which appears as Section 508 in the current \n     Labor/HHS appropriations bill (H.R. 3043).\n       In short, if you are opposed to direct federal funding of \n     abortion on demand, you should support the Vitter Amendment. \n     Rejection of the Vitter Amendment would have the effect of \n     leaving the door open to future federal funding of abortion \n     on demand by the IHS.\n       We anticipate that the roll call on the Vitter Amendment \n     will be included in NRLC's scorecard of key pro-life votes of \n     the 110th Congress. Thank you for your consideration of \n     NRLC's position on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Douglas Johnson,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 October 29, 2007.\n     Hon. David Vitter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Vitter: The 500,000 members of Concerned Women \n     for America are grateful for your continued commitment to the \n     sanctity of life. We appreciate your work to eliminate \n     federal funding of abortions through the Indian Health Care \n     Improvement Act (S. 1200). This amendment will benefit many \n     women and save innocent lives as Indian Health Services (IHS) \n     funds will be prohibited for use for abortions.\n       Thank you for your work to codify a longstanding policy and \n     ensure that despite the change in partisan politics, this \n     nation will stand for life. A permanent adoption of this \n     policy to the IHS program will be a positive step in the \n     direction of upholding our nation's claim to the sanctity of \n     life.\n       The Hyde amendment of 1976 restricted the federal funding \n     of abortion through Medicaid, but this policy did not apply \n     to the IHS due to its receiving funding through a separate \n     Interior Appropriations bill. The IHS continued to pay for \n     abortion on demand until 1982. This was six years too long. \n     Though the Reagan administration administratively curbed the \n     practice, future administrations have not been and will not \n     be barred from paying for abortion on demand using IHS funds.\n       Senator Vitter, that is why we are grateful for your pro-\n     life amendment to S. 1200. Legislative policies are needed to \n     ensure that the sanctity of life is not subject to partisan \n     politics. We appreciate your commitment to prohibit the \n     federal government from funding abortion on demand.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Wendy Wright,\n\n                                                        President,\n     Concerned Women for America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Family Research Council,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 14, 2008.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of Family Research Council and the \n     families we represent, I want to urge you to vote for the \n     amendment offered by Senator David Vitter (R-LA) to the \n     Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 2007 (S. 1200) which \n     would prevent Indian Health Service funds from being used for \n     abortion. Exceptions would include cases where the life of \n     the mother is at risk, or in the case of rape or incest with \n     a minor. We strongly support this amendment.\n       Current federal law since the 1988 Indian Health Care \n     reauthorization limits Indian Health Service funds from being \n     used to perform abortion. It does so by referencing the Hyde \n     provision in the annual LHHS appropriations bill, which \n     prohibits such funding for abortion. S. 1200 in Section 805 \n     reiterates this reference to the Hyde provision. However, if \n     the Hyde provision were removed from the LHHS appropriations \n     bill, funding of abortion under Indian Health Services would \n     ensue.\n       Senator Vitter's amendment language is similar to the Hyde \n     provision and would simply codify this long-standing policy \n     in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. As such, federal \n     Indian Health Service funds would not be used for abortions, \n     no matter what happens with the Hyde provision in future \n     appropriations cycles.\n       Your support for the Vitter amendment will uphold the long-\n     standing policy that United States taxpayers should not \n     subsidize abortion. FRC reserves the right to score votes \n     surrounding this amendment in our scorecard for the Second \n     Session of the 110th Congress to be published this fall.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Thomas McClusky,\n                            Vice President for Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Again, in closing, I welcome all of our colleagues to \nsupport this commonsense, pro-life, positive amendment. I look forward \nto any further debate on it, to answer any questions that might arise, \nand to an important vote before we conclude consideration on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 2539 \nand S. 2540 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk \nabout my support for the reauthorization of the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act. I am a cosponsor of this bill because there is a vital \nneed for our Native American communities to have access to modernized \nhealth care.\n  Today, the health disparities between our tribal communities and the \nrest of the country are shocking. According to the Indian Health \nService, the average life expectancy for Native Americans is almost \n2\\1/2\\ years below any other group in the country. The incidence of \nsudden death syndrome among tribal communities is more than three times \nthe rate of nontribal infants. If you are a Native American, you are \n200 percent more likely to die of diabetes, you are 500 percent more \nlikely to die from tuberculosis, you are 550 percent more\n\n[[Page S44]]\n\nlikely to die from alcoholism, and you are 60 percent more likely to \ncommit suicide.\n  These may seem like nothing but statistics, but behind them are real \npeople who are in real need of modernized health care services.\n  The suicide rate among Native American youth is the highest of any \nracial group in the Nation. In fact, suicide is the third leading cause \nof death among Native American youth. One of the country's most recent \nvictims is a 12-year-old Red Lake boy who hanged himself last October. \nThis young boy's suicide only added to the heartache of the Red Lake \nIndian Reservation, which is located in my State of Minnesota. This \nIndian reservation, the people there had already suffered a lot. Back \nin March of 2005, at the Red Lake High School, a troubled teenager \nnamed Jeff Weise went on a shooting rampage, killing nine people before \nturning the gun on himself. Most of the news reports highlighted the \ntroubled teen's past, including a history of depression and suicide \nattempts and the daunting socioeconomic conditions in his reservation \ncommunity. This calamity serves as a tragic reminder of the importance \nof increasing efforts to effectively address mental health issues in \nIndian Country and elsewhere. I know my colleague, Senator Dorgan, has \nbeen leading this effort, this bipartisan effort, to make sure we \nreauthorize this important act.\n  We know the negative impact mental health issues have on our \ncommunities, but we also know access to modern mental health care \nresources can make a difference. That is why it is so critical to \nreauthorize the Indian Health Care and Improvement Act.\n  Reauthorizing this bill will provide tribal communities with the \ntools needed to build comprehensive behavioral health prevention and \ntreatment programs--programs that emphasize collaboration among alcohol \nand substance abuse, social services, and mental health programs, and \nprograms that will help communities such as Red Lake prevent further \ntragedies.\n  Reauthorizing this bill will also help tribal communities attract and \nretain qualified Indian health care professionals and address the \nbacklog in needed health care facilities on Indian reservations. I have \nvisited the facilities. I visited the reservations throughout my State, \nand I know they are in need of this help. The lack of availability of \nnearby health care facilities and specialized treatment is a major \nconcern for tribal communities, especially those with large \nreservations.\n  On the Minnesota White Earth Indian Reservation, which is the largest \nreservation in our State, spanning 200 miles and home to almost 10,000 \npeople, elective surgeries are not even an option--in an area that \nspans 200 miles--due to a lack of modernized health care resources and \nfacilities. Currently, these White Earth tribal members are unable to \nundergo elective surgery on the reservation. These are people who need \na hip replacement or a knee replacement or a simple cataract surgery, \nbut they are unable to get the health care they deserve because there \nis a lack of doctors, adequate medical facilities, and basic insurance \ncoverage.\n  The Federal Government has a trust responsibility to provide health \ncare for our tribal communities. I cosponsored the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act because we made a commitment to our tribal communities. \nWe must ensure our tribal communities have access to convenient, \npreventive, and modern health care. I urge my colleagues to join me and \nsupport reauthorizing this important bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I believe Senator Nelson of Florida is \non his way. Before that, the legislation we brought to the floor from \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs has been worked on for a long while. It \nis long past due to be considered by the Congress. It deals with the \nurgent need for Indian health care.\n  I want to especially say we worked with the National Indian Health \nBoard on this legislation and Sally Smith, chair of the board; with the \nTribal Leaders Steering Committee on Indian Health, Buford Rollin, \ncochair, and Rachel Joseph, cochair. We worked closely with the \nNational Congress of American Indians, Joe Garcia, president, and \nJackie Johnson, executive director. We held listening sessions at many \nIndian reservations to talk about the challenges and what we need to do \nto resolve these issues.\n  I wish to mention as well today we have from the White House a \nstatement of administration policy in which the White House is talking \nabout a potential veto of this legislation. That is not particularly \nunusual. The White House has been talking about vetoing almost anything \nand everything for the last several months. So I am not particularly \nsurprised. My hope is we can work with the White House. This is a \nbipartisan piece of legislation. We expect to pass it through the \nCongress, and my hope is the President will sign it.\n  I wish to address one of the issues the White House is concerned \nabout--the Indian urban health care program. The President has \nrequested we not have any funding for it, that we discontinue the urban \nIndian health care program. My colleague, Senator Murkowski, and I and \nmany others have disagreed with that. We believe there is a need for \nthe urban Indian health care program.\n  I wish to describe that need by describing one person, a Native \nAmerican, the late Lyle Frechette. This is a photograph taken after he \nfinished high school. He was a member of the Menominee Tribe of Indians \nin Wisconsin. He was a proud veteran, who went into the Marine Corps \nright after high school, when this picture was taken. After serving his \ncountry as a U.S. marine, he came home to the Indian reservation to \nfind life had significantly changed. That was at a time in this country \nwhen we were going through what is called ``termination and \nrelocation.'' The policy in this country was to say to American Indians \nthat we want to get you off the reservation and to a city someplace.\n  In fact, the official policy of the Federal Government was to \nterminate government-to-government relationships with 109 Indian tribes \nduring that period, the early 1950s. It was suggested, well, let's \nterminate relationships with tribes and say to these Indians: Go to the \ncity and leave your reservation. So many did, and Lyle Frechette did. \nThe movement from a tribal reservation, where there was some Indian \nhealth care, although inadequate, to the major cities meant that Lyle \nFrechette was leaving an area that had vast forests and timber \nresources that represented financial stability for the Menominee Tribe. \nYet the Federal Government thought this was a great candidate for \ntermination. So they took steps to terminate the tribal status.\n  That termination had catastrophic effects on the lives of many of the \ntribal governments and the people who were members of the tribes. It \nrequired many of the young tribal members, such as Lyle Frechette, to \neither stay on the reservation and live in abject poverty, with no \nfurther health or any benefits that had long been promised to them, or \nparticipate in the Federal urban relocation program. Often, they were \ngiven a one-way bus ticket and told good luck; they ended up in cities \nwith substantial limitations on what they could do.\n  Lyle Frechette had a young wife and a child and they relocated to \nMilwaukee, WI, 3\\1/2\\ hours from the reservation. He no longer had \naccess to health care on the Indian reservation. There were very few \nurban clinics and the relocated Indians only qualified for private \nsector insurance for 6 months, and that was over. Health care is \nessential. Many of these folks, including this young man, left the \nreservation because of the termination and relocation program and \ndiscovered they were not able to access health care programs.\n  Then, over a period of years, urban health care programs were \nestablished to try to be helpful to those whom we had literally forced \noff the reservations. The fact is it has been a lifesaving experience \nfor many urban Indians to be able to access that which was guaranteed \nthem as part of the trust responsibility of the Federal Government to \nAmerican Indians, even being\n\n[[Page S45]]\n\nable to access that in some of our urban areas. The President has \nwanted to shut down that program. We have said we don't support that, \non a bipartisan basis. Congress has said the urban health care programs \nfor American Indians has worked very well.\n  I wished to describe that issue because the President indicated that \nis one of the issues in his letter and the statement of administrative \npolicy today in which he suggests he may well veto this legislation. I \nhope he will not and that we will work on a bipartisan basis to \nconvince the President doing this is the right thing to do.\n  I know my colleague from Florida is here ready to speak. At this \npoint, I yield the floor, and my colleague wishes to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I wish to say to the very \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota he has always been one of the \nforemost advocates for improving Indian health on the tribal lands, and \nI intend to support him. I thank him for his advocacy.\n  In my State of Florida, we have a number of very prominent Indian \ntribes, the Seminoles, the Mikasukis, and others. The good fortune is \nthey do not have the health problems other tribes have throughout other \nparts of the country. Yet there are some problems in Florida as well. \nThis is a matter we cannot continue to close our eyes to. We need to \nhelp them. I intend to support the Senator from North Dakota on this \nbill. I look forward to its passage and, hopefully, working out the \nproblems with the White House so they will not veto this legislation.\n  Madam President, I wish to talk about this. We are now obviously in a \nrecession: the gyration of the stock market, the weakness of the \ndollar, the roiling markets around the world, the emergency meeting of \nthe Federal Reserve, the cutting of the rate three-quarters of a \npercent, from 4\\1/4\\ to 3\\1/2\\, the likelihood they will meet again \nnext week and cut the interest rate further. We are in a full-scale \nrecession.\n  I have returned from my State of Florida and this recess having done \ntown hall meetings all over the State, in which the town halls were \npacked, with standing room only. They were out into the hallways. They \nwere hungry to be heard, and that is the way I conduct those town hall \nmeetings. I go in and say: This is your meeting, and I want to hear \nwhat is on your mind, what your concerns are, and I want to know how \nyou are hurting, so we can try to help you. We pick up huge numbers of \ncases for our caseworkers as a result of these outreach town hall \nmeetings all over my State.\n  Let me remind you my State is the fourth largest in the Union and by \n2012 it will surpass New York and will be the third largest in the \nUnion. In that midst of 18 million people who are as diverse as \nAmerica, indeed becoming as diverse as the Western Hemisphere, people \nare hurting. In addition to the global and national economies, our \npeople are triply hurting by getting the double whammy of increased \nreal estate taxes, as well as huge increases in homeowners insurance. \nWe talked about this crisis many times on the floor--about an \nappropriate Federal role to assist the States with regard to insurance \nmarkets that have gone out of control, jacking the rates to the Moon, \nin the anticipation of another catastrophe following Katrina in New \nOrleans and the previous year, 2004, four hurricanes that hit Florida \nwithin a 6-week period.\n  All those things have come together, so that I can tell you in these \n15 town hall meetings I did, from literally one end of Florida, Key \nWest, to the other, Pensacola, people are hurting. You take a very \nupscale, increasingly hot economy, such as Fort Myers, Lee County, they \nare in the economic doldrums. They are hurting. Go to your rural areas. \nWe always talk about rural health care. It is certainly true there. But \nthe rural areas are depressed. The jobs have diminished. Unemployment \nhas gone up. The people are concerned about their investments. The main \ninvestment the average Florida family has is their home. If they need \ncash and need to sell their home, now they cannot sell their home \nbecause there is a complete flat market; and if they need cash, trying \nto get an additional loan because of equity, the banks are not loaning. \nSo you get the picture of what is happening in Florida. Indeed, Florida \nis the microcosm of America. This is happening all over America.\n  Now, what we have already voted on in the Senate is a first step. But \nit is a small step. We have voted on, and I have supported, mortgage \nforgiveness debt relief so if a bank were to forgive part of the loan, \nwe want to change the Tax Code so the homeowner doesn't have to pay \nincome tax on that reduction in the amount of the loan the bank grants \nthem, to try to keep them solvent so they can continue to pay off the \nloan.\n  We are also supporting property tax relief, which is that 32 million \nhomeowners, or 70 percent of taxpayers, do not itemize their real \nestate property taxes, and of that 70 percent, 32 million of those are \nhomeowners. What we are suggesting is that we give them a standard \ndeduction, so if you own real estate property and you don't itemize \nyour deductions, there will be a standard deduction that will be \navailable.\n  And then in December the Senate passed, and this Senator voted for, \nthe Federal Housing Administration Modernization Act. It was intended \nto help homeowners in the risky subprime mortgages to be able to \nrefinance them through the FHA into more reliable mortgages. These are \nall attempts at getting at the problem. But that was December and this \nis now late January and the economy has slipped further and deeper into \nrecession. So we need to come out in a bipartisan way with a fix that \nwill help stimulate the economy and try to get us back on \ntrack: increasing unemployment compensation perhaps from the 26 weeks \nto as many as 46 weeks; the ability to go in and put money quickly in \nsomebody's pocket, such as a reduction of the payroll taxes, that in \nthose every 2-week paychecks, they will see an increase in that take-\nhome pay; perhaps for those who are hurting the most at the lower end \nof the economic scale, additional food stamps; infrastructure support \nthat would get money into the economy, stimulating and turning over \nthose dollars into the economy if it is invested in items that can be \nspent immediately in the much needed repair of roads and bridges.\n\n  Whatever the ideas are, there is going to be an ideological divide. \nLet's hope it does not come down to this question of taxing the poor \nand giving the tax breaks to the more well off. That is not going to \ngive the economic stimulus this country needs. And then approaching \nthis question of all these defaulted loans or the ones that are about \nto be defaulted, over and above what we have already attempted to do in \nDecember, is something that we must address. What is the appropriate \naction, not to reward those who were gaming the system, but for those \nwho are genuinely hurting because they either did not know or they were \ndeceived into signing a mortgage that lulled them along with cheap \ninterest rates and then all of a sudden has an escalation of that \ninterest rate that they cannot pay.\n  A combination of all these actions is what we ought to think about \nand come up with a stimulus package very soon in a bipartisan way. \nLet's in the Senate rise above the petty partisan politics that has so \ndominated this Chamber now for the last several years. Let's rise and \ncome together and help our people with a quick passage of a stimulus \npackage that will get America back on the economic track.\n\n\n                            Florida Primary\n\n  I end by saying a word or two about a completely different subject. \nIt has been painful for this Senator to see the Democratic candidates \nfor President stay out of my State of Florida because they had to sign \na pledge that was insisted upon by the four first privileged States--\nIowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina--even though it was a \nRepublican State legislature, signed into law by a Republican Governor \nof Florida, moving the primary 1 week before super Tuesday, February 5, \nto the Florida primary date of January 29, those four privileged States \ninsisted that the candidates sign a pledge or else suffer the \nconsequences in those early four States.\n  The pledge was that they would not campaign in Florida, they would \nnot hire staff in Florida, they would not open an office, they would \nnot make telephone calls, they would not make advertisements, they \nwould not, can you believe, have press conferences.\n\n[[Page S46]]\n\n  This Senator thinks that the first amendment protections have been \nshredded. Nevertheless, that is what the Democratic candidates did, and \nthey have stayed out of Florida.\n  The Republican National Committee, not taking away all the delegates \nas the Democratic National Committee did from Florida, took away half \nthe Republican delegates from Florida but did not extract such a \npledge. Thus, since the South Carolina primary was already held for the \nRepublicans, and it is still to be held this Saturday for the \nDemocrats, we see the Republicans en masse in Florida campaigning, much \nto the chagrin of Florida Democrats who do not see their candidates.\n  What is going to happen is that next Tuesday, Florida is going to \nvote; Florida, 18 million people, the first big State to vote, the \nfirst State that is representative of the country as a whole in almost \nany demographic that we line up with the country, it is going to vote, \nand it is going to cast its ballots for President of both parties, and \nit is going to be reported how Florida votes. It is definitely going to \nhave an effect 7 days going into super Tuesday when 22 States vote.\n  Senator Levin of Michigan and I have filed a bill that will bring \nsome order out of this chaos. There should not be a person in America \nwho thinks this is the way to nominate a President of the United States \nfor their party. If we continue to allow this kind of chaos going on, \nthe States will continue to leapfrog each other, and the first primary \nwill be at Halloween.\n  This is not a good way of selecting nominees. Senator Levin and I \nhave suggested a more orderly system that I will describe in detail at \na later time but that would have six primaries: the first in March, two \nin April, two in May, and the last one in June, through which the \nStates, large and small, geographically distributed, would each, \naccording to the sequence of which they would draw out of a hat one to \nsix, proceed on that order. Four years later, they would rotate. The \nones second would go first, and the ones first would go to the last \nprimary in June, 4 years down the road in the next Presidential cycle.\n  We have to bring order out of this chaos. In the meantime, I am here \nas Florida's senior Senator to say and to let all those Presidential \ncandidates know that Florida takes its vote very seriously. Florida \nwill express herself in both parties. Florida will have the influence \nof the first big State, and by the time we get to the conventions in \nAugust and September, the entire Florida delegation will be seated and \nvoted.\n  So I ask the Presidential candidates to consider the frustration and \nthe consternation on the Democratic side as we approach our Florida \nPresidential primary on January 29.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3893\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending business be set aside and that my amendment, No. 3893, be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3893.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To acknowledge a long history of official depredations and \n   ill-conceived policies by the Federal Government regarding Indian \n  tribes and offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the \n                             United States)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                        TITLE III--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     SEC. 301. RESOLUTION OF APOLOGY TO NATIVE PEOPLES OF UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the ancestors of today's Native Peoples inhabited the \n     land of the present-day United States since time immemorial \n     and for thousands of years before the arrival of people of \n     European descent;\n       (2) for millennia, Native Peoples have honored, protected, \n     and stewarded this land we cherish;\n       (3) Native Peoples are spiritual people with a deep and \n     abiding belief in the Creator, and for millennia Native \n     Peoples have maintained a powerful spiritual connection to \n     this land, as evidenced by their customs and legends;\n       (4) the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a new \n     chapter in the history of Native Peoples;\n       (5) while establishment of permanent European settlements \n     in North America did stir conflict with nearby Indian tribes, \n     peaceful and mutually beneficial interactions also took \n     place;\n       (6) the foundational English settlements in Jamestown, \n     Virginia, and Plymouth, Massachusetts, owed their survival in \n     large measure to the compassion and aid of Native Peoples in \n     the vicinities of the settlements;\n       (7) in the infancy of the United States, the founders of \n     the Republic expressed their desire for a just relationship \n     with the Indian tribes, as evidenced by the Northwest \n     Ordinance enacted by Congress in 1787, which begins with the \n     phrase, ``The utmost good faith shall always be observed \n     toward the Indians'';\n       (8) Indian tribes provided great assistance to the \n     fledgling Republic as it strengthened and grew, including \n     invaluable help to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on \n     their epic journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to the Pacific \n     Coast;\n       (9) Native Peoples and non-Native settlers engaged in \n     numerous armed conflicts;\n       (10) the Federal Government violated many of the treaties \n     ratified by Congress and other diplomatic agreements with \n     Indian tribes;\n       (11) the United States should address the broken treaties \n     and many of the more ill-conceived Federal policies that \n     followed, such as extermination, termination, forced removal \n     and relocation, the outlawing of traditional religions, and \n     the destruction of sacred places;\n       (12) the United States forced Indian tribes and their \n     citizens to move away from their traditional homelands and \n     onto federally established and controlled reservations, in \n     accordance with such Acts as the Act of May 28, 1830 (4 Stat. \n     411, chapter 148) (commonly known as the ``Indian Removal \n     Act'');\n       (13) many Native Peoples suffered and perished--\n       (A) during the execution of the official Federal Government \n     policy of forced removal, including the infamous Trail of \n     Tears and Long Walk;\n       (B) during bloody armed confrontations and massacres, such \n     as the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 and the Wounded Knee \n     Massacre in 1890; and\n       (C) on numerous Indian reservations;\n       (14) the Federal Government condemned the traditions, \n     beliefs, and customs of Native Peoples and endeavored to \n     assimilate them by such policies as the redistribution of \n     land under the Act of February 8, 1887 (25 U.S.C. 331; 24 \n     Stat. 388, chapter 119) (commonly known as the ``General \n     Allotment Act''), and the forcible removal of Native children \n     from their families to faraway boarding schools where their \n     Native practices and languages were degraded and forbidden;\n       (15) officials of the Federal Government and private United \n     States citizens harmed Native Peoples by the unlawful \n     acquisition of recognized tribal land and the theft of tribal \n     resources and assets from recognized tribal land;\n       (16) the policies of the Federal Government toward Indian \n     tribes and the breaking of covenants with Indian tribes have \n     contributed to the severe social ills and economic troubles \n     in many Native communities today;\n       (17) despite the wrongs committed against Native Peoples by \n     the United States, Native Peoples have remained committed to \n     the protection of this great land, as evidenced by the fact \n     that, on a per capita basis, more Native Peoples have served \n     in the United States Armed Forces and placed themselves in \n     harm's way in defense of the United States in every major \n     military conflict than any other ethnic group;\n       (18) Indian tribes have actively influenced the public life \n     of the United States by continued cooperation with Congress \n     and the Department of the Interior, through the involvement \n     of Native individuals in official Federal Government \n     positions, and by leadership of their own sovereign Indian \n     tribes;\n       (19) Indian tribes are resilient and determined to \n     preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their \n     unique cultural identities;\n       (20) the National Museum of the American Indian was \n     established within the Smithsonian Institution as a living \n     memorial to Native Peoples and their traditions; and\n       (21) Native Peoples are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, and among those are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n       (b) Acknowledgment and Apology.--The United States, acting \n     through Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the special legal and political relationship \n     Indian tribes have with the United States and the solemn \n     covenant with the land we share;\n       (2) commends and honors Native Peoples for the thousands of \n     years that they have stewarded and protected this land;\n       (3) recognizes that there have been years of official \n     depredations, ill-conceived policies, and the breaking of \n     covenants by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes;\n       (4) apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States \n     to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, \n     maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by \n     citizens of the United States;\n       (5) expresses its regret for the ramifications of former \n     wrongs and its commitment to build on the positive \n     relationships of the\n\n[[Page S47]]\n\n     past and present to move toward a brighter future where all \n     the people of this land live reconciled as brothers and \n     sisters, and harmoniously steward and protect this land \n     together;\n       (6) urges the President to acknowledge the wrongs of the \n     United States against Indian tribes in the history of the \n     United States in order to bring healing to this land by \n     providing a proper foundation for reconciliation between the \n     United States and Indian tribes; and\n       (7) commends the State governments that have begun \n     reconciliation efforts with recognized Indian tribes located \n     in their boundaries and encourages all State governments \n     similarly to work toward reconciling relationships with \n     Indian tribes within their boundaries.\n       (c) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this section--\n       (1) authorizes or supports any claim against the United \n     States; or\n       (2) serves as a settlement of any claim against the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank my colleague from North \nDakota, the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, who has been a \nsponsor of this bill that I put in amendment form and am calling up now \nas an amendment, as an official apology to Native Americans in the \nUnited States for past issues. It is an amendment with a lot of history \nto it.\n  The bill has been brought up this Congress, the last Congress, and it \nhas passed the Indian Affairs Committee both Congresses. It is an \namendment with an issue of a lot of history to it. The chairman and \nmyself are from Plains States where there is a lot of Native American \nhistory, as there is throughout the United States. It is a history that \nis both beautiful, difficult, and sad at the same time.\n  I have four tribal lands in my State, four areas where there are \ntribal lands, some that are tribal but don't have a resident tribe in \nthe State. This has been an issue that has been around for some time--\nthe relationship between the Federal Government and the tribes.\n  What we have crafted in this amendment, a previous bill that is now \nin amendment form, is an official apology. It does not deal with \nproperty issues whatsoever, but it recognizes some of the past \ndifficulty in the relationship.\n  It says that for those times the Federal Government was wrong, we \nacknowledge that and apologize for it. Apologies are difficult and \ntough to do, but I think this one is meritorious and, as I present my \ncase, I hope my colleagues will agree and support this amendment.\n  I rise today to speak about this issue that I believe is important to \nthe well-being of all who reside in the United States. It is an issue \nthat has lain unresolved for far too long, an issue of the United \nStates Government's relationship with the Native peoples of this land.\n  Native Americans have a vast and proud legacy on this continent. Long \nbefore 1776 and the establishment of the United States of America, \nNative peoples inhabited this land and maintained a powerful physical \nand spiritual connection to it. In service to the Creator, Native \npeoples sowed the land, journeyed it, and protected it. The people from \nmy State of Kansas have a similar strong attachment to the land.\n  Like many in my State, I was raised on the land. I grew up farming \nand caring for the land. I and many in my State established a \nconnection to this land as well. We care for our Nation and the land of \nour forefathers so greatly that we too are willing to serve and protect \nit, as faithful stewards of the creation with which God has blessed us. \nI believe without a doubt citizens across this great Nation share this \nsentiment and know its unifying power. Americans have stood side by \nside for centuries to defend this land we love.\n  Both the Founding Fathers of the United States and the indigenous \ntribes that lived here were attached to this land. Both sought to \nsteward and protect it. There were several instances of collegiality \nand cooperation between our forbears--for example, in Jamestown, VA, \nPlymouth, MA, and in aid to explorers Lewis and Clark. Yet, sadly, \nsince the formation of the American Republic, numerous conflicts have \nensued between our Government, the Federal Government, and many of \nthese tribes, conflicts in which warriors on all sides fought \ncourageously and which all sides suffered. Even from the earliest days \nof our Republic there existed a sentiment that honorable dealings and a \npeaceful coexistence were clearly preferable to bloodshed. Indeed, our \npredecessors in Congress in 1787 stated in the Northwest Ordinance:\n\n       The utmost good faith shall always be observed toward the \n     Indians.\n\n  Many treaties were made between the U.S. Government and Native \npeoples, but treaties are far more than just words on a page. Treaties \nrepresent our word, and they represent our bond. Treaties with other \ngovernments are not to be regarded lightly. Unfortunately, again, too \noften the United States did not uphold its responsibilities as stated \nin its covenants with Native tribes.\n  I have read all of the treaties in my State between the tribes and \nthe Federal Government that apply to Kansas. They generally came in \ntranches of three. First, there would be a big land grant to the tribe. \nThen there would be a much smaller one associated with some equipment \nand livestock, and then a much smaller one after that.\n  Too often, our Government broke its solemn oath to Native Americans. \nFor too long, relations between the United States and Native people of \nthis land have been in disrepair. For too much of our history, Federal \ntribal relations have been marked by broken treaties, mistreatment, and \ndishonorable dealings. I believe it is time to work to restore these \nrelationships to good health. While the record of the past cannot be \nerased, I am confident the United States can acknowledge its past \nfailures, express sincere regrets, and work toward establishing a \nbrighter future for all Americans. It is in this spirit of hope for our \nland that I am offering Senate Joint Resolution 4, the Native American \nApology Resolution, as an amendment to the bill currently before us. \nThis resolution will extend a formal apology from the United States to \ntribal governments and Native peoples nationwide--something we have \nnever done; something we should have done years and years ago.\n\n  I want my fellow Senators to note this resolution does not--does \nnot--dismiss the valiance of our American soldiers who fought bravely \nfor their families in wars between the United States and a number of \nthe Indian tribes, nor does this resolution cast all the blame for the \nvarious battles on one side or another.\n  Further, this resolution will not resolve the many challenges still \nfacing Native Americans, nor will it authorize, support or settle any \nclaims against the United States. It doesn't have anything to do with \nany property claims against the United States. That is specifically set \naside and not in this bill. What this resolution does do is recognize \nand honor the importance of Native Americans to this land and to the \nUnited States in the past and today and offers an official apology for \nthe poor and painful choices the U.S. Government sometimes made to \ndisregard its solemn word to Native peoples. It recognizes the negative \nimpact of numerous destructive Federal acts and policies on Native \nAmericans and their culture, and it begins--begins--the effort of \nreconciliation.\n  President Ronald Reagan spoke of the importance of reconciliation \nmany times throughout his Presidency. In a 1984 speech to mark the 40th \nanniversary of the day when the Allied armies joined in battle to free \nthe European Continent from the grip of the Axis powers, Reagan \nimplored the United States and Europe to ``prepare to reach out in the \nspirit of reconciliation.''\n  Martin Luther King, whom we recognized and celebrated yesterday, who \nwas a true reconciler, once said:\n\n       The end is reconciliation, the end is redemption, the end \n     is the creation of the beloved community.\n\n  This resolution is not the end, but perhaps it signals the beginning \nof the end of division and a faint first light and first fruits of the \ncreation of beloved community. This is a resolution of apology and a \nresolution of reconciliation. It is a step toward healing the wounds \nthat have divided our country for so long--a potential foundation for a \nnew era of positive relations between tribal governments and the \nFederal Government.\n  It is time--as I have stated, it is way past time--for us to heal our \nland of division, all divisions, and bring us together. There is \nperhaps no better place than in the midst of the Senate's consideration \nof the Indian Health Care Improvement Act reauthorization to do\n\n[[Page S48]]\n\nthis. With this in mind, I hope my Senate colleagues will support this \namendment. I would ask their consideration on it. I would ask for their \npositive vote for it.\n  I hope a number of my colleagues in the Senate will join me as a \ncosponsor of the amendment itself so we can show a united front and \nthat it is time for us to heal. I ask they give us that consideration. \nI simply ask my colleagues to look for this, and I hope they can vote \nfor it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Kansas. I am a \ncosponsor in support of the amendment he has offered.\n  If one studies the history in this country with respect to Indian \ntribes, it is a tragedy. It is very hard for someone to study it, \nunderstand it, and not wish our country to apologize for it. We entered \ninto treaties with the tribes; agreements, signed treaties, with the \ntribes. We took tribal homelands and pushed them onto reservations and \nmade agreements, including trust agreements, to provide for their \nhealth care and many other things.\n  Then we decided we wanted to push them off reservations and move them \ninto urban areas. Then we decided we would discontinue a government-to-\ngovernment relationship with 109 tribes. We terminated the tribal \nstatus of 109 tribes, and we told these folks to leave the reservations \nand here is a one-way ticket. We want you to go to the cities to be \nassimilated into the cities. So we sent them off to the cities, far \naway from families and health care facilities. Then we sent them off to \nboarding schools and terminated their governmental status. We took \nlands off protected trust status and then turned, once again, and began \nto revitalize tribal language and culture and governments.\n  When you understand what this country has done, in terms of \nabrogating agreements and treaties it has made, one can understand the \nwords of Chief Joseph. Here is what Chief Joseph said:\n\n       Good words do not last long unless they amount to \n     something. Good words do not pay for my dead people. Good \n     words cannot give me back my children. Good words will not \n     give my people good health and stop them from dying. I am \n     tired of talk that comes to nothing. It makes my heart sick \n     when I remember all of the good words and then all of the \n     broken promises.\n\n  Chief Joseph was an honorable Indian leader. He negotiated face-to-\nface with the leaders of our country. And while he lived, he saw \npromise after promise after promise broken. U.S. Supreme Court Justice \nHugo Black wrote:\n\n       Great nations, like great men, should keep their word.\n\n  That is all Chief Joseph and so many other Indian leaders asked, and \nit was never granted. We are trying now, in some small and some \nsignificant ways, to remedy and address these issues. The Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act is one step in the right direction to say this \ncountry will start to keep its promise, its promise, as a trust \nresponsibility, to provide health care for American Indians.\n  I say to my colleague from Kansas, I used a chart earlier today to \nsay the American people, the American Government, is responsible, \nbecause of treaty obligations and a trust obligation, a trust \nobligation we have for American Indians, to provide health care to two \ngroups of people. One group is incarcerated Federal prisoners. That is \nour charge. We put them in prison for crimes, we are required to \nprovide for their health care in Federal prisons. We also have a \nresponsibility for health care for American Indians because of the \ntrust responsibility and treaties by which we made that promise.\n  Compare the two. We spend twice as much money providing health care \nfor incarcerated prisoners in Federal prisons as we do providing health \ncare to American Indians. And that is why today it is likely somewhere \non an Indian reservation someone is dying who shouldn't have to die. \nSome young child is suffering who shouldn't have to suffer because the \nhealth care we expect for our families is not available to them.\n  If I might, for another minute, say once again that I showed a \npicture this morning of a young girl named Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight. \nShe died at the age of 5. Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight didn't get the \nhealth care most of us would expect for our children. She was a \nbeautiful young child on the Crow reservation, and she spent the last 3 \nmonths of her life in unmedicated pain. Finally, she was diagnosed with \na terminal illness. And when she was, and I talked about this earlier, \nshe asked to go to see Cinderella's castle, and so the Make-A-Wish \nFoundation sent her and her mother to Orlando. In the hotel, on the \nnight before she was to see Cinderella's castle, she died in her \nmother's arms. As she lay in her mother's arms, she said: Mommy, I will \ntry not to be sick. Mommy, I will try to get better.\n\n  This young girl, time after time after time, had been taken to the \nclinic and was diagnosed and treated for depression at the age of 5 \nwhen, in fact, she had terminal cancer and she is now dead. A beautiful \nyoung girl--Ta'Shon Rain Littlelight. This is happening across our \ncountry, and we have to stop it. It is our responsibility to stop it.\n  My colleague from Kansas offers a resolution that talks about past \nabuses, and they are unbelievable. But some of them continue, and that \nis the purpose of this bill and the reason I appreciate his support for \nthe underlying bill. But I did wish to say I am a cosponsor of the \namendment offered by Senator Brownback. It is the right thing for our \ncountry to do. I am proud to cosponsor what he is suggesting to the \nSenate today. He is offering it now as an amendment. I have previously \ncosponsored it as a bill when he has introduced it in the Senate.\n  So my thanks to the Senator from Kansas. And after he speaks, Madam \nPresident, I know the Senator from Ohio wishes to be recognized. But I \nsuspect the Senator from Kansas wishes to say a word, at which point I \nam happy the Senator from Ohio is here and wishes to speak on this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I wished to thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, and I would ask the amendment be referred to as the \nBrownback-Dorgan amendment, if that would be acceptable to my \ncolleague. We will put it forward that way because he has been lead \nsponsor of this for the past several Congresses, and I appreciate his \nhard work.\n  I appreciate his heart and his practicality on the current situation. \nWe do have to get better health care on the reservations and for the \nNative tribes. I appreciate the effort to get that done, and I think \nthat is an important effort for us and a very practical and necessary \nthing, so the examples he talks about, and unfortunately so many \nothers, don't continue to happen across this country.\n  The amendment put forward by my colleague from Louisiana, Senator \nVitter, is also important, his view about codifying a situation \nregarding abortions with Native Americans. I would hope that would be \nsomething we could see passed as something that is a hopeful sign in \npushing to the future, rather than a sign of despair and the killing of \nchildren, which I think is completely wrong for us to see taking place \nand for us to be funding it as well.\n  I am delighted this bill is coming up. I think this is an important \nissue for us to debate, and I am glad to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, Wall Street and international markets are \nclearly concerned or worse over a possible U.S. recession. Congress is \nformulating, as we know--the President, both parties' leadership, the \nMembers of the House and Senate--an economic stimulus package, which is \nthe right thing to do, but there are several pieces to this puzzle. The \neconomy is faltering, to be sure, and we have those concerns about our \neconomy as a whole. Equally important, I would argue more importantly, \nmore Americans are losing access to basic necessities because of it.\n  A stimulus package should do two things. First of all, a stimulus \npackage needs to stimulate the economy so we can pull ourselves more \nquickly and more vigorously, if you will, out of this recession. A \nstimulus package also, equally or more importantly, needs to help those \npeople who have been most victimized by the recession.\n  I rise to urge this body to take responsibility for helping those who \nare\n\n[[Page S49]]\n\nwithout food, without adequate heat, and without adequate housing; \nthose for whom the economic crisis is not just a source of anxiety, in \nsome sense it is a thief in the night who has robbed Americans of basic \nhuman needs.\n  In December, I spoke about the crisis food banks across our Nation \nface. It was the lead-up to Christmas, a time when the spirit of giving \nis at its peak. The holidays are now over and we are deep into January. \nNot surprisingly, food bank donations have fallen off precipitously. \nYet the need for food grows as the economic crisis deepens.\n  Across this country more Americans are in need of food assistance and \nless food is available. The result is hunger. In the wealthiest Nation \nin the world, people are waiting in line for a subsistence level of \nfood, food that runs out too often before the lines run out. People who \nlive in the communities we serve are facing increasing food insecurity. \nIn too many cases, people don't know from where their next meal will \ncome.\n  Increasingly, these are families with children. Food banks in Ohio \nand Virginia and Arizona and California and in the Presiding Officer's \nhome State of Missouri, in Colorado and every State in the Union are \nunderfunded, overextended. The unemployed, the sick, the aged, the \nhomeless, the mentally ill--these are the individuals who typically \nseek food banks and food pantries for assistance. And now more working \nfamilies are also being forced to seek food assistance as factories \nclose and as gas prices and transportation prices--the cost of \ntransportation goes up for people driving to work, wages stagnate, food \nprices go up, and daily necessities become more expensive.\n  Five years ago, the Food Bank of Southeast Virginia reported serving \n95,000 people--95,000 people in 2002. In 2007, that food bank served \n203,000. Forty-two percent of their recipients are categorized as \nworking poor, a population that is on the rise.\n  In Warren County, OH, a generally affluent county northeast of \nCincinnati--the county seat is Lebanon, which I visited last week--in \nthat county, 90 percent of people who go to food pantries have jobs, 90 \npercent of them are working. They are working often in part-time jobs, \noften in full-time jobs without benefits, always in jobs that cannot \npay their bills.\n  For many years, one of my constituents, Tim, and his wife donated \ntime and money to Cleveland-area food banks and soup kitchens. But over \ntime, cash for Tim and his wife became tight. They stopped giving money \nto the food bank; they continued to donate their time to the food bank. \nThis year, after months of rationing food in their own household, Tim \nand his wife were forced to use the food bank themselves. It took great \nhumility, Tim recalls. Tim says he used to be middle class, but he does \nnot see himself as middle class anymore. He says his wages have not \nkept pace with subsistence expenses. What he gets from the food bank is \nnot enough either. The groceries he receives last his household about 1 \nweek. Food distributions are limited to once a month.\n  In Ohio, 70 percent of food pantries do not have enough food to serve \neveryone in need. This problem is not unique to Ohio. It is affecting \ncities across the country, with Denver and Orlando and Phoenix \nparticularly hard-hit. American's Second Harvest, the nationwide food \nbank network, projected a food shortage of 15 million pounds--11.7 \nmillion meals--by the end of 2007.\n  Congress must act swiftly to alleviate the current food shortage. \nThat is why I introduced last month legislation that would allocate $40 \nmillion in emergency assistance--$40 million is all. Just to put it in \nperspective, we are spending $3 billion a week on the war in Iraq. We \nare asking for $40 million in short-term emergency funding for the \nEmergency Food Assistance Program, so-called TEFAP.\n  With legislators still negotiating the details of the farm bill, \ncritical TEFAP funding, which provides food at no cost to low-income \nAmericans in need of short-term hunger relief, has dried up at the \nworst possible time. This bill will provide the funding necessary to \nkeep food banks funding intact until the farm bill is signed into law.\n  On a cold December morning about a month ago in southeast Ohio, in \nthe town of Logan, at 3:30 in the morning--3:30 in the morning--people \nbegan to line up at a food bank at the Smith Chapel United Methodist \nChurch pantry. By 8 o'clock, about 4\\1/2\\ hours later, when volunteers \nbegan distributing food, the line of cars stretched for more than a \nmile and a half. By early afternoon of this cold December day, more \nthan 2,000 residents had received food. That is 7 percent of the local \npopulation in a county where people drove 20 or 30 minutes to get \nthere. Seven percent of the local population in 1 day, in one church, \ncame to this food pantry for food. Just 8 years ago, that pantry served \n17 families a month--17 families a month. One December day, 2,000 \nfamilies, that is a crisis.\n  In the Los Angeles Times yesterday, a grateful recipient of scant \nfood donations said: I eat anything they give me.\n  In the Virginia Pilot in southeast Virginia yesterday, a recipient \nadmitted: What I get here lasts all month. I kind of stretch it.\n  Of the shortages at the food banks, Tim from Cleveland asked: How \nhard is it to give a can of tuna?\n  In a nation as wealthy as ours, no one who works hard for a \nlifetime--as most of these people who have gone to food banks do and \nhave worked a lifetime to provide for their families, to get along, try \nto join the middle class--no one who works hard for a lifetime should \never have to make statements like those statements.\n  This is a national crisis. In a faltering economy, more people \ndescend into crisis. It is inevitable. The need for economic stimulus \ngoes hand in hand with the need for a caring community. Again, the \neconomic stimulus package needs to stimulate the economy. It also \nneeds, equally, maybe more importantly, to help those who have been \nvictimized by this recession.\n  Our Nation has always been a caring community. More children are \nhungry today. More elderly Americans cannot pay their heating bills. \nMore middle-class families now consider themselves among the working \npoor. Americans do not turn their backs on fellow Americans in need. As \nindividuals, Americans do not; as a government, we should not.\n  The economic stimulus package should revive the economy and reaffirm \nour bonds with each other. This economic stimulus package is an \nopportunity to demonstrate our economic and moral strength. Let us take \nthat opportunity. Let us act immediately to prevent more Americans from \ngoing to bed hungry.\n  The stimulus package needs to include food banks, food pantries, \nextension of unemployment compensation, and help for those elderly \nAmericans who simply cannot pay their heating bills.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I wish to commend my friend and \ncolleague from Ohio for addressing this issue on the challenges we are \nfacing in terms of our economic situation here in the United States. \nThe world is aware of this, as is anyone who watches the early morning \nprograms. But most of all, we have been seeing this develop over a \nperiod of time, as the Senator has pointed out, and it is really \nshocking to me that it has really taken this long for the \nadministration to come up and develop its own program.\n  I join with him in urging early action. We cannot delay. We cannot \nwait. The time is now on this issue. And I just thank him for telling \nus how it was out in the State of Ohio because the conditions he has \ndescribed out in his State are very similar to the conditions in my \nState of Massachusetts. We will hear from many of our colleagues that \nthey are feeling this as well. So we look forward to working with him \nand others here in the Senate and helping to fashion this program that \nis absolutely essential for the well-being of working families in this \ncountry.\n  I am always reminded, as the Senator is, that the American people who \nare so adversely affected did not do anything wrong. They have been \nworking hard, playing by the rules, and trying to provide for their \nfamilies. The responsibility to do something about it is right here \nwith the administration and with the Congress. So many Americans' lives \nhave been turned upside down, in many respects shattered. It adds a \nvery special responsibility for all of us. So I thank him for his very \nuseful and important contribution.\n\n[[Page S50]]\n\n  In recent weeks, the headlines have been filled with bad economic \nnews. Two weeks ago, it was an alarming increase in the unemployment \nrate. Last week, it was rising prices for basic essentials such as food \nand gasoline. Week after week, there is more bad housing news. \nForeclosures are skyrocketing. Bankruptcies are rising. Yesterday, the \nWashington Post discussed challenges facing the more than 1.3 million \nAmericans who have been actively looking for a job for more than 6 \nmonths--for more than 6 months without success. It is a tragic tale. \nCollege-educated professionals and people who have worked for decades \nare now forced to drain their retirement accounts and rely on charity \nto make ends meet. It seems that every day there is new information \nshowing that the economy is headed in the wrong direction, that no one \nwill be spared.\n  These are not statistical trends or indicators. Every bad number \nreflects a real hardship in real people's lives. When food prices \nincrease by 5 percent, that means average families will pay over $400 \nmore next year to put meals on the table. When the unemployment rate \nrises 1.5 percent, it pushes a typical family's wages down $2,400. Each \nhigher cost or lower paycheck adds up to big problems for working \nAmericans. Parents are giving up time with their families to work \nlonger hours or take a second job. Employees are struggling with credit \ncard debt and skyrocketing interest rates. Young couples are losing \ntheir first homes because they cannot pay the mortgage, and parents are \npulling their children out of college because they cannot pay the \nbills. For these families, a recession is not just part of the business \ncycle; it is a life-changing event from which they may never fully \nrecover.\n  I have heard from many in Massachusetts who are struggling in these \ntough times. There is Teresa in Everett. She is a single mom with three \nchildren aged 10, 6, and 3. She is proud that she has worked her way \nout of welfare, but her life as a working mother is increasingly hard. \nHer bills are out of control, and each day she is faced with impossible \ndecisions: Do I feed myself or feed my children? Can I turn on the heat \nor just put on an extra layer of clothing and try to get by? In \nTeresa's household, a $4 gallon of milk has become a luxury she cannot \nafford.\n  Teresa's family is not alone. A looming crisis is now facing tens of \nmillions of American families. Economists across the spectrum, from \nformer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben \nBernanke, and even President Bush himself, all agree that we are facing \ntough times to come and the Government must act.\n  But even more importantly than advice from these noted scholars is \nthe clear message of the American people. They are struggling. They \nneed our help now. They elected us to make their lives and their \nchildren's lives better, and now is the time.\n  We need a simple, effective plan to stimulate the economy and also \nput back in workers' pockets resources and money to give them the \nsupport they need to weather the storm. This plan should be built on \none fundamental principle: People do not work for the economy; the \neconomy should work for the people. If we want an economic recovery \nthat works, if we want real opportunities and sustainable growth, that \neffort must start and end with working families.\n  Putting people first means targeting our stimulus efforts to meet \nthree essential goals.\n  First, we must act quickly to provide immediate help for those in \ncrisis. The declining economy may be a current issue in the newspapers, \nbut working families have been suffering for some time; 7.7 million \nAmericans are already unemployed. There have been almost 2 million \nforeclosure filings in the last year alone, including 225,000 last \nmonth. The number of families facing bankruptcy has risen by 40 percent \nin the past year. For these Americans, the recession is already here, \nand they need help now to get back on their feet.\n  Second, we must do the most for those who need help the most. \nTargeting families at the very bottom of the economic ladder is \nessential because it also provides the biggest economic boost. Every \ndollar a low-income household receives is spent on basic needs, putting \nmoney back into the local economy right away. In regions with many \nstruggling families, such spending is critical to help keep entire \ncommunities afloat.\n  Finally, we must find solutions that will make a real difference in \npeople's lives. It is not enough just to tinker at the margins. Our \neconomic problems are getting worse every day, and we need a strong \nmedicine to make things right.\n  There are a number of short-term steps we can take to achieve these \ngoals and restore hope and opportunity to families across the country. \nThey are simple. They build on existing programs. They are effective. \nWe should pass them, and we should pass them now.\n  For workers who are struggling to find a job, we must support them in \nthe difficult process of finding work. It becomes harder and harder to \nfind a good job in today's economy. The Nation is enduring profound \nchanges as we adapt to the global economy. Entire industries are \ndisappearing, leaving workers and communities devastated in their \nwake. Madam President, 1.3 million workers have been getting up early \nevery morning, day in and day out, looking for a job for more than 6 \nmonths. That number will only rise as the recession deepens. Just last \nweek, Goldman Sachs economists predicted that the unemployment rate \nwould reach 6.5 percent by the beginning of 2009 compared to 5 percent \ntoday.\n\n  This is a dual challenge. We now have projections about what we are \ngoing to have in terms of unemployment. No matter what we do in terms \nof stimulating the economy--we have to stimulate the economy--we also \nhave to be mindful that we are going to have significant unemployment \neven in the outyear of 2009 as Goldman Sachs has predicted. We have \nboth challenges, the economy and the fact that people are going to be \nunemployed.\n  To help these unemployed men and women weather the storm we need to \nextend unemployment benefits and expand access to benefits. As workers, \nthey have paid into the system and they deserve help when they need it. \nWe should also provide transitional health care assistance. People who \nreceive unemployment compensation have paid into the fund. The problem \nnow is many of them, even though they paid into the fund, are unable to \nbenefit from it. That is wrong. We should address that. We have \nlegislation to do so. It passed the House of Representatives, and we \nshould pass it as part of a stimulus program at the present time.\n  Most importantly, we should do more to help unemployed workers find \ngood jobs they are seeking. We have open jobs, 93,000 in Massachusetts \nalone. We certainly have jobs that are available, and we have more than \n178,000 unemployed workers. So we have the jobs that are available, and \nwe have the unemployed workers. What is missing? Training programs. How \nmany applicants do we have for every training program? We have 21 \napplicants for every training program. We have good jobs with good \nbenefits, and we have the people who want them. The only ingredient \nmissing is training, and these workers want the training. They will \nsacrifice for training. But they haven't got it because we have cut \nback on training programs in recent years. We ought to be able to \naddress those issues, and we ought to do it now.\n  It is not just those who have lost their jobs and are facing a \ncrisis. Millions more families are living on the brink of disaster \nbecause they are struggling to pay bills. Since President Bush took \noffice, the cost of health insurance has risen 38 percent. Housing \nprices are up 39 percent. A tank of gas is up 78 percent; tuition, 43 \npercent; and wages are stagnant, up 6 percent. This is the pressure \nfamilies are feeling today, a sense of insecurity.\n  Security is an issue that is of major importance and consequence to \nfamilies. They are concerned about security overseas. They are \nconcerned about homeland security. But they are also concerned about \njob security and health security and education security. They are also \nconcerned about energy security. They are concerned about their long-\nterm security, what is going to happen to pensions, as they see the \nsafety net for pensions increasingly fragmented. They are concerned \nabout unemployment insurance security as they have seen that safety net \nfragment. They are deeply concerned. They are all worried deeply about \nit.\n\n[[Page S51]]\n\n  It is interesting. I don't know how many times during the course of \nthe debate on the stimulus that we will take a moment and think of what \nis the cost of the anxiety that these families have, when they are \nworried primarily about their children or grandparents. That doesn't \nappear on the bottom line of any sheet we will have on the floor of the \nSenate, but it is out there and being felt now, and it is very real. We \nought to understand that--real anxiety, real frustration, real \nsuffering, real worry every day, every night, primarily by parents as \nthey are concerned about their children. They worry about their loved \nones and their families, immediate family, and less about themselves. \nThey worry about others. We have the ability to deal with that, and we \nmust.\n  We need a boost in basic support programs to help working families \ncope with the relentless pressure of everyday life during this time. \nThis means expanding home heating assistance. A typical household may \nhave to spend as much as $3,000 on heating oil this winter, probably \ncloser to $4,000 in Massachusetts. Fuel assistance will cover less than \na third of these costs. Of the 35 million households eligible for fuel \nassistance nationwide, only 5 million receive such benefits. Six of \nseven families in need receive no help at all because the States run \nout of funds.\n  Last week, the White House released $450 million in emergency \nassistance to States across the Nation, including $27 million for \nMassachusetts. The reality is, when oil prices are surging past $3.30 \nper gallon, and households will need at least 800 gallons of heating \noil this winter, it is just not enough.\n  Bob Coard of Action for Boston Community Development, one of the \nlargest community action agencies in the Northeast, says the emergency \nfunds will barely cover enough to make a 100-gallon delivery to ABCD \nclients, and the 100-gallon delivery will cost about $300 and will \nprovide a family with heat for about 2 to 3 weeks. Talk about something \nthat will have a direct impact. A week ago Massachusetts was notified \nthat it was going to receive approximately $30 million, and they were, \nwithin a 2-week period, able to get the oil tankers up to find those \nwho are eligible for that program to deliver 100 gallons of fuel oil to \nneedy families. That will only last 2 weeks. It is out there. We know \nwhat the need is. We know what these individuals suffer. So we can do \nthings that can have an immediate impact. Certainly this is something \nto which we should be attentive.\n  The people who are receiving this fuel assistance are in danger of \nthis perfect storm that we refer to in New England where they have \nextraordinary increases in prices generally. One part of the storm is \nan increase in the cost of fuel oil to heat their homes. A second part \nis their ability to afford to pay their mortgage. If they cannot pay \nthe mortgage, this is what happens. They make a judgment about whether \nthey are going to pay the fuel or pay the mortgage. With children in \nthe picture, they pay their fuel and they end up losing their home. So \nthe fact that they don't get maybe 100 gallons, 200 gallons, 300 \ngallons of oil means they lose their home.\n  The cost in Massachusetts of providing services to a homeless family \ncan be thousands of dollars a year. You can provide the oil for a \nfraction of that and keep people in their homes.\n  These are the kinds of things that make a difference. We should give \nfocus and attention to them.\n  In our hearing this last week, I heard from Margaret Gilliam who \ntakes care of her grandchildren in Dorchester and has already spent \nmore on heating oil this heating season than she did all of last year. \nWe still have many weeks of cold weather ahead, and she wonders what is \ngoing to happen to her grandchildren and to her home. Diane Colby, a \nsingle mother of two in Lynn, MA, keeps the thermostat at only 62 \ndegrees to stretch out the heating oil as long as possible. She has to \nsit down and decide which bills get paid and which don't. Otherwise she \ncan't afford to keep the heat on. We must ensure that these families \nhave the help they need through the winter. This is part of the \nchallenge we are facing.\n  In the proposals we have had from the President, we find that he \nproposes a tax break and a stimulus program that would completely leave \nout the poorest Americans. That is bad policy. Not only are low-income \nfamilies the ones who suffer most in a recession, helping them is the \nbest way to be certain that any stimulus goes directly into the economy \nand benefits our country the most. We can't keep repeating the mistakes \nof the past. Any tax rebate we pass now should be for everyone so that \neveryone can get back on their feet. The President's tax cuts for \nbusiness are ill-advised. Past experience shows that such corporate tax \nbreaks do not provide an effective stimulus. The problem with our \neconomy today is a lack of demand, not of capacity. Businesses will not \nproduce more until they know that customers are ready to buy. That is \nextremely important.\n  We heard at our Joint Economic Committee hearing economists talk \nabout the lack of demand, not a lack of capacity. Since there is a lack \nof demand, it doesn't make a lot of sense to increase capacity if there \nis not demand for it. Yet that is what the administration is attempting \nto do.\n  Personal tax cuts targeting middle- and low-income families and \nfunding boosts for programs such as unemployment insurance and food \nstamps are a better stimulus than business tax cuts because they \nencourage consumers to start spending. The economy is at a crossroads, \nand we must act carefully to choose the right path for the future. I am \nconfident we can do that. I am certain we must do it to get America \nback on track.\n  Finally, I want to review a few of the charts I have that spell out \nexactly where we are globally on this issue. Americans are deeply \nanxious about the economy. In a survey from just two weeks ago, Madam \nPresident, 61 percent of Americans say the condition of the economy is \nbad; one in five think things are very bad. This is an indication of \nthe attitude of the American people. Here is one of the reasons.\n  We see a significant increase in the unemployment rate in December, \ngoing to 5 percent. Among unemployed workers, 17.5 percent are long-\nterm unemployed. If you look at 2001 as we approached the last \nrecession, it was only 11 percent. Now it is 17.5 percent, up 55 \npercent. These are individuals who are out there, workers who want a \njob and have been spending month after month after month looking for \none, unable to get a job. That has a devastating impact, particularly \nwhen you terminate the unemployment compensation for them which these \nindividuals should be eligible to receive and which they have paid \ninto.\n  This shows the prediction from economists that unemployment will \nskyrocket next year. We heard this in testimony in the Joint Economic \nCommittee hearing last week. Assuming we have a stimulus program, they \nsay the economy can improve, but even with the economy improving, we \nare going to have a continued increase in the numbers of unemployed. \nThat is something we have to be aware of.\n  We still have job openings that are here, but nearly 8 million \nunemployed workers competing for 4 million jobs. It is a real problem. \nNot being able to get these jobs is a result of administration cuts to \ntraining programs all of these years. This is a pretty good indicator \nof what happens with the limitations.\n\n  Americans cannot access job training programs. Opportunities are \nlimited for workers to improve their skills. In Massachusetts alone, as \nI mentioned, for every available slot in a job training program, there \nare 21 workers on a waiting list. I have in the Chamber a picture of \nworkers waiting on a waiting list. These people want to work. They want \nto provide for their families. They have the skills, the training \nprograms to be able to get the job done, but they cannot afford that. \nWe have had training programs, the kind the administration has cut \nback. Last year, it was close to half a billion dollars.\n  This chart shows what has been happening with the unemployment rate. \nIt has been going steadily up. High unemployment drives down wages. A \n1.5-percent increase in the unemployment rate would decrease the \naverage family's income by $2,400 because of the downward pressure it \nputs on wages. So for every family--we know from Goldman Sachs; this is \nnot our estimate, we have it from financial institutions--economic \nindicators indicate we are still going to have high unemployment.\n\n[[Page S52]]\n\nWhat that means is a real reduction for average working families in \ntheir purchasing power by $2,400. That is what is going on.\n  We have seen what is happening as to the kinds of products that \nfamilies are used to purchasing. The price of food is rising far faster \nthan the rate of inflation. We have milk going up 16 percent, eggs \ngoing up 78 percent, and beef going up some 13 percent.\n  In our part of the country, still, about 75 percent of all the homes \nare heated with home heating oil. Look what has happened. There has \nbeen a 40-percent increase in the cost of home heating oil since last \nyear. And a great many of our people in my part of the country who own \ntheir homes are living on fixed incomes. They are getting this kind of \nincrease. Social Security, for the average person, went up only 2.3 \npercent from last year. But here we have a 40-percent increase in the \ncost of home heating oil, and it has been a cold winter.\n  So these charts indicate, in different ways, how the average family \nis facing more and more difficulties. Too many middle-class families \ncould not pay the essential expenses in the event of a job loss or \nother financial hardship. Seventy-seven percent of middle-class \nfamilies do not have enough assets to pay the essential expenses for 3 \nmonths.\n  What is happening is many people are relying on their credit cards to \ndo it, and then they are unable to meet their ends with their credit \ncards. That directly affects their credit standing for the rest of \ntheir lives--under the last bankruptcy bill we passed here, which was \nsuch an unfortunate action that we took in the Senate.\n  We find out parents are listing credit cards in the names of their \nchildren--young children--in order to be able to heat their homes. It \nis affecting so many hard-working Americans who are facing that \nwhammy--the fact they are in danger of losing their homes because of \nthe mortgage challenge. They cannot afford heating oil, and then they \nfind out, when they resort to using credit cards, they lose all of \ntheir potential for credit for years to come.\n  This chart is a reflection of what is happening with people losing \ntheir homes. Foreclosures have gone up 181 percent from 2005. Millions \nof American families face losing their homes. Make no mistake about it, \nmany who lose their homes have in the past paid their mortgages each \nmonth, and yet now they lose their home. We have to ask: What are we \ngoing to do about it?\n  Just a final two points I will make. There has been a 40-percent \nincrease in bankruptcies. This is a result of the kind of economic \nsqueeze these families have been under. There has been a 40-percent \nincrease in bankruptcies. With the way that last bankruptcy act was \nenacted, they will find out, once the hooks get into these families, \nthey will never get free from them. Families are going to be indebted \nfor a very considerable period of time. That is now happening to \nworking Americans.\n  The final chart I will put up is that in looking at the stimulus \nprogram we ought to look at what gets the biggest bang for the buck. \nTargeted stimulus programs deliver far more bang for the buck. As to \nunemployment benefits, for every $1 we invest, there is $1.73 in \neconomic growth; for aid to the States, $1.24; for income taxes, it is \nonly 59 cents. These are the areas the administration is talking about: \nbusiness write-offs, 24 cents; capital gains tax cuts, 9 cents.\n  If we are going to pass a stimulus package--which we should do--let's \nlook at the areas that will have the greatest impact, the greatest \nstimulus that will help the working families of this country in the \nmost meaningful way. That is what we should do. That is what should be \nthe first order of business in the Senate. I hope we will get about the \nbusiness of helping working families in America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll of \nthe Senate.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I have a substitute at the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] for himself, Ms. \n     Murkowski, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Smith, Mr. Nelson of \n     Nebraska, and Mr. Salazar, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3899.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments previously considered be conformed to the substitute I have \njust offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have had a lot of discussion and debate \ntoday about the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. We, on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Murkowski, sent the substitute to the desk. The \nsubstitute is something we worked on that amends and changes somewhat \nwhat we had originally moved out of the committee. We have refined it, \nimproved it, and changed it a bit. The substitute was agreed to by \nSenator Murkowski and myself and other Senators with whom we have \nworked. So we have made some progress by laying down the substitute \nwhich perfects this bill. We have a number of amendments pending.\n  What I would ask--and so would Senator Murkowski--is if there are \nothers who have amendments to this bill, they come to the floor and \noffer them. We want to finish this piece of legislation. It is not as \nif we haven't had a lot of discussion and debate. We have pretty much \nfilled the time today. But we do want additional amendments to be \noffered. What we would like to see is if those Senators who have \namendments would contact us, we could schedule them and hopefully we \ncan get some time agreements, so when we finish this evening and come \nback on this bill, we could get a list of amendments, work through \nthose amendments and finish the bill and send it along to the House. \nBecause there is an urgency here.\n  There are some things we do that are not particularly urgent. I \nunderstand that. If anyone thinks the issue of Indian health care is \nnot urgent, I urge them to go to the nearest Indian reservation and \nhave a visit about what is happening with respect to the Indian Health \nService. I know there are a lot of good people working in the Indian \nHealth Service, but I am telling you, go sit and listen for awhile, \nlisten to a discussion about what happens when you ration health care, \nwhen health care is not a right and not only not a right but when \nhealth care is absolutely rationed. There are people dying. There are \npeople living in pain. There are people who don't have access to any \nkind of health care facility. There are people who are having \nemergencies at 5 in the afternoon, when their local clinic closed their \ndoors at 4, and they are 100 miles from the nearest hospital. That is \nwhat is happening on Indian reservations across this country.\n  We have a responsibility, a trust responsibility to provide for that \nhealth care. The Congress, this country has not owned up to that \nresponsibility, and we must. That is why we have brought this bill to \nthe floor of the\n\n[[Page S53]]\n\nSenate, and I am hoping very much for the cooperation of my colleagues. \nLet's complete the amendments, raise them with us, let us work with you \non getting them up and getting votes on them so we can at least \nindicate our support to do what we are required to do as American \ncitizens: honor our treaties, meet our trust responsibilities, and keep \nthe promises we have made to the first Americans.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.r. 4986\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4986, \nthe Department of Defense authorization, with no amendments in order to \nthe bill; that the bill be read a third time, and without further \naction, the Senate proceed to vote on passage; that upon passage, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and I make a point of \norder that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in a few moments we are going to vote on \nthe Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008.\n  The bill before us today is the same bill we passed by a 90-to-3 vote \na little more than a month ago, except for minor changes.\n  This bill will provide essential pay and benefits for our men and \nwomen in uniform. It includes a 3.5-percent pay raise for the troops.\n  It includes the Wounded Warrior Act, the greatest reform in the law \nrelative to medical care for our troops in more than a decade. It will \naddress the substandard living conditions, poor outpatient care and \nbureaucratic roadblocks and delays faced by injured soldiers. These \nprovisions will dramatically improve the management of medical care, \ndisability evaluations, personnel actions, and the quality of life for \nservice members recovering from illness or injuries incurred while \nperforming their military duties and begin the process of fundamental \nreform of DOD and VA disability evaluation systems.\n  The Wounded Warrior Act will require the Secretary of Defense and the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to work together to develop a \ncomprehensive policy on the care, management, and transition of \nseverely injured service members, including Active Duty, National \nGuard, and Reserve members, from the military to the Veterans \nAdministration or to civilian life. It will require the use of a single \nmedical examination where appropriate, and require and fund the \nestablishment of centers of excellence for the signature wounds of the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan--post-traumatic stress disorder and \ntraumatic brain injury.\n  To improve the disability evaluation system, the bill will require \nthe military departments to use VA standards when making disability \ndeterminations, authorizing deviation from these standards only when it \nwill result in a higher disability rating for the service member, and \nwill require the services to take into account all medical conditions \nthat render a member unfit for duty.\n  The bill will also increase the severance pay for military personnel \nwho are separated for medical disability with a disability rating of \nless than 30 percent and will eliminate the requirement that this \nseverance pay be deducted from VA disability compensation for \ndisabilities incurred in a combat zone or combat-related operation.\n  The bill also includes essential management reforms for the \nDepartment of Defense, including the Acquisition Improvement and \nAccountability Act of 2007. Some of the reforms included are: \nestablishment of a defense acquisition workforce development fund to \nensure that DOD has the people and the skills needed to effectively \nmanage its contracts; strengthening of statutory protections for \ncontractor employees who blow the whistle on waste, fraud, and abuse in \nDOD contracts; and tightening of the rules for DOD acquisition of major \nweapons systems and subsystems, components and spare parts to reduce \nthe risk of contract overpricing, cost overruns, and failure to meet \ncontract schedules and performance requirements. These and other \nprovisions should go a long way toward addressing the contracting \nwaste, fraud and abuse that we have seen altogether too frequently in \nrecent years.\n  Our legislation will also address a major failure in Iraq--the \nfailure to exercise control over private security contractors. It will \nrequire for the first time that private security contractors hired by \nthe State Department and other Federal agencies to work in a war zone \ncomply with directives and orders issued by our military commanders as \nwell as with DOD regulations.\n  On December 17, 2007, we sent the defense authorization act to the \nPresident for his signature. The following weekend, the White House \nstaff notified us that they had identified a problem with one provision \nthat would lead the President to veto the bill. While the \nadministration had previously expressed concerns about this provision, \nno administration official had ever indicated that the President would \nconsider a veto. Quite the opposite, this provision was not on the list \nof potential veto-causing problems.\n  I remain disappointed by the administration's failure to work with us \nto address this provision until after the bill had passed both Houses \nof Congress and was sent to the President for signature. It does not \nserve anybody's interest when we fail to address issues like this in a \ntimely manner. The veto of the National Defense Authorization Act sent \nthe wrong message to our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines at a \ntime when many of them are risking their lives on a daily basis in \nIraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere.\n  I am pleased that we have been able to work out language to address \nthe administration's concerns on a bicameral and bipartisan basis. The \nbill that is before us today contains modifications that have been \nagreed upon by the White House and by the bipartisan leadership of the \nHouse and Senate Armed Services Committee. I understand that these \nchanges are also acceptable to Senator Lautenberg and other Members who \nworked with him to put together the provision in the earlier bill.\n  Let me briefly explain the White House's problem, and how we have \naddressed it.\n  Section 1083 of the bill clarifies the law that permits U.S. \nnationals and members of the U.S. Armed Forces who are victims of \nterrorist acts to sue state sponsors of terrorism for damages resulting \nfrom terrorist acts in the U.S. courts. The provision also strengthens \nmechanisms to ensure that victims of terrorism can collect on their \njudgments against such State sponsors of terrorism. U.S. courts have \npreviously entered such judgments against Iran, Libya, and Saddam \nHussein's Iraq.\n  After the bill was passed and sent to the President for signature, \nthe administration informed us that Iraq currently has more than $25 \nbillion of assets in this country that could be tied up in litigation \nif section 1083 were enacted into law and that such restrictions on \nIraq's funds could take months to lift. The White House stated that \nrestrictions on Iraqi funds would interfere with political and economic \nprogress in Iraq and undermine our relations with Iraq.\n  We have addressed these concerns with new language which authorizes \nthe President to waive the applicability of section 1083 to Iraq, if he \ndetermines that a waiver is in the national security interest of the \nUnited States; that the waiver will promote Iraqi reconstruction, the \nconsolidation of democracy in Iraq, and U.S. relations with Iraq; and \nthat Iraq continues to be a reliable ally of the United States and a \npartner in combating international terrorism.\n  The revised language also expresses the sense of Congress that the \nPresident, acting through the Secretary of State, should work with the \nGovernment of Iraq on a state-to-state basis to ensure compensation for \nany meritorious claims based on terrorist acts\n\n[[Page S54]]\n\ncommitted by the Saddam Hussein regime that cannot be addressed in the \nU.S. courts due to a Presidential waiver.\n  We expect that the Department of State will actively pursue such \ncompensation from Iraq.\n  As one of the authors of the new section 1083, I want to assure the \nSenate that the new language authorizes the waiver of section 1083, \nonly as it applies to Iraq. The new subsection (d), which we have added \nto the bill, specifies that the President may waive any provision of \nsection 1083 ``with respect to Iraq'' and not with regard to any other \ncountry. We explicitly reaffirm in this bill that other cases against \nstate sponsors of terrorism, including both Iran and Libya, may proceed \nto judgment and collection under section 1083, unaffected by any \nPresidential waiver.\n  Over the last 2 weeks, concerns have been expressed about the \npossible impact of this provision on innocent third parties entering \njoint ventures with Libya or Iran. The concern was that these companies \nwould find their own property seized to satisfy judgments against those \ncountries. Our language does not allow for that result, because that is \nnot our intent. This is not a new issue: the question has been raised \nby the language of the Lautenberg amendment ever since it was first \napproved by the Senate last fall.\n  We specifically addressed the problem of joint ventures in our \nconference on the Defense authorization bill, previously approved by \nthe Congress. We added language to the bill making it clear that the \ncourts are authorized to compensate victim of state-sponsored terrorism \nout of Libya's--or other states'--assets, while separating and \nshielding the assets of companies engaged in joint ventures with those \nStates. In the accompanying statement of managers, we specifically \nurged the courts to make use of this authority. This language was the \nstrongest action that we could take to protect innocent third parties \nwithout also shielding the offending governments from liability for \ntheir own actions.\n  We have included a provision to ensure that the statement of managers \non our previous conference report will apply to this new bill in this \nand all regards.\n  Outside of the modification of section 1083, the bill remains \nvirtually unchanged. We have, however, taken steps to ensure our men \nand women in uniform will not lose a penny as a result of the delayed \nenactment of this bill. Toward that end, we have revised a number of \nprovisions in the bill to make pay increases and bonus provisions \nretroactive to January 1 and avoid any gap in these authorities. These \nchanges have been worked out with the Department of Defense and agreed \nto by the two Armed Services Committees on a bipartisan basis.\n  Other than these few changes, the bill before us today is identical \nto the conference report that the Senate overwhelmingly passed last \nmonth. It is my hope that the bill will receive similar support when we \nvote on it again later today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S54-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S54-S57]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4986) to provide for the enactment of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I oppose the fiscal year 2008 Defense \nauthorization bill because it authorizes $189.5 billion for the war in \nIraq but does nothing to end the President's misguided, open-ended Iraq \npolicy. That policy has overburdened our military, weakened our \nnational security, diminished our international credibility, and cost \nthe lives of thousands of brave American soldiers.\n  There are certain provisions of the bill that I support strongly, \nincluding a pay raise for military personnel, Senator Webb's amendment \ncreating a Commission on Wartime Contracting to examine waste, fraud, \nand abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Senator Lautenberg's amendment \nto create a Special Investigator General for Afghanistan \nReconstruction.\n  But on balance, I cannot vote to support a bill that defies the will \nof so many Wisconsinites--and so many Americans--by allowing the \nPresident to continue one of the worst foreign policy mistakes in the \nhistory of our Nation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to applaud the chairman and \nranking members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senators Levin \nand McCain, respectively, on passage of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2008.\n  Specifically, I would like to express my gratitude to the bill \nconferees for their inclusion of four amendments that I authored and \nwhich were unanimously adopted by the Senate during its initial \nconsideration of this bill. These provisions will increase oversight of \nour country's economic and security assistance to Afghanistan by \ncreating a Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, \nsection 1229; help victims of state sponsored terrorism to achieve \njustice through the U.S. courts, section 1083; prevent military health \ncare fees through the TRICARE program from rising, sections 701 and \n702; and increase accountability and planning for safety and security \nat the Warren Grove Gunnery Range in New Jersey, section 359.\n  First, I was proud to be joined by my cosponsors, Senators Coburn, \nDodd, Hagel, Feingold, Webb, and McCaskill, in creating a Special \nInspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. I wrote this \nlegislation because I believe that while a democratic, stable, and \nprosperous Afghanistan is important to the national security of the \nUnited States and to combating international terrorism, I am concerned \nthat we are not achieving all of our goals there. The United States has \nprovided Afghanistan with over $20 billion in reconstruction and \nsecurity assistance. However, repeated and documented incidents of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in the utilization of these funds have \nundermined reconstruction efforts. I therefore believe that there is a \ncritical need for vigorous oversight of spending by the United States \non reconstruction programs and projects in Afghanistan.\n  I would like to emphasize that the Government Accountability Office \nand the departmental Inspectors general have provided valuable \ninformation on these activities. However, I believe that the \ncongressional oversight process requires more timely oversight and \nreporting of reconstruction activities in Afghanistan. Oversight by \nthis new Special Inspector General would encompass the activities of \nthe Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development, as well as other relevant agencies. It \nwould highlight specific acts of waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as \nother managerial failures in our assistance programs that need to be \naddressed.\n  This new position will monitor U.S. assistance to Afghanistan in the \ncivilian and security sectors, as well as in the counternarcotics \narena, and will help both Congress and the American people better \nunderstand the challenges facing U.S. programs and projects in that \ncountry. I am pleased that this provision has been included in this \nfinal bill.\n  Second, this bill includes my legislation to provide justice for \nvictims of state-sponsored terrorism, which has strong bipartisan \nsupport. I believe this legislation is essential to providing justice \nto those who have suffered at the hands of terrorists and is an \nimportant tool designed to deter future state-sponsored terrorism. The \nexisting law passed by Congress in 1996 has been weakened by recent \njudicial decisions. This legislation fixes these problems.\n  In 1996, Congress created the ``state sponsored terrorism exception'' \nto the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, FSIA. This exception allows \nvictims of terrorism to sue those nations designated as state sponsors \nof terrorism by the Department of State for terrorist acts they commit \nor for which they provide material support. Congress subsequently \npassed the Flatow Amendment to the FSIA, which allows victims of \nterrorism to seek meaningful damages, such as punitive damages, from \nstate sponsors of terrorism for the horrific acts of terrorist murder \nand injury committed or supported by them.\n  Congress's original intent behind the 1996 legislation has been \nmuddied by\n\n[[Page S55]]\n\nnumerous court decisions. For example, the courts decided in Cicippio-\nPuleo v. Islamic Republic of Iran that there is no private right of \naction against foreign governments--as opposed to individuals--under \nthe Flatow Amendment. Since this decision, judges have been prevented \nfrom applying a uniform damages standard to all victims in a single \ncase because a victim's right to pursue an action against a foreign \ngovernment depends upon State law. My provision in this bill fixes this \nproblem by reaffirming the private right of action under the Flatow \nAmendment against the foreign state sponsors of terrorism themselves.\n  My provision in this bill also addresses a part of the law which \nuntil now has granted foreign states an unusual procedural advantage. \nAs a general rule, interim court orders cannot be appealed until the \ncourt has reached a final disposition on the case as a whole. However, \nforeign states have abused a narrow exception to this bar on interim \nappeals--the collateral order doctrine--to delay justice for, and the \nresolution of, victim's suits. In Beecham v. Socialist People's Libyan \nArab Jamahiriya, Libya has delayed the claims of dead and injured U.S. \nservice personnel who were off duty when attacked by Libyan agents at \nthe Labelle Discotheque in Berlin in 1986. These delays have lasted for \nmany years, as the Libyans have taken or threatened to take frivolous \ncollateral order doctrine appeals whenever possible. My provision will \neliminate the ability of state sponsors of terrorism to utilize the \ncollateral order doctrine. My legislation sends a clear and unequivocal \nmessage to Libya. Its refusal to act in good faith will no longer be \ntolerated by Congress.\n  Another purpose of my provision is to facilitate victims' collection \nof their damages from state sponsors of terrorism. The misapplication \nof the ``Bancec doctrine,'' named for the Supreme Court's decision in \nFirst National City Bank v. Banco Para El Comercio Exterior de Cuba, \nhas in the past erroneously protected the assets of terrorist states \nfrom attachment or collection. For example, in Flatow v. Bank Saderat \nIran, the Flatow family attempted to attach an asset owned by Iran \nthrough the Bank Saderat Iran. Although Iran owned the Bank Saderat \nIran, the court, relying on the State Department's application of the \nBancec doctrine, held that the Flatows could not attach the asset \nbecause they could not show that Iran exercised day-to-day managerial \ncontrol over Bank Saderat Iran. My provision will remedy this issue by \nallowing attachment of the assets of a state sponsor of terrorism to be \nmade upon the satisfaction of a ``simple ownership'' test.\n\n  Another problem is that courts have mistakenly interpreted the \nstatute of limitations provision that Congress created in 1996. In \ncases such as Vine v. Republic of Iraq and later Buonocore v. Socialist \nPeople's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, the court interpreted the statute to \nbegin to run at the time of the attack, contrary to our intent. It was \nour intent to provide a 10-year period from the date of enactment of \nthe legislation for all acts that had occurred at anytime prior to its \npassage in 1996. We also intended to provide a period of 10 years from \nthe time of any attack which might occur after 1996. My provision \nclarifies this intent.\n  My provision also addresses the problems that arose from overly \nmechanistic interpretations of the 1996 legislation. For example, in \nseveral cases, such as Certain Underwriters v. Socialist People's \nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, courts have prevented victims from pursuing \nclaims for collateral property damage sustained in terrorist attacks \ndirected against U.S. citizens. My new provision fixes this problem by \ncreating an explicit cause of action for these kinds of property \nowners, or their insurers, against state sponsors of terrorism.\n  Finally, in several cases the courts have prevented non-U.S. \nnationals who work for the U.S. Government and were injured in a \nterrorist attack during their official duties from pursuing claims for \ntheir personal injuries. My provision fixes this inequity by creating \nan explicit cause of action for non-U.S. nationals who were either \nworking as an employee of the U.S. Government or working pursuant to a \nU.S. Government contract.\n  I also want to make special mention of the inspiration for this new \nlegislation. On October 23, 1983, the Battalion Landing Team \nheadquarters building in the Marine Amphibious Unit compound at the \nBeirut International Airport was destroyed by a terrorist bomb killing \n241 marines, sailors, and soldiers who were present in Lebanon on a \npeace-keeping mission. In a case known as Peterson v. the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, filed on behalf of many of the marine victims and \ntheir families, the U.S. District Court ruled in 2003 that the \nterrorist organization Hezbollah was funded by, directed by, and relied \nupon the Islamic Republic of Iran and its Ministry of Information and \nSecurity to carry out that heinous attack. The judge presiding over \nthis case, Judge Royce Lamberth, referred to this as ``the most deadly \nstate sponsored terrorist attack made against United States citizens \nbefore September 11, 2001.'' In September of this year Judge Lamberth \nfound that Iran not only is responsible for this attack but also owes \nthe families of the victims a total of more than $2.6 billion for the \nattack. Congress's support of my provision will now empower these \nvictims to pursue Iranian assets to obtain this just compensation for \ntheir suffering. This is true justice through American rule of law.\n  However, President Bush's veto of the initial version of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008, H.R. 1585, on New \nYear's Eve required that my provision to provide justice for victims of \nstate-sponsored terrorism be amended. The President chose to take this \nextraordinary action without warning after asserting that he had not \nbeen aware of the provision's potential impact on the Government of \nIraq. The President contended that this provision would hinder Iraqi \nreconstruction by exposing the current Iraqi government to liability \nfor terrorist acts committed by Saddam Hussein's government and vetoed \nthe entire Defense Authorization bill on that basis.\n  To address the President's concerns that the Government of Iraq could \nbe made liable, the revised provision grants the President the \nauthority to waive the terror victim's provision only for cases in \nwhich Iraq or its agencies, instrumentalities, or governmental actors \nare named defendants. The provision does not give the President the \nauthority to waive any part of the provision for any case in which a \ngovernment, its agencies, instrumentalities, or governmental actors are \nnamed defendants other than Iraq.\n  By insisting on being given the power to waive application of this \nnew law to Iraq, the President seeks to prevent victims of past Iraqi \nterrorism--for acts committed by Saddam Hussein--from achieving the \nsame justice as victims of other countries. Fortunately, the President \nwill not have authority to waive the provision's application to \nterrorist acts committed by Iran and Libya, among others.\n  In addition, my new provision includes a Sense of the Congress that \nthe Secretary of State should work with Iraq, on a state-to-state \nbasis, to resolve the meritorious claims made against Iraq by terror \nvictims. It is crucial that the victims of these terrorist acts be \nincluded in such discussions. Their approval of agreements made between \nthe two governments on their behalf is critical to ensuring that \njustice is served.\n  Third, this Defense authorization bill includes my provision to \nprevent proposed increases in enrollment fees, premiums, and pharmacy \ncopayments for TRICARE, the military community's health plan. The \nprincipal coauthor of this provision is Senator Hagel.\n  Both career members of the uniformed services and their families \nendure unique and extraordinary demands and make extraordinary \nsacrifices over the course of 20-year to 30-year careers in protecting \nfreedom for all Americans. I believe they deserve the best retirement \nbenefits that a grateful nation can provide. Proposals to compare cash \nfees paid by retired military members and their families to fees paid \nby civilians fails to adequately recognize the sacrifice of military \nmembers. We must be mindful that military members prepay the equivalent \nof very large advance premiums for health care in retirement through \ntheir extended service and sacrifice.\n  The Department of Defense and our Nation have a committed obligation \nto\n\n[[Page S56]]\n\nprovide health care benefits to Active Duty, National Guard, Reserve, \nand retired members of the uniformed services, their families, and \nsurvivors, that considerably exceed the obligation of corporate \nemployers to provide health care benefits to their employees. \nUltimately, the Department of Defense has options to constrain the \ngrowth of health care spending in ways that do not disadvantage current \nand retired members of the uniformed services, and it should pursue any \nand all such options as a first priority. Raising fees excessively on \nTRICARE beneficiaries is not the way to achieve this objective.\n  Finally, I thank the conferees for including my amendment to require \nincreased oversight and accountability, as well as improved safety \nmeasures, at the Warren Grove Gunnery Range in New Jersey. I wrote this \nprovision with Senator Menendez because a number of dangerous safety \nincidents caused by the Air National Guard have repeatedly impacted the \nresidents living nearby the range.\n  On May 15, 2007, a fire ignited during an Air National Guard practice \nmission at Warren Grove Gunnery Range, scorching 17,250 acres of New \nJersey's Pinelands, destroying 5 houses, significantly damaging 13 \nothers, and temporarily displacing approximately 6,000 people from \ntheir homes in sections of Ocean and Burlington Counties in New Jersey.\n  My provision will require that an annual report on safety measures \ntaken at the range be produced by the Secretary of the Air Force. The \nfirst report will be due no later than March 1, 2008, and two more will \nbe due annually thereafter. My provision will also require that a \nmaster plan for the range be drafted that includes measures to mitigate \nencroachment issues surrounding the range, taking into consideration \nmilitary mission requirements, land use plans, the surrounding \ncommunity, the economy of the region, and the protection of the \nenvironment and public health, safety, and welfare. I believe that \nthese studies will provide the type of information that we need to \nensure that there is long-term safety at the range, both for the \nmilitary and the surrounding communities.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address the \npay raise given to members of the U.S. military. On December 28, 2007, \nPresident Bush vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2008 because of a disagreement over a provision in the Justice for \nVictims of State Sponsored Terrorism Act of 2007.\n  The disagreement over language in the Justice for Victims of State \nSponsored Terrorism Act has affected far more individuals than the \nlegislation itself addresses. By holding up the signing of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, it jeopardized the pay \nraise which was promised to our Nation's servicemen and servicewomen.\n  On January 4, 2008, the President issued Executive Order 13454, which \ngave all members of the military a 3-percent pay raise effective \nJanuary 1, 2008. I commend the House for its January 16, 2008, decision \nto make retroactive to January 1, 2008, a 3.5-percent pay raise for \nmembers of the uniformed services. This was the number that the House \nand the Senate agreed upon before we sent the bill to President Bush in \nDecember; I think it is only fair this be the number we return to when \nwe again submit the bill to the President. The men and women of the \nmilitary should not be made to suffer for disagreements between the \nCongress and the White House.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in a few minutes, I am going to ask \nunanimous consent to take up the authorization bill for the Department \nof Defense for fiscal year 2008. But before we proceed to consider and \npass this important legislation, I want to take just a moment to advise \nmy colleagues of the unfortunate and troubling path that this \nlegislation has taken since the Senate last voted to pass it on \nDecember 14.\n  On December 19, the same day the other body adjourned its first \nsession, the Congress sent to the President legislation, H.R. 1585, \nthat was identical to the bill we are about to take up and pass, with \none substantive difference regarding section 1083 and several \nassociated technical corrections necessary due to the delay of the \nbill's enactment.\n  What I want to focus on today is the manner in which the President \nchose to exercise his veto prerogative. As the Chair and our colleagues \nare well aware, the Framers of our Constitution deliberately gave the \nPresident only a limited or qualified veto power, one that could be \noverridden by Congress if it could muster a two-third vote in both \nHouses--a formidable challenge. But President Bush was not satisfied \nsimply to veto the bill and risk an override, as contemplated under our \nconstitutional process.\n  Rather, on December 28, the President issued a memorandum of \ndisapproval stating that, because the other body had adjourned its \nfirst session, while the Senate remained in session to protect its \nadvise-and-consent prerogative, he considered the bill pocket vetoed, \nrelying upon the constitutional provision that protects against the \nCongress's adjourning in order to prevent the President from exercising \nhis veto power. But the President did not actually pocket the bill. \nInstead, using the mechanism provided in the rules of the other body \nfor such periods as the December holidays, the White House returned the \nbill, with the President's veto message, to the Clerk of the House, for \ntransmission to the full body when it reconvened last week. The \nPresident said that he was returning the bill ``to avoid unnecessary \nlitigation'' and ``to leave no doubt'' that he was vetoing the bill.\n  The Constitution does not provide for double vetoes: A bill is vetoed \neither by being returned or, if return is prevented by Congress's \nadjournment, by being pocketed. Here, the President returned the bill \nto the other body through delivery to the Clerk. Obviously, the \nadjournment did not prevent the bill's return. Accordingly, the bill \nwas not subject to a pocket veto. Had the President not returned the \nbill within the 10 days--excluding Sunday--prescribed by the \nConstitution, the bill would have become law without his signature. \nThat fact explains why the President returned the bill.\n  Indeed, in 1983, President Reagan attempted to pocket veto a military \naid appropriations measure during an analogous adjournment--the break \nbetween the first and second sessions of the 98th Congress. On a \nbipartisan basis, the Senate joined a group of Members of the other \nbody to challenge that attempted misuse of the pocket veto in a Federal \ncourt case called Barnes v. Kline. Although the decision was \nsubsequently vacated because the fiscal year for the military aid bill \nhad expired in the meantime, thereby mooting the case, the Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected the Executive's \nattempt to pocket veto the bill and held that, because it could have \nbeen returned to the House, under the Constitution the bill had become \nlaw. The court held that three factors, when taken together, establish \nthat adjournment of the first session of a Congress does not prevent \nthe President from returning a bill under the Constitution: First, \n``[t]he existence of an authorized receiver of veto messages''; second, \n``the rules providing for carryover of unfinished business'' in the \nsecond session of a Congress; and third, ``the duration of modern \nintersession adjournments.''\n\n  In that decision, the court of appeals built upon the foundation laid \nby our colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, who, a decade \nearlier personally had argued and won the case Kennedy v. Sampson in \nthe same court, thereby establishing the President's duty to return \nbills to Congress, through its appointed officers, during intrasession \nadjournments. As the court made clear, during both types of \nadjournments, the application of the pocket veto clause has necessarily \nbeen guided from the beginning by its ``manifest purpose.'' And that \npurpose is solely to ensure that the Congress cannot deprive the \nPresident of his right to exercise the qualified veto, not to permit \nthe President to accomplish what the Framers of our Constitution denied \nhim--by transforming the qualified veto into an absolute veto.\n  I have gone into some detail in explicating the background and \nhistory of the pocket veto controversy because of its importance to our \nconstitutional system of separation of powers and checks and balances \nbetween the branches. The President should abandon the strange and \nunseemly practice\n\n[[Page S57]]\n\nof maintaining that he cannot return a bill to Congress, while \nsimultaneously returning the bill. Such game-playing is unworthy of the \nOffice of the President and breaks faith with the brilliant, carefully \ncrafted system that the Founders bequeathed to us and future \ngenerations.\n  However, much as part of me would like to see Congress take the \nopportunity provided by the President's action here to establish \ndefinitively the Congress's constitutional power to override a veto \nexercised during its adjournment, the Nation's security and the care of \nour troops and wounded warriors demands that we get this bill signed \ninto law as soon as possible. This bill provides important \ncongressional authorizations and guidance for the Nation's defense \nbudget, a 3.5-percent 9 pay raise and key bonuses for the troops, \nlegislation to improve the system of care for our wounded warriors, and \nauthorization to establish a war profiteering commission. The \nPresident's veto of this bill in December has already delayed these \nprovisions for too long.\n  I also want to reiterate that it is my belief that the Government of \nIraq should take responsibility for what has taken place there in years \npast, including the brutal torture of American POWs. Congress has gone \non record repeatedly--most recently, in overwhelmingly passing section \n1083 of the conference report to H.R. 1585 last year in both the House \nand Senate and sending it to the President--to support the efforts of \nthese Americans who have suffered so much for their country to hold \ntheir torturers accountable. This administration has been fighting for \nyears to oppose efforts to win compensation for these American \nsoldiers, which is, frankly, a disgrace.\n  In light of the President's veto over this issue, I call on him and \nhis administration to work with the POWs and their family members to \nfacilitate negotiations with the Government of Iraq. It is my \nunderstanding that the administration has been working with Iraq to \nsettle gulf war commercial debts with foreign corporations such as \nMitsubishi of Japan and Hyundai of Korea through issuance of Iraqi \nbonds. This mechanism takes no funds from the reconstruction of Iraq. \nIt is beyond me why the administration would refuse to do at least that \nfor the POWs. The administration needs to make this right.\n  The bill (H.R. 4986) was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on passage of the bill.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), \nthe Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez), and the Senator from \nIllinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Menendez) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Thune), \nand the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am glad we have a large number of Senators \nhere today. I want to go over the schedule for this week.\n  First of all, I am going to ask unanimous consent, and I will do that \nnow, that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 2541, which is \na 30-day extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act we are \ngoing to be dealing with; that the bill be read three times, passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The reason I ask consent on this legislation is that this bill \nexpires on February 1. The House has not acted on this bill yet, so \nwhen we pass this bill, the House has to pass their bill, and there has \nto be a conference. I hope we could have this extension. I need not \nbelabor the point. I asked this consent before we left; I ask it again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill be objecting, let me say, my good friend, the majority leader, and \nI have discussed this issue. There is a significant amount of time left \nthis month to pass this bill in the Senate. A conference may or may not \nbe necessary. Back in August, when we did an extension of the FISA \nbill, the House simply took up the Senate-passed bill and passed it, \nand it went down to the President for signature. So I think the \ndiscussion of extension, particularly when, hopefully, we will turn to \nthis bill in the very near future in the Senate, is not timely and, \ntherefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for all Members here, we are on the Indian \nhealth bill now. I hope we can complete that bill tomorrow. The \nRepublicans are having a retreat. They are having theirs tomorrow; we \nare going to have ours in 10 days or so. There will be activities on \nthe Senate floor tomorrow, but there will be no votes. If there are any \nvotes tomorrow, it will be after they finish their retreat, after 6 \no'clock tomorrow night.\n  So we hope some work can be done on this bill tomorrow. We know the \nRepublicans will be absent, so that makes it very difficult.\n  We have to finish FISA this week. Everyone should be aware of that \npoint. We have to finish it this week. I know there are important trips \npeople want to take. We have the very important economic conference in \nDavos that Democrats and Republicans alike would like to go to.\n  I say, unless we finish the bill Thursday--and we will not be able to \nget to it until tomorrow night--unless we finish the bill on Thursday, \nthen we are going to have to continue working this week until we finish \nthis bill. We have to finish this bill. It is not fair to the House to \njam them so that they have 1 day to act on this legislation. If we \nfinish it this week, I have spoken to the Speaker today and they will \nwork to complete this matter next week. It would be to everyone's \nadvantage if we had more time to do this.\n\n  I respect what the Republican leader has said, but everyone here \nshould understand all weekend activities have to be put on hold until \nwe finish this bill. Now, it is possible we could finish it fairly \nquickly. We are going to work from the Intelligence bill, and if \namendments are offered that people don't like, I would suggest they \nmove to table those amendments. Because if people think they are going \nto talk this to death, we are going to be in here all night. This is \nnot something\n\n[[Page S58]]\n\nwe are going to have a silent filibuster on. If someone wants to \nfilibuster this bill, they are going to do it in the openness of the \nSenate.\n  We are not going to say, well, we can't get 60 votes on this. We are \ngoing to work toward completing this bill as quickly as we can. I would \nrather we didn't have to do this. And maybe if we get to it on \nThursday, we can finish it Thursday. If not, hopefully on Friday. But I \nknow of no alternative. This work period is very short. We have, after \nthis week, only 3 weeks.\n  I have had many meetings, and they have been bipartisan in nature, to \ntry to come up with a stimulus package that is so important to our \ncountry. Everyone has seen what has happened to not only our own stock \nmarkets but those around the world. We may not be in a recession, but \npeople are looking at an economic downturn as concerning to everyone, \nincluding the President. So we have a lot to do this work period. I \nhave only mentioned a couple issues we need to work on, but there are a \nlot of others, of course, we need to do also.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1255\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of Calendar No. 213, H.R. 1255, Presidential Records Act \nAmendments of 2007; that the amendment at the desk be considered and \nagreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements \nrelating thereto appear at the appropriate place in the Record as if \ngiven; and that there be no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on the issue of FISA, let me second the \nobservation of the majority leader. There is no more important issue \nfor us to deal with in terms of protecting the homeland. I agree with \nhis decision that we press forward on FISA and get it out of the \nSenate--but not just get it out of the Senate, get it out of the Senate \nand to the House in a form the President will sign. Nothing is more \nimportant to protecting the homeland than getting this done and getting \nit done properly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have a number of Members who are \nsupposed to go to the Davos economic summit tomorrow night, and I would \nnote I have talked with Senator Bennett of Utah, who is the senior \nRepublican on that trip, and the trip that is set to leave tomorrow \nnight will not. We will put it on hold until Thursday, to determine \nwhether we can leave on Thursday.\n  If I could have the attention of the majority leader for a moment. I \nappreciate the majority leader has been very clear. I happen to concur \nwith him that this is important and we should finish it. All we want to \ndo is to know how it will go. There is a Judiciary Committee amendment \nto the bill. I would not anticipate taking a great deal of time on \nthat, but I think the distinguished majority leader is doing the \nabsolute right thing.\n  He has the worst job in America, trying to accommodate the schedules \nof 99 other people, plus his own, which usually comes in number 100 out \nof the 100. I am not in any way suggesting we change for the Davos \nsummit. I will keep in touch with him, Senator Rockefeller, and others \nas we go forward. If it is possible for us to leave Thursday night, we \nwill be able to leave Thursday night. But I would not suggest the \nbipartisan delegation go to Davos if this matter is pending.\n  I appreciate the distinguished leader spending a lot of time on the \nphone over the weekend and again today and I appreciate his \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might address the majority leader for a moment, we \nhave had a great deal of debate today on the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act, and I appreciate, as I said earlier, the willingness \nof the majority leader to bring this bill to the floor of the Senate. I \nknow it deals with about 4 million Americans. But the fact is there are \npeople dying, dying in this country, because of inadequate health care \nfor a trust requirement, a responsibility our Government has for the \nhealth of the American Indians.\n  I know we will be considering that issue still tomorrow. I talked to \nSenator Coburn, who indicated he has some amendments and will be here \ntomorrow to be discussing the bill. My hope is we could get the \nSenators to come and offer amendments, that we can finish these \namendments, and for the first time in 10 years get this bill passed. \nSenator McCain, when chairman of this committee; Senator Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell, when chairman; and now myself, along with Vice Chair \nMurkowski, have worked hard to get this done. We are so close, and I \nappreciate the cooperation of the majority leader.\n  I understand we will have to move to FISA at some point, but I know \nthe majority leader wants to give us fair opportunity to consider these \namendments and see if we can finish in a day or so, and I hope that can \nbe the case.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to my friend from North \nDakota, we have a Presidential debate going on now. Democrats and \nRepublicans are talking about health care. I say to my friend, there is \nno place, no people in America more badly in need of health care than \nNative Americans. In Nevada, we have 22 different tribal organizations. \nThe sickest, the most dependent people on health care are Indians. We \nhad hospitals that used to exist where they could go, but they are \ngone. We had a hospital that was brand new. It was never staffed. The \npeople have to drive 110 miles over the worst roads in Nevada to go to \nthe hospital--these Native Americans.\n\n  So I say if we, as a people, have any concern about health care, \nplease direct it to the Native Americans. No one needs it more than \nthey do. That is what this legislation is all about. We have legal \nresponsibilities to take care of it, and we have neglected those \nresponsibilities. We as a Federal Government have neglected those \nresponsibilities.\n  So I so appreciate the chair of this committee, the ranking member of \nthe committee, Senator Murkowski of Alaska, and I hope the two of you \ncan work hard to get us a piece of legislation we can send over to the \nHouse and that the President will sign it. People desperately need this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. I understand \nwe are going to need to move off and go to FISA at some point. We need \nsome time, at least another day, to have some amendments, and then I \nthink we can finish this bill.\n  Frankly, we have a trust responsibility. We have signed treaties, and \nthis great country needs to keep its word. It has not kept its word on \nIndian health care. That is the reason we are on the floor of the \nSenate. So I wanted to make this point as we move to consider all these \nother priorities, that one of the significant priorities is to get the \namendments on the floor, get them debated, have time agreements, and \nlet us get this bill passed. It is 10 years late, but let us at least \npay respect to our word, the commitments we have made, the treaties we \nhave signed, and the trust responsibilities that are ours.\n  I heard someone say, people aren't dying over this. They are dying \nover this, I guarantee you. I will get you their names. There are \npeople who deserve health care who aren't getting it, and the fact is \npeople are dying today as a result of it. Ten years later we ought to \npass this legislation. I have worked hard with Senator Murkowski, \nSenator McCain, and so many others to move this legislation. All we ask \nis fair opportunity to get the amendments to the floor and get them \nconsidered and voted on and let us do the right thing.\n  Tomorrow, I will be back. I do have great passion about this because \nI have seen people who are sick, I have seen people who are suffering \nand I have seen people and talked to people who had children die and \nspouses die because of inadequate health care, because of full-scale \nhealth care rationing in this country for American Indians. That is \nunacceptable, and it ought to be unacceptable to every single Member of \nthis Senate.\n\n[[Page S59]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S57-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S57-S59]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2541\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am glad we have a large number of Senators \nhere today. I want to go over the schedule for this week.\n  First of all, I am going to ask unanimous consent, and I will do that \nnow, that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. 2541, which is \na 30-day extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act we are \ngoing to be dealing with; that the bill be read three times, passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The reason I ask consent on this legislation is that this bill \nexpires on February 1. The House has not acted on this bill yet, so \nwhen we pass this bill, the House has to pass their bill, and there has \nto be a conference. I hope we could have this extension. I need not \nbelabor the point. I asked this consent before we left; I ask it again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill be objecting, let me say, my good friend, the majority leader, and \nI have discussed this issue. There is a significant amount of time left \nthis month to pass this bill in the Senate. A conference may or may not \nbe necessary. Back in August, when we did an extension of the FISA \nbill, the House simply took up the Senate-passed bill and passed it, \nand it went down to the President for signature. So I think the \ndiscussion of extension, particularly when, hopefully, we will turn to \nthis bill in the very near future in the Senate, is not timely and, \ntherefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for all Members here, we are on the Indian \nhealth bill now. I hope we can complete that bill tomorrow. The \nRepublicans are having a retreat. They are having theirs tomorrow; we \nare going to have ours in 10 days or so. There will be activities on \nthe Senate floor tomorrow, but there will be no votes. If there are any \nvotes tomorrow, it will be after they finish their retreat, after 6 \no'clock tomorrow night.\n  So we hope some work can be done on this bill tomorrow. We know the \nRepublicans will be absent, so that makes it very difficult.\n  We have to finish FISA this week. Everyone should be aware of that \npoint. We have to finish it this week. I know there are important trips \npeople want to take. We have the very important economic conference in \nDavos that Democrats and Republicans alike would like to go to.\n  I say, unless we finish the bill Thursday--and we will not be able to \nget to it until tomorrow night--unless we finish the bill on Thursday, \nthen we are going to have to continue working this week until we finish \nthis bill. We have to finish this bill. It is not fair to the House to \njam them so that they have 1 day to act on this legislation. If we \nfinish it this week, I have spoken to the Speaker today and they will \nwork to complete this matter next week. It would be to everyone's \nadvantage if we had more time to do this.\n\n  I respect what the Republican leader has said, but everyone here \nshould understand all weekend activities have to be put on hold until \nwe finish this bill. Now, it is possible we could finish it fairly \nquickly. We are going to work from the Intelligence bill, and if \namendments are offered that people don't like, I would suggest they \nmove to table those amendments. Because if people think they are going \nto talk this to death, we are going to be in here all night. This is \nnot something\n\n[[Page S58]]\n\nwe are going to have a silent filibuster on. If someone wants to \nfilibuster this bill, they are going to do it in the openness of the \nSenate.\n  We are not going to say, well, we can't get 60 votes on this. We are \ngoing to work toward completing this bill as quickly as we can. I would \nrather we didn't have to do this. And maybe if we get to it on \nThursday, we can finish it Thursday. If not, hopefully on Friday. But I \nknow of no alternative. This work period is very short. We have, after \nthis week, only 3 weeks.\n  I have had many meetings, and they have been bipartisan in nature, to \ntry to come up with a stimulus package that is so important to our \ncountry. Everyone has seen what has happened to not only our own stock \nmarkets but those around the world. We may not be in a recession, but \npeople are looking at an economic downturn as concerning to everyone, \nincluding the President. So we have a lot to do this work period. I \nhave only mentioned a couple issues we need to work on, but there are a \nlot of others, of course, we need to do also.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 1255\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of Calendar No. 213, H.R. 1255, Presidential Records Act \nAmendments of 2007; that the amendment at the desk be considered and \nagreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements \nrelating thereto appear at the appropriate place in the Record as if \ngiven; and that there be no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on the issue of FISA, let me second the \nobservation of the majority leader. There is no more important issue \nfor us to deal with in terms of protecting the homeland. I agree with \nhis decision that we press forward on FISA and get it out of the \nSenate--but not just get it out of the Senate, get it out of the Senate \nand to the House in a form the President will sign. Nothing is more \nimportant to protecting the homeland than getting this done and getting \nit done properly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we have a number of Members who are \nsupposed to go to the Davos economic summit tomorrow night, and I would \nnote I have talked with Senator Bennett of Utah, who is the senior \nRepublican on that trip, and the trip that is set to leave tomorrow \nnight will not. We will put it on hold until Thursday, to determine \nwhether we can leave on Thursday.\n  If I could have the attention of the majority leader for a moment. I \nappreciate the majority leader has been very clear. I happen to concur \nwith him that this is important and we should finish it. All we want to \ndo is to know how it will go. There is a Judiciary Committee amendment \nto the bill. I would not anticipate taking a great deal of time on \nthat, but I think the distinguished majority leader is doing the \nabsolute right thing.\n  He has the worst job in America, trying to accommodate the schedules \nof 99 other people, plus his own, which usually comes in number 100 out \nof the 100. I am not in any way suggesting we change for the Davos \nsummit. I will keep in touch with him, Senator Rockefeller, and others \nas we go forward. If it is possible for us to leave Thursday night, we \nwill be able to leave Thursday night. But I would not suggest the \nbipartisan delegation go to Davos if this matter is pending.\n  I appreciate the distinguished leader spending a lot of time on the \nphone over the weekend and again today and I appreciate his \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might address the majority leader for a moment, we \nhave had a great deal of debate today on the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Act, and I appreciate, as I said earlier, the willingness \nof the majority leader to bring this bill to the floor of the Senate. I \nknow it deals with about 4 million Americans. But the fact is there are \npeople dying, dying in this country, because of inadequate health care \nfor a trust requirement, a responsibility our Government has for the \nhealth of the American Indians.\n  I know we will be considering that issue still tomorrow. I talked to \nSenator Coburn, who indicated he has some amendments and will be here \ntomorrow to be discussing the bill. My hope is we could get the \nSenators to come and offer amendments, that we can finish these \namendments, and for the first time in 10 years get this bill passed. \nSenator McCain, when chairman of this committee; Senator Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell, when chairman; and now myself, along with Vice Chair \nMurkowski, have worked hard to get this done. We are so close, and I \nappreciate the cooperation of the majority leader.\n  I understand we will have to move to FISA at some point, but I know \nthe majority leader wants to give us fair opportunity to consider these \namendments and see if we can finish in a day or so, and I hope that can \nbe the case.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to my friend from North \nDakota, we have a Presidential debate going on now. Democrats and \nRepublicans are talking about health care. I say to my friend, there is \nno place, no people in America more badly in need of health care than \nNative Americans. In Nevada, we have 22 different tribal organizations. \nThe sickest, the most dependent people on health care are Indians. We \nhad hospitals that used to exist where they could go, but they are \ngone. We had a hospital that was brand new. It was never staffed.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mrs. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wished to echo the comments of my \ncolleague and my chairman on the Indian Affairs Committee. \nReauthorization of this Indian Health Care Improvement Act is something \nthat is long overdue. When we sat down as the chairman and vice \nchairman of this committee to assess the priorities of the committee, \nit was absolutely clear the one thing we could do now to help make a \ndifference in the lives of American Indians and Alaska Natives was to \nimprove the health care system, the delivery, and the access.\n  The last time this was updated, if you will, was 1992. Think about \nwhat has happened in health care and the technologies and the \ntechniques since 1992. We owe it to our constituents across the \ncountry--not just in Alaska, where we have 225 tribes, but from \nCalifornia to Maine, from the Dakotas down to Florida--we owe it to all \nour constituents to finally see this reauthorization through. We do \nacknowledge there are some issues that are as yet unresolved, but it is \nnot as if we have not had the time to resolve them. The time is now to \nmake it happen.\n  I, too, would urge the Senate to work together, as the chairman and I \nhave, in a very cooperative, very bipartisan manner to figure out how \nwe move this legislation through the Senate to the House so it is \nfinally enacted into law.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3900\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I can send an amendment to the desk, and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself, Mr. \n     Obama, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n     Sununu, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. \n     Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 3900.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be considered as read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for payments under subsections (a) through (e) of \n   section 2604 of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981)\n\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2__. LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated, \n     and there are appropriated, out of any money in the Treasury \n     not otherwise appropriated--\n       (1) $400,000,000 (to remain available until expended) for \n     making payments under subsections (a) through (d) of section \n     2604 of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 \n     U.S.C. 8623); and\n       (2) $400,000,000 (to remain available until expended) for \n     making payments under section 2604(e) of the Low-Income Home \n     Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8623(e)), \n     notwithstanding the designation requirement of section \n     2602(e) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 8621(e)).\n       (b) Designation.--Any amount provided under subsection (a) \n     is designated as an emergency requirement and necessary to \n     meet emergency needs pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of \n     section 204 of S. Con. Res. 21 (110th Congress), the \n     concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by saying this amendment is \nbeing cosponsored by Senators Snowe, Collins, Obama, Cantwell, Sununu, \nMenendez, Stabenow, Clinton, Leahy, and Kerry. This amendment, which \nwould increase LIHEAP funding by $800 million, also has the support of \nthe National Energy Assistance Directors Association, the National Fuel \nFunds Network, the American Gas Association, the National Association \nof State Energy Officials, and many other groups.\n  This amendment is as simple and straightforward as it can be, and \nwhat it is about is that at a time when, as everybody knows, home \nheating prices are going through the roof, it is getting colder every \nday--it will be below zero in Vermont this week--this amendment would \nprovide real relief to millions of senior citizens on fixed incomes, \nlow-income families with children, and persons with disabilities.\n  Specifically, this amendment would provide $800 million emergency \nfunding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, otherwise \nknown as LIHEAP. Four hundred million dollars of this funding would be \ndistributed under the regular LIHEAP formula and the other $400 million \nwould be used under the contingency LIHEAP program.\n  Last month, I introduced the Keeping Americans Warm Act to provide $1 \nbillion in emergency LIHEAP funding. I am pleased that this bill has \ngarnered 26 cosponsors--19 Democrats, 6 Republicans, and 1 Independent.\n  In addition, as you know, on December 3, 38 Senators cosigned a \nletter spearheaded by Senator Jack Reed and Susan Collins to the Labor-\nHHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Harkin and Ranking \nMember Specter urging the appropriations committee to provide a total \nof $3.4 billion in LIHEAP funding.\n  As you know, there is a lot of discussion right now in seeing that \nthere be a substantial increase in LIHEAP funding in the economic \nstimulus bill that is being talked about, which I certainly support.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Subcommittee \nChairman Harkin, Ranking Member Specter, Appropriations Chairman Byrd, \nand Ranking Member Cochran for providing a total of $2.6 billion in \nfunding for LIHEAP in the Omnibus appropriations bill. I understand how \ndifficult it was to reach a deal on this bill. I appreciate everything \nSenator Byrd and others have done for LIHEAP to make sure people in our \ncountry do not go cold.\n  Unfortunately, this $2.6 billion in funding for LIHEAP, while an 18-\npercent increase from last year, is still 23 percent below what was \nprovided for LIHEAP just 2 years ago. And that 23-percent reduction is \nnot even adjusted for inflation. I am talking about nominal dollars.\n  Two years ago, as I think every American fully understands, the price \nof heating oil was less than $2.50 a gallon. Today, it is over $3.36 a \ngallon. In central Vermont, we have seen prices as high as $3.73 a \ngallon for heating oil. This winter, consumers are projected to pay \nover $1,800 to heat their homes with heating oil--$1,800 just to stay \nwarm this winter. This winter, it is projected that consumers will be \npaying over $1,600 to heat their homes with propane. Two years ago, \nthey only paid $1,281.\n  The skyrocketing prices are already stretching the household budgets \nof millions of families with children, senior citizens on fixed \nincomes, and persons with disabilities beyond the breaking point. I \ncannot tell you--I am sure the situation is not radically different in \nPennsylvania--how many people are telling me that when they see these \nheating bills, they cannot believe it. They just do not know how they \nare going to stay warm this winter.\n  Unfortunately, the spike in energy costs is completely eviscerating \nthe purchasing power of this extremely important program in State after \nState. If Congress does not act soon to confront this problem head-on--\nand this is a problem which is existing now and will get worse in late \nJanuary and in February--I fear for the public health and safety of \nmany of our most vulnerable citizens.\n  The point is, we have to act. We have to act. I support any and all \nefforts to\n\n[[Page S60]]\n\nexpand LIHEAP but, frankly, it will do less good if it is passed in \nMarch or in April than it will if it is passed in January and February. \nWe need to get the money out to people now so they do not go cold.\n  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, \ndue to insufficient funding, the average LIHEAP grant only pays for 18 \npercent of the total cost of heating a home with heating oil this \nwinter, 21 percent of residential propane costs, 41 percent of natural \ngas costs, and 43 percent of electricity costs this winter. What this \nmeans is that low-income families with kids, senior citizens on fixed \nincomes, and others will have to make up the remaining cost out of \ntheir own pockets. As you know, in this country we are looking at some \nvery rocky economic times. More and more people are unemployed. Poverty \nis going up. Where are those people going to get these large sums of \nmoney to stay warm this winter?\n  In addition, only 15 percent of eligible LIHEAP recipients currently \nreceive assistance with home heating bills. Eighty-five percent of \neligible low-income families with children, senior citizens on fixed \nincomes, and persons with disabilities do not receive any LIHEAP \nassistance whatsoever due to a lack of funding. There are many people \nall over this country who are eligible for this program who are unable \nto get the help they need. In my own State of Vermont, it has been \nreported that outrageously high home heating costs, oil costs, are \npushing families into homelessness. In fact, it is not uncommon for \nfamilies with two working parents to receive help from homeless \nshelters in the State of Vermont because they cannot afford anyplace \nelse to live during the winter.\n  This is a national energy emergency which is affecting States all \nover the country, certainly not just Vermont. On January 17, 1 day \nafter the President released $450 million in emergency LIHEAP funding, \nthe National Energy Assistance Directors Association testified in front \nof the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee chaired by \nSenator Kennedy. I very much appreciate his holding that hearing in \nBoston focusing national attention on this crisis. Here is what the \nnational energy directors reported. This is what they say:\n  In Arkansas, the number of families receiving LIHEAP assistance is \nexpected to be reduced by up to 20 percent from last year if they are \nnot able to get more funding. Arkansas, 20 percent reduction.\n  In Arizona, estimates are that they will have to cut the number of \nfamilies receiving LIHEAP assistance by 10,000 families as compared to \nlast year.\n  In Delaware, the number of families receiving LIHEAP assistance will \nbe reduced by up to 20 percent. In most instances, your average LIHEAP \ngrant only pays for about 20 percent of the total cost of heating a \nhome in Delaware.\n  During the winter in Iowa, the regular LIHEAP grant has been cut by 7 \npercent from last year. The average LIHEAP grant in Iowa is $300. Two \nyears ago, the average grant was $450.\n  The State of Kentucky can run out of LIHEAP funding as early as next \nFebruary.\n  In Maine, the average LIHEAP grant will only pay for about 2 to 3 \nweeks of home heating costs in most homes in that State, and I can tell \nyou that it stays cold for a lot longer than 2 or 3 weeks in Maine, in \nNew England.\n  In Massachusetts, the spike in energy costs means that the purchasing \ncosts for LIHEAP has declined by 39 percent since 2006.\n  The State of Minnesota can run out of LIHEAP funding as early as \nFebruary.\n  In New York, many households have already exhausted their entire \nLIHEAP funding.\n  While Ohio has seen a 10-percent increase in the number of people \napplying for LIHEAP assistance, that State will have to cut back its \nregular LIHEAP grant by between 15 to 20 percent.\n  Rhode Island, Texas, the State of Washington--on and on it goes. The \nbottom line is, home heating fuel costs are soaring, and LIHEAP does \nnot have enough money to take care of the needs of people in State \nafter State after State.\n  In the richest country on the face of the Earth, no family, no child, \nno senior citizen should be forced to go cold this winter. I am afraid \nthat unless we act, and act very quickly, that is exactly what will be \nhappening.\n  We hear a lot of talking about energy funding around here. Not every \npiece of legislation, in fact, is an emergency. This is an emergency. \nAs we speak tonight, people all over this country do not have enough \nmoney to stay warm. That situation will only get worse. We have to act, \nand we have to act now.\n  Let me again thank the many cosponsors of this legislation. It is \ncertainly bipartisan. There are cold people in Republican States, \nDemocratic States, Independent States. We have to act together, and we \nhave to move as rapidly as we can.\n  I am offering this amendment now on the Indian health bill. I will \noffer it at every opportunity I can. I look forward to working with the \nMembers of the Senate to see that we do the right thing so that no \nAmerican goes cold this winter.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I wish to discuss funding for the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program, commonly known as LIHEAP. LIHEAP \nis a Federal grant program that provides vital funding to help low-\nincome and elderly citizens meet their home energy needs.\n  Due to record-high oil costs, the situation for our neediest citizens \nis especially dire this winter. That is why I have sponsored Senator \nSanders' amendment to increase LIHEAP funding by $800 million.\n  Nationwide, over the last 4 years, the number of households receiving \nLIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4.6 million to about 5.8 \nmillion, but during this same period, Federal funding increased by only \n10 percent. The result is that the average grant declined from $349 to \n$305. In addition, since August 2007, crude oil prices quickly rose \nfrom around $60 a barrel to nearly $100 a barrel earlier this month, so \na grant buys less fuel today than it would have just 4 months ago. \nAccording to Maine's Office of Energy Independence and Security, the \naverage price of heating oil in our State is $3.30 per gallon, which is \n$1.09 higher than at this time last year.\n  This large, rapid increase, combined with less LIHEAP funding \navailable per family, imposes hardship on people who use home heating \noil to heat their homes. Low-income families and senior citizens living \non limited incomes in Maine and many other States face a crisis \nsituation in staying warm this winter.\n  The Sanders amendment would provide an additional $800 million as \nemergency funding for LIHEAP. The term ``emergency'' could not be more \naccurate. Our Nation is in a heating emergency this winter. Families \nare being forced to choose among paying for food, housing, prescription \ndrugs, and heat. No family should be forced to suffer through a severe \nwinter without adequate heat.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the Sanders proposal to provide \nvital home energy assistance for the most vulnerable of our citizens.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of \nreauthorizing the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, IHCIA, of which I \nam a cosponsor. Like many of my colleagues, I feel that passing this \nlegislation is long overdue. Since its enactment in 1976, the IHCIA has \nprovided the framework for carrying out our responsibility to provide \nNative Americans with adequate health care. As we know, the act has not \nbeen updated in more than 16 years, despite the growing need among \nNative Americans.\n  We cannot allow the health of Native Americans to remain in jeopardy \nfor yet another year. The reauthorization legislation is a major step \nin addressing the growing health disparities that Native Americans \nface. The act makes much needed changes to the way the Indian Health \nService, IHS, delivers health care to Native Americans and is the \nproduct of significant consultation and cooperation with Tribes and \nhealth care providers.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Dorgan and Vice Chair Murkowski for \ntheir leadership and for building on the momentum from the last \nCongress to reauthorize this act.\n  The IHCIA was last reauthorized in 1992. Now 16 years later, another \nreauthorization is necessary to modernize Indian health care services \nand delivery and improve the health status of\n\n[[Page S61]]\n\nNative American people to the highest level possible.\n  A September 2004 report released by the United States Commission on \nCivil Rights gives us a snapshot of the health crises Native Americans \nface. Native Americans are 770 percent more likely to die from \nalcoholism, 650 percent more likely to die from tuberculosis, 420 \npercent more likely to die from diabetes, 52 percent more likely to die \nfrom pneumonia or influenza, and 60 percent more likely to die of \nsuicide.\n  Also, according to the CDC, American Indians and Alaska Natives, AI/\nAN, also have the highest rate of suicide in the 15- to 24-year-old age \ngroup, and suicide is the second leading cause of death among Native \nAmerican youth aged 10 to 24. The overall rate of suicide for American \nIndians and Alaska Natives is 20.2 per 100,000, or approximately double \nthe rate for all other racial groups in the United States. Given these \ncircumstances, the life expectancy for Native Americans is 71 years of \nage, nearly 5 years less than the rest of the U.S population.\n  Many serious health issues affect our Native American population. \nYet, today, funding levels meet only 60 percent of demand for services \neach year, which requires IHS, tribal health facilities and \norganizations, and urban Indian clinics to ration care, resulting in \ntragic denials of needed services. Reauthorization of the act will \nfacilitate the modernization of the systems, such as prevention and \nbehavioral health programs for the approximately 1.8 million Native \nAmericans who rely upon the system. I sincerely hope that we can pass \nthis legislation and send it to the President for his signature.\n  Although this bill makes vast and necessary improvements upon current \nlaw, it is not perfect. In my home State of Oregon, as well as in many \nother States across the country, there is concern that the current bill \ncreates inequities among the tribes related to the distribution of \nhealth care facilities funding. Senator Cantwell and I intend to offer \nan amendment that we are hopeful can resolve this issue because, \nultimately we must ensure that all tribes are treated equitably.\n  The current priority system outlined in S. 1200 seems to favor health \nfacility construction in a few States and will harm Oregon's tribes as \nwell as many others across the country. Since the original bill was \ndrafted, the IHS and tribes have worked together to develop a new and \nmore equitable construction priority system that more fairly allocates \nfunds across Indian Country. This priority system includes the \ndevelopment of an area distribution methodology. This proposed \nmethodology would provide for a portion of facility construction funds \nto be used to build health facilities that are not part of the current \nfacilities priority system. Unfortunately, the language in S. 1200 does \nnot explicitly account for this agreement made between the tribes and \nIHS through the National Steering Committee. Many tribes in Oregon and \naround the country have never received any construction funding and are \nconcerned that the proposed language is outdated and will continue to \ncause their facilities to lose priority to the extent that it could be \n20 to 30 years until facility upgrades would occur.\n  I offered an amendment during the May 2007 Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs markup of S. 1200 that would have allowed for a portion of \nhealth facility construction funds to be distributed equitably among \nall of the IHS areas for local health facilities projects. I withdrew \nmy amendment because Chairman Dorgan assured me that he would work with \nme to find a suitable compromise before the bill went to the floor. \nSince then, I have been working with my colleagues and national tribal \norganizations to develop compromise language. Yet, given all of this \neffort, some Senators are unwilling to compromise.\n  Therefore, Senator Cantwell and I intend to offer our amendment which \nrepresents an appropriate middle ground for all tribes. I hope my \ncolleagues will vote in favor of this amendment, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with them to explore other creative ways to identify \napproaches that address everyone's interest and ensures that all Native \nAmerican Indians receive the health care they need and deserve.\n  I am pleased to see that the bill contains my legislation, the \nAmerican Indian Veteran Health Care Improvement Act. This legislation \nwould encourage collaborations between the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, \nresulting in greater access to health care services for American Indian \nand Alaska Native, veterans of federally recognized tribes. This \nlegislation also would ensure that these AI/AN veterans eligible for VA \nhealth care benefits delivered by IHS, an Indian tribe, or tribal \norganization will not be liable for any out of pocket expenses.\n  American Indians and Alaska Natives have a long history of exemplary \nmilitary service to the United States. They have volunteered to serve \nour country at a higher percentage in all of America's wars and \nconflicts than any other ethnic group on a per capita basis. As a \nresult, they have a wide range of combat related health care needs. AI/\nAN veterans may be eligible for health care from the Veterans Health \nAdministration, VHA, or from IHS or both. Despite this dual \neligibility, AI/AN veterans report the highest rate of unmet health \ncare needs among veterans and exhibit high rates of disease risk \nfactors.\n  On February 25, 2003, HHS and the VA entered into a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding, MOU, to encourage cooperation and resource sharing \nbetween IHS and the VHA. The goal of the MOU is to use the strengths \nand expertise of both organizations to increase access, deliver quality \nhealth care services, and enhance the health status of AI/AN veterans. \nThese collaborations are designed to improve communication between the \nagencies and tribal governments and to create opportunities to develop \nstrategies for sharing information services and technology. The \ntechnology sharing includes the VA's electronic medical record system, \nbar code medication administration, and telemedicine. Also, the VA and \nIHS cosponsor continuing medical training for their health care staffs. \nThe MOU encourages VA, tribal, and IHS programs to collaborate in \nnumerous ways at the local level. These services may include referrals \nfor specialty care at a VA facility, prescriptions offered by the VA, \nand testing not offered by IHS.\n  At the local level, many partnerships are being formed among IHS, the \nVA, and tribal governments to identify local needs and develop local \nsolutions. These may include outreach and enrollment for the VA's \nhealth system, initial screenings, and other health care services. The \nanticipated product of these collaborations is to ensure that quality \nhealth care is provided to all eligible AI/AN veterans.\n  In my State, the Portland VA Medical Center and the Portland Area \nOffice-IHS are working on a local MOU for the purpose of improving \naccess to VA health care services for eligible AI/AN veterans. The Warm \nSprings Confederated Tribes have been instrumental in developing this \nagreement based on the needs of AI veterans on the Warm Springs \nReservation. These veterans often are eligible for health benefits from \nboth the VA and IHS, and it is their intended purpose to make care more \nseamless, thereby improving access and quality.\n  In November 2001, President George W. Bush proclaimed National \nAmerican Indian Heritage Month by celebrating the role of the \nindigenous peoples of North America in shaping our Nation's history and \nculture. He said, ``American Indian and Alaska Native cultures have \nmade remarkable contributions to our national identity. Their unique \nspiritual, artistic, and literary contributions, together with their \nvibrant customs and celebrations, enliven and enrich our land.''\n  An important part of the overall contribution of AI/AN peoples to our \nNation is the part they play in protecting and preserving our freedoms. \nTheir contributions to our Armed Forces have been made throughout our \nhistory. I am hopeful that the VA and IHS will continue to work \ntogether to deliver health care services to our Nation's AI/AN veterans \nthat they so deserve. I look forward to hearing about more of these \npartnership projects, and to learn of their successes.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Native Americans have some of the highest \nsuicide rates in our Nation. That is why it is so critical that we \nincrease physical and mental health services to this population and, \nultimately, that we pass\n\n[[Page S62]]\n\nthis bill. I am proud to have cosponsored the telemental health \nlanguage in this bill. The bill would authorize a demonstration project \nto use telemental health services for suicide prevention and for the \ntreatment of Indian youth in Indian communities. The Indian Health \nService would carry out a 4-year demonstration program under which five \ntribes, tribal organizations or urban Indian organizations with \ntelehealth capabilities could use telemental health services in youth \nsuicide prevention and treatment.\n  I also would like to speak to my support of the Urban Indian Health \nProgram, UIHP. It constitutes only 1 percent of IHS's budget; however, \n34 UIH centers provide care for nearly 70 percent of the Native \nAmerican population residing in cities. According to the 2000 Census, \nnearly 70 percent of Americans identifying themselves as having \nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native heritage live in urban areas.\n  In my home State of Oregon, the Native American Rehabilitation \nAssociation of the Northwest, NARA, an urban Indian health provider, \nhas been in existence for over 37 years and provides education, \nphysical and mental health services, and substance abuse prevention and \ntreatment that is culturally appropriate to Native Americans and other \nvulnerable people. NARA is an Indian-owned and operated nonprofit urban \nIndian health clinic that annually serves over 4,000 people including \n257 tribes and bands, of which 25 percent are from Oregon. NARA's \nhealth clinic delivers health care services to tribal members from over \nhalf of the federally recognized tribes that reside in about 30 States. \nNotably, NARA is a grant recipient of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial \nAct, which it uses to serve Oregon's tribes.\n  The UIHP has been a fixture of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act \nsince its initial passage in 1976, principally serving urban Indian \ncommunities in those cities where the Federal Government relocated \nIndians during the 1960s and 1970s. Notably, the Federal Government \nrelocated thousands of tribal members to Portland at that time. \nAlthough the UIHP overwhelmingly serves citizens of federally \nrecognized tribes, it has the authority to serve other Native \nAmericans, largely those who have descended from the Federal \nrelocatees. S. 1200 provides a modest expansion of authority for the \nUIHP to engage in a wider array of health related programs, consistent \nwith the many changes that have occurred in health delivery in the \nUnited States since the IHCIA was last reauthorized 16 years ago.\n  Proposals to eliminate or even limit the UIHP within the IHS would \nhave far-reaching and devastating consequences. Urban Indian health \nclinics report that the elimination of Federal support would result in \nbankruptcies, lease defaults, elimination of services to tens of \nthousands of Indians who may not seek care elsewhere, an increase in \nthe health care disparity for American Indians and Alaska Natives, and \nthe near annihilation of a body of medical and cultural knowledge \naddressing the unique cultural and medical needs of the urban Indian \npopulation held almost exclusively by these programs. Notably, Urban \nIndian health clinics typically leverage IHS funding 2:1 from other \nsources.\n  Urban Indian health clinics provide unique and nonduplicable \nassistance to urban Indians who face extraordinary barriers to \naccessing mainstream health care. Many Native Americans are reluctant \nto go to health care providers who are unfamiliar with and insensitive \nto Native cultures. Urban Indian programs not only enjoy the confidence \nof their clients but also play a vital role in educating other health \ncare providers in the community to the unique needs and cultural \nconditions of the urban Indian population. Urban Indian health clinics \nalso save costs and improve medical care by getting urban Indians to \nseek medical attention earlier; Provide care to the large population of \nuninsured urban Indians who otherwise might go without care; and reduce \ncosts to other parts of the Indian Health Service system by reducing \ntheir patient load.\n  More than 30 years ago, President Ford saw the great need and had the \nwisdom to sign into law the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. His \nsignature was a promise made to American Indians that the Federal \nGovernment would work to improve their health status. That promise is \none that we must not back away from. Reauthorizing this act is a \nreaffirmation of that commitment and proves that we understand there is \nwork yet to be done to further improve Indian health.\n  Again, I am thankful to Chairman Dorgan and Vice Chair Murkowski for \ntheir leadership and for building on the momentum from the last \nCongress to reauthorize the act. I hope that we can swiftly resolve any \nremaining issues and get this long-overdue bill signed into law.\n  I would like to close my statement with a quote from Mourning Dove, \nthe literary name of Christine Quintasket, a Salish tribal woman from \nthe Pacific Northwest now recognized as the first Native American woman \nto publish a novel (1888-1936). ``Everything on the earth has a \npurpose, every disease an herb to cure it, and every person a mission . \n. . this is the Indian theory of existence.''\n  There are indeed cures and treatments for the maladies that \ndisproportionately afflict Native Americans: diabetes, alcoholism, and \nsuicide. The purpose and the mission of this bill is to connect those \ncures with those who need it the most--those who have sought it the \nlongest--and through chapters of our history, have a unique claim to \nthose cures and treatment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the Indian Health \nCare Improvement Act, which provides updated objectives and policy for \naddressing the health needs of American Indians.\n  By virtue of many treaties and agreements, the Federal Government has \na trust responsibility--an obligation--to provide a variety of basic \nneeds, including healthcare.\n  The Indian Health Care Service estimates that it provides about 60 \npercent of the health care that is needed in Indian Country: an amount \nthat is less than half of what we spend on the health care needs of \nFederal prisoners. Tribes with the resources, try to make up the \ndifference. In most cases, the result is an absence of health care.\n  In my State, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians has improved its \nhealth care and the overall health of its population over the last 30 \nyears. But the sad fact remains that health care on the reservation is \ninadequate.\n  For the 9,600 members of the tribe, there are four doctors. The \nhospital has 14 beds. The approximately $8 million the tribe spent last \nyear is simply not enough to cover the needs of the Choctaw's growing \npopulation.\n  According to Health Care Financing Review--Summer 2004, Volume 24, \nNumber 4--the national health care expenditure average cost per person \nper year was calculated at $5,440. Using the $5,440 estimate, the \nMississippi Band of Choctaw Indians Health Care System would need over \n$48 million dollars to cover the tribe's health care costs.\n  From fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2005, there was a 30.4 percent \nincrease in the number of patients from the Mississippi Band of Choctaw \nIndians who accessed the health care system. During that same time \nperiod there was a 41.4 percent increase in the number of ambulatory \nvisits.\n  According to the CDC, 7 percent of Americans have diabetes. In \ncomparison, 20.5 percent of Choctaws have diabetes, one of the highest \npercentages of any tribe in the country. From 2000 to 2005 there was a \n62.3 percent increase in the number of patients diagnosed with \ndiabetes.\n  My point in telling the Senate these examples is, with adequate \nhealth care, successful preventive care, appropriate facilities, and \nmore health care professionals, lives would be longer and general \nhealth would improve.\n  Statistics for other tribes are similar. Some include alarming \nincidences of suicide, high infant mortality rates, and practically \nnonexistent mental health care.\n  This bill includes provisions that promote better communication \nbetween tribes and the Indian Health Care Service, in order to ensure \neffective administration of the programs meant to assist the well-being \nof the American Indian population.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n[[Page S63]]\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I commend Senator Dorgan and the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs for their leadership on the long-overdue \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act, IHCIA, Amendments of 2007.\n  The historical treatment of Native Americans is a tarnished mark on \nAmerican history. Lawmakers must ensure that this Nation fulfills its \ntreaty obligations to Native Americans and address the injustices that \ncontinue to be suffered by the first Americans. I am committed to \nmaking sure that Native Americans are treated with respect, dignity, \nand equality both now and in the future and to ensure that promises \nmade by this great Nation are promises kept as well. As such, I believe \nit is this country's moral imperative to address the significant health \ndisparities between Native Americans and the American population as a \nwhole.\n  Diabetes is perhaps the most striking example of such health \ndisparities. American Indians have the highest rate of diabetes in the \nworld. The American Diabetes Association reports that American Indians \nand Alaska Natives are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with \ndiabetes as non-Hispanic Whites, and the death rate from diabetes is \nthree times higher among American Indians and Alaska Natives than the \nrate in the general U.S. population. Yet these statistical averages \nmask the fact that certain tribal populations are experiencing epidemic \nrates of diabetes. About half of adult Pima Indians, for example, have \ndiabetes. Even worse, on average, Pima Indians are only 36 years old \nwhen they develop diabetes, which contrasts to an average age of 60 \nyears for White diabetics.\n  Unfortunately, diabetes is not the only health condition that \ndisproportionately affects American Indians. Death rates from heart \ndisease and stroke are respectively 20 and 14 percent greater among \nAmerican Indians compared to the average U.S. population. We know the \ninfant mortality rate is 150 percent higher for Indian infants than \nWhite infants. The rate of suicide for Indians is 2\\1/2\\ times greater \nthan the national rate, and methamphetamine use has ravaged Indian \nreservations all across the country.\n  Urban Indians are not exempt from these dire health challenges. In \naddition to facing higher than average rates of chronic disease and \nmental health and substance abuse disorders, urban Indians experience \nserious difficulties accessing needed health care services. Given that \nover half of the Native American population no longer reside on \nreservations, our efforts to improve Indian health and health care must \ninclude explicit focus on the urban Indian population.\n  For these reasons, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act. Our tribal health care programs \nmust be modernized and prepared to provide preventive and chronic \ndisease health care services and to address other key issues such as \naccess and quality of care concerns. And these activities must be \nsupported while honoring the principle of tribal sovereignty.\n  The bill before us would enact much needed advancements in the scope \nand delivery of health care services to Native Americans. In \nparticular, it authorizes a host of new health services, makes crucial \norganizational improvements, and provides greater funding for \nfacilities construction. Through scholarships, investments in \nrecruitment activities, loan repayment programs, and grants to \ninstitutions of higher education, IHCIA also takes steps to help \nincrease the number of Native Americans entering the health services \nfield.\n  I am especially pleased that the bill addresses well-documented \nhealth problems affecting urban Indian communities as well. This \nproposal provides grants and increased aid for diabetes prevention and \ntreatment, community health programs, behavioral health training, \nschool health education programs, and youth drug abuse programs in \nurban areas.\n  I trust my colleagues will agree with me on the critical need to \naddress health disparities facing the Native American community. I urge \nthe Senate to act quickly to pass this bill.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. \n1200, the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, IHCIA, Amendments of \n2007. This bill would reauthorize the IHCIA, the statutory framework \nfor the Indian health system, which covers just about every aspect of \nNative American health care.\n  I would first like to acknowledge the hard work of Chairman Dorgan \nand my other colleagues on the Senate Indian Affairs Committee for \ntheir efforts to bring this important legislation to the floor. \nReauthorization of the IHCIA is critical to the lives of more than 2 \nmillion American Indians and Alaska Natives and is long overdue.\n  The IHCIA expired in 2000, and Indian tribes and health organizations \nhave been working diligently to see it reauthorized. Seven years ago, a \nsteering committee of tribal leaders, with extensive consultation by \nthe Indian Health Service, developed a broad consensus in Indian \nCountry about what needs to be done to improve and update health \nservices for Indian people. During the 109th Congress, we made \nsignificant progress towards passing a reauthorization bill. \nUnfortunately, the Senate was unable to complete work on that bill \nbefore adjourning last Congress.\n  I believe now as I did when I served as chairman of the Senate Indian \nAffairs Committee during the last Congress that reauthorizing our \nIndian health care programs is a top priority for us, and I hope that \nthe Senate will move a sound comprehensive bill through the legislative \nprocess as quickly as possible. However, there are some key and \ntroubling differences between the bill pending before the Senate and \nthe proposal I put forward at the end of the last Congress, S. 4122. In \nparticular, the new version contains language that would essentially \nauthorize the Indian Health Service to promote ``reproductive health \nand family planning'' services. As my colleagues know, I have had a \nlongstanding policy against promoting abortion as an acceptable form of \nbirth control, except in cases of rape and incest. I strongly believe \nthat society and government have a legitimate interested in protecting \nlife, born or unborn. Obviously, my thinking on this question applies \nto the unborn children of patients to the Indian Health Service. I \ncannot in good conscience support the promotion of abortions at \nFederally funded IHS facilities or any Federal facilities. I remain \nhopeful the bill will be modified to allow me to supports its swift \npassage.\n  I am, however, supportive of the majority of this bill which builds \nupon the principles of Indian self-determination. Over the years, \nIndian health care delivery has greatly expanded and tribes are taking \nover more health care services on the local level. It is our \nresponsibility to maintain support for these services and promote high \nstandards of quality health care for IHS and its partner units. Among \nthe items provided in this bill are provisions exploring options for \nlong-term care, governing children and senior issues. It also would \nprovide support for recruitment and retention purposes; access to \nhealth care, especially for Indian children and low-income Indians. \nFurther, it would provide more flexibility in facility construction \nprograms, consolidated behavioral health programs for more \ncomprehensive care, and would establish a Commission to study and \nrecommend the best means of providing Indian health care.\n  We must remember that nearly 30 years ago, Congress first enacted the \nIHCIA to meet the fundamental trust obligation of the United States to \nensure that comprehensive health care would be provided to American \nIndians and Alaska Natives. Yet the health status of Indian people \nremains much worse than that of other Americans. They have a shorter \naverage lifespan, higher infant mortality rate, and a much higher rate \nof diabetes than the national average. American Indians and Alaska \nNatives are 650 percent more likely to die of tuberculosis, 770 percent \nmore likely to die of alcoholism, and 60 percent more likely to die of \nsuicide. The suicide mortality rate among Indian youth is three times \nthat of the general population.\n  I have seen the hard reality of these statistics in the families of \nArizona tribes as well as tribes across the Nation. Methamphetamine \naddiction, diabetes, alcoholism, and heart disease are epidemics \ndevastating the Indian people. Our trust obligation dictates we address \nthese health crises on reservations, and I strongly support actions to \nthat effect. However, as I stated before,\n\n[[Page S64]]\n\nusing taxpayer money to promote abortion services is something I find \nhighly objectionable and will vehemently oppose. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support efforts to strike these unacceptable provisions \nand enable this bill, which is of critical importance to Indian \ncountry, to be approved.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, is the pending business S. 1200, the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act Amendments of 2007?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to speak to that legislation. The \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act is before the Senate today and \ntomorrow and hopefully will be completed, and we will be able to vote \non some amendments and finally get this legislation reauthorized \nbecause it is very long overdue and the need for its completion cannot \nbe underestimated.\n  I represent nine tribes in my State of South Dakota, and in any given \nyear, depending on the year we are talking about, as many as five of \nthose reservation counties in South Dakota will be in the top 10 \npoorest counties in America. These are areas in my State that are \nstruggling in so many different ways where many of the basic services \nthat those of us who live off the reservations expect on a daily basis \nare just not available.\n  One of the things that is desperately needed is access to health \ncare, making sure there is quality health care available to people on \nthe reservations.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act reauthorization has really \nbeen in the works since 1999-2000. I think the 106th Congress was the \nlast time this issue was debated. We have been trying since that time \nto get this bill on the floor and get it reauthorized. It is a critical \npiece of legislation that is so important to the people whom I \nrepresent and to tribes all across this country and to Native American \npeople.\n  To give an example of what I am talking about, in South Dakota, \nbetween 2000 and 2005, Native American infants were more than twice as \nlikely to die as White infants. Nationally, Native Americans are three \ntimes as likely to die from diabetes as compared to the rest of the \npopulation in the country.\n  In South Dakota, a recent survey found that 13 percent of Native \nAmericans suffered from diabetes. This is twice the rate of the general \npopulation in which only 6 percent are suffering from diabetes.\n  An individual who is served by IHS is 6.5 times more likely to suffer \nan alcohol-related death than the general population. An individual \nserved by an IHS facility is 50 percent more likely to commit suicide \nthan the general population.\n  I appreciate the time the Senate is taking to debate this bill and \nthe serious health issues this bill hopes to address and correct. I \nespecially thank the Indian Affairs Committee for working with me to \nhelp the Yankton Sioux Tribe of South Dakota keep the Wagner emergency \nroom open. Our delegation from South Dakota has been working for some \ntime in making sure that members of the Yankton Sioux Tribe have access \nto emergency room service 24 hours a day, which is critically \nimportant.\n  The committee was very helpful in making sure that issue was \naddressed in this authorization. I thank them for that help and \nappreciate their work in working with us to that end.\n  I also thank them for the work they have done to ensure that the \nUrban Indian Health Program remains a viable and helpful program for \nNative Americans who live off the reservation.\n  I am also a cosponsor of an amendment that has been offered by \nSenator Vitter. I reiterate my support for extending the Hyde language \nof this bill in preventing Federal funds being spent on abortions, \nexcept in cases where the life of the mother is at stake or in case of \nincest or rape.\n  I also reiterate my support for Senator Bingaman's amendment. I am a \ncosponsor of that amendment which will extend Medicare payment rates to \nall Medicare providers who accept IHS contracting agreements.\n  This amendment hopefully will stretch IHS contracting dollars even \nfurther and help reduce, even if it is only in a small way, some of the \nshortfalls that currently exist.\n  This legislation goes a long way in attempting to improve health care \nthroughout Indian country. However, we have to remember there is still \nmore, lots more, that we need to do, especially in the area of tribal \njustice and law enforcement in order to help improve the lives of \nindividuals who live on and near Indian reservations throughout the \ncountry.\n  Last year, I worked hard to improve tribal justice and law \nenforcement on Indian reservations, and I look forward to partnering \nwith my colleagues in the Senate to continue that fight this year to \nmake sure we have adequate law enforcement personnel, that we have an \nadequate number of prosecutors so that when crimes are committed, they \ncan be prosecuted. But we have to address these very fundamental issues \nif we are going to improve the quality of life for people on the \nreservations.\n  As I travel the reservations in South Dakota--and I was at the \nRosebud Indian Reservation just this last week--what strikes me is, \npeople on the reservations, just as those I represent who live off the \nreservations, want the same thing: They want a better life for their \nchildren, for their grandchildren, for future generations. They want to \nmake sure they have security and there is adequate law enforcement and \nthey do not have to live in fear when it comes to the issues of crime. \nThey want to make sure their children have access to quality education \nand a responsibility that many of us take very seriously, ensuring and \nseeing to it that young people, children on the reservation, have an \nopportunity to learn at the very fastest rate possible, to go through \nelementary and secondary school and then on to higher education if they \nchoose to.\n  A number of the tribal colleges we support in many cases suffer, \nagain, from a lack of funding. They also have to have basic health care \nservices, which is what this bill attempts to address. Whether it is in \nthe area of dental care, whether it is in the area of basic primary \ncare, speciality care, the IHS facilities on the reservations suffer \nfrom being unable to recruit and retain health care providers. Whether \nit is physicians or dentists--and that is an issue we face as well--we \nneed to make sure we have the right incentives in place to attract \nhealth care providers to serve in reservation areas.\n  This bill, as it is currently structured, I believe, will help to \naddress that very basic expectation that all people who live on \nreservations have, and that is, when they have a need, they will have \naccess to quality health care to address those needs.\n\n  This bill will be debated again tomorrow in the Senate, probably, I \nhope, voted on sometime tomorrow so that we can finally get this \nreauthorization bill through. It has been teed up for some time.\n  I appreciate the work the chairman, Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, \nand Senator Murkowski from Alaska, the ranking Republican, have done to \nbring this bill to the floor and, as I said before, to work with us on \nissues important to South Dakota.\n  I am also happy to cosponsor a couple of amendments that I hope can \nbe adopted--the Vitter amendment and, as I said earlier, the Bingaman \namendment, which will help make health care more available and take the \ndollars of the IHS and stretch them further when it comes to \ncontracting services.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote for this bill. This should \nbe a big bipartisan vote. If anybody cares seriously about improving \nthe quality of life on reservations in this country and addressing what \nare deep economic needs, it starts with some of these very basic \nservices. It starts with law enforcement security, it starts with \neducation, and it starts with health care, and I think this bill takes \nus a long way in the direction of dealing with the health care issues \nthat affect so many of our tribes in this country.\n\n[[Page S65]]\n\n  I hope my colleagues in a very big bipartisan way will vote for this \nlegislation, support it, and hopefully get it signed into law before \nthis year is out.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown).

Mr. President, tomorrow, the city of Chicago and Cook \nCounty, IL, will say goodbye to a legend.\n  John Stroger was born into poverty in Arkansas at the start of the \nGreat Depression. He lived to become the first African American ever \nelected president of the Board of Commissioners of Cook County, IL. He \nlived to be one of the most powerful politicians in my home State.\n  He died at 8 o'clock last Friday morning from complications of a \nstroke he suffered almost 2 years ago and from which he never fully \nrecovered.\n  John Stroger was 78 years old.\n  Mayor Daley confirmed the passing of John Stroger at a prayer \nbreakfast on that day when we were honoring Dr. Martin Luther King. \nWhat a fitting coincidence. Dr. King had told us:\n\n       Everybody can be great, because everyone can serve.\n\n  John Stroger spent his life serving.\n  John Stroger was a grandson of former slaves who believed in the \npromise of America and believed that government can and should be a \nforce for progress.\n  He was a man of compassion, integrity, great humor, and great \npolitical skill. He used all of those qualities to help others.\n  He spent his political life breaking down racial barriers and working \nto lift up those who were less fortunate. His lifelong commitment to \nserve those who struggle every day to find affordable, quality medical \ncare will certainly be his legacy.\n  Many years ago, John Stroger befriended me when I was an unknown \ncandidate from Springfield with a few friends in the Chicago political \nworld. For me, John Stroger was more than an ally. He was a great \nfriend.\n  He was also a man of strong opinions. Our mutual friend, Congressman \nDanny Davis of Illinois, once joked that John Stroger ``would argue \nwith a signpost.'' But he never held grudges. He was a real gentleman.\n  He was also a champion for working families and the poor. As Cook \nCounty board president from 1994 to 2006, John Stroger opened doors of \nopportunity in government and business for women and minorities and \nimproved the county's bond rating.\n  He made county government more responsive by changing the way \ncommissioners are elected.\n  He created a special domestic violence court.\n  And then there is the achievement of which he was probably most \nproud: the construction in the year 2002 of a state-of-the-art hospital \nto serve the poor, the uninsured, and the underserved of Cook County \nand the Chicagoland area.\n  At a time when public hospitals across America are having to turn \npeople away, John Stroger still believed that every person deserved the \ndignity and security of basic health care and lifesaving medicine.\n  The Chicago Sun Times noted:\n\n       John Stroger was so much larger than life they did not even \n     wait until he was dead to put his name on the Cook County \n     Hospital he defied the critics to build.\n\n  The John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County, IL, is just one way that \nthe legacy of this remarkable man will continue to serve the people and \ncity he loved for years to come.\n  Mr. President, I remember when John Stroger decided that this \nhospital was going to be built. There were scores of critics. Why in \nthe world would we want to build a hospital for poor people? John \nStroger knew the answer to that question. It was an answer from his \nheart: Because that is what America does. America cares for the poor. \nAmerica provides the poor in Cook County and all across our Nation with \nthe same kind of quality care that we all want for our families.\n  John Stroger knew that. His battle for that hospital ended up in one \nof the great success stories of public life in Illinois.\n  John Stroger was born in 1929 in Helena, AR--the oldest of four kids. \nHis father was a tailor, his mother worked as a maid. The family lived \nin a three-room shack with no electricity and no indoor plumbing.\n  John Stroger later described it for a Sun Times reporter when he \nsaid: ``We didn't have any boots, and we didn't have any straps.''\n  He graduated from Xavier College in New Orleans in 1952 with a degree \nin business administration. He was proud of Xavier to the last day I \never spoke to him. He always spoke with great pride about that college. \nHe moved back to Arkansas and spent a year teaching high school math \nand coaching basketball. When he came home one day, his mom had packed \na suitcase. She told him she had arranged for him to move to Chicago \nbecause there would be more opportunities for a young black man.\n  John Stroger had caught the political bug years earlier. After \nhearing a speaker in Arkansas say that the election of President Harry \nTruman would lead to full rights for African Americans, he had \norganized voters and tried to persuade them to pay the poll tax so they \ncould vote.\n  In Chicago, there was no poll tax, but there were other obstacles to \nfull political participation for African Americans in the 1950s. Over \nthe next four decades, John Stroger fought them all.\n  In 1968, he was named Democratic committeeman for South Side's Eighth \nward--the first African-American committeeman for that famous ward. Two \nyears later, John was elected to the Cook County Board. In 1994, he \nbecame board president. He was running for his fourth term in 2006 when \nhe suffered a stroke a week before the primary.\n  John was my friend. The last picture we had taken together was at the \nSt. Patrick's Day march, a legendary march in Chicago. There was John, \nwith his big smile and big green sash, standing next to me and Mayor \nDaley. I am going to treasure that photo. I think it was one of the \nlast taken of John as a candidate.\n  After he suffered a stroke, the Chicago Tribune ran an editorial that \nread, in part:\n\n       If John Stroger ever anticipated a career farewell, he \n     surely saw himself shaking hands with everyone--his allies, \n     his adversaries, the bypassers captivated if only for a \n     moment by one of the more genuine personalities in Chicago \n     politics.\n\n  The Tribune went on to write:\n\n       But he likely didn't anticipate a farewell. He wouldn't \n     have enjoyed those elaborate exercises in staged finality. \n     Politics and governance were his life; an intimate says the \n     prospect of retirement unnerved him. Even in this awkward \n     moment, we know he leaves public office just as he occupied \n     it: Without a grudge, without a complaint, and with precious \n     few regrets.\n\n  Those were the words of the Chicago Tribune, not always John \nStroger's political friend.\n  The mayor and Members of Congress and the city council and even a \nformer President of the United States have praised John Stroger's life \nand legacy these past days--and rightly so. But I think the eulogy John \nStroger would have liked best wasn't offered by a politician.\n  Clyde Black runs a shoeshine operation in the City Hall-County \nBuilding complex in Chicago. Years ago, John Stroger gave him a helping \nhand to start his little business. As word of President Stroger's death \nspread last Friday, Clyde Black told a reporter:\n\n       He changed my life--made me a better person. He's someone \n     we all dearly miss a lot.\n\n  It is a sentiment I and many others share.\n  I offer my deep condolences to President Stroger's family, especially \nhis wife Yonnie. What a wonderful woman, by his side throughout his \npolitical life\n\n[[Page S66]]\n\nand by his bedside as his illness lingered on for years; their daughter \nYonnie Clark; their son and my friend Cook County Board President Todd \nStroger, his family; and their two grandchildren. America and the State \nof Illinois have lost a great leader and I have lost a great friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S66-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S66]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNION LEAGUE CLUB OF CHICAGO\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Union League \nClub of Chicago and its Boys and Girls Clubs. This month they celebrate \nan important milestone.\n  The Union League Club of Chicago was founded in 1879, adopting the \nmotto ``commitment to country and community.'' Throughout its long and \ndistinguished history, the Union League Club of Chicago has maintained \na strong tradition of civic involvement. Over the years, Club members \nhave been a part of politics and society, advocating on issues ranging \nfrom election reform to the death penalty. The Union League Club of \nChicago also helped develop community support for cultural institutions \nas they were coming into the community, including Orchestra Hall, the \nField Museum, and the Harold Washington Library Center.\n  In 1920, recognizing a critical need in the community, the Union \nLeague Club of Chicago established the Union League Boys Club, a club \ndesigned to serve the large population of underprivileged children in \nChicago.\n  Today, the club opens the doors of its four Chicago area facilities \nto disadvantaged youth who are in communities with some Chicago's the \nlowest educational attainment levels and highest dropout and poverty \nrates. In addition to providing wholesome social and recreational \nopportunities, the Union League Boys and Girls Clubs offer a wide \nvariety of structured programs that emphasis character building and \nempowerment.\n  The clubs provide a safe and inviting refuge for young Chicagoans, \nfree from the negative influences of drugs, gangs, and violence. \nStudies have shown that afterschool programs, like those offered by the \nUnion League Boys and Girls Clubs, can reduce urban crime rates by \nkeeping teens off the streets and providing positive alternatives.\n  At each club, members are served balanced snacks and meals and given \nnutritional guidance they can use when not at the club. The clubs also \nprovide an environment in which students can tackle their homework, \nwith assistance when they need it and access to personal computers. Not \nsurprisingly, club members average significantly higher grade point \naverages than their peers.\n  A full-time professional staff, assisted by part-time workers and \nvolunteers, provides high school students with career guidance and job \ntraining to help young club members become responsible citizens. Each \nyear, the clubs award scholarships to help members pay for college or \ntrade school.\n  In the summer, members take advantage of the 250-acre summer camp \nowned by the clubs. Located a short distance north of the Illinois-\nWisconsin border, the camp gives Chicago youth an opportunity to \nexperience and enjoy the outdoors.\n  This month, the Union League Boys and Girls Clubs realize a \nremarkable achievement. For the first time in its 87-year history, the \nClubs will enroll the 10,000th member in a single program year.\n  Mr. President, I join the Chicago community in commending the Union \nLeague Club of Chicago and its Boys and Girls Clubs for outstanding \ncommitment to the welfare of the community and for enriching thousands \nof young lives--in the past, today, and for decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S66-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S66]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF GREG HARNESS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on January 31, 2008, the Senate Librarian, \nMr. Greg Harness, will retire. With his departure, we will lose a \ndedicated, loyal, and very important member of the Senate family.\n  The Senate Library is a fundamental part of the U.S. Senate. \nOperating under the direction of the Secretary of the Senate, the \nSenate Library serves as both a legislative and general reference \nlibrary, and provides a wide variety of information services to \nSenators and our staffs in a prompt and timely fashion. It maintains a \ncomprehensive collection of congressional and governmental publications \nand of materials relating to the specialized needs of the Senate.\n  The origins of this unique and important institution date back to \n1792, when the Senate directed the Secretary ``to procure and deposit \nin his office, the laws of the states, for the use of the Senate.'' The \nfirst Senate Librarian to be appointed was George S. Wagner, who \nofficially commenced his duties on July 1, 1871.\n  In 1997, Greg Harness became the 17th Senate Librarian. A native of \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Harness began work in the Senate Library on October \n20, 1975, as a reference librarian. He planned to work only a few years \nin Washington and then return to North Dakota to attend law school. \nFortunately, his plans changed.\n  Mr. Harness continued his employment in the Senate Library for the \nnext 32 years. As a reference librarian, Mr. Harness was a wonderful \nand pleasant person with whom to work. He undertook every request, no \nmatter how large or small, how urgent or demanding, whether from the \nmajority or the minority, and answered it effectively, professionally, \nand promptly. He always took that extra step to ensure that the Senator \nor his staff member received the best, the most accurate, and the most \nrecent information.\n  As the Senate Librarian, Mr. Harness directed the administrative and \nprofessional operations of the Senate Library. He oversaw the movement \nof the Library from the Capitol to the Russell Building in 1999 and \noversaw the design of the new Senate Library. More important, he \ncontinued that same cooperative, helpful attitude that he had always \ndisplayed as a reference librarian. As a result, he set a model of \nsuperior service for his entire staff.\n  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Harness \nfor his years of loyalty to the Senate, as well as his dedicated and \ndistinguished service. And, I want him to know that my staff and I will \ncertainly miss him. I wish him happiness and success as he enters the \nnext phase of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S66-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S66-S67]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL DONALD C. STORM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to honor a respected Kentuckian, \nMG Donald C. Storm, who has nobly served the United States and Kentucky \nfor 37 years.\n  In 1970, General Storm enlisted in the U.S. Army, serving with \nMilitary Assistance Command Vietnam. After 2 years of Active Duty, he \ncontinued to serve his country in the Kentucky National Guard. Years of \naccomplishment and experience earned General Storm the appointment to \nAdjutant General of the Kentucky National Guard by Governor Ernie \nFletcher in 2003. Regretfully, after 37 years of service and 4 years in \nthat post, General Storm has decided to retire. Because of his \ndignified and unwavering commitment to the citizens of this country and \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky, I stand to honor him today.\n  General Storm has served the Commonwealth and its citizens in superb \nways. He was an advocate for the destruction of marijuana, supporting \nthe Marijuana Eradication Program; he oversaw a recruitment program \nthat exceeded its goals; and finally, he was a true leader and \nsupporter of his troops. General Storm was known for his dedication to \nthe care of his soldiers and their families, celebrating with them in \ntimes of victory and mourning with them in times of loss.\n  Storm has clearly proved himself a man of honor and dignity who \nrepresents not only his country proudly but his State proudly. I wish \nGeneral Storm and his family much happiness after retirement, and I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in honoring General Storm for his dedication, \npatriotism, and willingness to give so much of himself for the good of \nhis country and his fellow Kentuckians.\n  Mr. President, recently the Lexington Herald-Leader published a story \nabout Major General Storm, ``Generally Speaking; Retiring Guard chief's \nmission: `Take care of the troops.''' I ask unanimous consent to have \nthe full article printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S67]]\n\n           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Jan. 13, 2008]\n\nGenerally Speaking; Retiring Guard Chief's Mission: ``Take Care of the \n                                Troops''\n\n                            (By Jim Warren)\n\n       Lexington, KY.--The pace of life is slower these days \n     around Donald Storm's Elizabethtown home.\n       No more dashing to catch planes for Iraq. No more late-\n     night phone calls about soldiers lost. No more need to put on \n     the uniform.\n       After a 37-year military career, Storm, the former Kentucky \n     adjutant general, is relearning civilian life.\n       Storm had hoped to be retained as adjutant general in the \n     new administration of Gov. Steve Beshear. But the governor \n     chose to replace him with Brig. Gen. Edward W. Tonini, 61, \n     former chief of staff for the Kentucky Air National Guard.\n       Storm could have elected to remain in uniform, but that \n     would have required him to move to another state guard \n     program with a slot for someone of his rank, or take a post \n     at the National Guard Bureau in Washington. But he chose \n     retirement, and respite from the stresses and strains of \n     commanding the Kentucky National Guard during its most \n     difficult period in more than 30 years.\n       Storm did not escape controversy during his tenure, but is \n     generally remembered for working hard to support the troops \n     he led.\n       During his watch, the Kentucky Guard sent thousands of \n     soldiers to Iraq and Afghanistan, losing troops in both \n     countries. It sent units to Louisiana to help in the recovery \n     from Hurricane Katrina, and dispatched about 1,000 soldiers \n     to help monitor the U.S.-Mexico border in Operation Jump \n     Start. Add peace-keeping duties in Bosnia, and Homeland \n     Security assignments, and about 9,400 Kentucky Army and Air \n     National Guard members were deployed over the course of \n     Storm's tenure--more than the entire membership of the state \n     guard when Storm became adjutant general.\n       Storm was the guard's chief of staff in December 2003, when \n     incoming Gov. Ernie Fletcher appointed him to be adjutant \n     general, succeeding D. Allen Youngman.\n       ``Little did I know then that I would face some of the \n     things I had to face,'' Storm said.\n       Sgt. Darrin Potter of Louisville, the first Kentucky \n     National Guard member lost in combat since Vietnam, had died \n     in Iraq about two months before Storm's promotion. Many \n     others would follow during the next four years. Officially, \n     15 Kentucky Guard members were lost in combat while Storm was \n     in command. He personally includes two others who were on \n     inactive guard status when they were killed while working for \n     private security firms in Iraq. Once a guard member, always a \n     guard member, Storm believes.\n       Today, he admits that losing soldiers was the one part of \n     his job he wasn't prepared for.\n       The period from March through September 2005 was \n     particularly bloody, for example, with six guard members \n     killed in action. That year also saw one of the Kentucky \n     Guard's proudest moments, as members of the Richmond-based \n     617th Military Police Company fought off a furious insurgent \n     attack on a convoy at Salman Pak on March 20, 2005. Three \n     unit members, including a woman, were awarded the Silver \n     Star. One of them, Sgt. Timothy Nein, later received the \n     Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest \n     military decoration.\n       But displays of undaunted courage could never offset the \n     pain of lost lives. Attending funerals and consoling the \n     families of lost soldiers became an all-too-common part of \n     Storm's job.\n       ``Sergeant Potter had died,'' he recalled, ``and then it \n     was just one right after another.''\n       It was particularly painful because Storm, through his many \n     years in the guard, personally knew many of those who were \n     lost.\n       ``I'm going to admit that it took a toll on me,'' Storm \n     said. ``I don't think I fully understood how much of a toll \n     it was at the time. But it was the toughest thing I ever went \n     through . . . the losses of these soldiers and the tremendous \n     sacrifices of their wonderful families. I just grieved with \n     all of them.''\n       Storm, a native of Laurel County, began his military career \n     as an enlisted man, serving in Vietnam in 1971-72. He never \n     planned to be a soldier--he says he just wanted to get a \n     college education--but he quickly found that he liked the \n     regimentation and the values of life in uniform. He joined \n     the Kentucky National Guard after his Army enlistment ended. \n     He was commissioned a first lieutenant in 1981, beginning a \n     steady rise through the ranks. By the time Storm took over \n     the top job, he had held virtually every major post in the \n     Kentucky Guard.\n       Storm sometimes sounds like a social philosopher when he \n     speaks on the importance of military service.\n       ``Military power,'' he says, ``is one of the four types of \n     power you must have to support a nation state--information \n     power, diplomatic power, economic power and military power. \n     The fifth common denominator is the will of the people.''\n       No one had to convince Storm that invading Afghanistan and \n     Iraq were the right things to do. He said he had seen the \n     plight of the common people in both lands and felt that \n     liberating them was a proper use of American force.\n       He admits that he didn't expect the war in Iraq to drag on \n     this long, though he says he knew it would be ``a long hard \n     road'' once the insurgency kicked into high gear in 2004. But \n     he says he was never discouraged, even when polls began to \n     show declining citizen support for the war.\n       ``I could see the light at the end of the tunnel, which was \n     something that our people here at home didn't have the \n     opportunity to see,'' he said. ``I knew that if we stayed the \n     course . . . that removing Saddam . . . would bode well for \n     free people and the other countries in that part of the \n     world.''\n       Storm says he personally saw off every Kentucky guard unit \n     as it left for the war zone except one (he was on his way to \n     Iraq himself at the time), and greeted every unit when it \n     came home. He made eight trips to Iraq, Afghanistan and \n     Kuwait to visit Kentucky troops and encourage them.\n       ``I tried to make it my business to meet as many of the \n     soldiers as I could, and let them know how much the people of \n     Kentucky appreciated their service,'' he said. ``You know, \n     it's not about generals. It's about soldiers and airmen.''\n       Storm, however, drew some fire in April 2005, after a \n     Kentucky Guard member in Iraq went public with complaints \n     that his unit was saddled with old, inadequately armored \n     trucks. It happened shortly after a Kentucky guardsman died \n     when a roadside bomb detonated near his vehicle. Storm \n     responded that he didn't agree with the soldier going outside \n     channels to raise a complaint, but that he would work to get \n     better equipment for Guard units in Iraq.\n       The adjutant general found himself in hot water again in \n     March 2007, after an usual appearance in the State Senate, \n     where he made a last-minute appeal in support of an income-\n     tax break for Kentucky military personnel that was stuck in \n     the State House. Some House leaders, including Speaker Jody \n     Richards, attacked Storm's comments as a ``shameless, \n     partisan diatribe.'' The Louisville Courier-Journal ran an \n     editorial saying Storm should be replaced as adjutant \n     general.\n       Storm maintains that his ``whole deal'' always was ``to \n     take care of the troops.''\n       Nowadays, he believes the work and sacrifices of the \n     soldiers in Iraq are beginning to pay off. He sees the \n     decline in violence since last summer as proof that ``we have \n     turned the corner.'' The question, he says, is whether the \n     improvement can be sustained as U.S. troops sent over for the \n     ``surge'' start returning home in coming weeks.\n       ``I pray that we can sustain this,'' he said. ``You never \n     know in that part of the world because there are so many \n     factions to deal with.\n       ``But, boy, it sure does look great now. And if we can pull \n     it off, it would be one of the greatest accomplishments ever \n     for world peace . . . because the enemy we face is real. They \n     want to destroy the western world and all the freedoms we \n     enjoy.''\n       Storm won't be in uniform to see the victory he hopes for. \n     But he says the biggest thing he will miss is simply serving \n     in the Kentucky National Guard.\n       ``The Kentucky National Guard is probably the best Guard \n     unit in America,'' he says. ``That's what some three- and \n     four-star generals will tell you. And it's because of all \n     these great Kentuckians who have stood up, particularly after \n     9/11, to serve the State and the Nation. I'm so proud of the \n     way they answered the call.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S67-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S67-S75]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON FOREIGN TRAVEL TO THE UNITED KINGDOM, ISRAEL, PAKISTAN, \n                  JORDAN, SYRIA, AUSTRIA, AND BELGIUM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise to comment about a trip which I \nmade over the recess during the period from December 22 of last year to \nJanuary 4 of this year on travels which I undertook with visits to the \nUnited Kingdom, Israel, Pakistan, Jordan, Syria, Austria, and Belgium.\n  The stop which Congressman Patrick Kennedy and I made in Pakistan was \nan extraordinary visit, a shocking visit, and a visit at a time of \ngreat tragedy.\n  On Thursday, December 27, Congressman Kennedy and I were scheduled to \nmeet with Benazir Bhutto in Islamabad. She had set the meeting for 9 \np.m., at the end of a busy day of campaigning. While we were preparing \nto go that night to an earlier dinner with the President of Pakistan, \nPresident Musharraf, and then plans to go on to meet with Benazir \nBhutto, we were informed, within 2 hours of our planned meeting with \nMs. Bhutto, that she had been brutally assassinated. It was obviously a \ngreat shock, a great loss to Pakistan, obviously, a great loss to her \nfamily, and really a loss to the world because she had the unique \npotential to unite Pakistan and to provide leadership in a very \ntroubled country.\n  Pakistan has nuclear weapons, and it is an ongoing matter of concern \nas to whether those nuclear weapons are being adequately protected. \nPresident Musharraf assured us that they were. So did the Chairman of \nthe Joint\n\n[[Page S68]]\n\nChiefs of Staff. And we accept those assurances. But with Pakistan in a \ncondition with militants there, there is always the worry and concern, \nand it would be reassuring, comforting, if there can be political \nstability in Pakistan. It is our hope that will occur with the oncoming \nelections.\n  But whether Benazir Bhutto would have emerged as Prime Minister, as \nthe leader, remained to be seen. But certainly she had extraordinary \npotential. Those who have seen her on television know she was a movie \nstar, beautiful, charismatic, and beyond those features, a great \nintellect, educated in the United States, at Radcliffe, of course, at \nHarvard, Oxford--a real intellectual and a real leader in the political \nsphere. Her father had been Prime Minister. She had been Prime \nMinister.\n  I had the opportunity to meet her some 20 years ago when my wife and \nI visited her at her family home in Karachi. She was a very disarming \nyoung woman. When I took some pictures of her, she asked if I would \nsend her copies. She said nobody ever sent her copies of pictures which \nwere taken. I was surprised, really sort of amused, because she was on \nthe cover of People magazine at that time. You only had to pick up most \nany magazine on the stands and find a picture of a glamorous, \nbeautiful, talented Benazir Bhutto.\n  I visited her when she was Prime Minister in Islamabad in 1995. I \ndiscussed with her the possibility at that time of having the \nsubcontinent nuclear free. Senator Hank Brown and I carried a message \nfrom the Prime Minister of India, Prime Minister Singh at that time, to \nhave the subcontinent nuclear free. Then I had seen her from time to \ntime in Washington. Beyond any doubt, she had the power to and the \npotential to be a great leader in Pakistan and the great potential to \nbe a stabilizing force.\n  I learned after she was assassinated, according to members of her own \nparty, that she had planned to give Congressman Kennedy and me some \ndocumentation about the likelihood of vote fraud. I have sought \ninformation on those matters.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my statement, the \nfull text of a lengthy 40-page report be printed in the Record, \ntogether with copies of the letters which I have sent to her family and \nto her political allies making inquiries about the information on vote \nfraud which reportedly she was interested in turning over to \nCongressman Kennedy and me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. With the assassination of Ms. Bhutto, it seems to me \nthere is a need for an international investigation. By letter dated \nJanuary 2, before returning to the United States, I wrote a letter to \nthe Secretary General of the United Nations urging that there be an \ninternational investigation because of the obvious concerns as to \nwhether security was involved or the kinds of conspiratorial theories \nwhich arise, whether there is any basis for them.\n  President Musharraf of Pakistan had asked for assistance from \nScotland Yard. My own view is that was insufficient because Pakistan \nwould retain control of the investigation, but that would certainly be \na step in the right direction.\n  I supplemented that letter to the Secretary General on January 17, \n2008, with a suggestion that the United Nations put into operation a \nstanding commission to investigate international assassinations. The \nimportance of immediate action and investigation is well known--to get \nto the scene, to preserve the evidence to the maximum extent possible, \nand to question witnesses while their memories are fresh and before \nthey are potentially intimidated. Some of the doctors who attended \nBenazir Bhutto reported they had been told not to talk to the media. I \nthink these ideas are ideas which are worth pursuing.\n\n  The composition of the standing commission would have to be very \ncarefully thought through. There would obviously be exemptions for \nnations which are capable of carrying on an investigation with the \ntechnical expertise and which would have the confidence of the public, \nbut I think this is an issue which ought to be undertaken. The \nWiesenthal Institute has published the idea, full-page ads in the New \nYork Times, that assassination ought to be classified as a crime \nagainst humanity. That, too, is an idea, in my opinion, which ought to \nbe pursued. But the lessons learned and the pain and suffering which \ncomes from the assassination of a great leader such as Ms. Bhutto ought \nto be studied. We ought to look to the future to be sure that where \nthere are recurrences--and regrettably, it is highly likely there will \nbe recurrences--that we profit by that experience.\n  In addition to traveling to Pakistan, Congressman Kennedy and I \nvisited in Israel and in Syria. We talked to Prime Minister Olmert in \nIsrael. We talked to President Bashar al-Asad in Syria. Both are \nnational leaders and both expressed a desire to have a peace treaty. It \nis very difficult to assess the possibilities by talking, even with the \nprobing questions, because it depends so much on a matter of trust. But \nI think it is worth noting that back-channel negotiations have been \nundertaken. A report has appeared in the Arabic press and specified in \nmy written statement but has not appeared, to my knowledge, in the \nAmerican press. We do know Israel and Syria came very close to an \nagreement in 1995, until Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated, and \nthen again brokered by President Clinton near the end of his term in \n2000. They came very close to an agreement, when it was reported that \nSyrian President Hafez al-Asad was more concerned with the succession \nof his son than in completing the treaty. Only Israel can decide \nwhether it is in Israel's interest to give up the Golan, which is the \ncentral issue.\n  But warfare is very different now than it was in 1967, when Israel \ntook the Golan Heights. The rockets are impervious to elevated spots \nsuch as the Golan, and it is a very different strategic concern. But as \nPrime Minister Olmert commented--and I quoted him in the written \nstatement--there are very material advantages which could come if Syria \nwould stop supporting Hamas. It would promote the possibilities of a \ntreaty between Palestinian President Abbas and Israel. If Syria would \nstop supporting Hezbollah and destabilizing Lebanon, there could be a \ngreat advantage. Such a treaty would have the potential of driving a \nwedge between Syria and Iran which would be of value.\n  That is a very brief statement of the extensive written report which \nI have filed, and I appreciate it being printed in the Record, at the \nconclusion of my statement. I thank the managers of the pending bill \nfor yielding this time, and I conclude my statement by yielding the \nfloor.\n\n                                Exhibit 1\n\n                   Statement of Senator Arlen Specter\n\n\n   report on foreign travel to the united kingdom, israel, pakistan, \n                   jordan, syria, austria and belgium\n\n       Mr. President, as is my custom from returning abroad, I \n     have sought recognition to report on the recent trip I made \n     overseas from December 22, 2007 to January 4, 2008.\n\n\n                             united kingdom\n\n       On the morning of December 23, the delegation which \n     included my wife Joan, Representative Patrick Kennedy, \n     Christopher Bradish, a member of my staff, Colonel Gregg \n     Olson, our escort officer and Captain Ron Smith, our doctor \n     and me, departed from Washington Dulles International Airport \n     for London, England. After a flight of just over 7 hours, we \n     arrived at London Heathrow Airport. The following morning we \n     departed for Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\n\n                                 israel\n\n       We arrived in Tel Aviv on the evening of December 24. We \n     were greeted at the airport by Rachel Smith our control \n     officer from the embassy.\n       The following morning, I was briefed by DCM Luis Moreno and \n     Political Counsel Marc Sievers on the latest developments in \n     the region. The country team stressed that, prior to the \n     Annapolis conference, tension in the region was high. The \n     team informed us that Prime Minister Olmert and President \n     Mahmoud Abbas have good chemistry and that the leaders remain \n     optimistic that an agreement can be reached in 2008. We \n     discussed some of the prevalent matters in the region \n     including the situation in the Gaza strip, the dynamic \n     between Fatah and Hamas, the Paris conference, the security \n     situation in Israel and the political outlook for the region. \n     Following the briefing, we departed for a meeting with \n     Israeli President Shimon Peres.\n       Having traveled to Israel 25 times during my tenure, I had \n     come to know many of Israel's leaders including President \n     Shimon Peres. I asked the President for his thoughts on how \n     to break the cycle of violence and hate that reigns in the \n     region. He provided\n\n[[Page S69]]\n\n     his candid assessment of the prospects for peace but stressed \n     that nothing can be solved without cooperation, a strong \n     commitment to economic improvement which entails the creation \n     of jobs in addition to aid money and the tangible benefits of \n     changing the economic situation and the impact that has on \n     changing people's lives. President Peres stated it was \n     critical to support Abu Mazen and develop the West Bank.\n       I asked Peres on the prospects for future dealings with \n     Syria. The President said Syria should make a choice: Lebanon \n     or the Golan. If they meddle in Lebanon, the Israeli's will \n     not discuss Golan and that all other issues are secondary.\n       I pressed President Peres on Iran and what he thought \n     should be done. He stated that the U.S. needs a united, \n     coherent policy to combat President Ahmadinejad's policy of \n     enriching uranium. He complimented President Bush in showing \n     courage, but that the capacity to build a coalition was \n     absent. Peres did not express great alarm about Iran as he \n     believes that the world will not allow the Islamic Republic \n     to acquire nuclear weapons. I asked if there were any lessons \n     from our diplomatic engagement with North Korea to which he \n     responded by highlighting the benefits of diplomatic and \n     economic efforts.\n       I mentioned to Peres that we would be traveling to Pakistan \n     and solicited his thoughts. He believes that religious \n     fanatics in the region are a massive problem for the \n     government and that the U.S. should not force Pakistan and \n     its leaders to be an American democracy--a theme that would \n     continue in our meetings in Pakistan. He did not believe that \n     the situation between Pakistan and India would lead to war \n     but that it is imperative that Pakistan secure its nuclear \n     arsenal--something with which I strongly agree.\n       President Peres suggested that oil is our great enemy: It \n     finances terror, makes a mockery of democracy, negatively \n     impacts the environment, and undercuts ideological \n     foundations. He called for increased efforts to pursue \n     alternatives to fossil fuels.\n       When asked about his view on our engagement in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan, Peres stated that we have no choice but to \n     combat radical extremism and those who think modernity will \n     end. He elevated the struggle to one of those in the modern \n     world versus those who are not able to deal with the fact \n     that science has replaced them. He pointed to the fact that \n     you cannot find an Israeli hospital without an Arab doctor. \n     And even an Israeli who will not hire an Arab has no problem \n     with one operating on him with a knife.\n       When discussing our bilateral relationship, Peres said: \n     ``The less we need America, the more friendly our relations \n     will become.'' President Peres ended the meeting by extending \n     an invitation for us to come back to Israel for the sixtieth \n     anniversary of Israel. We left the President's office for our \n     next meeting at the Knesset with former Prime Minister and \n     Likud party leader, Benjamin Netanyahu.\n       The focus of our discussion with Netanyahu and Zarman \n     Shoval centered on Iran. He expressed his support for \n     continued economic pressure in the form of sanctions and \n     pension fund divestment. He reported that U.S. states \n     divesting from companies, mostly European, doing business \n     with Iran is having an impact. Netanyahu concluded that \n     Iran's building of long range weapon platforms and its \n     increased centrifuge activities leaves it with very little \n     left to do to obtain a nuclear weapon. A theme in my \n     discussions with Israeli officials, in Washington, DC and \n     Israel, is that our Nations don't differ on the facts but we \n     do differ on the interpretation. He was not convinced that \n     Iran halted its program and more importantly that we do not \n     know if Iran restarted its efforts.\n       In addition to talking about unilateral actions, Netanyahu \n     recommended that we work with the Europeans and form a \n     unified front with Russia. He stressed the importance of \n     ``turning back the momentum'' domestically and \n     internationally to combat Iran.\n       I asked Netanyahu what can be done to break the cycle of \n     violence and hatred. He said this is a battle between \n     modernity/globalization and militant Islam and that this \n     ``culture of death'' with nuclear weapons could lead to \n     catastrophe. Militant Islam, according to Netanyahu, works by \n     brainwashing individuals. The information and economic \n     revolution could be the best weapon against this ideology as \n     a form of combating brainwashing. Following our meeting with \n     Netanyahu, we departed for a meeting with Former Prime \n     Minister and current Defense Minister, Ehud Barak.\n       I had met with Barak when he was in Washington, DC \n     attending the Annapolis conference. He provided me an update \n     on Israeli security service actions and intelligence gained \n     since we last spoke. I asked the Defense Minister to provide \n     his views on breaking the cycle of violence and hatred and \n     his outlook for the region. Barak believes that we cannot \n     reshape but can guide and offer a path of more opportunity. \n     He expressed his support for strengthening moderates like Abu \n     Mazen and Salaam Fayyad and that he is more optimistic \n     dealing with these leaders than he was when serving as Prime \n     Minister dealing with Yasser Arafat. I asked him about coming \n     close to an agreement in 2000 with Chairman Arafat. Barak \n     said the gap may have been narrow, but it was very deep.\n       When asked about Lebanon and Syria, Barak said Syria \n     continues to destabilize Lebanon. He pointed to the recent \n     assassination of Francois El-Hajj, who was expected to be \n     Lebanon's new Army commander in chief should General Michel \n     Suleiman take over as President. Barak believes that Syria \n     would not stand to see the deputy elevated and that Syria \n     wants a government that will request the U.N. to halt its \n     investigation in the Hariri assassination--an attack that \n     some suspect was orchestrated by Syria. When I asked Barak \n     about his peace efforts while serving as Prime Minister with \n     Syria, he indicated that there was an opportunity, but Hafez \n     Assad was more concerned about his son's succession than \n     peace.\n       On Iran, Minister Barak reiterated that the information \n     between U.S. and Israeli intelligence is 95 percent the same, \n     but that different interpretations persist. Barak expressed \n     concern over Iran's hidden program and that they are not \n     likely to cooperate. I asked about getting Russia to assist \n     and President Putin's offer to handle part of Iran's fuel \n     cycle. Barak stated that Russia wants to see the U.S. \n     squeezed right now but that we must engage China and Russia \n     if we want to have success on this front. We departed the \n     Knesset for our next meeting with President Mahmoud Abbas and \n     Salaam Fayyad in the West Bank.\n       On Christmas Eve, we loaded in our convoy bound for \n     Bethlehem in the Palestinian-controlled West Bank. Security \n     was tight as we left Jerusalem and entered the West Bank with \n     security personnel lining both sides of the street every 100 \n     yards. Upon arrival we were greeted by Salaam Fayyad, the \n     well-respected, western-educated finance minster, with whom \n     I've had a relationship for some years. I asked Abu Mazen \n     about the status of talks and prospects for peace. He shared \n     his optimism and informed me that he would be meeting with \n     Prime Minister Olmert in two days. He described 2008 as \n     precious and that he will work with the Israelis to reach a \n     deal. He expressed his concern over Israeli settlement \n     activities and the negative impact this could have on the \n     process.\n       President Abbas informed the delegation that Hamas' \n     popularity was subsiding but that they are still receiving \n     assistance through tunnels and border crossings. Should these \n     not be blocked, money and weaponry still can flow to Gaza. \n     While this type of activity harms the process, he indicated \n     that humanitarian aid must flow to Palestinians residing in \n     the West Bank.\n       The delegation pressed Abu Mazen about anti-Israeli \n     Palestinian decrees and expressed that these are not \n     acceptable. The President responded emphatically by saying, \n     ``I am the head of the PLO, I am the head of Fatah and I am \n     recognizing Israel and we want peace.''\n       Congressman Kennedy asked President Abbas about comparisons \n     to the successful peace talks in Ireland and the prospects \n     for transferring some of the mechanisms employed to the \n     Middle East. Abu Mazen said there are elements that can be \n     utilized especially in the arena of people to people \n     programs.\n       Salaam Fayyad shared his gratitude for the pledges made in \n     Paris and informed us that debt is being paid and the economy \n     showing signs of improvement. He cited that hotel occupancy \n     rate is near 100 percent which is up from 5-10 percent \n     earlier this year. He expressed his desire for implementing \n     larger infrastructure projects and a reduction in Israeli \n     restrictions, such as check points, which hinder businesses. \n     We concluded our meeting and returned to Jerusalem.\n       On December 25, we had a morning meeting with Prime \n     Minister Ehud Olmert. The Prime Minister requested I brief \n     him on developments in the United States and our views \n     towards the region. Olmert asked about the U.S. role in \n     moving forward with Syria and if anything can be done given \n     their meddling in Lebanon. I told him I thought there is a \n     chance based on the progress made in 1995 and 2000. I told \n     him of my discussions in Washington, DC with Syrian officials \n     and that they expressed their interest in talks. I told him I \n     thought that the status of the Golan Heights would be the \n     crux of the negotiations.\n       Olmert told me he is prepared to negotiate with Syria but \n     that it is a long process that needs to mature and that Syria \n     must deliver, not just talk. I pressed Olmert about what \n     actions he had taken and who would make the first move. I \n     reminded Olmert that Henry Kissinger said it took 34 \n     negotiating sessions with Hafez Al-Assad to get an agreement.\n       Prime Minister Olmert said the National Intelligence \n     Estimate on Iran was not helpful in efforts to combat Iran's \n     suspected nuclear weapons program. When asked if he thought \n     they stopped in 2003, Olmert replied, ``I don't know.'' He \n     expressed his hope that U.S. intelligence based its findings \n     on solid facts.\n       Olmert, like Netanyahu, stated that if they have enough \n     uranium they can do everything else needed to make a weapon \n     in short order. Nevertheless, Olmert stated that we must \n     carry on impressing upon Iran to change their course.\n       I requested specifics on how to confine Iran's nuclear \n     weapons program to which Olmert cited the usefulness of \n     economic pressure such as sanctions. He expressed displeasure \n     that the debate has been confined to two options: Military \n     action or acquiescence. The Prime Minister said he will raise \n     alternatives with President Bush during his January 2008 \n     visit.\n       Representative Kennedy asked Olmert about the Gaza-Hamas-\n     Egypt nexus and the\n\n[[Page S70]]\n\n     problems associated with smuggling. Olmert confirmed that the \n     movement of money, weapons, to include anti-tank and anti-air \n     missiles, and terrorists across the Philadelphia line is a \n     major concern. He indicated displeasure with Egyptian \n     acquiescence on this front and said that he had raised his \n     concerns with President Mubarak and that he would be \n     dispatching Defense Minister Barak to Egypt the following day \n     to follow up on these issues.\n       I asked the Prime Minister about the reported ``offer'' \n     from Hamas for a ceasefire. Olmert said that no offer was \n     made, but rather a journalist reported receiving a call from \n     Hamas indicating an interest and that the media subsequently \n     played it up. He questions the logic of negotiating with \n     Hamas as all it would do is provide Hamas an opportunity to \n     re-arm and Israel would get nothing. He made clear his stance \n     that he is not inclined to negotiate with a group who wants \n     to kill Israelis and refuses to recognize the state.\n       On the Israeli-Palestinian track, Olmert stated that Abbas \n     and Fayyad recognize Israel and want to make peace and are \n     serious, committed partners. When we discussed breaking the \n     cycle of violence and hate in the region, Olmert pointed to \n     Abbas as an example as someone who changed, became a \n     legitimate political leader and sees things differently than \n     he did 30 years ago. However, the question if the two sides \n     can agree on outstanding issues in unknown. He believes \n     reaching an agreement in 2008 is possible but that \n     implementation would take more time.\n       I pressed the Prime Minister about the settlements \n     controversy raised in the media and directly by the \n     Palestinians. He explained that he has established a complete \n     moratorium on new settlements, but that Israel can build on \n     plans previously approved at current sites. We departed the \n     Prime Minister's office for our next meeting with Foreign \n     Minister Tzipi Livni.\n       I called on Tzipi Livni to get her perspective on the \n     Israeli-Palestinian track, Syrian-Israeli track and broader \n     regional matters. Livni believes Abu Mazen and Salaam Fayyad \n     are sincere in their goals for peace and in refraining from \n     using terrorism. She supports the approach of strengthening \n     pragmatic Palestinians like Abbas and Fayyad. She went so far \n     as to say that Salaam Fayyad is a determined person in this \n     process and has exhibited real courage.\n       I asked the Foreign Minister about economic development for \n     the Palestinians and the strategy to elevate their situation. \n     She said development was important but that we should not \n     look to it as the sole source to bring about change. Minister \n     Livni stated that Israel cannot afford another terrorist \n     state, a real partner in peace must be found and the only way \n     to achieve a Palestinian state is through negotiations, not \n     terror. She appreciated the rights of Palestinians and the \n     impacts of security measures, but stated that Israelis have a \n     right not to live in fear and endure terror.\n       That afternoon, the delegation met with Saeb Erekat, the \n     Palestinian's chief negotiator. I had met with Saeb in the \n     past and found him to be an intelligent and insightful player \n     on understanding the conflict.\n       Saeb informed me that the Israelis and Palestinians have \n     ``matured'' and that there is a genuine need for the peace \n     process. He expressed his view that the sides are in \n     agreement on 70 percent of what a pact would entail but that \n     no outside country can finalize a deal--it must be done by \n     the Israelis and Palestinians--it must be done by Olmert and \n     Abbas.\n       Saeb and I talked about the broader Middle East and \n     regional conflicts. He believes that democracy in the Middle \n     East will defeat Al Qaeda and if negotiations between Israel \n     and the Palestinians fail, Osama bin Laden wins. He expressed \n     his optimism that a deal can be reached in 2008 and that both \n     sides are prepared for peace. He stated that there needs to \n     be a package deal and both sides know exactly what the \n     other wants--Israel wants no refugees and security and the \n     Palestinians want Jerusalem and land.\n       On the issue of Iran, Saeb said that Iranian nationalism \n     cannot be overlooked when approaching Tehran. He expressed \n     frustration over anti-Israeli comments made by President \n     Ahmadinejad: ``When he says he wants Israel off the map, he \n     is killing me!'' He cannot comprehend why Iran would support \n     Hamas in Gaza and pointed out that Abu Mazen has been invited \n     to Tehran nine times and never responded. He suggested that \n     Iran wants a deal and is willing to make one with the U.S. or \n     international community.\n       Saeb closed by indicating that progress on the Syrian-\n     Israeli track would be beneficial to the Palestinian-Israeli \n     track. The following morning we drove from Jerusalem to Tel \n     Aviv en route to Pakistan.\n\n\n                                pakistan\n\n       We landed in Islamabad, Pakistan on the night of Wednesday, \n     December 26 and were met by our control officer Jason \n     Jeffreys.\n       The following morning, we met with Hamid Karzai, President \n     of Afghanistan, in his hotel room. President Karzai was in \n     Islamabad for officials meetings. President Karzai stated \n     that U.S. efforts in Afghanistan are working, roads are being \n     built, economies are being turned around and schools are \n     improving.\n       I pressed President Karzai on the prospects for victory \n     over the Taliban and Al Qaeda. He stated that he and \n     President Musharraf had focused on this issue in their \n     meeting earlier and that it was a priority. Karzai stated \n     that the Taliban is not a long term threat in Afghanistan as \n     they have no popular support. The President stated that more \n     must be done to address the sanctuaries, training grounds and \n     madrasas.\n       I asked Karzai about the prospects of catching Osama bin \n     Laden. The President told me that he will not be able to hide \n     forever and that sooner or later he will be caught.\n       I asked President Karzai about Iran's pursuit of nuclear \n     weapons. He stated that nuclear weapons in the region bring \n     pride and a sense of security. He stated that Iran and the \n     U.S. should open a dialogue, talking pays and that no one can \n     benefit from confrontation.\n       Following our meeting with President Karzai, we departed \n     for the embassy for the country team briefing led by \n     Ambassador Patterson.\n       The delegation, including Ambassador Patterson, departed \n     the embassy to our next meeting with General Tariq Majid, \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Majid's \n     headquarters are located in Rawalpindi--the same part of \n     Islamabad where Benazir Bhutto would be killed later that \n     same day.\n       I pressed Gen. Majid on Pakistan's efforts to combat Al-\n     Qaeda and locate Osama bin Laden. He indicated that he does \n     not know where he is but that Pakistan should be able to find \n     him but that it must be an integrated and combined effort \n     with U.S. support.\n       I expressed my concern over the problems in the FATA region \n     and asked what is being done to combat the issues plaguing \n     that region and the country. He responded by telling me that \n     for many years, Pakistan did not have access to the tribal \n     belt but that military forces were now engaged--100,000 \n     according to Majid.\n       I told the General of my concern over Pakistan's nuclear \n     arsenal and the command and control structures in place to \n     ensure the weapons do not fall into the hands of militants. \n     He informed me that there is a structure in place that \n     ensures that there can be no rogue launch of nuclear weapons \n     as the President, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Defense \n     Minister and the service chiefs all have to approve usage.\n       I expressed my desire to see the Indian subcontinent \n     denuclearized--a matter I had taken up with the Prime \n     Ministers of India and Pakistan over a decade earlier. Majid \n     informed me that Pakistan had made such an offer to India but \n     that it was rejected. Pakistan claims its arsenal is an \n     insurance policy against the much larger Indian force and \n     that they do not have regional ambitions. India not only \n     looks at Pakistan but looks east towards China and would not \n     likely give up their arsenal with such a neighbor. China \n     would be unlikely to surrender its weapons given the \n     considerable arsenals of Russia and the United States.\n       I expressed my concern over Iran's nuclear activities and \n     ambitions. Majid indicated that Pakistan did not have a \n     problem with a peaceful program but that they object to high \n     levels of enrichment. Any military action against Iran, Majid \n     said, would compound problems in Pakistan. He suggested \n     bilateral talks between the U.S. and Iran as the path leading \n     us out of this dilemma.\n       I told Gen. Majid of my great concern over the situation in \n     Pakistan, the political crisis, the removal of members of the \n     judiciary and the imprisonment of citizens. I told him there \n     was great concern in the United States and talk of altering \n     U.S. aid to Pakistan's military. Majid asked us to remember \n     that Pakistan is not the U.S. and that their democracy and \n     institutions are not as strong as ours. He asked us to review \n     the actions taken by the Chief Justice as he claimed he was \n     acting beyond his jurisdiction.\n       Following our meeting with Gen. Majid, we were received by \n     President Pervez Musharraf at his palace. He expressed his \n     satisfaction with bilateral relations but indicated that \n     stopping the military cooperation would negatively impact the \n     relationship. I pressed Musharraf on the reported misuse of \n     aid and overcharging on reimbursements. The President \n     objected to the characterization of his government's actions \n     claiming that all requests are analyzed, mutually agreed upon \n     and submitted.\n       I asked Musharraf about his efforts to combat terrorism. He \n     generalized about his government's efforts to combat the \n     Taliban and Al Qaeda. He indicated that actions in \n     Afghanistan have led to an overflow of troublemakers in \n     western Pakistan. When I asked if he will catch Osama bin \n     Laden, he responded that he, ``can't say for sure, but we \n     should.'' He claimed he does not have the forces required to \n     search and police some of the areas he may be hiding.\n       I informed the President that we want transparency in \n     Pakistan and events such as removal of the Chief Justice \n     cause grave concern. I told Musharraf responded by saying \n     Pakistan has various pillars of government like the U.S. but \n     that their institutions are not as strong and capable as \n     those in the U.S. He indicated that the Chief Justice had \n     acted inappropriately and that his activities included \n     corruption, kickbacks and inappropriately using his \n     influence, which would not be tolerated in the United States. \n     Musharraf stated the Chief Justice was doing an injustice to \n     Pakistan, interfering in various cases in other courts, \n     actively campaigned in political rallies, traveling with his \n     own masked security detail and interfering with the executive \n     branch in privatization matters which had led to Pakistan's \n     recent economic success.\n       When I pressed Musharraf on the rationale of imposing \n     martial law, he stated that the\n\n[[Page S71]]\n\n     government was weakening, economy declining and terrorists \n     rising and that it was needed to maintain stability. He \n     stated that most people that were detained had been released. \n     We departed the Presidential Palace for a working lunch at \n     the Ambassador's residence to further evaluate and discuss \n     the issues confronting Pakistan and our bilateral \n     relationship. Attendees included Ambassador Patterson, \n     General Helmly, Peter Bodde, Candace Putnam, Jason Jeffreys \n     and the delegation.\n       On the afternoon of December 27, we received word in our \n     control room that there had been an incident at a political \n     rally for Benazir Bhutto. As we were preparing for a dinner \n     hosted by President Musharraf we got word that she had \n     possibly been injured and was taken to the hospital. As I \n     headed to the elevators, Chris Bradish, my deputy, informed \n     me that Benazir had died. I had known her for nearly 20 \n     years. We were scheduled to meet with her in her home at 9 \n     p.m. that night--in approximately 3 hours.\n       I received many calls and e-mails from the U.S. requesting \n     information on the situation. Below is a transcript of a \n     phone conversation I had with MSNBC:\n\n       HALL: On the phone with us now is Senator Arlen Specter, \n     who is in Islamabad and was, according to what I'm being \n     told, expected to meet with Benazir Bhutto sometime tonight. \n     Senator, are you there?\n       SPECTER: I am. Congressman Patrick Kennedy and I were \n     scheduled to meet with Benazir Bhutto this evening. We were \n     scheduled to go to a dinner with President Musharraf. We had \n     met with President Musharraf earlier today and, en route to \n     the dinner, about ready to go, we heard the tragic news.\n       HALL: And how did you learn the news, sir?\n       SPECTER: Watching CNN. We heard, first, that there had been \n     a suicide bomber attempt, that Benazir Bhutto was OK. Then we \n     heard she'd been hurt, critically, and then the news came in \n     that it had been fatal.\n       HALL: And tell us a little bit about what you were planning \n     to meet with her regarding. We know that Hamid Karzai met \n     with her, as well as Pervez Musharraf, on the security issue \n     concerning the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan. What was \n     the focus of your meeting?\n       SPECTER: Well, Congressman Patrick Kennedy and I are in the \n     region. We had been to Israel on our way to Syria. And we had \n     meetings with President Musharraf today, and we also saw \n     Afghanistan President Karzai, who just coincidentally was in \n     town.\n       And we had a meeting with former Prime Minister Benazir \n     Bhutto this evening at nine o'clock Pakistan time, and it was \n     scheduled then because she had a full day of campaigning.\n       And our concerns are about what is happening here, the \n     stability; what's happening with the supreme court; what's \n     happening with our fight against terrorism, our efforts to \n     capture Osama Bin Laden; and what is happening to the very \n     substantial funding the United States has put in here; what \n     the prospects were for the election.\n       I've known Benazir Bhutto for the better part of two \n     decades, having been visiting her in Karachi back in 1988 and \n     when she was Prime Minister in 1995. And we were looking \n     forward to talking to her to get to her evaluation on whether \n     the elections would be honest and open, and to get her sense \n     of the situation.\n       HALL: And what did you think her--the impact that she \n     played while, of course, she was alive, with her opposition \n     group, and now with her assassination? Obviously, you felt \n     that she was important, a critical piece of this puzzle, in \n     that you were planning to meet with her at 9 p.m., at the \n     time there.\n       SPECTER: Well, Benazir Bhutto was a very prominent person \n     this year, the leader of a major party; had a real \n     opportunity to become Prime Minister, a brilliant woman with \n     a family background. Her father had been Prime Minister. She \n     had been Prime Minister twice.\n       She had a lot of popular support, and she was the first \n     woman Prime Minister of Pakistan and a very prominent woman \n     internationally, sort of, the symbol of modernity, so that \n     it's a tremendous loss, and we. . .\n       HALL: And what do you think is the . . .\n       SPECTER: . . . we can't let the terrorists win. We have to \n     rebound and we have to be sure that democracy moves forward \n     in Pakistan.\n       HALL: But Senator, we're looking at the images out of \n     Pakistan, and I don't want to paint a picture bleaker than it \n     is, but certainly, immediately following the assassination, \n     people spilling out into the streets blaming, some of them, \n     anyway, Pervez Musharraf--quite a picture of instability. \n     What needs to happen, in your opinion, being there?\n       SPECTER: Well, it is easy to blame people, but it's \n     premature. There has to be an investigation. There has to be \n     determination, to the extent possible, as to what happened.\n       When you have an assassination, this sort of a violent act, \n     you have to expect people to be erupting in the streets. But \n     there will be a tomorrow. There will be elections here. We \n     have to assert the democratic process and we have to move \n     forward.\n       We cannot let the crazy suicide bombers take over the \n     world. And that is our job for tomorrow.\n       HALL: And still very early into this breaking news, \n     Senator--again, to update our audience, we are following \n     developments in Pakistan in the assassination of former Prime \n     Minister Benazir Bhutto. Senator Arlen Specter was expected \n     to meet with her this evening.\n       Senator Specter, the impact--so many people are wondering, \n     with Pakistan being so crucial to this war on terror, that \n     there may perhaps be a vacuum in that country, now, with the \n     assassination having taken place and this could offset all of \n     the work, the $10 billion that's been put into Pakistan and \n     the support of Pervez Musharraf since 9/11.\n       SPECTER: Well, we are not going to allow this incident, \n     tragic as it is, to upset the very important work at hand. \n     You have the Pakistani government working with the United \n     States government. They have been allies of ours.\n       We have not been pleased with some of the things that they \n     have done, like having the chief justice under house arrest \n     or having an emergency suspension, which has been eliminated.\n       But the elections are going forward and we are going to \n     rebound from this event and do what is necessary to defeat \n     the terrorists and to have the democratic elections. We are \n     not going to give in.\n       And we will rebound, and stability will be restored after \n     the outbursts which are present tonight. It may take some \n     time, but we're going to win.\n       HALL: Senator, do you have confidence in Pervez Musharraf \n     and the job that he's done and doing?\n       SPECTER: I do have confidence. When Congressman Patrick \n     Kennedy and I met with him today, we raised a number of our \n     concerns in a very candid discussion.\n       We are concerned that the substantial U.S. funding be \n     directed toward the specific purposes of fighting terrorism. \n     And we are checking to see if some of it might have been \n     diverted. But by and large, we think the monies are going in \n     the right direction. We expressed concern about what is \n     happening with the supreme court here. We expressed concern \n     about the state of emergency, but that has been reversed.\n       The elections are going forward and he is our best hope \n     there. It is not a perfect situation. Nothing is. But we have \n     to utilize the government which is here to help stabilize it \n     and to move forward.\n       HALL: All right, Senator Arlen Specter from Islamabad.\n       Thank you very much, Senator, for your time, just on the \n     very day you were expected to meet with former Prime Minister \n     Benazir Bhutto. Thank you, Senator.\n       Just before midnight on the night of Bhutto's death, we \n     ventured back out into the city to go to Bhutto's local \n     headquarters to pay our respects. We met with her supporters, \n     gave our condolences and laid flowers beneath a photo of her.\n       We were scheduled to travel to Lahore the following morning \n     to meet with Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi and Mian Shahbaz Sharif \n     and visit a USAID project. After the State Department \n     consulted with the Pakistani government, it was recommended \n     that our delegation cancel the planned trip to Lahore due to \n     the deteriorating and uncertain security situation. The \n     following morning we left Chakala Airfield for Amman, Jordan.\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n       On Saturday, December 29 we departed Amman for Damascus, \n     Syria. Upon arrival at Allama Iqbal International Airport, we \n     were greeted by CDA Todd Holmstrom and officials from our \n     embassy Pamela Mills and Katherine Van De Vate. This trip was \n     my 17th visit to Syria.\n       We proceeded to a working lunch with Mr. Holmstrom where we \n     discussed the situation in Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the \n     greater region. Following our lunch we departed for a meeting \n     with Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouallem.\n       I provided him with a copy of Haaretz which published the \n     headline: ``Olmert Says Ball is in Assad's Court.''\n\n                     [From Haaretz, Dec. 26, 2007]\n\n                    Olmert: Ball Is in Assad's Court\n\n                            (By Barak Ravid)\n\n       Prime Minister Ehud Olmert sent a message to Syrian \n     President Bashar Assad yesterday saying he was still waiting \n     for a Syrian response on the likelihood of renewing \n     negotiations between the two countries.\n       Olmert met yesterday with U.S. Senator Arlen Specter \n     (Republican-Pennsylvania), who will travel tomorrow for \n     meetings with Assad's government. Specter is a big supporter \n     of resuming dialogue with Damascus.\n       Much of yesterday's meeting addressed Syria. During the \n     meeting, Specter asked Olmert whether he wanted to further \n     the diplomatic process with Syria. Olmert said that for the \n     past few months he has been appraising whether negotiations \n     could be resumed through mediators.\n       ``I am still evaluating the Syrian track and the degree to \n     which Damascus is serious about [a peace process],'' Olmert \n     said. ``I have not stopped the assessment, but so far I have \n     not received a clear answer and I am still waiting.''\n       Officials in Jerusalem added yesterday: ``Even though \n     Olmert did not ask specifically that his message be relayed \n     to Assad, we assume that it will be raised during [Specter's] \n     talks in Damascus.''\n       Specter also met with Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and \n     discussed Syria.\n       Livni did not reject the possibility of renewing \n     negotiations with Syria, but said there was a series of \n     issues troubling Israel.\n       ``The Syrians need to show that they are willing to \n     contribute something toward gaining the release of the \n     abducted soldiers in\n\n[[Page S72]]\n\n     the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon, or express willingness to end \n     the smuggling of weapons to Hezbollah, so that we will know \n     that they are serious,'' Livni said.\n       This would ``make it easier for us to consider negotiations \n     with them,'' she added.\n       According to an annual assessment prepared by the Foreign \n     Ministry's research office and presented to the Knesset \n     Foreign Relations and Defense Committee, ``Damascus is \n     interested in a settlement with Israel, but only on its terms \n     and with American involvement.''\n       According to the report, Assad understands that the current \n     American administration is unwilling to negotiate with him on \n     his terms, so he is ready to wait until 2009, when a new \n     president is in the White House.\n\n       Walid told me that during Speaker Pelosi's visit, she \n     brought a message from Olmert and President Assad responded \n     only to have Israel deny it made such an overture. We agreed \n     that certain conversations must remain out of the press and \n     remain private.\n       Mouallem outlined a plan he believes critical to pushing \n     ahead with the Israeli-Syrian track including Israeli \n     withdrawal from the Golan and return to the June 4, 1967 \n     borders. Walid stated that, based on prior discussions dating \n     back to 1995, 95 percent of a prospective deal had been \n     agreed upon.\n       I said it was good that Syria sent representatives to \n     Annapolis; and added that Olmert was waiting for a signal \n     from Syria. I pressed him on Lebanon and told him it was my \n     view that the International Community as well as the United \n     States does not accept that Syria does not have a role in \n     Lebanon and that this relationship has a negative impact on \n     U.S.-Syrian as well as Israeli-Syrian relations.\n       Walid stated the need to create a climate for peace. Walid \n     stated that French President Sarkozy asked President Assad to \n     help elect a president in Lebanon. The Foreign Minister \n     highlighted the importance of having a consensus candidate \n     and the difficulty of ruling by majority in Lebanon. He \n     stated that Syria agreed to work with the French provided \n     that the goal be a consensus unity government, not majority \n     rule, the U.S. remain neutral and France would not back any \n     party. The Foreign Minister provided me with a document which \n     was presented to the Lebanese on the path forward. He stated \n     that Syria's work was done and that it was in Lebanon's hands \n     to chart the course forward.\n       I asked him about the prospects of a prompt resolution of \n     the stalemate. Walid told me that the Syrians and French had \n     been working for 45 days trying to find common ground. In the \n     end, according to Walid, the outcome depends on what the \n     majority will give the minority in terms of minister posts.\n       When I pressed him on Syria's actions to destabilize its \n     neighbor, the Foreign Minister responded, ``We are not \n     destabilizing Lebanon, we are directly impacted. We have \n     250,000 Lebanese as the result of last summer's conflict with \n     Israel, we have 500,000 Palestinian refugees and we have 1.6 \n     million Iraqi refugees.''\n       The Foreign Minister emphasized he did not approve of the \n     U.S. holding the Israeli-Syrian track or improved U.S.-Syrian \n     relations hostage to the issue of Lebanon. He specifically \n     asked that the U.S. not deal with Syria only through the lens \n     of Lebanon, Hamas and Hezbollah.\n       The Foreign Minister rejected my complaints that Syria was \n     supporting Hamas and Hezbollah. He said that weapons to Hamas \n     go through Egypt and that only 20 members of Hamas were in \n     Syria. He said that resumption of Syrian cooperation on \n     intelligence with the U.S. would depend on better U.S.-Syrian \n     relations.\n       Following our meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \n     we attended a dinner hosted by the embassy. Civil society \n     leaders were in attendance and shared their wide array of \n     views on the region and U.S. Syrian relations.\n       The next morning we met with President Bashar al-Assad. He \n     reiterated what the Foreign Minister told us of the steps \n     needed to bring Israel and Syria closer to the table. He \n     stated that there must be U.S. involvement. I told him it \n     would be beneficial to use the momentum and attention of \n     Annapolis to show the region, the U.S. and the world that \n     Syria was interested in peace. Assad said he was more \n     optimistic about the potential for success on a Syrian-\n     Israeli agreement after Annapolis than before.\n       I told Assad that it would be beneficial to take positive \n     action to show that he is serious about peace and that Syria \n     is not meddling in Lebanon. I also told him that Syria would \n     benefit by cooperating with the U.S. on intelligence sharing. \n     Assad told me that there must be political cooperation \n     first--sending an Ambassador to Syria and refraining from \n     negative rhetoric would be a good first step.\n       I pressed Assad on the case of missing Israeli soldiers. He \n     indicated that he had spoken to Hezbollah and asked them to \n     release the Israelis but that Hezbollah was waiting for a \n     response from Israel on a prisoner swap proposal. He said he \n     believed Hezbollah was ready to make a deal and Syria was \n     willing to take messages between the two. He stated that \n     Egypt was working on the release of the soldier held by Hamas \n     in Gaza. On the case of Ron Arad, Assad stated that he had no \n     information on what happened to him.\n       When I asked Assad about the request for a new U.S. \n     mission, he stated that Syria needed a year to facilitate the \n     development of the requisite infrastructure. Assad said that \n     he was disappointed with the slow progress but that that \n     bureaucracy had been the cause of the delay.\n       Following our meeting with President Assad, we met with \n     Syrian opposition leader Riad Seif. Seif shared with us his \n     ongoing bout with prostate cancer and the difficulty he has \n     had with the Syrian government limiting his ability to seek \n     treatment. Seif said he needs to travel outside of Syria to \n     receive the most advanced care which is currently not \n     available in Damascus. We discussed his activities and those \n     of the National Council which includes over 160 members and \n     was formed on December 1. We discussed the plight of those \n     who have been imprisoned and the repressive acts of the \n     Syrian government.\n       The news conference which Representative Kennedy and I had \n     at the Damascus airport summarizes our meetings in Syria:\n\n  Senator Arlen Specter and Representative Patrick Kennedy Remarks to \nPress at Damascus International Airport Prior to Departure December 29, \n                                  2007\n\n       SENATOR SPECTER: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, \n     Congressman Kennedy and I had a very productive, lengthy \n     meeting this morning with President Bashar al-Assad, and it \n     is my custom not to quote directly; obviously President Assad \n     speaks for himself. We had a meeting in the past several days \n     in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Olmert, and again I \n     choose not to quote directly, but to give you impressions as \n     to where I think the situation stands with respect to the \n     potential for a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty.\n       It is my sense that the time is right now, and the \n     prospects are very good that the Syrians and the Israelis are \n     in a position to proceed to have a peace treaty. I say that \n     because of a number of factors. One is the Annapolis meetings \n     were a significant step forward. President Bashar al-Assad \n     had the courage to go there representing Syria, meeting with \n     the Israelis, meeting with the Palestinians, a meeting \n     attended by President Bush, a meeting with the invitations \n     coming from the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. A very \n     important factor is present when President Bush has signified \n     his willingness to participate and interest in becoming \n     involved in the Mideast peace process, and that is a \n     significant change as to what has been for the first seven \n     years of his Administration.\n       To give you just a little insight into U.S. political \n     activities, with the Congress in the hands of the Democrats; \n     I'm a Republican; Congressman Kennedy is a Democrat. But in \n     the United States, as you may know, Congress is separate. We \n     have separation of powers, and we speak independently; even \n     though the President is of my party, it is the tradition of \n     Senators to be independent. But what has happened is that the \n     President's domestic agenda has not been successful because \n     of the division of power. He had ideas for social security \n     reform, tax reform, immigration reform, and that is not \n     productive now. So he is in a position to turn his attention \n     to international affairs.\n       There is the potential for a victory for the President. It \n     would also be a victory for Syria if Syria could regain the \n     Golan Heights. It would be a victory for Israel if there \n     could be a peace treaty. Right now, Syria and Israel continue \n     to be in a state of war. Now the President is not going to \n     spend his time unless there is a realistic possibility that \n     something can be worked out, that it can be fruitful. But he \n     is available, I think, to help on the Palestinian-Israeli \n     track, and the Syrian-Israeli track can go forward at the \n     same time.\n       It is not to say that there are not problems. Lebanon \n     continues to be a major problem which we all know about. \n     Whether it is right or whether it is wrong, there is the \n     international perception that Syria has great influence, if \n     not control, in Lebanon. Again, I say I make no judgment on \n     the point. I am citing what I think to be the international \n     perception. And it would be very important if the efforts of \n     Syria and France working together can find an answer to the \n     Lebanese issue. Congressman Kennedy and I discussed this, at \n     some length, last night in a very long meeting, an hour and a \n     half, with Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem and again to \n     some extent with President Bashar al-Assad today. There are \n     problems with Hamas and Hizbollah, and again there is the \n     perception that Syria could be helpful in those, in those \n     matters. So it is overall a very complicated picture. I've \n     been coming to this region, as you may know, for a long time. \n     I made my first trip here in 1984, been here some 16 times. \n     [I] met nine times with President Hafez al-Assad, and now \n     seven times with President Bashar al-Assad. It is different \n     this year. It is different this year from what it was last \n     year. It is my hope that the parties will seize the moment.\n       Let me yield now to my distinguished colleague.\n       CONGRESSMAN KENNEDY: I want to say it is an honor to be \n     here. We had a very good meeting with the President, and I \n     was very pleased that the President, when we brought up the \n     issue of Syria's moving towards a more representative \n     democracy because of the fact that the President was very \n     clear that the kind of American democracy that we have, a \n     Jeffersonian democracy, does not necessarily work here in the \n     Middle East. He pointed to the fact that Iraq and Lebanon are \n     perfect examples.\n\n[[Page S73]]\n\n       I did say, ``Well then, what does work, where people can \n     have a voice in their government?'' He suggested that a \n     coalition government, where various people, based upon the \n     representation of their tribal group or ethnic group, can \n     speak through their coalition, could have a representative \n     government. And I said, ``Well, to that degree then, is Syria \n     moving towards that regard?'' He said: ``Well, that will take \n     time.'' And I said, ``Well, is it then your policy to jail \n     people who are outspoken politically to your regime? \n     Particularly the Foreign Minister said it was not the policy \n     of Syria to jail political opponents, only to jail people who \n     were related to foreigners in opposing Syria. And so I asked \n     about the National Council, the Damascus Declaration, because \n     recently they were all detained and put in jail, and they are \n     not related to any foreigners. So I asked ``Why were they put \n     in jail? And have they been, would they be released?'' and \n     the President said that they would be released if they have \n     not already. I gave him the names, I read the names, and he \n     said they all are released. Could you read the names?\n       Akram al-Bunni, Walid al-Bunni, Ali Abdullah, Fidaa \n     Khourani, Mohammed Yasser al-Eitti, Jaber al-Shufi, Ahmed \n     Toumeh.\n       The President said they were released. The President \n     assured me personally that they were released. He assured me \n     personally that they had already been released. Yes. And I \n     had the chance also to meet with Riad Seif, and I want to say \n     that when I go back to the United States, I am going to \n     nominate Mr. Seif for the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights \n     Award, named after my uncle Robert Kennedy. That award is \n     given to a person who has put their life in jeopardy on \n     behalf of human rights. As all of you know, Mr. Seif's life, \n     he was in jail for standing up for human rights; his son was \n     incarcerated and has never reappeared. He is fighting on \n     behalf of the 19,000 people who have disappeared and never \n     reappeared again. I just don't know anything more frightening \n     than being taken away in the middle of the night and not \n     knowing whether you are ever going to return to your family \n     again.\n       And for all of you to know, I say this to my own government \n     when they are wrong as well. I say it all over the world \n     wherever there are problems, and certainly when there are \n     problems at home I write letters about my own government's \n     mistreatment of human rights. So it is universal wherever it \n     is. I would hope that someone over here would speak up on my \n     behalf if they were over in my country, just as I would hope \n     that I could speak up on someone else's behalf if I were over \n     in their country, because it doesn't matter what country we \n     are in; we are all human beings. We are not Syrians; we are \n     not Americans; we are human beings first, and we ought to be \n     treated as human beings.\n       QUESTION: Khalid Ouweiss from Reuters: Senator Specter, \n     what is the next step to resume peace negotiations between \n     Israel and Syria? What needs to be done? Have you heard of \n     any compromises on both sides? Can you tell us in forthright \n     and certain terms what needs to be done and when and when do \n     you expect it to be done?\n       SENATOR SPECTER: The next step will be the arrival of \n     President Bush in the Middle East in the course of the next \n     week to ten days. And the focus will be on the Palestinian-\n     Israeli track. But I think there will also be an opportunity \n     to get a sense for what is happening in the region more \n     broadly, including the Syrian-Israeli track. The parties are \n     going to have to initiate, or continue talks through \n     intermediaries. It is my hope, really expectation, that at \n     some point when some preliminary progress has been made that \n     the United States government will be a party to broker \n     conversations. But, this is going to have to evolve step by \n     step from what has happened at Annapolis and what the sense \n     is in Jerusalem today and what my sense is in Damascus today.\n       Later today I will be in touch with officials in the White \n     House in Washington and also with officials of the Israeli \n     government in Jerusalem to tell them the conversation with \n     President Bashar al-Assad and my sense as to what ought to be \n     done next.\n       QUESTION: Ziad Haider for Los Angeles Times. Senator, could \n     you please elaborate on your role? Do you have a specific \n     role between the Syrians and the Israelis? Are you an \n     official mediator between the two sides?\n       SENATOR SPECTER: What is my role? The foreign policy of the \n     United States Government under our Constitution is carried \n     out by the Executive [Branch]. The Congress has very \n     substantial authority on the appropriations process, on \n     control of the military, on the authority to declare war, so \n     Congress has very extensive responsibilities. Do I have an \n     official role in the government?\n       QUESTION: Do you have a personal role? A specific personal \n     role as a mediator?\n       SENATOR SPECTER: Well, I have described for you what my \n     undertakings have been. They have been to talk to Israeli \n     Prime Minister Olmert and other Israeli officials--Netanyahu, \n     Barak, and Perez--and to talk to President Bashar al-Assad \n     and also to Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem. And to convey \n     to President Bashar al-Assad what conversations I had with \n     Prime Minister Olmert and the others and I will now convey \n     the conversations back to the Israeli officials.\n       QUESTION: Senator Specter and Congressman Kennedy, what was \n     the content of your conversations with President Assad and \n     Foreign Minister regarding the American steps with regard to \n     Lebanon, what steps they are going to take in that regard? \n     Are there any deals which have been talked about? Can you \n     confirm that?\n       SENATOR SPECTER: Congressman Kennedy and I talked at length \n     with Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem and again today to \n     some extent with President Bashar al-Assad. We are looking \n     for an answer there. Congressman Kennedy referenced the fact \n     that we understand that it is not possible to have the same \n     kind of democracy in Lebanon like we have in the United \n     States, that what they are looking for is a consensus \n     democracy, that you can't have the majority govern the \n     country effectively, but with all the various factions, there \n     has to be a consensus. Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem gave \n     to Congressman Kennedy and me a document which the Syrians \n     and the French have agreed to as the basis for adjusting the \n     situation and going forward with elections in Lebanon. With \n     respect to Israeli Prime Minister Olmert, we talked about \n     Lebanon to some extent, but Israel does not factor into being \n     a determinative factor there. Prime Minister Olmert is \n     concerned about Hizbollah, concerned about potential Syrian \n     support for Hamas, but the answers in Lebanon are going to \n     have to come through the efforts of the Lebanese \n     themselves with the assistance of Syria and France.\n       QUESTION: Lina Sinjab, BBC World News: Senator Specter, you \n     mentioned, you talked about the importance of getting Syria \n     and Israel back to the peace track and Syria's attendance in \n     Annapolis was provided to have a Moscow version of Annapolis \n     to talk about the Syrian-Israeli peace track. Are the \n     Israelis committed to that? Is Olmert's government committed \n     to attend the Moscow version of Annapolis and what is going \n     to happen next?\n       SENATOR SPECTER: The question is, is Olmert committed to \n     the peace track and what will happen next?\n       QUESTION: The question is there was a Moscow version of \n     Annapolis to discuss Syria-Israel peace track and to talk \n     about the Golan Heights, and is the Israeli government \n     committed to that?\n       SENATOR SPECTER: Well, the question as to whether the \n     Israeli government is committed is something only the Israeli \n     government can answer and it will require the evolving \n     discussions. I believe the inference is clear that Israel \n     understands that if there is to be a treaty, that the Golan \n     will have to be returned to Syria. I believe that that is the \n     overhang. Has Prime Minister Olmert told me flatly that he is \n     prepared to give the Golan Heights back? No. We did not get \n     into that detail, but the whole process would not make any \n     sense unless Syria gets back the Golan. Now there is going to \n     have to be a working out of the fine lines. There is a \n     question about the June 4, 1967, boundary. There are \n     questions about security when the Golan goes back. There are \n     questions about confidence-building measures. But I think it \n     is accurate and conclusive to say that Prime Minister Olmert \n     wants to have a peace treaty with Syria. Prime Minister \n     Olmert is prepared to do what is necessary, in a reciprocal \n     arrangement, to get it done.\n       QUESTION: Asaaf Aboud, BBC in Arabic. Senator Specter, you \n     mentioned in your briefing that this visit is different from \n     previous visits. In what aspect is it different? Have you \n     reached a specific breakthrough in terms of the Syrian-\n     Israeli peace track, for example?\n       SENATOR SPECTER: Well, it is different in many ways. When I \n     was here in 1995 and 1996, Netanyahu was Prime Minister, \n     there had been some conversations about Prime Minister \n     Netanyahu holding Syria responsible for what was going on \n     with Hizbollah. I carried a message to President Hafez al-\n     Assad and it was, there were disagreements. A year ago, \n     Israeli Prime Minister Olmert said he was interested in \n     talks, but did not have the intensity of interest that he has \n     now. Annapolis is a big change. President Bashar al-Assad had \n     the courage to go in a difficult situation and made progress. \n     Now, most of all, as I explained at some length, President \n     Bush is willing to participate. To have the President of the \n     United States involved is a big plus if the parties will take \n     advantage of it. It is a very different atmosphere today, in \n     Damascus, in Jerusalem and in Washington. Big difference.\n       Let me see how many more questions are there? I don't want \n     to cut anyone short, but I'll know long my answers will be. \n     One, two, three questions.\n       QUESTION (Elaph): This is a question for Representative \n     Kennedy. You mentioned that regarding the Damascus \n     Declaration detainees, that you expressed concern over their \n     human rights, et cetera. And you did mention in your \n     statement also that you are willing to accept somebody from \n     Syria to criticize the violation of human rights in the \n     United States. The lady is from Elaph News Agency, or \n     website; she is saying that the Syrian opposition have, they \n     interpret, they are critical of foreign intervention in local \n     politics here, even on the human rights level. They would \n     understand that if an American writer or a journalist would \n     be critical of the human rights situation here, but they view \n     with caution the intervention of foreign officials in the \n     local political scene, the same way as a Syrian official \n     would not interfere in the local political scene in the U.S. \n     What would be your comment to that?\n       CONGRESSMAN KENNEDY: That makes no sense. The greatest \n     human rights people in the world have their voice because \n     they transcend political boundaries of any nation state. They \n     are human beings. They speak to the human consciousness that \n     is universal.\n\n[[Page S74]]\n\n     We are not Syrians, [or] Americans; there's the great \n     Niemuller quote after Auschwitz: ``First they came for the \n     Catholics, and I wasn't a Catholic, so I did not speak up. \n     Then they came for the laborers, and I wasn't a laborer, so I \n     did not speak up. Then they came for the Jews, and I was not \n     a Jew, so I did not speak up. Then they came for me, and \n     there was no one left to speak up.''\n       QUESTION: You talk about the return of dialogue between \n     Damascus and Washington. But we know that such a dialogue \n     should be conducted through diplomatic channels, at least \n     this is the level which is a reasonable level. But as we \n     know, there is no American ambassador to Damascus. So have \n     you been talking about the possibility of returning an \n     American ambassador to Damascus?\n       SENATOR SPECTER: The issue about a U.S. ambassador to \n     Damascus, I think, in the eyes of President Bush turns on \n     Lebanon today. The Ambassador was withdrawn when the \n     assassination of Prime Minister Harari [Hariri]. I think that \n     is a decision which only the President can make, and I \n     believe that he is not yet ready to make it, but perhaps--\n     it's his decision, I'll emphasize--when things improve, an \n     ambassador will come back.\n       QUESTION: You talked about Netanyahu in the previous visits \n     you did. But do you feel after this visit that the current \n     Israeli government is willing to return the Golan Heights in \n     return for a peace treaty with Syria?\n       SENATOR SPECTER: Well, I repeat that I do not speak for the \n     Israeli government. I started off by saying it is not my \n     practice to quote President Bashar al-Assad or to quote \n     Israeli Prime Minister Olmert or to quote anybody, but to \n     tell you what my impressions are from the extended \n     conversations which we have had. But we know that in 1995, \n     when Prime Minister Rabin negotiated for Israel with \n     President Hafez al-Assad, the deal was to return the Golan. \n     We know that when Prime Minister Barak negotiated in the year \n     2000 with President Hafez al-Assad, the deal was to return \n     the Golan. There was some disagreement as to precisely where \n     the line would be on the June 4, 1967, line.\n       The core of any agreement, I think, is accepted that the \n     Golan is going to have to come back. But only the parties can \n     speak for themselves. Forty years later, it is a very \n     strategic difference. You have rockets; you have very \n     different issues of security than you had 40 years ago when \n     the Golan was taken by Israel. I think it is fair and \n     accurate to say, in a very complex context, that if there is \n     no Golan return, there is no deal. That is the core of the \n     deal. Then there has to be reciprocity. But nobody from the \n     United States, including the President, can speak for Israel \n     or for Syria. That's why it is important that the parties \n     come forward at this time. I do not believe there will be a \n     time this opportune, after Annapolis, and in the last year of \n     a presidency where the President has so many domestic \n     problems, that he has time and interest in coming to the \n     Israel-Palestinian issue and the Syrian-Israeli issue.\n       Congressman Kennedy and I thank you for your attention. The \n     presence of a free press is very, very important in our \n     society, and Congressman Kennedy has spoken about our \n     interest in human rights. He spoke very eloquently about that \n     issue. Officials have a standing to talk about human rights, \n     as well as journalists. You journalists have unique standing, \n     but so do officials. But we admire what you are doing and \n     your efforts in spreading the word as to what Congressman \n     Kennedy and I have said today. We hope we'll be helpful in \n     getting the word out that something very constructive can be \n     done soon.\n       One final comment: Mrs. Assad and my wife Joan had a very \n     pleasant meeting this morning and spent some very quality \n     time together.\n       Thank you very, very much.\n\n       We departed directly from the meeting for the airport en \n     route to Vienna, Austria. During the flight, I had to \n     opportunity to brief National Security Advisor Hadley on my  \n     visits to Pakistan, Syria and Israel. Because the \n     connection was not good, I called Hadley from Vienna on a \n     hard line for a more extensive discussion.\n\n\n                                austria\n\n       Upon arrival in Vienna, we were met by Michael Spring, our \n     control officer and Christian Ludwig, a foreign service \n     national. The following morning we traveled to the U.S. \n     embassy for a country team briefing. Vienna is a unique \n     location in that the U.S. has multi-missions: one to the \n     Austrian government, the OSCE and the United Nations.\n       CDA Scott Kilner led the briefing which included \n     representatives from the FBI, DHS and the United States \n     Military. In all, the U.S. has 24 government agencies \n     represented in Austria. We discussed the problem, one which \n     is not only faced by the State Department, that there is not \n     enough funding for certain government bodies.\n       We discussed Austria's role in the international community \n     and more specifically their identity in Europe, their \n     relationship with the EU, their bilateral relationship with \n     the Czech Republic and their views on nuclear energy and \n     missile defense. The group noted that Austria is currently \n     campaigning for a seat on the UN Security Council. We \n     discussed terrorism, the IAEA, Kosovo, energy security, \n     Afghanistan and the changing demographics of Europe. We \n     discussed the situation in Iran and our mission's efforts to \n     process and assist Iranian refugees.\n       Following the country team briefing, I briefed Secretary of \n     State Rice by telephone on some aspects of our discussions in \n     Syria.\n       I met with Dr. Ferdinand Trautmannsdorf, the Director of \n     International Legal Affairs and Thomas Mayr-Harting, the \n     Political Director of the Austrian Foreign Ministry. The \n     officials were very interested in my recent travels \n     especially the situation in Pakistan. We had a substantial \n     discussion about Iran, to include the impact of the NIE in \n     Europe. I pressed them on Austria's significant stake in OMV, \n     an Austrian industrial firm which has dealings with Iran. \n     They responded by saying that the government does not have \n     the ability to influence OMV--a statement with which I \n     disagreed strongly.\n       On January 2, 2008, we met with Geoff Pyatt from our \n     mission prior to our meetings at the United Nations. We \n     discussed the IAEA and the issues surrounding Iran's nuclear \n     program.\n       We departed the hotel for our meeting with Dr. Mohamed El-\n     Baradei, the Director General of the International Atomic \n     Energy Agency (IAEA). I had spoken to Dr. Baradei about two \n     months before by telephone when he extended an invitation to \n     me to visit him in Vienna to discuss further the issues \n     surrounding Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n       Dr. Baradei shared his view that the Middle East is in \n     disarray and almost in civil war. I asked him about his views \n     on Iran and his concept of seeking a ``confession'' from them \n     on their nuclear agenda. He stated that the problems between \n     the U.S. and Iran go back to 1953 with the CIA's \n     intervention, the reign of the Shah and the embassy hostage \n     situation and that these events have led to distrust and a \n     lot of emotion on both sides. Iran's rationale for going \n     underground with its nuclear program was that they could not \n     do it above ground. The Director General stated that Iran \n     does not want to rely on others to enrich uranium and that it \n     is a matter of national pride and is a lucrative trade.\n       When solicited about his views on President Putin's idea to \n     have Russia handle Iran's nuclear material, he stated that \n     Iran did not reject it but that they wanted their own \n     capability. He suggested that an acceptable security \n     structure must be negotiated with Iran to deter them. The DG \n     agreed that it is not acceptable for Iran to have nuclear \n     weapons and that his job was to verify that the program is \n     clean and under IAEA inspections.\n       I pressed him on Iran's devious behavior in the past to \n     conceal nuclear efforts and asked if we can ever be 100 \n     percent sure. He stated that you can never be 100 positive \n     but that he thinks Iran has things to tell him and that he \n     has told them they should come clean.\n       The Director General suggested that direct U.S.-Iranian \n     negotiations should begin immediately to resolve the impasse. \n     The U.S. and international community need to understand what \n     the nuclear issue means to Iran with respect to its position \n     in the region and the world, that there needs to be an \n     understanding of the repercussions and that it must be done \n     in a manner that allows all sides to save face.\n       We discussed Secretary Rice's precondition that the U.S. \n     would only meet with Iran if they halt enrichment. He said \n     there must be middle ground to bring the parties together on \n     this issue. He emphasized that sanctions alone won't resolve \n     the situation and only makes people more hawkish. Iran's \n     concealment of its R program, according to the Director, \n     led to a confidence deficit in the international community.\n       I asked about the capabilities of an inspection regime \n     given Iran's substantial size. He confirmed the need to have \n     a robust verification system on the ground. Baradei stated \n     that the Additional Protocol to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation \n     Treaty (NPT) was helpful but that Iran stopped implementing \n     it. The Additional Protocol was the result of an IAEA \n     initiative to better constrain NPT member-states' ability to \n     illicitly pursue nuclear weapons after secret nuclear weapons \n     programs in Iraq and North Korea exposed weaknesses in \n     existing agency safeguards. That effort eventually produced a \n     voluntary Additional Protocol, designed to strengthen and \n     expand existing IAEA safeguards for verifying that non-\n     nuclear-weapon states-parties to the nuclear Nonproliferation \n     Treaty (NPT) only use nuclear materials and facilities only \n     for peaceful purposes. He stated that the Protocol gives him \n     a good handle on Iran's nuclear program in that it provides \n     access to additional facilities and information.\n       We discussed other issues confronting the Middle East such \n     as the Palestinian question and Pakistan. I expressed my \n     concern over the controls Pakistan has on its nuclear \n     arsenal. Baradei agreed with my assessment and stated his \n     first concern is those countries that already possess \n     weapons. In the case of Pakistan, he stated his concern about \n     those weapons falling under militant control.\n       Following our meeting with Dr. Baradei, we met with the \n     United Nations office on Drugs and Crime. Dr. Thomas \n     Pietschmann from the Research and Analysis Section and an \n     expert on Afghanistan, Mr. Jean-Luc Lemahieu, an Afghanistan \n     expert and Matthew Nice, a synthetic drug expert provided a \n     detailed brief on the UN's efforts globally with a focus on \n     Afghanistan. We discussed the patterns and trends in illicit \n     drug production, trafficking and abuse. The group provided \n     significant data on cultivation, eradication and supply and \n     demand. Following the briefing we flew from Vienna to \n     Brussels, Belgium.\n\n[[Page S75]]\n\n                                BELGIUM\n\n       On January 3, we met with Victoria Nuland, the U.S. \n     Ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). \n     We discussed a wide range of topics to include NATO's \n     involvement in Afghanistan, the NATO-Russian dynamic, NATO \n     expanding global partnerships, the EU-NATO relationship, \n     Kosovo and missile defense.\n       On January 4, we departed for our return to the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, January 2, 2008.\n     Hon. Ban Ki-Moon,\n     Secretary-General of the United Nations,\n     New York, NY.\n       Dear Secretary-General: In light of the uncertainty on who \n     assassinated former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto \n     and the impact of her assassination on the pending Pakistani \n     elections. I urge the United Nations, either alone or in \n     conjunction with the Musharraf government of Pakistan, to \n     appoint an investigating commission.\n       Since President Musharraf has already suggested an \n     international investigation, joint action by the U.N. would \n     be consistent with Pakistani sovereignty. Even without the \n     voluntary joinder of the Musharraf government, it is obvious \n     that a U.N. investigatian would have greater public \n     credibility.\n       In making this recommendation, I recollect the action taken \n     by President Lyndon Johnson within seven days after the \n     assassination of President John F. Kennedy to appoint an \n     independent investigating commission.\n       As you may know, Representative Patrick Kennedy, member of \n     the U.S. House of Representatives (D-RI), and I were \n     scheduled to meet with Ms. Bhutto at 9 p.m. an Thursday, \n     December 27th. She had called for that late meeting because \n     she was fully engaged in campaigning that day. As \n     Representative Kennedy and I were preparing to depart for a \n     dinner with President Musharraf at 7 p.m. and the later \n     meeting with Ms. Bhutto, we were informed of her \n     assassination.\n       I am further concerned by a report in the Boston Globe from \n     January 2, 2008 picking up a Washington Post story by Griff \n     Witte and Emily Wax which says:\n       ``Senator Latif Khosa, a lawmaker from Bhutta's Pakistan \n     Peoples Party, said she had planned to give the lawmakers \n     (referring to Representative Kennedy and myself) a report \n     outlining complaints an `pre-poll rigging' by Musharraf's \n     government and the military-run Inter-Services Intelligence \n     Directorate.''\n       In a matter of this sort it is to be expected, based on \n     what happened following the assassination of President \n     Kennedy, to have a wide range of allegations and conspiracy \n     theories.\n       It would be expected that expert investigative bodies like \n     the FBI and Scotland Yard and other national, reputable \n     investigating organizations would be willing to undertake \n     such an investigation under the name of the United Nations.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 2008.\n     Hon. Sarfraz Khan Lashari,\n     Election Monitor,\n     Pakistan People's Party\n       Dear Mr. Lashari: It is my understanding that Ms. Bhutto \n     may have intended to present me with a report detailing \n     election fraud in Pakistan's upcoming election at the time of \n     our scheduled meeting on December 27, 2007.\n       According to a January 1, 2008 article in The Guardian, you \n     told reporters, ``That's what she was going to explain to the \n     U.S. Senators.'' ``We have a lot of evidence that the \n     government is involved in rigging. It was going to be \n     discussed on that evening.'' I am very interested in \n     examining any material that your party may have prepared for \n     my review.\n       Americans are closely watching what is happening in \n     Pakistan. Any help you can provide in shedding light on this \n     tragic event may further the investigation into Ms. Bhutto's \n     death, as well as help to ensure that the upcoming elections \n     are free and fair.\n       I Thank you for your consideration of this request.

I have noted in \n     the press that the Honorable Sarfraz Khan Lashari was quoted \n     in a January 1, 2008 article in the Guardian that Ms. Bhutto \n     was going to turn over evidence of election-rigging to \n     Representative Kennedy and me at our meeting.\n       With this letter, I am enclosing for you a copy of my \n     letter to Mr. Lashari.\n       If you have any such evidence in your possession and would \n     care to transmit it to me, I would be very pleased to receive \n     it.\n       I am sure you will be interested to know that I wrote to UN \n     Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon on January 2, 2008 calling for \n     an international investigation of the assassination. I have \n     not yet had a response.\n       I am also writing today to the UN Secretary General urging \n     that the United Nations set up a standing investigating \n     commission which would be available to move quickly to \n     investigate any future assassinations.\n       With this letter I am enclosing copies of both those \n     letters for you.\n       Again, my condolences.

Mr. President, I wish to discuss the current situation \nwith regard to siting of the American Revolution Center at Valley \nForge, a museum dedicated to interpreting, honoring, and celebrating \nthe complete story of the entire American Revolution, within Valley \nForge National Historical Park in Pennsylvania.\n  I have been working with the American Revolution Center for a number \nof years, and there has been no shortage of challenges. The current \nchallenge is related to zoning issues in Lower Providence Township, \nMontgomery County. The township has approved a zoning ordinance to \nenable development of the American Revolution Center on a 78-acre \nparcel of land that is within the federally authorized boundary of \nValley Forge National Historical Park but not owned by the National \nPark Service. The 78-acre parcel is part of a larger 125-acre tract of \nland that is in danger of housing development. Not only would the \nAmerican Revolution Center, a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization, \ndevelop a museum dedicated to the Revolutionary War, but it would also \npreserve the remaining 47 acres as open space.\n  I have supported appropriating Federal funding to acquire the \naforementioned land that is in jeopardy of residential development. In \nfiscal year 2005, I helped secure $1.5 million for the National Park \nService to begin acquiring 85 acres that were related to the 125-acre \ntract that is now connected with the American Revolution Center. In \nfiscal years 2006 and 2007, I supported the appropriation of $9 million \nand $3.1 million, respectively, for the Park Service to complete the \n125-acre acquisition. However, due to increasing fiscal constraints, no \nfunding was available at that time to continue the project. \nAdditionally, in fiscal year 2004, I helped secure $5 million for the \nNational Park Service to acquire other land within the Valley Forge \nboundary to also prevent it from housing development.\n  By the American Revolution Center taking possession of this land, it \nis easing the financial and obligatory burden of the Federal Government \nto preserve this sacred ground. Additionally, I am confident that those \nin charge of the administration of the American Revolution Center will \nbe responsible stewards of the historical integrity of the land and \nensure its conservation for generations to come. I am also confident \nthat the Lower Providence Township managers, the local governing \nbranch, will appropriately manage the zoning ordinance for the 125-acre \ntract under current direction of the American Revolution Center to \nguarantee its conservation should the museum ever vacate the property.\n  Thus, recognizing the importance of Valley Forge to the founding of \nthe United States, the creation of a museum to celebrate its history \nand preserve the park's integrity is a positive development. Local \ngovernment decisions regarding private land use ought to be respected, \nand I strongly urge the Department of the Interior, the National Park \nService, and the American Revolution Center to work cooperatively to \nexpedite the creation of this museum, which is long overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S75-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S75-S84]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 U.S. SENATE TRAVEL REGULATIONS UPDATE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to inform all Senators that the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration has updated the U.S. Senate \nTravel Regulations to include two changes.\n  First, P.L. 110-81 requires the Rules Committee to make certain \nchanges to\n\n[[Page S76]]\n\nthe U.S. Senate Travel Regulations. The provision dealing with how \nMembers estimate costs for charter jets is amended in section III \nTransportation, paragraph C, of the Travel Regulations, as follows:\n\n       C. Corporate/Private Aircraft: Reimbursement of official \n     expenses for the use of a corporate or private aircraft is \n     allowable from the contingent fund of the Senate provided the \n     traveler complies with the prohibitions, restrictions, and \n     authorizations specified in these regulations. Moreover, \n     pursuant to the Ethics Committee Interpretive Ruling 444, \n     excess campaign funds may be used to defray official expenses \n     consistent with the regulations promulgated by the Federal \n     Election Commission.\n       i. An amendment to Rule XXXV of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, paragraph 1(c)(1)(C), enacted September 14, 2007, \n     pursuant to P.L. 110-81, states:\n       (C)(i) Fair market value for a flight on an aircraft \n     described in item (ii) shall be the pro rata share of the \n     fair market value of the normal and usual charter fare or \n     rental charge for a comparable plane of comparable size, as \n     determined by dividing such cost by the number of Members, \n     officers, or employees of Congress on the flight.\n       (ii) A flight on an aircraft described in this item is any \n     flight on an aircraft that is not--\n       (I) operated or paid for by an air carrier or commercial \n     operator certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration \n     and required to be conducted under air carrier safety rules; \n     or\n       (II) in the case of travel which is abroad, an air carrier \n     or commercial operator certificated by an appropriate foreign \n     civil aviation authority and the flight is required to be \n     conducted under air carrier safety rules.\n       (iii) This subclause shall not apply to an aircraft owned \n     or leased by a governmental entity or by a Member of Congress \n     or a Member's immediate family member (including an aircraft \n     owned by an entity that is not a public corporation in which \n     the Member or Member's immediate family member has an \n     ownership interest), provided that the Member does not use \n     the aircraft anymore than the Member's or immediate family \n     member's proportionate share of ownership allows.\n       ii. Prior to the commencement of official travel on a \n     corporate or private aircraft, the traveler or the traveler's \n     designee shall contact a charter company in the departure or \n     destination city to request a written estimate of the cost of \n     a flight between the two cities on a similar aircraft of \n     comparable size being provided by the corporation or private \n     entity.\n       1. For example, if a Learjet 45 XR aircraft is being \n     provided by the corporation or private entity, the traveler \n     or the traveler's designee shall request a written estimate \n     of the cost to charter a Learjet 45 XR aircraft from the \n     departure city to the destination city.\n       2. If no charter company is located in either the departure \n     or destination city which rents a similar aircraft of \n     comparable size, a charter company nearest either the \n     destination or departure city which does so shall be \n     contacted for a written estimate.\n       iii. Following the completion of official travel on a \n     corporate or private aircraft, reimbursement for related \n     expenses may be processed on direct pay vouchers payable to \n     each individual traveler, to the corporation or private \n     entity, or to the travel charge card vendor. The written \n     estimate received from the charter company shall be attached \n     to the voucher for processing.\n\n  The second change concerns travel by Members to the home State for \nfunerals. The provision is amended in section of the Travel Regulations \nentitled ``Special Events, II. Funerals,'' as follows:\n\n       II. Funerals: Members who represent the Senate at the \n     funeral of a Member or former Member may be reimbursed for \n     the actual and necessary expenses of their attendance, \n     pursuant to S. Res. 263, agreed to July 30, 1998. \n     Additionally, the actual and necessary expenses of a \n     committee appointed to represent the Senate at the funeral of \n     a deceased Member or former Member may be reimbursed pursuant \n     to S. Res. 458, agreed to October 4, 1984.\n       A. Pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 58e, which authorizes reimbursement \n     for travel while on official business within the United \n     States, Members and their staff may be reimbursed for the \n     actual and necessary expenses of attending funerals within \n     their home state only.\n       B. Examples of funerals that may be considered official \n     business include, but are not limited to, funerals for \n     military servicemembers, first responders, or public \n     officials from the Member's state.\n\n  These changes became effective on December 20, 2007.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the updated U.S. \nSenate Travel Regulations printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAuthority of the Committee on Rules and Administration To Issue Senate \n                           Travel Regulations\n\n       The travel regulations herein have been promulgated by the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration pursuant to the \n     authority vested in it by paragraph 1(n)(1)8 of Rule XXV of \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate and by section 68 of Title 2 \n     of the United States Code, the pertinent portions of which \n     provisions are as follows:\n\n                      Standing Rules of the Senate\n\n\n                                rule XXV\n\n                           paragraph 1(n)(1)8\n\n       (n)(1) Committee on Rules and Administration, to which \n     committee shall be referred * * * matters relating to the \n     following subjects: * * *\n       8.

Payments from contingent fund of Senate\n       No payment shall be made from the contingent fund of the \n     Senate unless sanctioned by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration of the Senate * * *.\n\n                United States Senate Travel Regulations\n\n       Revised by the Committee on Rules and Administration\n       United States Senate, effective October 1, 1991 as amended \n     January 1, 1999, as further amended December 7, 2006, as \n     further amended October 29, 2007, as further amended December \n     20, 2007.\n\n                          General Regulations\n\n       Travel Authorization\n       A. Only those individuals having an official connection \n     with the function involved may obligate the funds of said \n     function.\n       B. Funds disbursed by the Secretary of Senate may be \n     obligated by:\n       1. Members of standing, select, special, joint, policy or \n     conference committees\n       2. Staff of such committees\n       3. Employees properly detailed to such committees from \n     other agencies\n       4. Employees of Members of such committees whose salaries \n     are disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate and employees \n     appointed under authority of section 111 of Public Law 95-94, \n     approved August 5, 1977, when designated as ``ex officio \n     employees'' by the Chairman of such committee. Approval of \n     the reimbursement voucher will be considered sufficient \n     designation.\n       5. Senators, including staff and nominating board members. \n     (Also individuals properly detailed to a Senator's office \n     under authority of Section 503(b)(3) of P.L. 96-465, approved \n     October 17, 1980.)\n       6. All other administrative offices, including Officers and \n     staff.\n       c. An employee who transfers from one office to another on \n     the same day he/she concludes official travel shall be \n     considered an employee of the former office until the \n     conclusion of that official travel.\n       D. All travel shall be either authorized or approved by the \n     chairman of the committee, Senator, or Officer of the Senate \n     to whom such authority has been properly delegated. The \n     administrative approval of the voucher will constitute the \n     approvals required. It is expected that ordinarily the \n     authority will be issued prior to the expenses being incurred \n     and will specify the travel to be performed as such possible \n     unless circumstances in a particular case prevent such \n     action.\n       E. Official Travel Authorizations: The General Services \n     Administration, on behalf of the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, has contracted with several air carriers to \n     provide discount air fares for Members, Officers, and \n     employees of the Senate only when traveling on official \n     business. This status is identifiable to the contracting air \n     carriers by one of the following ways:\n       1. The use of a government issued travel charge card\n       2. The use of an ``Official Travel Authorization'' form \n     which must be submitted to the air carrier prior to \n     purchasing a ticket. These forms must be personally approved \n     by the Senator, chairman, or Officer of the Senate under \n     whose authority the travel for official business is taking \n     place. Payment must be made in advance by cash, credit card, \n     check, or money order. The Official Travel Authorization \n     forms are available in the Senate Disbursing Office.\n       II. Funds for Traveling Expenses\n       A. Individuals traveling on official business for the \n     Senate will provide themselves with sufficient funds for all \n     current expenses, and are expected to exercise the same care \n     in incurring expenses that a prudent person would exercise if \n     traveling on personal business.\n       1. Travel Advances\n       (a) Advances to Committees (P.L. 81-118)\n       (1) Chairmen of joint committees operating from the \n     contingent fund of the Senate, and chairmen of standing, \n     special, select, policy, or conference committees of the \n     Senate, may requisition an advance of the funds authorized \n     for their respective committees.\n       (a) When any duty is imposed upon a committee involving \n     expenses that are ordered to be paid out of the contingent \n     fund of the Senate, upon vouchers to be approved by the \n     chairman of the committee charged with such duty, the receipt \n     of such chairman for any sum advanced to him[her] or his[her] \n     order out of said contingent fund by the Secretary of the \n     Senate for committee expenses not involving personal services \n     shall be taken and passed by the accounting officers of the \n     Government as a full and sufficient voucher; but it shall be \n     the duty of such chairman, as soon as practicable, to furnish \n     to the Secretary of the Senate vouchers in detail for the \n     expenses so incurred.\n\n[[Page S77]]\n\n       (2) Upon presentation of the properly signed statutory \n     advance voucher, the Disbursing Office will make the original \n     advance to the chairman or his/her representative.

No Member, Officer, or employee engaged in foreign \n     travel may claim payment or accept funds from the United \n     States Government (including foreign currencies made \n     available under section 502(b) of the Mutual Security Act of \n     1954 (22 U.S.C. 1754(b)) for any expense for which the \n     individual has received reimbursement from any other source; \n     nor may such Member, Officer, or employee receive \n     reimbursement for the same expense more than once from the \n     United States Government. No Member, Officer, or employee \n     shall use any funds furnished to him[/her] to defray ordinary \n     and necessary expenses of foreign travel for any purpose \n     other than the purpose or purposes for which such funds were \n     furnished.\n       3. A per diem allowance provided a Member, Officer, or \n     employee in connection with foreign travel shall be used \n     solely for lodging, food, and related expenses and it is the \n     responsibility of the Member, Officer, or employee receiving \n     such an allowance to return to the United States Government \n     that portion of the allowance received which is not actually \n     used for necessary lodging, food, and related expenses.\n       IV. Reimbursable Expenses: Travel expenses (i.e., \n     transportation, lodging, meals and incidental expenses) which \n     will be reimbursed are limited to those expenses essential to \n     the transaction of official business\n\n[[Page S79]]\n\n     while away from the official station or post of duty.\n       A. Member Duty Station(s): The official duty station of \n     Senate Members shall be considered to be the metropolitan \n     area of Washington, D.C.\n       1. During adjournment sine die or the August adjournment/\n     recess period, the usual place of residence in the home \n     state, as certified for purposes of official Senate travel, \n     shall also be considered a duty station.\n       2. Each Member shall certify in writing at the beginning of \n     each Congress to the Senate Disbursing Office his/her usual \n     place of residence in the home state; such certification \n     document shall include a statement that the Senator has read \n     and agrees to the pertinent travel regulations on permissible \n     reimbursements.\n       3. For purposes of this provision, ``usual place of \n     residence'' in the home state shall encompass the area within \n     thirty-five (35) miles of the residence (by the most direct \n     route). If a Member has no ``usual place of residence'' in \n     his/her home state, he/she may designate a ``voting \n     residence,'' or any other ``legal residence,'' pursuant to \n     state law (including the area within thirty-five (35) miles \n     of such residence), as his/her duty station.\n       B. Officer and Employee Duty Station\n       1.

Travel may begin and/or end at the Senate traveler's \n     residence when such deviation from the duty station locale is \n     more advantageous to the government.\n       3. For purposes of these regulations, the ``duty station'' \n     shall encompass the area within thirty-five (35) miles from \n     where the Senator's home state office or designated duty \n     station is located.\n       C. No employee of the Senate, relative or supervisor of the \n     employee may directly benefit monetarily from the expenditure \n     of appropriated funds which reimburse expenses associated \n     with official Senate travel. Therefore, reimbursements are \n     not permitted for mortgage payments, or rental fees \n     associated with any type of leasehold interest.\n       D. A duty station for employees, other than Washington, \n     D.C., may be designated by Members, Committee Chairmen, and \n     Officers of the Senate upon written designation of such \n     station to the Senate Disbursing Office. Such designation \n     shall include a statement that the Member or Officer has read \n     and agrees to the pertinent travel regulations on permissible \n     reimbursements. The duty station may be the city of the \n     office location or the city of residence.\n       E.

When the legislative business of the Senate requires \n     that a Member be present, then the round trip actual \n     transportation expenses incurred in traveling from the city \n     within the United States where the Member is located to \n     Washington, D.C., may be reimbursed from official Senate \n     funds.\n       G. Any deviation from this policy will be considered on a \n     case by case basis upon the written request to, and approval \n     from, the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n       V. Travel Expense Reimbursement Vouchers\n       A. All persons authorized to travel on official business \n     for the Senate should keep a memorandum of expenditures \n     properly chargeable to the Senate, noting each item at the \n     time the expense is incurred, together with the date, and the \n     information thus accumulated should be made available for the \n     proper preparation of travel vouchers which must be itemized \n     on an official expense summary report and stated in \n     accordance with these regulations. The official expense \n     summary report form is available at the Senate Disbursing \n     Office or through the Senate Intranet.\n       B. Computer generated vouchers should be submitted with a \n     signed original. Every travel voucher must show in the space \n     provided for such information on the voucher form the dates \n     of travel, the official travel itinerary, the value of the \n     transportation, per diem expenses, incidental expenses, and \n     conference/training fees incurred.\n       C. Travel vouchers must be supported by receipts for \n     expenses in excess of $50. In addition, the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration reserves the right to request \n     additional clarification and/or certification upon the audit \n     of any expense seeking reimbursement from the contingent fund \n     of the Senate regardless of the expense amount.\n       D. When presented independently, credit card receipts such \n     as VISA, MASTER CHARGE, or DINERS CLUB, etc. are not \n     acceptable documentation for lodging. If a hotel bill is lost \n     or misplaced, then the credit card receipt accompanied by a \n     certifying letter from the traveler to the Financial Clerk of \n     the Senate will be considered necessary documentation. Such \n     letter must itemize the total expenses in support of the \n     credit card receipt.\n\n                        Transportation Expenses\n\n       I. Common Carrier Transportation and Accommodations\n       A. Transportation includes all necessary official travel on \n     railroads, airlines, helicopters, buses, streetcars, \n     taxicabs, and other usual means of conveyance. Transportation \n     may include fares and such expenses incidental to \n     transportation such as but not limited to baggage transfer. \n     When a claim is made for common carrier transportation \n     obtained with cash, the travel voucher must show the amount \n     spent, including Federal transportation tax, and the mode of \n     transportation used.\n       1. Train Accommodations\n       (a) Sleeping-car accommodations: The lowest first class \n     sleeping accommodations available shall be allowed when night \n     travel is involved. When practicable, through sleeping \n     accommodations should be obtained in all cases where more \n     economical to the Senate.\n       (b) Parlor-car and coach accommodations: One seat in a \n     sleeping or parlor car will be allowed. Where adequate coach \n     accommodations are available, coach accommodations should be \n     used to the maximum extent possible, on the basis of \n     advantage to the Senate, suitability and convenience to the \n     traveler, and nature of the business involved.\n       2. Airplane Accommodations\n       (a) First-class and air-coach accommodations: It is the \n     policy of the Senate that persons who use commercial air \n     carriers for transportation on official business shall use \n     less than first-class accommodations instead of those \n     designated first-class with due regard to efficient conduct \n     of Senate business and the travelers' convenience, safety, \n     and comfort.\n       (b) Use of United States-flag air carriers: All official \n     air travel shall be performed on United States-flag air \n     carriers except where travel on other aircraft (1) is \n     essential to the official business concerned, or (2) is \n     necessary to avoid unreasonable delay, expense, or \n     inconvenience.\n       (B) Change in Travel Plans: When a traveler finds he/she \n     will not use accommodations which have been reserved for him/\n     her, he/she must release them within the time limits \n     specified by the carriers. Likewise, where transportation \n     service furnished is inferior to that called for by a ticket \n     or where a journey is terminated short of the destination \n     specified, the traveler must report such facts to the proper \n     official. Failure of travelers to take such action may \n     subject them to liability for any resulting losses.\n       1. ``No show'' charges, if incurred by Members or staff \n     personnel in connection with official Senate travel, shall \n     not be considered payable or reimbursable from the contingent \n     fund of the Senate.\n       2. Senate travelers exercising proper prudence can make \n     timely cancellations when necessary in order to avoid ``no \n     show'' assessments.\n       3. A Member shall be permitted to make more than one \n     reservation on scheduled flights with participating airlines \n     when such action assists the Member in conducting his/her \n     official business.\n       C. Compensation Packages: In the event that a Senate \n     traveler is denied passage or gives up his/her reservation \n     due to overbooking on transportation for which he/she held a \n     reservation and this results in a payment of any rebate, this \n     payment shall not be considered as a personal receipt by the \n     traveler, but rather as a payment to the Senate, the agency \n     for which and at whose expense the travel is being performed.\n       1. Such payments shall be submitted to the appropriate \n     individual for the proper disposition when the traveler \n     submits his/her expense account.\n       2. Through fares, special fares, commutation fares, \n     excursion, and reduced-rate round trip fares should be used \n     for official travel when it can be determined prior to the \n     start of a trip that any such type of service is practical \n     and economical to the Senate.\n       3. Round-trip tickets should be secured only when, on the \n     basis of the journey as planned, it is known or can be \n     reasonably anticipated that such tickets will be utilized.\n       D. Ticket Preparation Fees: Each Chairman, Senator, or \n     Officer of the Senate may, at his/her discretion, authorize \n     in extenuating circumstances the reimbursement of penalty \n     fees associated with the cancellation of through fares, \n     special fares, commutation fares, excursion, reduced-rate \n     round trip fares and fees for travel arrangements, provided \n     that reimbursement of such fees offers the best value and \n     does not exceed $30.\n       E. Frequent Flyer Miles: Travel promotional awards (e.g. \n     free travel, travel discounts, upgrade certificates, coupons, \n     frequent flyer miles, access to carrier club facilities, and \n     other similar travel promotional items) obtained by a Member, \n     officer or employee of the Senate while on official travel \n     may be utilized for personal use at the discretion of the \n     Member or officer pursuant to this section.\n\n[[Page S80]]\n\n       1. Travel Awards may be retained and used at the sole \n     discretion of the Member or officer only if the Travel Awards \n     are obtained under the same terms and conditions as those \n     offered to the general public and no favorable treatment is \n     extended on the basis of the Member, officer or employee's \n     position with the Federal Government.\n       2. Members, officers and employees may only retain Travel \n     Awards for personal use when such Travel Awards have been \n     obtained at no additional cost to the Federal Government. It \n     should be noted that any fees assessed in connection with the \n     use of Travel Awards shall be considered a personal expense \n     of the Member, officer or employee and under no circumstances \n     shall be paid for or reimbursed from official funds.\n       3. Although this section permits Members, officers and \n     employees of the Senate to use Travel Awards at the \n     discretion of the Member or officer, the Committee encourages \n     the use of such Travel Awards (whenever practicable) to \n     offset the cost of future official travel.\n       F. Indirect Travel: In case a person, for his/her own \n     convenience, travels by an indirect route or interrupts \n     travel by direct route, the extra expense will be borne by \n     the traveler. Reimbursement for expenses shall be allowed \n     only on such charges as would have been incurred by the \n     official direct route. Personal travel should be noted on the \n     traveler's expense summary report when it interrupts official \n     travel.\n       G. Public Transportation During Official Travel: \n     Transportation by bus, streetcar, subway, or taxicab, when \n     used in connection with official travel, will be allowed as \n     an official transportation expense.\n       H. Dual Purpose Travel: Dual purpose travel occurs when a \n     Senator, staffer, or other official traveler conducts both \n     Senatorial office business and Committee office business \n     during the same trip. The initial point at which official \n     business is conducted will determine the fund which will be \n     charged for travel expenses from and to Washington, D.C. \n     Examples include:\n       1. If committee business is conducted at the first stop in \n     the trip, travel expenses from Washington, D.C., to said \n     point and return will be chargeable to the committee's funds. \n     Additional travel expenses from said point to other points in \n     the United States, incurred by reason of conducting \n     senatorial business, will be charged to the Senators' \n     Official Personnel and Office Expense Account.\n       2.. If senatorial business is conducted at the first stop \n     in the trip, travel expenses from Washington, D.C., to said \n     point and return will be chargeable to the Senators' Official \n     Personnel and Office Expense Account. Committee funds will be \n     charged with any additional travel expenses incurred for the \n     purpose of performing committee business.\n       I. Interrupted Travel: If a traveler interrupts official \n     travel for personal business, the traveler may be reimbursed \n     for transportation expenses incurred which are less than or \n     equal to the amount the traveler would have been reimbursed \n     had he/she not interrupted travel for personal business. \n     Likewise, if a traveler departs from or returns to a city \n     other than the traveler's duty station or residence for \n     personal business, then the traveler may be reimbursed for \n     transportation expenses incurred which are less than or equal \n     to the amount the traveler would have been reimbursed had the \n     witness departed from and returned to his/her duty station or \n     residence.\n       II. Baggage\n       A. The term ``baggage'' as used in these regulations means \n     Senate property and personal property of the traveler \n     necessary for the purposes of the official travel.\n       B. Baggage in excess of the weight or of size greater than \n     carried free by transportation companies will be classed as \n     excess baggage. Where air-coach or air-tourist accommodations \n     are used, transportation of baggage up to the weight carried \n     free on first-class service is authorized without charge to \n     the traveler; otherwise excess baggage charges will be an \n     allowable expense.\n       C. Necessary charges for the transfer of baggage will be \n     allowed. Charges for the storage of baggage will be allowed \n     when such storage was solely on account of official business. \n     Charges for porters and checking baggage at transportation \n     terminals will be allowed.\n       III. Use of Conveyances: When authorized by the employing \n     Senator, Chairman, or Officer of the Senate, certain \n     conveyances may be used when traveling on official Senate \n     business. Specific types of conveyances are privately owned, \n     special, and private airplane.\n       A. Privately Owned\n       1. Chairmen of committees, Senators, Officers of the \n     Senate, and employees, regardless of subsistence status and \n     hours of travel, shall, whenever such mode of transportation \n     is authorized or approved as more advantageous to the Senate, \n     be paid the appropriate mileage allowance in lieu of actual \n     expenses of transportation. This amount should not exceed the \n     maximum amount authorized by statute for use of privately \n     owned motorcycles, automobiles, or airplanes, when engaged in \n     official business within or outside their designated duty \n     stations. It is the responsibility of the office to fix such \n     rates, within the maximum, as will most nearly compensate the \n     traveler for necessary expenses.\n       2. In addition to the mileage allowance there may be \n     allowed reimbursement for the actual cost of automobile \n     parking fees (except parking fees associated with commuting); \n     ferry fees; bridge, road, and tunnel costs; and airplane \n     landing and tie-down fees.\n       3. When transportation is authorized or approved for \n     motorcycles or automobiles, mileage between points traveled \n     shall be certified by the traveler. Such mileage should be in \n     accordance with the Standard Highway Mileage Guide. Any \n     substantial deviations shall be explained on the \n     reimbursement voucher.\n       4. In lieu of the use of taxicab, payment on a mileage \n     basis at a rate not to exceed the maximum amount authorized \n     by statute will be allowed for the round-trip mileage of a \n     privately owned vehicle used in connection with an employee \n     going from either his/her place of abode or place of business \n     to a terminal or from a terminal to either his/her place of \n     abode or place of business: Provided, that the amount of \n     reimbursement for round-trip mileage shall not in either \n     instance exceed the taxicab fare for a one-way trip between \n     such applicable points, notwithstanding the obligations of \n     reasonable schedules.\n       5. Parking Fees: Parking fees for privately owned vehicles \n     may be incurred in the duty station when the traveler is \n     engaged in interdepartmental transportation or when the \n     traveler is leaving their duty station and entering into a \n     travel status. The fee for parking a vehicle at a common \n     carrier terminal, or other parking area, while the traveler \n     is away from his/her official station, will be allowed only \n     to the extent that the fee, plus the allowable mileage \n     reimbursement, to and from the terminal or other parking \n     area, does not exceed the estimated cost for use of a taxicab \n     to and from the terminal.\n       6. Mileage for use of privately owned airplanes shall be \n     certified from airway charts issued by the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, and \n     will be reported on the reimbursement voucher and used in \n     computing payment. If a detour was necessary due to adverse \n     weather, mechanical difficulty, or other unusual conditions, \n     the additional air mileage may be included in the mileage \n     reported on the reimbursement voucher and, if included, it \n     must be explained.\n       7. Mileage shall be payable to only one of two or more \n     employees traveling together on the same trip and in the same \n     vehicle, but no deduction shall be made from the mileage \n     otherwise payable to the employee entitled thereto by reason \n     of the fact that other passengers (whether or not Senate \n     employees) may travel with him/her and contribute in \n     defraying the operating expenses. The names of Senate Members \n     or employees accompanying the traveler must be stated on the \n     travel voucher.\n       8. When damages to a privately owned vehicle occur due to \n     the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Member, \n     Officer, or employee of the Senate while acting within the \n     scope of his/her employment, relief may be sought under the \n     Federal Tort Claims Act.\n       B. Special\n       1. General:\n       (a) The hire of boat, automobile, aircraft, or other \n     conveyance will be allowed if authorized or approved as \n     advantageous to the Senate whenever the Member or employee is \n     engaged on official business outside his/her designated duty \n     station.\n       (b) Where two or more persons travel together by means of \n     such special conveyance, that fact, together with the names \n     of those accompanying him/her, must be stated by each \n     traveler on his/her travel voucher and the aggregate cost \n     reimbursable will be subject to the limitation stated above.\n       (c) If the hire of a special conveyance includes payment by \n     the traveler of the incidental expenses of gasoline or oil, \n     rent of garage, hangar, or boathouse, subsistence of \n     operator, ferriage, tolls, operator waiting time, charges for \n     returning conveyances to the original point of hire, etc., \n     the same should be first paid, if practicable, by the person \n     furnishing the accommodation, or his/her operator, and \n     itemized in the bill.\n       2. Rental Cars:\n       (a) In no case may automobiles be hired for use in the \n     metropolitan area of Washington, DC, by anyone whose duty \n     station is Washington, DC.\n       (b) Reimbursements for rental of special conveyances will \n     be limited to the cost applicable to a conveyance of a size \n     necessary for a single traveler regardless of the number of \n     authorized travelers transported by said vehicle, unless the \n     use of a larger class vehicle on a shared cost basis is \n     specifically approved in advance by the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration, or the form ``Request for a Waiver of the \n     Travel Regulations'' is submitted with the voucher, and found \n     in order upon audit by the Rules Committee.\n       (c) For administrative purposes, reimbursement may be \n     payable to only one of two or more Senate travelers traveling \n     together on the same trip and in the same vehicle.\n       (d) Government Rate: In connection with the hire of an \n     automobile for the use in conducting Senate business outside \n     of Washington, DC, it should be noted that the Military \n     Traffic Management Command (MTMC), a division of the \n     Department of Defense, arranges all rental car agreements for \n     the government.\n       (1) These negotiated car rental rates are for federal \n     employees traveling on official business and include \n     unlimited mileage, plus full comprehensive and collision \n     coverage (CDW) on rented vehicles at no cost to the traveler.\n\n[[Page S81]]\n\n       (2) For guidance on rate structure and the companies \n     participating in these rate agreements, call the approved \n     Senate vendor (currently the Combined Airline Ticket Office \n     (CATO)).\n       (3) Individuals traveling on behalf of the United States \n     Senate should use these companies to the maximum extent \n     possible since these agreements provide full coverage with no \n     extra fee. The Senate will not pay for separate insurance \n     charges; therefore, any individuals who choose to use non-\n     participatory car rental agencies may be personally \n     responsible for any damages or liability accrued while on \n     official Senate business.\n       (e) Insurance: In connection with the rental of vehicles \n     from commercial sources, the Senate will not pay or reimburse \n     for the cost of the loss/damage waiver (LDW), collision \n     damage waiver (CDW) or collision damage insurance available \n     in commercial rental contracts for an extra fee.\n       (1) The waiver or insurance referred to is the type offered \n     a renter to release him/her from liability for damage to the \n     rented vehicle in amounts up to the amount deductible on the \n     insurance included as part of the rental contract without \n     additional charge.\n       (2) The cost of personal accident insurance is a personal \n     expense and is not reimbursable.\n       (3) Accidents While On Official Travel: Collision damage to \n     a rented vehicle, for which the traveler is liable while on \n     official business, will be considered an official travel \n     expense of the Senate up to the deductible amount contained \n     in the rental contract. Such claims shall be considered by \n     the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate on a case by case basis \n     and, when authorized, settled from the contingent fund of the \n     Senate under the line item--Reserve for Contingencies. This \n     is consistent with the long-standing policy of the government \n     to self-insure its own risks of loss or damage to government \n     property and the liability of government employees for \n     actions within the scope of their official duties.\n       (4) However, when damages to a rented vehicle occurs due to \n     the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Member, \n     Officer, or employee of the Senate while acting within the \n     scope of his/her employment, relief may be sought under the \n     Federal Tort Claims Act.\n       3. Charter Aircraft:\n       (a) Reimbursements for charter aircraft will be limited to \n     the charges for a twin-engine, six-seat plane, or comparable \n     aircraft. Charter of aircraft may be allowed notwithstanding \n     the availability of commercial facilities, if such commercial \n     facilities are not such that reasonable schedules may be \n     kept. When charter aircraft is used, an explanation and \n     detail of the size of the aircraft, i.e., seating capacity \n     and number of engines, shall be provided on the face of the \n     voucher.\n       (b) In the event charter facilities are not available at \n     the point of departure, reimbursement for charter from \n     nearest point of such availability to the destination and \n     return may be allowed.\n       (c) When a charter aircraft larger than a twin-engine, six-\n     seat plane is used, the form ``Request for a Waiver of the \n     Travel Regulations'' is submitted with the voucher.\n       C. Corporate/Private Aircraft: Reimbursement of official \n     expenses for the use of a corporate or private aircraft is \n     allowable from the contingent fund of the Senate provided the \n     traveler complies with the prohibitions, restrictions, and \n     authorizations specified in these regulations. Moreover, \n     pursuant to the Ethics Committee Interpretive Ruling 444, \n     excess campaign funds may be used to defray official expenses \n     consistent with the regulations promulgated by the Federal \n     Election Commission.\n       1. An amendment to Rule XXXV of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, paragraph 1(c)(1)(C), enacted September 14, 2007, \n     pursuant to P.L. 110-81, states:\n       (C)(i) Fair market value for a flight on an aircraft \n     described in item (ii) shall be the pro rata share of the \n     fair market value of the normal and usual charter fare or \n     rental charge for a comparable plane of comparable size, as \n     determined by dividing such cost by the number of Members, \n     officers, or employees of Congress on the flight.\n       (ii) A flight on an aircraft described in this item is any \n     flight on an aircraft that is not--\n       (I) operated or paid for by an air carrier or commercial \n     operator certificated by the Federal Aviation Administration \n     and required to be conducted under air carrier safety rules; \n     or\n       (II) in the case of travel which is abroad, an air carrier \n     or commercial operator certificated by an appropriate foreign \n     civil aviation authority and the flight is required to be \n     conducted under air carrier safety rules.\n       (iii) This subclause shall not apply to an aircraft owned \n     or leased by a governmental entity or by a Member of Congress \n     or a Member's immediate family member (including an aircraft \n     owned by an entity that is not a public corporation in \n     which the Member or Member's immediate family member has \n     an ownership interest), provided that the Member does not \n     use the aircraft anymore than the Member's or immediate \n     family member's proportionate share of ownership allows.\n       Prior to the commencement of official travel on a corporate \n     or private aircraft, the traveler or the traveler's designee \n     shall contact a charter company in the departure or \n     destination city to request a written estimate of the cost of \n     a flight between the two cities on a similar aircraft of \n     comparable size being provided by the corporation or private \n     entity.\n       (a) For example, if a Learjet 45 XR aircraft is being \n     provided by the corporation or private entity, the traveler \n     or the traveler's designee shall request a written estimate \n     of the cost to charter a Learjet 45 XR aircraft from the \n     departure city to the destination city.\n       (b) If no charter company is located in either the \n     departure or destination city which rents a similar aircraft \n     of comparable size, a charter company nearest either the \n     destination or departure city which does so shall be \n     contacted for a written estimate.\n       3. Following the completion of official travel on a \n     corporate or private aircraft, reimbursement for related \n     expenses may be processed on direct pay vouchers payable to \n     each individual traveler, to the corporation or private \n     entity, or to the travel charge card vendor. The written \n     estimate received from the charter company shall be attached \n     to the voucher for processing.\n       IV. Interdepartmental Transportation\n       A. The reimbursement for interdepartmental transportation \n     is authorized as a travel expense pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 58(e) \n     but only for the incidental transportation expenses incurred \n     within the duty station in the course of conducting official \n     Senate business. Such reimbursement would include the \n     following expenses:\n       1. Mileage when using a privately owned vehicle\n       2. Bus, subway, taxi-cab, parking, and auto rental. \n     (However, reimbursement is prohibited for auto rental \n     expenses within the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area duty \n     station.)\n       B. Pursuant to S. Res. 294, agreed to April 29, 1980, \n     section 2.(1), reimbursements and payments shall not be made \n     for commuting expenses, including parking fees incurred in \n     commuting.\n\n                          Subsistence Expenses\n\n       I. Per Diem Expenses\n       A. Allowance\n       1. Per diem expenses include all charges for meals, \n     lodging, personal use of room during daytime, baths, all fees \n     and tips to waiters, porters, baggagemen, bell boys, hotel \n     servants, dining room stewards and others on vessels, \n     laundry, cleaning and pressing of clothing, and fans in \n     rooms. The term ``lodging'' does not include accommodations \n     on airplanes or trains, and these expenses are not \n     subsistence expenses.\n       (a) Laundry: Laundry expenses must be incurred during the \n     midway point of a trip. Reimbursable laundry expenses are for \n     the refreshing of clothing during a trip, but not the \n     maintenance of the clothing.\n       (b) Meals: Reimbursable expenses incurred for meals while \n     on official travel include meals and tips for the traveler \n     only and may not include alcohol.\n       2. Per diem expenses will not be allowed an employee at \n     his/her permanent duty station and will be allowed only when \n     associated with round trip travel outside his/her permanent \n     duty station.\n       (a) Training: Meals in the duty station are only \n     reimbursable when they are incurred during a training \n     session. If the cost of the meal is included in the training \n     session, then a meal certification form should be included \n     with the voucher. The Committee on Rules and Administration \n     will consider these on a case by case basis. Meal \n     certification forms are available at the Disbursing Office or \n     on the Senate intranet.\n       (1) Training is defined as a planned, prepared, and \n     coordinated program, course, curriculum, subject, system, or \n     routine of instruction or education, in scientific, \n     professional or technical fields which are or will be \n     directly related to the performance by the employee of \n     official duties for the Senate, in order to increase the \n     knowledge, proficiency, ability, skill and qualifications of \n     the employee in the performance of official duties.\n       (2) Meetings in the duty station where meals are served, \n     such as but not limited to Chamber of Commerce monthly \n     meetings do not constitute training. Therefore, the meals \n     associated with these meetings are not an authorized \n     reimbursable expense.\n       3. In any case where the employee's tour of travel requires \n     more than two months' stay at a temporary duty station, \n     consideration should be given to either a change in official \n     station or a reduction in the per diem allowance.\n       4. Where for a traveler's personal convenience/business \n     there is an interruption of travel or deviation from the \n     direct route, the per diem expenses allowed will not exceed \n     that which would have been incurred on uninterrupted travel \n     by a usually traveled route and the time of departure from \n     and return to official business shall be stated on the \n     voucher.\n       5. Per diem expenses will be allowed through the time the \n     traveler departs on personal business and will be recommenced \n     at the time he/she returns to official business. Such dates \n     and times shall be stated on the voucher.\n       B. Rates\n       1. The per diem allowances provided in these regulations \n     represent the maximum allowance, not the minimum. It is the \n     responsibility of each office to see that travelers are \n     reimbursed only such per diem expenses as are justified by \n     the circumstances affecting the travel. Maximum rates for \n     subsistence expenses are established by the General Services \n     Administration and are published in the FEDERAL REGISTER. \n     Maximum per diem rates for Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, and possessions of the United States are \n     established by the Department of Defense and are also \n     published in the FEDERAL REGISTER. In addition, per diem\n\n[[Page S82]]\n\n     rates for foreign countries are established by the Department \n     of State and are published in the document titled, ``Maximum \n     Travel Per Diem for Foreign Areas.''\n       (a) Per diem expenses reimbursable to a Member or employee \n     of the Senate in connection with official travel within the \n     continental United States shall be made on the basis of \n     actual expenses incurred, but not to exceed the maximum rate \n     prescribed by the Committee on Rules and Administration for \n     each day spent in a travel status. Any portion of a day while \n     in a travel status shall be considered a full day for \n     purposes of per diem entitlement.\n       (b) When travel begins or ends at a point in the \n     continental United States, the maximum per diem rate \n     allowable for the portion of travel between such place and \n     the place of entry or exit in the continental United States \n     shall be the maximum rate prescribed by the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration for travel within the continental \n     United States. However, the quarter day in which travel \n     begins, in coming from, or ends, in going to, a point outside \n     the continental United States may be paid at the rate \n     applicable to said point, if higher.\n       (c) In traveling between localities outside the continental \n     United States, the per diem rate allowed at the locality from \n     which travel is performed shall continue through the quarter \n     day in which the traveler arrives at his/her destination: \n     Provided, that if such rate is not commensurate with the \n     expenses incurred, the per diem rate of the destination \n     locality may be allowed for the quarter day of arrival.\n       (d) Ship travel time shall be allowed at not to exceed the \n     maximum per diem rate prescribed by the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration for travel within the continental United \n     States.\n       C. Computations\n       1. The date of departure from, and arrival at, the official \n     station or other point where official travel begins and ends, \n     must be shown on the travel voucher. Other points visited \n     should be shown on the voucher but date of arrival and \n     departure at these points need not be shown.\n       2. For computing per diem allowances official travel begins \n     at the time the traveler leaves his/her home, office, or \n     other point of departure and ends when the traveler returns \n     to his/her home, office, or other point at the conclusion of \n     his/her trip.\n       (a) The maximum allowable per diem for an official trip is \n     computed by multiplying the number of days on official \n     travel, beginning with the departure date, by the maximum \n     daily rate as prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration. If the maximum daily rate for a traveler's \n     destination is higher than the prescribed daily rate, then \n     the form ``Request for a Waiver of the Travel Regulations'' \n     must be submitted with the voucher showing the maximum daily \n     rate for that location and found in order upon audit by the \n     Rules Committee.\n       (b) Total per diem for an official trip includes lodging \n     expenses (excluding taxes), meals (including taxes and tips), \n     and other per diem expenses as defined by these regulations.\n\n                          Incidental Expenses\n\n       I. Periodicals: Periodicals purchased while in a travel \n     status should be limited to newspapers and news magazines \n     necessary to stay informed on issues directly related to \n     Senate business.\n       II. Traveler's Checks/Money Orders: The service fee for \n     preparation of traveler's checks or money orders for use \n     during official travel is allowable.\n       III. Communications\n       A. Communication services such as telephone, telegraph, and \n     faxes, may be used on official business when such expeditious \n     means of communications is essential. Government-owned \n     facilities should be used, if practical. If not available, \n     the cheapest practical class of commercial service should be \n     used.\n       B. Additionally, one personal telephone call will be \n     reimbursed for each day that a Senator or staff member is in \n     a travel status. The calls may not exceed an average of five \n     minutes a day, and cannot be reimbursed at a rate higher than \n     $5.00 without itemized documentation.\n       IV. Stationery: Stationery items such as pens, paper, \n     batteries, etc. which are necessary to conduct official \n     Senate business while in a travel status are authorized.\n       V. Conference Center/Meeting Room Reservations: The fee for \n     the reservation of a meeting room, conference room, or \n     business center while on official travel is allowable.\n       VI. Other: This category would be used (with full \n     explanation on the Expense Summary Report for Travel) to \n     disclose any expense which would occur incidentally while on \n     official travel, and for which there is no other expense \n     category, i.e., interpreting services, hotel taxes, baggage \n     cart rental, etc.\n\n                      Conference and Training Fees\n\n       I. Training of Senators' Office Staff: The Senators' \n     Official Personnel and Office Expense Account is available to \n     defray the fees associated with the attendance by the Senator \n     or the Senator's employees at conferences, seminars, \n     briefings, or classes which are or will be directly related \n     to the performance of official duties.\n       A. When such fees (actual or reduced) are less than or \n     equal to $500, have a time duration of not more than five (5) \n     days, and have been asked to be waived or reduced for \n     Government participation, reimbursement shall be made as an \n     official travel expense. However, if the fee or time duration \n     for meetings is in excess of the aforementioned, \n     reimbursement shall be made as a non-travel expense.\n       B. Reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees \n     associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an \n     advanced degree or certification.\n       C. The costs of meals that are considered an integral, \n     mandatory and non-separable element of the conference, \n     seminar, briefing, or class will be allowed as part of the \n     attendance fee when certified by the registrant. The meal \n     certification form, which must accompany the reimbursement \n     voucher, is available in the Disbursing Office or through the \n     Senate Intranet.\n       II. Training of Committee Employees: Section 202 (j) of the \n     Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 provides for the \n     expenditure of funds available to standing committees of the \n     Senate for the training of professional staff personnel under \n     certain conditions. It is the responsibility of each \n     committee to set aside funds within its annual funding \n     resolution to cover the expenses of such training.\n       A. Prior approval for attendance by professional staff at \n     seminars, briefings, conferences, etc., as well as committee \n     funds earmarked for training, will not be required when all \n     of the following conditions are met:\n       1. The sponsoring organization has been asked to waive or \n     reduce the fee for Government participation.\n       2. The fee involved (actual or reduced) is not in excess of \n     $500.\n       3. The duration of the meeting does not exceed five (5) \n     days.\n       B. When such fees are less than or equal to $500, have a \n     time duration of not more than five (5) days, and have been \n     requested to be waived or reduced for Government \n     participation, reimbursement shall be made as a non-training, \n     official travel expense. However, if the fee or time duration \n     for meetings is in excess of the aforementioned, \n     reimbursement shall be made as an official training expense. \n     Reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees \n     associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an \n     advanced degree or certification.\n       C. If the fee or time duration for meetings is in excess of \n     the aforementioned, advance approval by the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration must be sought. Training requests \n     should be received sufficiently in advance of the training to \n     permit appropriate consideration by the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration.\n       D. The costs of meals that are considered an integral, \n     mandatory, and non-separable element of the conference, \n     seminar, briefing, or class will be allowed as part of the \n     attendance fee when certified by the registrant. The meal \n     certification forms which must accompany the reimbursement \n     voucher are available in the Disbursing Office or through the \n     Senate Intranet.\n       II. Training of Administrative Offices Staff: The \n     administrative approval of the voucher is the only approval \n     required by the Committee on Rules and Administration. \n     Training expenses of staff shall be limited to those fees \n     associated with the attendance by staff at conferences, \n     seminars, briefings, or classes which are or will be directly \n     related to the performance of official duties. However, \n     reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees \n     associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an \n     advanced degree or certification.\n\n                             Special Events\n\n       I. Retreats: Reimbursement of official travel expenses for \n     office staff retreats is allowable from the contingent fund \n     provided they follow the restrictions and authorizations in \n     these regulations. Reimbursement of expenses for meeting \n     rooms and equipment used during the retreat also is \n     allowable. The vouchers for retreat expenses should be noted \n     as retreat vouchers.\n       A. Discussion of Interpretative Ruling of the Select \n     Committee on Ethics, No. 444, issued February 14, 2002.\n       An office retreat may be paid for with either or both \n     official funds (with Rules Committee approval) or principal \n     campaign committee funds. Private parties may not pay \n     expenses incurred in connection with an office retreat. \n     Campaign workers may attend, at campaign expense, office \n     retreats if their purpose in attending is to engage in \n     official activities, such as providing feedback from \n     constituents on legislative or representational matters.\n       B. When processing direct pay vouchers payable either to \n     each individual traveler or to the vendor providing the \n     retreat accommodations, prior approval by the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration is not required. Retreat expenses, \n     including but not limited to per diem, may be charged to the \n     office's official centrally billed government travel charge \n     card and paid on direct vouchers to the charge card vendor. \n     Any deviation from this policy will be considered on a case \n     by case basis upon the written request to, and approval from, \n     the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n       C. Spreadsheet of Expenses\n       1. The Member office, Committee, or Administrative office, \n     must attach to the retreat voucher(s) a spreadsheet detailing \n     each day of the retreat broken out by breakfast, lunch, \n     dinner, and lodging for each traveler attending the retreat.\n       2. For each traveler, the spreadsheet should list his/her \n     duty station, additional per diem expenses incurred outside \n     of the retreat, and any other retreat attendee the traveler \n     shared a room with during the retreat. Any non-staff members \n     attending the\n\n[[Page S83]]\n\n     retreat also should be detailed on the spreadsheet. The \n     ``Waiver of the Travel Regulations'' form does not need to be \n     attached to retreat voucher(s) for the sharing of rooms.\n       3. The per diem expenses for staff members attending a \n     retreat within their duty station are not reimbursable but \n     should be detailed on the spreadsheet. All expenses for non-\n     staff members attending the retreat are not reimbursable, but \n     their attendance at the retreat must be taken into account \n     when computing a per traveler cost on the spreadsheet.\n       II. Funerals: Members who represent the Senate at the \n     funeral of a Member or former member may be reimbursed for \n     the actual and necessary expenses of their attendance, \n     pursuant to S. Res. 263, agreed to July 30, 1998. \n     Additionally, the actual and necessary expenses of a \n     committee appointed to represent the Senate at the funeral of \n     a deceased Member or former Member may be reimbursed pursuant \n     to S. Res. 458, agreed to October 4, 1984.\n       A. Pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 58e, which authorizes reimbursement \n     for travel while on official business within the United \n     States, members and their staff may be reimbursed for the \n     actual and necessary expenses of attending funerals within \n     their home state only.\n       B. Examples of funerals that may be considered official \n     business include, but are not limited to, funerals for \n     military service-members, first responders, or public \n     officials from the Member's state.\n\n                         Senators' Office Staff\n\n       I. Legislative Authority (2 U.S.C. 58(e), as amended)\n       (e) Subject to and in accordance with regulations \n     promulgated by the Committee on Rules and Administration of \n     the Senate, a Senator and the employees in his office shall \n     be reimbursed under this section for travel expenses incurred \n     by the Senator or employee while traveling on official \n     business within the United States. The term `travel expenses' \n     includes actual transportation expenses, essential travel-\n     related expenses, and, where applicable, per diem expenses \n     (but not in excess of actual expenses). A Senator or an \n     employee of the Senator shall not be reimbursed for any \n     travel expenses (other than actual transportation expenses) \n     for any travel occurring during the sixty days immediately \n     before the date of any primary or general election (whether \n     regular, special, or runoff) in which the Senator is a \n     candidate for public office (within the meaning of section \n     301(b) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971), unless \n     his candidacy in such election is uncontested. For purposes \n     of this subsection and subsection 2(a)(6) of this section, an \n     employee in the Office of the President Pro Tempore, Deputy \n     President Pro Tempore, Majority Leader, Minority Leader, \n     Majority Whip, Minority Whip, Secretary of the Conference of \n     the Majority, or Secretary of the Conference of the Minority \n     shall be considered to be an employee in the office of the \n     Senator holding such office.\n       II. Regulations Governing Senators' Official Personnel and \n     Office Expense Accounts Adopted by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration Pursuant to Senate Resolution 170 agreed to \n     September 19, 1979, as amended.\n       Section 1. For the purposes of these regulations, the \n     following definitions shall apply:\n       (a) Documentation means invoices, bills, statements, \n     receipts, or other evidence of expenses incurred, approved by \n     the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n       (b) Official expenses means ordinary and necessary business \n     expenses in support of the Senators' official and \n     representational duties.\n       Section 2. No reimbursement will be made from the \n     contingent fund of the Senate for any official expenses \n     incurred under a Senator's Official Personnel and Office \n     Expense Account, in excess of $50, unless the voucher \n     submitted for such expenses is accompanied by documentation, \n     and the voucher is personally signed by the Senator.\n       Section 3. Official expenses of $50 or less must either be \n     documented or must be itemized in sufficient detail so as to \n     leave no doubt of the identity of, and the amount spent for, \n     each item. Items of a similar nature may be grouped together \n     in one total on a voucher, but must be itemized individually \n     on a supporting itemization sheet.\n       Section 4. Travel expenses shall be subject to the same \n     documentation requirements as other official expenses, with \n     the following exceptions:\n       (a) Hotel bills or other evidence of lodging costs will be \n     considered necessary in support of per diem.\n       (b) Documentation will not be required for reimbursement of \n     official travel in a privately owned vehicle.\n       Section 5. No documentation will be required for \n     reimbursement of the following classes of expenses, as these \n     are billed and paid directly through the Sergeant at Arms and \n     Doorkeeper:\n       (a) official telegrams and long distance calls and related \n     services;\n       (b) stationery and other office supplies procured through \n     the Senate Stationery Room for use for official business.\n       Section 6. The Committee on Rules and Administration may \n     require documentation for expenses incurred of $50 or less, \n     or authorize payment of expenses incurred in excess of $50 \n     without documentation, in special circumstances.\n\n               Committee and Administrative Office Staff\n\n       (Includes all committees of the Senate, the Office of the \n     Secretary of the Senate, and the Office of the Sergeant at \n     Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate)\n       I. Legislative Authority (2 U.S.C. 68b)\n       No part of the appropriations made under the heading \n     `Contingent Expenses of the Senate' may be expended for per \n     diem and subsistence expenses (as defined in section 5701 of \n     Title 5) at rates in excess of the rates prescribed by the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration; except that (1) higher \n     rates may be established by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration for travel beyond the limits of the \n     continental United States, and (2) in accordance with \n     regulations prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration of the Senate, reimbursement for such expenses \n     may be made on an actual expense basis of not to exceed the \n     daily rate prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration in the case of travel within the continental \n     limits of the United States.\n       II. Incidental Expenses: The following items may be \n     authorized or approved when related to official travel:\n       1. Commissions for conversion of currency in foreign \n     countries.\n       2. Fees in connection with the issuance of passports, visa \n     fees; costs of photographs for passports and visas; costs of \n     certificates of birth, health, identity; and affidavits; and \n     charges for inoculations which cannot be obtained through a \n     federal dispensary when required for official travel outside \n     the limits of the United States.\n       III. Hearing Expenses (committees only)\n       A. In connection with hearings held outside of Washington, \n     D.C., committees are authorized to pay the travel expenses of \n     official reporters having company offices in Washington, \n     D.C., or in other locations, for traveling to points outside \n     the District of Columbia or outside such other locations, \n     provided:\n       1. Said hearings are of such a classified or security \n     nature that their transcripts can be accomplished only by \n     reporters having the necessary clearance from the proper \n     federal agencies;\n       2. Extreme difficulty is experienced in the procurement of \n     local reporters; or\n       3. The demands of economy make the use of Washington, D.C., \n     reporters or traveling reporters in another area highly \n     advantageous to the Senate; and further provided, that should \n     such hearings exceed five days in duration, prior approval \n     (for the payment of reporters' travel expenses) must be \n     obtained from the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n       IV. Witnesses Appearing Before the Senate (committees only)\n       A. The authorized transportation expenses incurred and \n     associated with a witness appearing before the Senate at a \n     designated place of examination pursuant to S. Res. 259, \n     agreed to August 5, 1987, will be those necessary \n     transportation expenses incurred in traveling from the \n     witness' place of residence to the site of the Senate \n     examination and the necessary transportation expenses \n     incurred in returning the witness to his/her residence.\n       B. If a witness departs from a city other than the witness' \n     city of residence to appear before the Senate or returns to a \n     city other than the witness' city of residence after \n     appearing before the Senate, then Senate committees may \n     reimburse the witness for transportation expenses incurred \n     which are less than or equal to the amount the committee \n     would have reimbursed the witness had the witness departed \n     from and returned to his/her residence. Any deviation from \n     this policy will be considered on a case by case basis upon \n     the written request to, and approval from, the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration.\n       C. Service fees for the preparation or mailing of passenger \n     coupons for indigent or subpoenaed witnesses testifying \n     before Senate committees shall be considered reimbursable for \n     purposes of official travel.\n       D. Transportation expenses for witnesses may be charged to \n     the Committee's official centrally billed government travel \n     charge card and paid on direct vouchers to the charge card \n     vendor. Additionally, per diem expenses for indigent \n     witnesses may be charged to the Committee's official \n     government charge card and paid on direct vouchers to the \n     charge card vendor.\n       V. Regulations Governing Payments and Reimbursements from \n     the Senate Contingent Funds for Expenses of Senate Committees \n     and Administrative Offices\n       (Adopted by the Committee on Rules and Administration on \n           July 23, 1987, as authorized by S. Res. 258, 100th \n           Congress, 1st session, these regulations supersede \n           regulations adopted by the Committee on October 22, \n           1975, and April 30, 1981, as amended.)\n       Section 1. Unless otherwise authorized by law or waived \n     pursuant to Section 6, herein, no payment or reimbursement \n     will be made from the contingent fund of the Senate for any \n     official expenses incurred by any Senate committee (standing, \n     select, joint, or special), commission, administrative \n     office, or other authorized Senate activity whose funds are \n     disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, in excess of $50, \n     unless the voucher submitted for such expenses is accompanied \n     by documentation, and the voucher is certified by the \n     properly designated staff member and approved by the Chairman \n     or elected Senate Officer. The designation of such staff \n     members for certification shall be done by means of a letter \n     to the Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration. \n     ``Official expenses,'' for the purposes of these regulations, \n     means ordinary and necessary business expenses in support of \n     a committee's or administrative office's official duties.\n       Section 2. Such documentation should consist of invoices, \n     bills, statements, receipts, or other evidence of expenses \n     incurred, and should include ALL of the following \n     information:\n       (a) date expense was incurred;\n       (b) the amount of the expense;\n\n[[Page S84]]\n\n       (c) the product or service that was provided;\n       (d) the vendor providing the product or service;\n       (e) the address of the vendor; and\n       (f) the person or office to whom the product or service was \n     provided.\n       Expenses being claimed should reflect only current charges. \n     Original copies of documentation should be submitted. \n     However, legible facsimiles will be accepted.\n       Section 3. Official expenses of $50 or less must either be \n     documented or must be itemized in sufficient detail so as to \n     leave no doubt of the identity of, and the amount spent for, \n     each item. However, hotel bills or other evidence of lodging \n     costs will be considered necessary in support of per diem \n     expenses and cannot be itemized.\n       Section 4. Documentation for services rendered on a \n     contract fee basis shall consist of a contract status report \n     form available from the Disbursing Office. However, other \n     expenses authorized expressly in the contract will be \n     subject to the documentation requirements set forth in \n     these regulations.\n       Section 5. No documentation will be required for the \n     following expenses:\n       (a) salary reimbursement for compensation on a ``When \n     Actually Employed'' basis;\n       (b) reimbursement of official travel in a privately owned \n     vehicle;\n       (c) foreign travel expenses incurred by official \n     congressional delegations, pursuant to S.

In special circumstances, the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration may require documentation for expenses \n     incurred of $50 or less, or authorize payment of expenses \n     incurred in excess of $50 without documentation.\n       Section 7. Cash advances from the Disbursing Office are to \n     be used for travel and petty cash expenses only. No more than \n     $5000 may be outstanding at one time for Senate committees or \n     administrative offices, unless otherwise authorized by law or \n     resolution, and no more than $300 of that amount may be used \n     for a petty cash fund. The individual receiving the cash \n     advance will be personally liable. The Committee on Rules and \n     Administration may, in special instances, increase these non-\n     statutory limits upon written request by the Chairman of that \n     committee and proper justification.\n       Section 8. Documentation of petty cash expenses shall be \n     listed on an official petty cash itemization sheet available \n     from the Disbursing Office and should include ALL of the \n     following information:\n       (a) date expense was incurred;\n       (b) amount of expense;\n       (c) product or service provided; and\n       (d) the person incurring the expense (payee).\n       Each sheet must be signed by the Senate employee receiving \n     cash and an authorizing official (i.e., someone other than \n     the employee(s) authorized to certify vouchers). Original \n     receipts or facsimiles must accompany the itemization sheet \n     for petty cash expenses over $50.\n       Section 9. Petty cash funds should be used for the \n     following incidental expenses:\n       (a) postage;\n       (b) delivery expenses;\n       (c) interdepartmental transportation (reimbursements for \n     parking, taxi, subway, bus, privately owned automobile \n     (p.o.a.), etc.;\n       (d) single copies of publications (not subscriptions);\n       (e) office supplies not available in the Senate Stationery \n     Room; and\n       (f) official telephone calls made from a staff member's \n     residence or toll charges incurred within a staff member's \n     duty station.\n       Petty cash funds should not be used for the procurement of \n     equipment.\n       Section 10. Committees are encouraged to maintain a \n     separate checking account only for the purpose of a petty \n     cash fund and with a balance not in excess of $300.\n       Section 11. Vouchers for the reimbursement of official \n     travel expenses to a committee chairman or member, officer, \n     employee, contractor, detailee, or witness shall be \n     accompanied by an ``Expense Summary Report--Travel'' signed \n     by such person. Vouchers for the reimbursement to any such \n     individual for official expenses other than travel expenses \n     shall be accompanied by an ``Expense Summary Report--Non-\n     Travel'' signed by such person.\n\n                Appendix A: The Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n       Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 492, agreed to \n     December 10, 1982, the Sergeant at Arms has the authority to \n     consider and ascertain and, with the approval of the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration, determine, compromise, \n     adjust, and settle, in accordance with the provisions of \n     chapter 171 of Title 28, United States Code (The Federal Tort \n     Claims Act), any claim for money damages against the United \n     States for injury of loss of property or personal injury or \n     death caused by negligent or wrongful act or omission of any \n     Member, Officer, or Employee of the Senate while acting \n     within the scope of his/her employment. Any compromise, \n     adjustment, or settlement of any such claim not exceeding \n     $2,500 shall be paid from the contingent fund of the Senate \n     on a voucher approved by the Chairman of the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration.\n       Payments of awards, compromises, or settlements in excess \n     of $2,500 are obtained by the agency by referring the award, \n     compromise, or settlement to the General Accounting Office \n     for payment.

I join my Senate colleagues in expressing our confidence \nthat many wonderful adventures lie before our friend, Trent Lott, and \nhis family, even as we are saddened by his plans to leave the Senate.\n  Tributes to Trent will include praise of his extraordinary leadership \nabilities, his thoughtfulness for others, his physical strength and \nendurance during long sessions of work, his even temper and good humor, \nand even his vocal performance talents.\n  But Senate ``insiders'' will usually turn to the concept of ``Trent \nthe Vote-Counter'' in an attempt to identify how and why our friend \nsucceeded on so many occasions while many colleagues did not fare so \nwell. I would not suggest for a moment that Trent lacked any counting \nability, but I would suggest that a search for his crystal ball misses \na major point. Trent was successful because he convinced people that \nthey should support him and demonstrate that support by voting for him.\n  Long before he announced his interest in elective office or commenced \n``herding cats'' on the House or Senate floors, Trent studied the \nCongress with the benefit of his able mentors, and he learned the \nfundamentals of how they had gained election in his home State of \nMississippi. Trent learned that long before any vote-counting \ncommenced, the fundamental task was to win hearts, minds, and trust of \nindividual voters, and that requires evaluation of interests, the best \narguments delivered in the most appropriate language with the best \nselection of time and place, and the steady development of trust.\n  We watched Trent win elections in Mississippi, from afar, but we have \nwitnessed his House and Senate leadership races up close. He faced \nstrong and able opposition. He was a graceful winner. He fulfilled all \nexpectations and promises, and we know he will continue to do so.\n  Trent, I thank you for loyal friendship, personal encouragement, and \nthe times we have enjoyed great experiences, together. I pray for your \ncontinuing good health and vitality which will make possible the \nenjoyment of your loving family and your service to others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S85-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S85]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Staff Sergeant Sean M. Gaul\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I salute a great American hero who \nhas fallen in service to his country in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. Army SSG Sean M. Gaul gave his life on January 9, 2008, after \nsustaining wounds when an improvised explosive device detonated while \nhe was on patrol in Sinsil, Iraq, in the Diyala Province. He was \nserving his fifth deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan. His loyalty and \nbravery will be remembered. My thoughts and prayers go out to Sean's \nfamily and friends, especially to his wife Jessica and their young \ndaughter, his mother Christine, and his father Michael.\n  Sean Gaul lived in Cresco, IA, with his parents until the age of 7. \nHe then moved to Reno, NV, with his mother. He attended Reed High \nSchool, where he was a member of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training \nCorps. In 1997, he passed the GED exam. He was first deployed to \nAfghanistan shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Before \ndeploying for the final time, he completed the Army's sniper school.\n  Staff Sergeant Gaul's wife Jessica called him a ``very good man and \nloving husband.'' She said, ``He did not waiver from his \nresponsibility. He always trained hard as he led the way by example. He \nwas focused and determined as he sought out more special forces \ntraining.''

Mr. President, early in 2007 I met with a distinguished \ngroup of American business leaders and retired military officers who \nhad formed an organization called Securing America's Future Energy, \nSAFE, Coalition for the purpose of improving our country's energy \nsecurity.\n  This organization was comprised of a high level group of business and \nretired military leaders led by Federal Express CEO Fred Smith, and \nretired Marine GEN P.X. Kelley. They understood that our country's \ncontinued dependence on foreign oil coming from troubled parts of the \nworld holds our entire economy hostage to events that are outside of \nour control. They knew that our energy security relates to both \neconomic security and our national security and they wanted to do \nsomething about it.\n  Their organization worked to develop a specific, aggressive plan that \nwould reduce our dependence on foreign oil and reduce the intensity of \noil use.\n  Specifically, the plan called for an increase in vehicle efficiency \nthrough more aggressive CAFE standards. It also called for additional \nenergy production here at home, both renewable and fossil energy, a \nmuch greater emphasis on conservation, and new and innovative ways to \nmake more efficient use of our energy.\n  Following our meeting I decided to take the lead in sponsoring \nlegislation to implement the bulk of the SAFE Coalition's plan because \nI believed it was the best combination of approaches to begin solving \nour problem of excessive dependence on foreign oil.\n  By the end of 2007 I am pleased to say that a substantial portion of \nthat legislation which was recommended by the SAFE Coalition is now \nlaw. For the first time in over 34 years, Congress finally increased \nCAFE standards that require a 10-mile-per-gallon increase over 10 \nyears. It applies to both automobiles and trucks and does it in a way \nthat does not penalize large vehicles. But it requires all vehicles to \nmeet greater efficiency standards.\n\n[[Page S86]]\n\n  The Congress also included major new goals with respect to a robust \nrenewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons a year. All of those \nprovisions were recommendations of the SAFE Coalition and \nrecommendations in the legislation that I introduced in the Congress.\n  The recommendations on additional production of energy was advanced \nwith the recent passage legislation to open a portion of the Gulf of \nMexico, known as Lease 181, to additional production of oil and natural \ngas.\n  There is still more to be done to reduce our oil intensity and to \nallow us to become less dependent on foreign sources of oil. But I was \nproud to have been a member of the Energy Committee in the Senate that \nhas advanced an energy bill with real and constructive solutions that \nwill improve America's energy future.\n  And I was also pleased to work with Fred Smith, P.X. Kelley, and many \nother American leaders who wanted to do the right thing for this \ncountry and whose efforts as a part of the SAFE Coalition, I believe, \nhad measurable and substantial impact on the progress that we made this \nyear.\n  In a climate of so much partisanship, and at a time when it is so \ndifficult to get things done, I am proud that all of us, working \ntogether, did something that represents a real investment in America's \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S86-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S86]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                        HONORING SARGENT SHRIVER\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to \nSargent Shriver, a humanitarian and powerful advocate for the poor and \nmost vulnerable among us.\n  While serving under President John F. Kennedy, Sargent Shriver was \nthe driving force behind the creation of the Peace Corps and is \ncredited with turning a bold idea for public service into a reality. \nEach year, more than 8,000 of our best and brightest citizens travel \naround the world, representing our Nation and values, to work with \ngovernments, nonprofits, schools, and local citizens to fulfill three \ngoals: providing aid to those in need, promoting a better understanding \nof America, and fostering greater understanding between people of \ndifferent nations.\n  Today, Peace Corps volunteers join with people across the globe in \nhelping to lift up families and communities: farming and agricultural \ndevelopment in Paraguay; promoting education in China; combating HIV/\nAIDS in Ghana; and so much else. More than 190,000 Peace Corps \nvolunteers have served in nearly 140 countries. The work Peace Corps \nvolunteers are carrying out on behalf of our country has never been \nmore important than it is today. There is an urgent need to repair the \ndamage to America's image abroad, both among our friends and those who \ndo not wish America well.\n  And the Peace Corps is only one part of Sargent Shriver's important \ncontributions to our country.\n  Sargent Shriver served as the first Director of the Office of \nEconomic Opportunity under President Lyndon Johnson. He helped lead \nPresident Johnson's war on poverty where he created or inspired the \ncreation of many social programs, including Volunteers in Service to \nAmerica, VISTA, Head Start, Foster Grandparents, Job Corps, Upward \nBound, and the Legal Services Corporation. I was honored and proud to \nserve on the board of Legal Services Corporation from 1978 to 1981, \nchairing the board of directors from 1978 to 1980. The Legal Services \nCorporation, and many efforts mentioned, continue to help millions of \nlow-income Americans today.\n  He played a significant role in the drafting and passage of the \nNational Community Service Trust Act of 1993, legislation that created \nAmeriCorps, and I was proud to work with him on this effort in the \nClinton administration. In recognition of his service to this Nation, \non August 8, 1994, President Bill Clinton presented Sargent Shriver \nwith the Presidential Medal of Freedom, our country's highest civilian \nhonor.\n  I continue to be inspired by Sargent Shriver's service to our \ncountry. In fact, nearly a decade ago, I joined Sargent Shriver at the \ndedication of the new Peace Corps building and recounted a story I once \nheard. When the founders of Peace Corps were just starting out--still \nfiguring out what the organization would look like and how it would \nwork--Sargent Shriver was shown an organizational chart. This chart \nshowed him at the top, with lines pointing down at staff members at \nvarious levels of a hierarchy. At the bottom of the chart was the word \n``volunteer.'' When Sargent Shriver saw this chart, he turned it upside \ndown because he believed deeply that the volunteers were the heart and \nsoul--and the most important part--of the Peace Corps. His vision set \nthe course of the agency--and that is how it has been run ever since.\n  Each of us has a responsibility to live up to that vision, to promote \nvolunteerism, to give our young people a chance to give back to the \nNation that has given each of us so much. That is why I stood with my \ncolleagues in 2003 to undo massive funding cuts to AmeriCorps. These \nare cuts that would have meant thousands of Americans who wanted to \nserve through programs like VISTA, City Year, and Teach For America but \nwould be turned away at the doors.\n  And that is why I have worked to support AmeriCorps and to remove \nbarriers to public service. I proposed the Public Service Academy Act. \nIt would create a new Public Service Academy, modeled on the military \nservice academies, to provide a 4-year, affordable college education \nfor more than 5,000 students each year in exchange for 5-year \ncommitment to public service.\n  Sargent Shriver is a leader and servant whose legacy will live on for \ngenerations to come. It will live on in the work of Peace Corps \nvolunteers in nations around the world. It will live on in the work of \nAmeriCorps helping to lift up communities here at home. And it will \nlive on in his work to create more opportunities for children and \nfamilies living in poverty.\n  Together, we can help to carry his legacy forward, too, through \npublic service--and through small and large acts of kindness and \ngenerosity to build better communities and a better world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S86-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S86-S87]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                      IRAQ'S RELIGIOUS MINORITIES\n\n Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I wrote to Secretary Rice on \nSeptember 11, 2007, out of concern for Iraq's Christian and other non-\nMuslim religious minorities who appear to be targeted by Sunni, Shiite, \nand Kurdish militants. The severe violations of religious freedom faced \nby members of these indigenous communities, and their potential \nextinction from their ancient homeland, is deeply alarming in light of \nour mission to bring freedom to the Iraqi people.\n  In addition, such violence may be an indicator of greater sectarian \nviolence. Such rising violence and the Iraqi internally displaced \npeople and refugee crises potentially could serve as catalysts for \nwider regional instability. These crises demand an urgent response from \nour Government.\n  On January 11, 2008, I received a response from the Department of \nState to the questions I posed in my letter. I ask to have my original \nletter and the response from the Department of State printed in the \nCongressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Condoleezza Rice,\n     Secretary, Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Rice: I am writing out of concern for Iraq's \n     Christian and other non-Muslim religious minorities, \n     including Catholic Chaldeans, Syriac Orthodox, Assyrian, \n     Armenian and Protestant Christians, as well as smaller Yazidi \n     and Sabean Mandaean communities. I know that the fate of \n     these communities was the subject of a recent letter to you \n     from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.\n       These communities appear to be targeted by Sunni, Shiite \n     and Kurdish militants. The U.N. High Commissioner for \n     Refugees reports that Christians, now less than 4 percent of \n     Iraq's population, make up 40 percent of its refugees. And \n     according to the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom, ``violence against members of Iraq's \n     Christian community occurs throughout the country, and the \n     Commission has raised particular concern about reports from \n     Baghdad, Mosul, Basra, and the north Kurdish regions.''\n       Such violence bespeaks a humanitarian crisis of grave \n     proportions. The severe violations of religious freedom faced \n     by members\n\n[[Page S87]]\n\n     of these indigenous communities, and their potential \n     extinction from their ancient homeland, is deeply alarming in \n     light of our mission to bring freedom to the Iraqi people. In \n     addition, such violence may be an indicator of greater \n     sectarian violence. Such rising sectarian violence and the \n     Iraqi internally displaced people and refugee crises \n     potentially could serve as catalysts for wider regional \n     instability. These crises demand an urgent response from our \n     government.\n       In that regard. I request that you provide responses to the \n     following questions:\n       (1) Is it the State Department's view that Iraq's Christian \n     and other non-Muslim minorities face particular threats \n     because of their religion? Do they face a level of threat and \n     abuse disproportionate to their representation in the Iraqi \n     population?\n       (2) Has the State Department or our embassy in Baghdad \n     sought out members of these communities to inquire as to what \n     the United States could do to enhance their protection?\n       (3) What steps, if any, has the State Department taken to \n     urge the Iraqi government to provide protection to Iraq's \n     Christian and other non-Muslim religious minorities?\n       (4) Has the Iraqi government been responsive to requests \n     for such protection?\n       (5) Do you have reason to believe that any Iraqi security \n     forces or other government forces or personnel are involved \n     in violence against such vulnerable populations?\n       (6) What mechanisms are in place to ensure that U.S.-\n     trained and equipped Iraqi Security Forces do not use U.S.-\n     provided assistance for sectarian purposes?\n       (7) What plans have the Agency for International \n     Development and State Department developed to increase \n     humanitarian assistance to Iraq's internally displaced?\n       I thank you in advance for the consideration of these \n     questions, and I look forward to your prompt reply.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Barack Obama,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC., January 11, 2008.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     U.S. Senate,\n       Dear Senator Obama: Thank you for your letter regarding the \n     status of Iraq's religious minorities. We regret the delay in \n     sending you this response, but we wanted to provide you with \n     a reply that was both comprehensive and accurate.\n       We share the concerns you express in your letter and assure \n     you the Department of State takes matters relating to the \n     safety of Iraq's ethnic and religious minorities very \n     seriously.\n       Iraqis from all ethnic and religious communities suffer \n     from the sectarian and general violence in Iraq. While it is \n     true that in some cases religious minorities, such as \n     Christians, are targeted due to their religion, the threat to \n     Iraq's religious minorities is not unique to them; Shi'a in \n     Sunni majority areas face much the same situation, and vice \n     versa. In fact, Muslim citizens generally who do not support \n     the actions of militants within their region are subject to \n     similar threats. The assassination in Anbar of Sunni Sheikh \n     Abdul Sattar Bezia al-Rishawi, who rejected extremist \n     ideologies and sectarianism, and the murders of associates of \n     the Shi'a Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani are recent examples \n     of how violence impacts all of Iraq's communities, not just \n     Christians or other non-Muslims.\n       Unfortunately, given the difficulty of compiling accurate \n     data in Iraq, it is not possible to determine through \n     statistical analysis whether violence against specific groups \n     is disproportionate to their representation in the \n     population. However, communities that are isolated or small \n     in number and that lack the means of providing for their own \n     protection are particularly at risk.\n       The Department of State is coordinating closely with \n     several U.S. Government agencies, as well as the Government \n     of Iraq, religious leaders, and local ethnic and religious \n     organizations in Iraq, to help alleviate the plight of \n     minority groups. Moreover, the Embassy and Provincial \n     Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), together with Coalition Forces, \n     are working at the national and provincial level to help the \n     Iraqi Government provide the necessary protection and safety \n     for all of its citizens, including Iraqi religious \n     minorities. And the Government of Iraq continues to improve \n     its capacity and capability to improve the overall security \n     situation and, thereby, protect Iraq's minority communities. \n     We would also note that while we have seen reports of \n     violence against Iraqi non-Muslims, we have not seen evidence \n     showing these acts were part of an orchestrated effort by \n     Iraqi government forces.\n       As part of our efforts to help improve the situation for \n     minority groups in Iraq, State Department and Embassy \n     officials meet regularly with representatives of Iraq's \n     ethnic and minority groups and raise their concerns with the \n     appropriate Iraqi Government officials at all levels. The \n     PRTs located in Ninewa province and the Kurdish region--areas \n     with large Christian and other non-Muslim communities--also \n     meet regularly with representatives from these communities \n     and work to ensure that their concerns are heard at the \n     provincial government level.\n       The status of religious minorities in Iraq will become more \n     secure as groups representing them develop the capability to \n     advocate on their own behalf and participate actively in the \n     political system. To that end, U.S. Government-sponsored \n     programs offer assistance to such groups upon request in \n     areas such as conflict resolution, political party \n     development, and human rights. In conjunction with these \n     efforts, the U.S. Agency for International Development \n     (USAID) and the Department of State's Bureau of Population, \n     Refugees, and Migration (PRM) are supporting capacity-\n     building programs for the Government of Iraq's Ministry of \n     Displacement and Migration at both the local and national \n     levels. While PRM focuses primarily on assisting refugees and \n     facilitating entry into the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program \n     for the most vulnerable Iraqi refugees, it coordinates its \n     programs with those of USAIP to ensure that as many \n     vulnerable Iraqis as possible receive essential services as \n     quickly as possible.\n       USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) has \n     five implementing partner organizations presently working \n     with internally displaced persons (IDPs) in all 18 of Iraq's \n     provinces. For 2007, assistance has been targeted to reach \n     approximately 550,000 of the most vulnerable IDP \n     beneficiaries. OFDA plans to obligate an additional $26 \n     million by December 31, 2007, and has requested an additional \n     $80 million for Iraqi IDP in FY 2008. USAID is also funding \n     humanitarian organizations to collect data on IDP movements \n     and needs to prioritize humanitarian assistance.\n       USAID's understanding of the current breakdown in IDP \n     accommodation is that 56 percent are renting accommodations, \n     19 percent are living with host families, 25 percent are \n     living in abandoned buildings such as former military sites \n     (barracks, etc.), and less than one percent are living in \n     tented camps. This indicates that coping mechanis remain for \n     the majority of IDPs, although threats and vulnerabilities \n     still exist, including a continuing need for access to food \n     and potable water, adequate shelter and sanitation, and \n     health care and other social services. In addition, IDPs are \n     faced with border crossing closures; restrictions on their \n     abilities to register as IDPs, and the upcoming winter. USAID \n     is prepared to help IDPs respond to these vulnerabilities \n     with existing resources and partners, and plans to continue \n     responding with additional resources expected to be obligated \n     by the end of calendar year 2007.\n       The Secretary of Defense could best address your question \n     about mechanisms to ensure that U.S.-trained and equipped \n     Iraqi Security Forces do not use U.S.-provided assistance for \n     sectarian purposes.\n       We hope this information is helpful to you. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact us if we can be of further assistance on \n     this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Jeffrey T.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a devoted \npastor, community leader, father and friend: Reverend Dr. Wallace S. \nHartsfield, Sr.\n  On January 1 of this year, Reverend Hartsfield retired as senior \npastor of the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church in Kansas City, \nMO. He served as the congregation's pastor for more than 40 years and \nas a dedicated member of the clergy for more than 55 years.\n  Dr. Hartsfield has worked as a key leader and mentor in social, \npolitical, and religious circles in Kansas City and throughout the \ncountry. He has served at every level of the National Baptist \nConvention of America and as the president of the General Baptist \nConvention of Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska.\n  My friend, Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, has dubbed this remarkable \nleader the ``Godfather of Preachers'' for his ministerial knowledge and \nsuperior oratorical skills.\n  Countless Kansas Citians--and Americans--have been touched by this \nman and his messages. Always positive, Dr. Hartsfield speaks out for \npeace, social and racial justice, AIDS intervention, faith, and hard \nwork. And like a true pastor, he cares deeply for his congregation and \nthe surrounding community. My guess is he will not slow down much even \nin retirement.\n  As a measure of our appreciation for Pastor Hartsfield's long service \nto the community, Congressman Cleaver, Senator McCaskill, and I worked \nto enact legislation designating the U.S. Postal Service facility at \n4320 Blue Parkway in Kansas City the ``Wallace S. Hartsfield Post \nOffice Building.'' This designation is but small recognition of Dr. \nHartsfield's many accomplishments as a minister, dedicated community \nactivist, civil servant, and compassionate role model. I am proud to \ncall him a friend.\n\n[[Page S88]]\n\n  Future generations will look to his leadership and example to find \nhope and inspiration.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the accomplishments of Maxine Pierce Frost, a longtime \ncommunity leader in Riverside, CA, and nationally renown leader in \neducation. In November 2007 Maxine Frost announced her retirement from \nthe Riverside Unified School District after 40 years of dedicated \nservice. Due to failing health, she died shortly thereafter.\n  Since 1967, Maxine Frost has provided leadership to her community, \nthe State of California, and our Nation. As a board member of the \nRiverside Unified School District, Frost has seen great change in \neducation policy throughout her tenure. Being a member of the first \nlarge school district in the Nation to voluntarily desegregate, she has \nhelped pave the way for similar changes across America.\n  Throughout periods of intense growth in the State and the region, \nMaxine Frost has worked diligently to ensure that students and \neducators are provided with adequate resources. The Riverside Unified \nSchool District has grown from roughly 23,000 students to 43,000 \nstudents during Frost's tenure. Throughout this period of intense \ngrowth, she has maintained her resolve that every student have the \nresources they need to succeed.\n  Numerous academic committees across the State of California and our \nNation have benefitted from the leadership and experience of Maxine \nFrost. She has held a number of leadership posts: president of the \nPacific Region of National School Boards Association, the California \nSchool Boards Association Legislative Network, the California \nAssociation of Suburban School Districts, the Schools Accrediting \nCommissions, the Council for Basic Education, and the California \nAssociation of Student Council's Board of Directors. In 1981, after \nserving as president of the California School Boards Association, \nCalifornia Governor George Deukmejian appointed her to the Education \nCommission of the States, in which she served alongside future \nPresident William Jefferson Clinton, who chaired the commission at that \ntime.\n  On October 16, 2006, the Riverside Unified School District adopted a \nresolution to designate one of its elementary schools as Maxine Frost \nElementary School, in honor of her longtime service and dedication to \nthe community.\n  On her retirement from four decades of service and dedication to the \nstudents, families, and educators of California and our Nation, I am \npleased to ask my colleagues to join me in posthumously thanking her \nfor her fine work. Her tremendous leadership and lifetime of \nachievement will be long remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S88-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S88]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           100TH ANNIVERSARY OF MUIR WOODS NATIONAL MONUMENT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to observe \nthe 100th anniversary of Muir Woods National Monument, located in Marin \nCounty, CA.\n  It was U.S. Representative William Kent whose visionary actions would \nlead to the creation of Muir Woods National Monument. During the mid-\nnineteenth century, the Gold Rush brought treasure seekers to northern \nCalifornia in large numbers. To accommodate this rapid population \ngrowth in San Francisco and other coastal cities, timber, meat, and \ncrops were needed in much larger quantities. As a result, much of the \neasily accessible timber in Marin County was logged between 1840 and \n1870.\n  Representative Kent witnessed this massive resource depletion and \ndecided to take action to preserve coastal redwood forest areas. In \n1905, he purchased 612 acres of the Redwood Canyon from the Tamalpais \nLand & Water Co. On December 26, 1907, in order to best protect the \nland, Representative Kent and his wife, Elizabeth Thatcher Kent, \ndonated 298 acres of Redwood Canyon to the Federal Government. On \nJanuary 9, 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt declared Muir Woods a \nNational Monument. This year, we celebrate its centennial anniversary.\n  Coast redwoods, Sequoia sempervirens, are the dominant feature of \nMuir Woods' forest. These ancient wonders are also the world's tallest \nliving tree species and the official tree of the State of California. \nThis species of redwood is believed to have existed when the dinosaurs \nroamed the Earth. Visitors to Muir Woods are left fascinated as they \nget to experience living history by exploring the Bohemian and \nCathedral groves of Muir Woods, where many trees are more than 1,200 \nyears old. Muir Woods is also home to douglas fir, tanbark oak, bigleaf \nmaple, and bay laurel trees, leading conservationist and namesake John \nMuir to remark that Muir Woods ``is the best tree-lovers' monument that \ncould possibly be found in all the forests of the world.''\n  Only 15 miles north of San Francisco, Muir Woods National Monument \noffers a stunning glimpse of the redwood forests that once covered \nnorthern California's coastal valleys. For 100 years, Muir Woods \nNational Monument has served as a recreational escape for nature \nenthusiasts, hikers, and those seeking a glimpse of northern \nCalifornia's rich history. It is a powerful reminder of the beauty of \nnature and the importance of conservation efforts.\n  I commend the National Park Service staff and volunteers for \nmaintaining the natural beauty and historical significance of Muir \nWoods National Monument. I look forward to future generations having \nthe opportunity to study and enjoy this unique piece of our State and \nnational history for another 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S88-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S88-S89]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            100TH ANNIVERSARY OF PINNACLES NATIONAL MONUMENT\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

To honor World AIDS \nDay, the city of Rialto partnered with Brothers and Sisters in Action, \nBASIA, and First Chance/Youth-Community Health Outreach Workers to host \nthe inaugural AIDS Walk Rialto on December 8, 2007. I am pleased to say \nthat it was a success.\n  Since reported in 1981, HIV/AIDS has become the most significant \ncommunicable disease in San Bernardino County for African Americans. \nThe rate of HIV among this group has increased dramatically since the \nfirst cases were reported. In 2005, 18 percent of the new HIV cases in \nSan Bernardino County were in African Americans, yet African Americans \nrepresent only 8.5 percent of the population of the county. AIDS Walk \nRialto aimed to broaden awareness of this disparity.\n  I commend the city of Rialto and the organizers of this event for the \nwork that they are doing to turn the tide of HIV/AIDS infections on the \nlocal level. Better education and awareness programs can make a \ntremendous difference in stopping the spread of this disease, and I \nencourage an even larger parade next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S89-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S89]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING THE LIFE OF VU NGUYEN\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

He was a member of the Sacramento Sheriff's Department for 7 \nyears, serving as a member of the gang unit for 3 years. Prior to his \ncareer with the Sheriff's Department, he was a probation officer for \nSacramento County.\n  Vu Nguyen was born in Vietnam in 1970 and immigrated to the United \nStates in 1975. His family settled in Modesto, CA, where he attended \nBurbank Elementary School, Mark Twain Junior High School, and Modesto \nHigh School. While attending Modesto High School he participated in \nseveral activities including football, yearbook, and student \ngovernment.\n  Vu continued his education at California State University, \nSacramento, where he graduated cum laude with a degree in criminal \njustice. He continued to excel at the Sheriff's Academy where he \ngraduated with high honors.\n  Deputy Nguyen was married in April and is survived by his wife Phanh, \nparents, five sisters, and two brothers. His family, friends, and \ncolleagues remember him as a humble man, a respected officer, and an \nambassador for the Sheriff's Department in the Asian-American community \nwhere he often reached out to troubled youth.\n  Deputy Vu Nguyen's brave service and commitment to public safety will \nnot be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S89-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S89]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA SORORITY\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to commemorate the \ncentennial anniversary of the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, \nAmerica's first Greek-letter organization established by Black college \nwomen. It is with great pride that I join my friends Congresswoman \nSheila Jackson-Lee, Congresswomen Diane Watson, and Congresswoman Eddie \nBernice Johnson in extending our congratulations to all of its members \non this tremendous occasion.\n  On January 15, 1908, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority was founded at Howard \nUniversity in Washington, DC, by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle, who envisioned \nAKA as a source of social and intellectual enrichment for its members. \nOver the past century, AKA has evolved into a nationwide organization \nof college-trained women working to improve the socioeconomic \nconditions in their cities, States, and countries throughout the world. \nToday, the sorority serves through a membership of more than 200,000 \nwomen in 975 chapters in the United States and several other countries.\n  In September 2005, along with my colleagues in the House, I had the \npleasure of cohosting a reception on Capitol Hill for the House AKA \nleadership and nearly 100 members. I was reminded yet again of the \nremarkable strength and unwavering dedication of AKA to improve the \nlives of others.\n  AKA's significant contributions to the Black community and to \nAmerican society over the past century are widespread. From election \nreform and safety to and health care and education initiatives, AKA has \nraised money for and spread awareness about issues that directly impact \ncountless lives across the country. In addition to advancing these \nservices, AKA maintains a focus on strengthening the quality of life \nfor its members. AKA cultivates and encourages high scholastic and \nethical standards, promotes unity and friendship among college women, \nalleviates problems facing girls and women, maintains a progressive \ninterest in college life and continues to demonstrate the power of \nEthel Hedgeman Lyle's vision a century later.\n  Today marks not only a moment for celebration but also a time to give \nthanks to all members for the significant contributions AKA have made \nto our communities and America over the past century.\n  AKA's members have built an enduring legacy of leadership and service \nthat has made a profound contribution to our history and to our future. \nAs the women of AKA celebrate this significant milestone, I add to the \nchorus of thanks and praise for your 100 years of groundbreaking \nachievement and the many accomplishments yet to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S89-4", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S89-S90]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF MR. DAVID J. WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I congratulate David J. Williams \nfor his 30 years of service to the vaccine industry and Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. Williams was born in Scranton, PA, and received his accounting \ndegree from the University of Scranton in 1973. He then joined \nConnaught Laboratories in 1978 as the manager of financial services. \nMr. Williams was a member of the executive team and was named chief \noperating officer of Connaught Laboratories in 1989.\n  Mr. Williams steered the company through several mergers and \nacquisitions, growing the organization from 100 employees and sales of \njust over $5 million in 1978, to the creation of today's Sanofi \nPasteur, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer with 11,000 employees \nand more than $4 billion in sales in 2007. Under Mr. Williams' \nguidance, more than a billion doses of Sanofi Pasteur's lifesaving \nvaccines are administered to more than 500 million people around the \nworld each year, representing more than 25 percent of the global \nvaccine market.\n  Mr. Williams recognized his company's ability to address current and \nfuture public health needs by investing in a research and development \nprogram and a production plan for pandemic preparedness in the event \nthat a public health emergency strikes the United States. Mr. Williams \nand Sanofi Pasteur have helped to build the domestic infrastructure \nnecessary to protect millions of Americans from deadly diseases, while \naddressing public health around the world.\n  Mr. Williams has served as an advocate for the survival of the \nvaccine industry. I am told that in 1986, when the industry was being \ndiminished by lawsuits, he served as the industry point person for \nnegotiation of The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Compensation Act, \nwhich established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund. In his \ndedication to the larger immunization community, he created the Vaccine \nPolicy Committee of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of \nAmerica and is a founding member of the Partnership for Prevention \nwhich includes public and private sector representatives who focus on \npreventative health care policies.\n  Mr. Williams served as the first liaison member of the Advisory \nCommittee on Immunization Practices to the U.S. Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, which sets immunization policy in the United \nStates. He has also served on the board of directors of the \nBiotechnology Industry Organization, Blue Cross of Northeastern \nPennsylvania, the Hospital Service Association of Northeastern \nPennsylvania, and the Board of Regents of the University of Scranton. \nHe is one of the founding board members of the Medical Education \nDevelopment Consortium.\n\n[[Page S90]]\n\n  I am advised that Mr. Williams has cultivated a culture of community \ninvolvement at Sanofi Pasteur and demonstrated a commitment to \nphilanthropy through the company's contributions to United Way and \ndonations of vaccines through UNICEF, the Global Alliance for Vaccines \nImmunization, GAVI, the World Health Organization's Global Polio \nEradication Initiative and various humanitarian relief efforts.\n  Mr. Williams has also been committed to the economic growth and \ndevelopment of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. This includes \nexpanding the impressive campus in Swiftwater to maintain a domestic \nmanufacturing base for many vaccines, including influenza. Under his \nguidance, Sanofi Pasteur has grown to be the largest private employer \nin Monroe County and a purchaser of over $145 million in goods and \nservices from Pennsylvania-based vendors. I have been pleased to assist \nin this important expansion through appropriation of Federal funding \nwhich not only benefits the county but the entire Commonwealth and \nNation.\n  On January 16, 2008, after 30 years of service, David J. Williams \nwill retire as the chairman, president, and chief executive officer of \nSanofi Pasteur. I commend Dr. Williams for his distinguished career and \nleadership in the advancement of immunizations and the eradication of \nvaccine-preventable diseases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S90-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S90]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S90-2", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S90]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and treaties which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S90-3", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S90]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE UNITED \nSTATES AND THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY RELATIVE TO PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR \n                             ENERGY--PM 34\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit to the Congress, pursuant to sections 123 b. and 123 d. of \nthe Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2153(b), (d)) (the \n``Act''), the text of the proposed Agreement for Cooperation between \nthe United States of America and the Republic of Turkey Concerning \nPeaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy (the ``Agreement'') together with a \ncopy of the unclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement \n(NPAS) and of my approval of the proposed Agreement and determination \nthat the proposed Agreement will promote, and will not constitute an \nunreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. The Secretary of \nState will submit the classified NPAS and accompanying annexes \nseparately in appropriate secure channels.\n  The Agreement was signed on July 26, 2000, and President Clinton \napproved and authorized execution and made the determinations required \nby section 123 b. of the Act (Presidential Determination 2000-26, 65 FR \n44403 (July 18, 2000)). However, immediately after signature, U.S. \nagencies received information that called into question the conclusions \nthat had been drawn in the required NPAS and the original classified \nannex, specifically, information implicating Turkish private entities \nin certain activities directly relating to nuclear proliferation. \nConsequently, the Agreement was not submitted to the Congress and the \nexecutive branch undertook a review of the NPAS evaluation.\n  My Administration has completed the NPAS review as well as an \nevaluation of actions taken by the Turkish government to address the \nproliferation activities of certain Turkish entities (once officials of \nthe U.S. Government brought them to the Turkish government's \nattention). The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy, and the \nmembers of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are confident that the \npertinent issues have been sufficiently resolved and that there is a \nsufficient basis (as set forth in the classified annexes, which will be \ntransmitted separately by the Secretary of State) to proceed with \ncongressional review of the Agreement and, if legislation is not \nenacted to disapprove it, to bring the Agreement into force.\n  In my judgment, entry into force of the Agreement will serve as a \nstrong incentive for Turkey to continue its support for \nnonproliferation objectives and enact future sound nonproliferation \npolicies and practices. It will also promote closer political and \neconomic ties with a NATO ally, and provide the necessary legal \nframework for U.S. industry to make nuclear exports to Turkey's planned \ncivil nuclear sector.\n  This transmittal shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsection 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act. My Administration is prepared to \nbegin immediate consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee as provided in \nsection 123 b. Upon completion of the period of 30 days of continuous \nsession provided for in section 123 b., the period of 60 days of \ncontinuous session provided for in section 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to prohibit \nthe\n\n[[Page S97]]\n\nSecretary of Veterans Affairs from collecting certain debts to the \nUnited States in the case of veterans who die as a result of a service-\nconnected disability incurred or aggravated on active duty in a combat \nzone, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a bill I filed \ntoday, the Combat Veterans Debt Elimination Act of 2008. This bill \nrequires the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to forgive \ncertain debts by our service members who have already paid the ultimate \nprice in combat. This bill is about honoring our fallen heroes by \ntreating the families they left behind with dignity, and by showing \nthem we truly mean it when we tell them our Nation is grateful.\n  If a member of our Armed Forces is killed and owes the Department of \nVeterans Affairs any outstanding debts, the Secretary of VA is required \nby law to notify the deceased family of the debt. I am appalled at \nthis. I am saddened. If a service member is killed in combat, his or \nher family has already paid enough. I cannot think of anything more \ninsulting than to tell a family who has just lost a loved one that they \nowe a couple of hundred dollars to the Government. I for one will not \nstand for this.\n  Let me explain the scope of this problem to illustrate how simple it \nshould be to fix. There are 22 service members who were killed in \ncombat fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan who have debts to the VA. If \nyou combined the debts of those 22 service members, the total amount of \ntheir debt would come to $56,366. In most cases the service member's \ndebt came in the form of educational benefit payments so they could go \nto college. During their enrollment at school, they were called into \nservice, and they were killed. Later on, the VA was forced to contact \nthe families of the deceased and notify them of those outstanding \ndebts. How tragic is this?\n  Three of the 22 cases occurred in my home State of Texas, which is \nmore than any other State. One fallen hero, a brave young man from \nRaymondville, TX, joined the Army in 1997, right out of high school \nwhere he was both an academic star, and an athletic star. He had been \naccepted to a prestigious university, but put service to his country \nfirst. He was on his 3rd tour in Iraq when he was killed by a sniper's \nbullet. When he died, he owed the Government $389 in education \nassistance payments. The Secretary of VA was required by law to contact \nthat family and ask for $389. I cannot imagine a more insensitive \nrequirement. The family paid this debt in full because they believed it \nwas the right thing to do. But did we do the right thing? I regret to \nsay we did not. I am embarrassed that this happened and I beseech my \ncolleagues to fix this problem today.\n  A second case involved an Army Sergeant from Missouri City, TX. After \nserving in the Marine Corps for a number of years, this young man \nenlisted in the Army. After high school he attended 2 different \ncolleges utilizing VA education benefits. When he was deployed, he \ndropped out of school to serve his country. He served one tour in \nAfghanistan and was on his 2nd tour in Iraq when he was killed by a \nbomb explosion. Because he had dropped out of school, the deceased owed \nthe VA $2,282. He is survived by a wife and 4 children. The family paid \nthe VA because they also believed it was the right thing to do.\n  The third Texas case involved a Marine reservist. He graduated from \nTexas A University and intended to be a cardiovascular surgeon. He \nhad received education assistance to go to the University. He was also \nkilled in an explosion in Iraq. He was married and had 2 small \nchildren. Two days before his death the VA sent him a letter saying he \nowed $845.\n  This is not a bill that should in any way fall into politics. This \nbill should be passed quickly on a bipartisan basis. There are cases \njust like the ones I mentioned in Wisconsin, North Carolina, Illinois, \nIowa, Connecticut, Nebraska, Colorado, Michigan, Washington, \nCalifornia, New York, Kentucky, Georgia and South Carolina. It is clear \nour entire Nation is affected and we have to do something now.\n  I know bills are usually referred to the committee of jurisdiction \nfor review. I have served in this distinguished body for 15 years. But \nI am convinced this is a special case, and so I am here today asking \nthe distinguished Majority and Minority Leaders to bring this bill to \nthe floor before another family suffers the indignity of the current \nlaw. The VA has no choice but to follow the law, but we, here in \nCongress, have the power to change it. We can and should correct this \nrequirement and honor the memories and the families of our fallen \nheroes.\n  I am calling on all of my colleagues to right this wrong immediately. \nWe cannot let this law stand another day. Our soldiers and their \nfamilies deserve better. Every day is crucial to passing this \nlegislation and I ask my colleagues to join with me in this endeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 2539. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na special depreciation allowance for certain property placed in service \nduring 2008 and 2009; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have sought recognition to introduce two bills with a \nview to aiding an emergency economic stimulus package. I am pleased to \nsee that the President and the Democratic leaders of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate have stated their intentions to work \ntogether to provide an economic stimulus package. There is no doubt, \nbased upon what is happening in markets around the world, that there is \nan urgent need for such a package.\n  It has been well known that the American people have not looked \nkindly on what is happening in Washington, DC. The approval ratings of \nthe President are low. The approval ratings of the Congress are low. It \nappears sometimes as if it is a race to the bottom as to who is going \nto be the lowest the fastest.\n  But now I think we have an opportunity, in the face of an emergency--\nwhat may accurately be described as a real crisis--to take some \neffective action. It is my hope we will move with dispatch, with all \ndue deliberation. We have the finest economic minds at work on the \nissue. There have been a lot of studies, and with our background of \nknowledge we are in a position to move.\n  There is no doubt the Congress can move promptly when the Congress \nhas the will to do so with the President. Congress and the President \nhave the capacity to move promptly. It is only a question of the will. \nI think this is an opportunity for the Federal Government to redeem \nitself in the eyes of the American people by acting.\n  I am pleased to see that Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke has acted \nthis morning to drop interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage \npoint to 3.5 percent. The Chairman of the Fed does not quite go so far \nas to say we are in a recession, but he has pretty dire news saying:\n\n       The committee took this action in view of a weakening of \n     the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth. \n     While strains in short-term funding markets have eased \n     somewhat, broader financial market conditions have continued \n     to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some \n     businesses and households.\n\n  I think it is really an understatement. I think the credit market is \na shambles, that if you look at the indicators in terms of borrowing on \na variety of sources, credit is simply not there.\n  Many had urged the Fed to lower the rate to 3 percent. Candidly, that \nwould have been my choice. But I think three-quarters of a percent is \ndecisive action, and that should be the starting point for an economic \npackage from Congress.\n  I appreciate the fact that the President has honored the wishes of \nthe leaders of the Democrats in Congress to await specifics until there \nhas been a meeting and a rejoinder of action. But I think the time has \ncome now to be specific.\n  The two legislative proposals which I am suggesting today deal with \ndepreciation schedules. Currently, there are depreciation schedules on \nthe 3-, 5-, and 7-year mark which my legislation would expense--or, \nthat is, depreciate--in the year when the expenditure is made. \nCalculating the cost of this legislation over a 10-year period, the \nJoint Committee on Taxation should find that it will not cost a great \ndeal on the books.\n  The second bill which I am introducing would give a bonus \ndepreciation\n\n[[Page S98]]\n\nof 50 percent on items purchased on all depreciation schedules. The \nbonus of 50 percent in 2008 or 50 percent in 2009, if the purchases are \nmade in either of these 2 years, will be a considerable stimulus.\n  These are not original ideas of mine; these ideas have been proposed \nfrom a variety of sources, including a commentary article from The Wall \nStreet Journal dated January 12, 2008. The ideas were forwarded last \nweek to the Secretary of Treasury, Secretary Paulson, and the Chairman \nof the Council of Economic Advisers, Edward Lazear.\n  It is my hope we will move promptly with an economic stimulus \npackage. It is my hope that while there may be divergent views and many \ndifferent points of view, that the efforts are being focused to the \nmaximum extent possible on progrowth ideas.\n  There is no doubt we have a very serious problem with credit today. \nWhat the Federal Reserve has done in lowering the rate three-quarters \nof a percent to 3.5 percent is a significant start, but more needs to \nbe done on seeing to it that credit is available in our economy.\n  Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce two pieces of \nlegislation designed to provide immediate economic stimulus for an \neconomy hindered by a housing crisis, rising oil prices, unemployment, \nsagging stock markets, and battered consumer confidence. Both bills I \nam introducing today, S. 2539 and S. 2540, provide incentives for firms \nto place new equipment and other assets into use, thus creating new job \nopportunities. Specifically, my proposals allow firms to deduct, or \nexpense, a greater share of new equipment in the year placed in \nservice. The need for aggressive action is becoming more apparent with \neach passing day.\n  There is increasing sentiment that timely action is needed by \nCongress to stimulate growth beyond what the Federal Reserve can \nachieve through lower interest rates. Many experts, including former \nFederal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and former Treasury Secretary \nLawrence H. Summers, have indicated that the U.S. economy is not faring \nwell and that a recession may be in our future.\n  Meanwhile, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has been hesitant to \nclassify the deteriorating economy as being in recession. However, in \nresponse to an international stock sell-off and the likelihood of a \nsharp drop in America, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark short-term \ninterest rate by \\3/4\\ of a percentage point to 3.5 percent this \nmorning, Tuesday January 22, 2007. In a statement, the Federal Reserve \nsaid: ``The committee took this action in view of a weakening of the \neconomic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth. While strains \nin short-term funding markets have eased somewhat, broader financial \nmarket conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has \ntightened further for some businesses and households.''\n  Our current economic difficulties were accentuated with the subprime \nmortgage crisis. With interest rates at all-time lows, lenders \nincreasingly offered mortgages to those who previously either would not \nhave qualified for a mortgage or could not have afforded the payments \non a mortgage. Many borrowers with adjustable rate, interest-only or \nno-down-payment mortgages have been unable to keep up with their \nmonthly mortgage payments that have reset to higher rates. The \nimplications of the subprime mortgage crisis have now spread beyond the \nhousing sector.\n  A mere 18,000 jobs were added in December, falling significantly \nshort from the 70,000 that were projected by industry analysts. \nAccording to the Labor Department's monthly report, the unemployment \nrate also jumped to 5 percent, up from November's 4.7 percent. Our \neconomy has not seen that level of unemployment in 2 years. On January \n2, 2007, crude oil prices hit the $100 per barrel milestone for the \nfirst time. The high cost of energy continues to drive up the cost of \ndoing business. This also means a higher cost of living for American \nconsumers. The Consumer Price Index increased 0.8 percent in November, \nits largest advance since September 2005. A weak holiday shopping \nseason also suggests that consumer confidence is low. According to the \nInternational Council of Shopping Centers, sales growth for retailers \nwas the lowest in 7 years.\n  On Friday, January 18, 2008, the President made clear that timely \naction is needed during a televised address with his economic advisors. \nThe President outlined a broad framework for an economic stimulus \npackage, one that: is big enough to make a difference; is built on \nbroad-based tax relief; is temporary and takes effect right away; and \ndoes not include any tax increases. Specifically, the President called \nfor Congress to enact temporary tax relief consisting of rebate checks \nfor individuals and investment incentives for businesses. He has tasked \nTreasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Ed Lazear, Chairman of the Council \non Economic Advisors, to work with Congress on agreeing on details of a \npackage.\n\n  Many in Congress are floating ideas for a package to kick-start the \neconomy, including boosting spending for extending unemployment \nbenefits and providing States with fiscal relief. No matter what the \nfinal product, it is my belief that any package passed into law should \ninclude tax incentives to spur immediate business investment. The two \nbills I introduce today are designed to help firms acquire new capital \nand expand their operations. Incentives for investment will lead to job \ncreation and help dampen the threat of a recession. In the long-term, \ninvestment incentives will lead to increased growth. On January 16, \n2008, I wrote to Edward Lazear, Chairman of the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisors, urging him to consider these proposals as \ncornerstones of any economic stimulus package. I sent a similar letter \nto Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson on January 18, 2008.\n  My first piece of legislation provides 2 years of ``bonus \ndepreciation'' for all sectors of the economy. Specifically, firms \nwould be allowed to expense 50 percent of the cost of new equipment in \nthe first year the asset is put to use. Remaining value would be \ndeducted over the course of its useful life by using the Internal \nRevenue Code depreciation schedules. By allowing firms to expense a \ngreater share of the value of an asset in the first year, this proposal \nfrees up additional resources for firms to hire more workers and expand \ntheir operations.\n  In the long-run, the cost of this proposal is minimal because it \nsimply accelerates a tax benefit that is due over time. This proposal \ndoes not create a new deduction. However, because this proposal will \naffect assets depreciated on schedules longer than 10 years, this bill \nwill have a static revenue cost over a 10-year scoring period.\n  The second piece of legislation I offer today will allow a variety of \nsectors to take advantage of one-hundred percent up-front expensing for \nnew assets that are placed into service during tax years 2008 and 2009. \nSpecifically, this legislation would allow all equipment which is \ncurrently depreciated on the 3-, 5-, and 7-year schedules to be fully \nexpensed in year one. Under current law, when a company buys an asset \nthat will last longer than 1 year, the company cannot, under most \ncircumstances, deduct the entire cost and enjoy an immediate tax \nbenefit. Instead, the company must depreciate the cost over the useful \nlife of the asset, taking a tax deduction for a part of the cost each \nyear. While the company will get to deduct the full cost of the asset, \ndelaying this benefit is a disadvantage to the company. By allowing \nfirms to deduct the cost of a new asset in year one, expensing spurs \nnew investments quickly, which helps to drive immediate job creation.\n  The assets that currently depreciate on these schedules are so varied \nthat virtually every sector of the economy would be able to take \nadvantage of this benefit and expand their businesses. Some of the \nassets and sectors on these schedules include office equipment, \ntransportation equipment, agriculture, textiles, furniture \nmanufacturing, steel products and high-tech manufacturing. I have \nincluded at the conclusion of this statement a full list of the asset \nclasses impacted by this bill.\n\n  One particular advantage to this legislation is the minimal cost \nimpact as viewed by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Congressional \nunit which investigates the operation and effects of internal revenue \ntaxes and the administration of such taxes. Because revenue legislation \nis scored over a 10-year\n\n[[Page S99]]\n\nwindow and the tax benefit inferred by this bill still occurs within \nthat span, quicker, it is my belief that the revenue impact will be \nnegligible. This point is of particular importance in the 110th \nCongress because of PAYGO scoring rules that require offsetting revenue \nraising provisions to be included in order to ``pay for'' tax relief.\n  A January 12, 2008, op-ed in the Wall Street Journal entitled ``The \nJFK Stimulus Plan,'' by Ernest S. Christian and Gary A. Robbins, \nprovides an excellent argument for the approach I have identified with \nthese two bills. According to Mr. Christian and Mr. Robbins, ``More \ninvestment means more productivity--and 80 percent of the net benefit \nfrom increased productivity goes to labor. Expensing is a no-risk tax \ncut. It worked four times in the 1960s and 1970s. It worked in 1981-\n1982 and again in 2002-2004.'' They cite a 2001 analysis conducted by \nthe Institute for Policy Innovation: ``Each $1 of tax cut from first-\nyear expensing produces about $9 of additional GDP growth.'' A copy of \nthe op-ed is included for the Record.\n  To address a short-run need for economic stimulus, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation as Congress begins making \nimportant decisions on how best to address our slumping economy. These \nbills are supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, Americans for Tax Reform, and the \nNational Restaurant Association.\n  In the long run, it is my belief that Congress should consider taking \nsteps to both enhance and make expensing tax benefits permanent. There \nare strong arguments for allowing all businesses to deduct these costs \nfully in the year paid instead of requiring them to collect a benefit \nover a long amount of time. In addition to the issue of providing tax \nincentives for businesses to invest in new growth capital, I believe it \nwill also be important in the long-run to provide sustained relief for \nAmerican taxpayers. The President has acknowledged that while passing a \nnew growth package is our most pressing economic priority, Congress \nneeds to turn next to making sure that tax relief that is now in place \nis not taken away.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to rapidly enact a \nbipartisan fiscal stimulus package to help our sluggish economy.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills of \nsupporting material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2539\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Christian and Gary A. Robbins)\n\n       Got an economic downturn? Need a stimulus package? Why not \n     adopt full or partial first-year expensing (or its cousin, \n     the investment tax credit), which has come to the rescue many \n     times since 1962, when President John F. Kennedy first \n     administered this type of remedy to the economy?\n       By allowing more of the cost of machinery and equipment to \n     be deducted more quickly, first-year expensing causes new \n     investment to be made sooner. More investment means more \n     productivity--and 80% of the net benefit from increased \n     productivity goes to labor. Expensing is a no-risk tax cut. \n     It worked four times in the 1960s and 1970s. It worked in \n     1981-1982 and again in 2002-2004.\n       It also has bipartisan appeal. Democrat Dan Rostenkowski \n     proposed it in 1981, when he was Chairman of the House Ways \n     and Means Committee. More recently, Democrat Max Baucus, the \n     current Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, was the \n     Senate sponsor of 30% partial expensing in 2002.\n       During the recession that started in 2000, the economy did \n     not respond much to a Keynesian tax cut in 2001, consisting \n     mostly of a new 10% bottom bracket for individuals and a \n     child credit. In the first quarter of 2001, real investment \n     began falling at an annual rate of 6%. The decline was \n     stopped by the 30% partial expensing enacted in the spring of \n     2002. Investment started rising again at a real annual rate \n     of 9% beginning with the enactment in 2003 of 50% partial \n     expensing, in combination with lower rates of tax on capital \n     gains and dividends.\n       Expensing is the favorite of tightfisted budgeters because \n     ultimately it pays for most of its cost. This is true even \n     when the Treasury uses old-fashioned static revenue estimates \n     that do not take into account feedback revenues from the \n     large amount of induced economic growth. Expensing is the \n     low-cost remedy because it does not create any new \n     deductions, but merely accelerates forward in time currently \n     allowable depreciation write-offs.\n       Much of the revenue payback starts quickly. In the case of \n     a full, first-year deduction for the cost of equipment with a \n     five-year depreciation life, the Treasury gets 52% of its \n     money back in the first two years. The economy gets a boost \n     even quicker.\n       In terms of the real benefit from capital investment--\n     induced economic growth and higher living standards--first-\n     year expensing produces enormous bang for the buck. \n     Experience in 2003-2004 shows that new orders for \n     manufacturing equipment and other business durables begin to \n     be placed within weeks of the enactment date. Small \n     businesses and other producers will not order what they do \n     not need. But when the price goes down (which is the effect \n     of expensing), they can afford to order what they do need \n     more quickly, and in larger volumes.\n       An analysis for the Institute for Policy Innovation in 2001 \n     concluded that, over time, each $1 of tax cut from first-year \n     expensing produces about $9 of additional GDP growth. The \n     high ratio occurs in large part because more capital \n     investment leads to more employment and higher wages.\n       Expensing is not the favorite of the financial accountants \n     who treat it as a tax deferral rather than a tax cut--and for \n     that reason it is probably also not the favorite of some \n     corporate financial officers. But it ranks very high with \n     economists, tax reformers and many members of Congress. In \n     fact, first-year expensing is not a stimulant for emergency \n     use only. It is the correct way to treat capital investment \n     and is, therefore, a key component of all mainstream tax-\n     reform proposals.\n       A surefire economic stimulus with an exceptional pedigree \n     that ultimately pays for most of its cost and can get enacted \n     ought to be at the top of the list for inclusion in President \n     George Bush's upcoming State of the Union message. It ought \n     also to be made a permanent part of the tax code.\n       Although essentially revenue neutral in the long run, full \n     and permanent fist-year expensing is not ``free'' from a \n     budget-accounting standpoint. The static revenue cost may on \n     average be as much as $80 billion per year until it is paid \n     back. But these sums do not take into account feedbacks, and \n     are relatively small compared to all the money that simply \n     falls through the cracks on the spending side of the budget. \n     And then there are all the earmarks and other waste.\n       Surely Congress and the administration can find enough \n     money to finance the temporary cost of a much needed tax \n     reform that will make the American people at least $2.5 \n     trillion better off through economic growth.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 15, 2008.\n     Hon.

Your \n     accelerated cost recovery proposals would, in the short run, \n     act as an insurance policy by encouraging immediate \n     investment, and, in the long run, would increase productivity \n     and further the prospects for long-term economic growth.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue.

Henry M. Paulson, Jr.,\n     Secretary, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Paulson: I am writing to bring to your \n     attention two pieces of legislation which I plan to introduce \n     when the Senate returns on Tuesday, January 22, 2008, to \n     provide immediate economic stimulus for an economy hindered \n     by a housing crisis, rising oil prices, unemployment, sagging \n     stock markets, and battered consumer confidence. Both are \n     designed to spur new business investments through the use of \n     partial- and full-expensing. By allowing firms to expense a \n     greater share of the value of an asset in the first year, \n     these proposals free up additional resources for firms to \n     hire more workers and expand their operations.\n       The first bill provides two years of ``bonus depreciation'' \n     for all sectors of the economy.\n\n[[Page S105]]\n\n     Specifically, firms would be allowed to expense fifty percent \n     of the cost of new equipment in the first year the asset is \n     put to use. Remaining value would be deducted over the course \n     of its useful life by using the Internal Revenue Code \n     depreciation schedules.\n       The second bill allows a variety of sectors to take \n     advantage of one-hundred percent up-front expensing for new \n     assets that are placed into service during tax years 2008 and \n     2009. Specifically, this legislation would allow all \n     equipment which is currently depreciated on the three-, five-\n     , and seven-year schedules to be fully expensed in year one. \n     One particular advantage to this legislation is the minimal \n     cost impact as viewed by the Joint Committee on Taxation. \n     Because revenue legislation is scored over a ten-year window \n     and the tax benefit inferred by this bill still occurs within \n     that span (only quicker), the revenue impact will be \n     negligible.\n       I believe that these proposals should be the cornerstone of \n     any economic stimulus package crafted by the Administration \n     and/or Congress. To that end, I urge you to review these \n     proposals and include them in any potential stimulus package.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 16, 2008.\n     Hon.

Nearly half of all American adults \n     have worked in a restaurant and 32 percent of adults got \n     their first job experience in a restaurant. Eight out of 10 \n     salaried employees in restaurants started as hourly employees \n     and the restaurant industry employs more minority managers \n     than any other industry. Furthermore, more than one in nine \n     restaurants are involved in some type of charitable activity.\n       We commend you for introducing this legislation that would \n     help stimulate the economy by allowing businesses, like \n     restaurants, to use partial- and full-expensing and spur on \n     new investments. Under current law, when a company buys an \n     asset that will last longer than one year, the company \n     cannot, under most circumstances, deduct the entire cost and \n     enjoy an immediate tax benefit. Instead, the company must \n     depreciate the cost over the useful life of the asset, taking \n     a tax deduction for a part of the cost each year. By allowing \n     firms to deduct the cost of a new asset in year one, \n     expensing spurs new investments quickly and drives immediate \n     job creation.\n       It is clear an economic stimulus package is needed quickly \n     to help the U.S. economy. Restaurants are in the unique \n     position to help by creating more demand for projects that \n     will bring increased opportunity for new construction and \n     improvements to our businesses. The restaurant industry will \n     quickly respond to signals and take advantage of bonus \n     depreciation periods, as we have done in the past, should \n     such provisions be enacted into law.\n       Restaurants also have a great opportunity to create more \n     jobs for Americans. Not only will we build new locations and \n     improve existing ones, thereby creating more jobs within the \n     restaurant industry, but we can also generate jobs in other \n     sectors of the economy. According to the Bureau of Economic \n     Analysis, every dollar spent in the construction industry \n     generates an additional $2.39 in spending in the rest of the \n     economy, while every $1 million spent in the construction \n     industry creates more than 28 jobs in the overall economy.\n       Again, we commend you and support your efforts with these \n     two pieces of legislation. We look forward to working with \n     you as discussions quickly move forward to craft an economic \n     stimulus package for the country.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                     John Gay,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                             Government Affairs and Public Policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2541.

A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to provide for \nenhanced disclosure under an open end credit plan; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Credit Card \nMinimum Payment Notification Act.\n  Many Americans now own multiple credit cards. The average American \nhas four credit cards, and 1 in 7 Americans hold more than 10 cards.\n  The proliferation of credit cards can be traced, in part, to a \ndramatic increase in credit card solicitation. In 1990, credit card \ncompanies sent about 1.1 billion solicitations to American homes; in \n2006, they sent over 9.2 billion.\n  As one would expect, the increase in credit card ownership has also \nyielded an increase in credit card debt. Individuals get 6, 7, or 8 \ndifferent credit cards, pay only the minimum payment required, and many \nend up drowning in debt. That happens in case after case.\n  Over the past two decades, the credit card debt of American consumers \nhas nearly tripled--from $238 billion in 1989 to a staggering $800 \nbillion in 2005.\n  As a result, the average American household now has about $9,500 of \ncredit card debt. That is almost twice the average level of credit card \ndebt from just 10 years ago.\n  In light of these figures it should be no surprise that vast numbers \nof Americans have been filing for bankruptcy in recent years. In 2005--\njust before the implementation date of the Bankruptcy Reform Act--over \n2 million non-business bankruptcies were filed.\n  Many of these personal bankruptcies are people who utilize credit \ncards. The benefits and flexibility these cards offer are enormously \nattractive. However, these individual credit card holders receive no \ninformation on the impact of carrying a balance with compounding \ninterest. Too often individuals make just the minimum payment. They pay \nit for 1 year, 2 years--they make additional purchases, they get \nanother card, and another, and another.\n  After, 2 or 3 years, many find that the interest on the debt is \nlarger than the total purchases they originally made, such that they \ncan never repay these cards--and they do not know what to do about it.\n  The Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act would help prevent \nthis problem. Let me tell you exactly what the bill would do. It would \nrequire credit card companies to add two items to each consumer's \nmonthly credit card statement: a notice warning credit card holders \nthat making only the minimum payment each month will increase the \ninterest they\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\npay and the amount of time it takes to repay their debt; and examples \nof the amount of time and money required to repay a credit card debt if \nonly minimum payments are made.\n  If the consumer makes only minimum payments for, 6 consecutive \nmonths, the amount of time and money required to repay the individual's \nspecific credit card debt, under the terms of their credit card \nagreement.\n  The bill would also require that a toll-free number be included on \nstatements, to allow consumers to call and speak to a live person to \nget an estimate of the time and money required to repay their balance \nif only minimum payments are made.\n  If the consumer makes only minimum payments for 6 consecutive months, \nthey will receive a toll-free number for an accredited credit \ncounseling service.\n  The disclosure requirements in this bill would only apply if the \nconsumer has a minimum payment that is less than 10 percent of the debt \non the credit card. Otherwise, none of these disclosures would be \nrequired on their statement.\n  Statistics vary about the number of individuals who make only the \nminimum payments. One study in 2004 determined that 35 million people \npay only the minimum on their credit cards. In a 2005 poll, 40 percent \nof respondents said that they pay the minimum or slightly more.\n  What is certain is that many Americans pay only the minimum, and that \npaying only the minimum has harsh financial consequences.\n  I suspect that most people would be surprised to know how much \ninterest can pile up when paying the minimum. Take the average \nhousehold, with $9,500 of credit card debt, and the average credit card \ninterest rate, which last week was 13.74 percent. If only the 2 percent \nminimum payment is made, it will take them 35 years and $21,799.07 to \npay off the card.\n  That is if the family doesn't spend another cent on their credit \ncards--an unlikely assumption. In other words, the family will need to \npay over $12,000 in interest to repay just $9,500 of principal.\n  For individuals or families with more than average debt, the pitfalls \nare even greater. $20,000 of credit card debt at the average 13.74 \npercent interest rate will take 42 years and more than $46,300 to pay \noff if only the minimum payments are made.\n  Mr. President, 13.74 percent is only the average rate. Interest rates \naround 20 percent are not uncommon. Penalty interest rates on credit \ncards average 27.3 percent, and seven major credit cards charge penalty \nrates of more than 30 percent.\n  Even if we assume only a 20 percent interest rate, a family that has \nthe average debt of $9,500 at a 20 percent interest rate and makes the \nminimum payments will need an incredible 82 years and $55,084 to pay \noff that initial $9,500 of debt. That's $45,584 in interest payments--\nan amount that approaches 5 times the original debt. These examples are \nfar from extreme.\n  Last March, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs heard testimony \nfrom Wesley Wannemacher, a consumer from Lima, OH.\n  Mr. Wannemacher charged $3,200 to a credit card in 2001 and 2002. He \nnever charged anything on the card again, but he spent the next 6 years \nstruggling to pay it off, as he experienced the kinds of events that \nAmerican households routinely face--unexpected medical expenses, a \ngrowing family, and so on.\n  By early 2007 Mr. Wannemacher had paid $6,300 on the initial $3,200 \nin debt, but he still owed $4,400 on the card. Interest charges, late \nfees, and $1,500 in fees for going over the limit--even though the \nbalance had only exceeded the limit three times--had resulted in total \ncharges of $10,700 for that initial $3,200 in credit.\n  Fortunately for Mr. Wannemacher, his credit card company reviewed his \naccount--after it became known that he was going to testify to Congress \nabout his experience. The remaining balance on his account was \nforgiven.\n  Mr. President, testifying before a Senate committee is not something \nthat Americans could--or should have to--do to escape from crushing \ncredit card debt.\n  That is one of the reasons why it is so important for this Congress \nto pass the Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act.\n  There will always be people who cannot afford to pay more than their \nminimum payments. But there is also a large number of consumers who can \nafford to pay more but feel comfortable paying the minimum payment \nbecause they don't realize the consequences of doing so.\n  Now I am certainly not trying to demonize credit cards or the credit \ncard industry. Credit cards are an important part of everyday life, and \nthey help the economy operate more smoothly by giving consumers and \nmerchants a reliable, convenient way to exchange funds.\n  However, I do think that people should understand the dangers of \npaying only their monthly minimums. In this way individuals will be \nable to act responsibly.\n  The bottom line is that for many consumers, the two percent minimum \npayment is a financial trap.\n  The Credit Card Minimum Payment Notification Act is designed to \nensure that people are not caught in this trap through lack of \ninformation. The bill tracks the language of an amendment I cosponsored \nduring the debate on the 2005 bankruptcy bill.\n  The language of this bill is based on a California law, the \nCalifornia Credit Card Payment Warning Act, passed in 2001. \nUnfortunately, in 2002, this California law was struck down in U.S. \nDistrict Court as being preempted by the 1968 Truth in Lending Act.\n  The Truth in Lending Act was enacted in part because Congress found \nthat, ``The informed use of credit results from an awareness of the \ncost thereof by consumers.''\n  This bill would amend the Truth in Lending Act, and would also \nfurther its core purpose.\n  These disclosures will allow consumers to know exactly what it means \nfor them to carry a balance and only make minimum payments, so they can \nmake informed decisions on credit card use and repayment.\n  The disclosure required by this bill is straightforward--how much it \nwill cost to pay off the debt if only minimum payments are made, and \nhow long it will take to do it. As for expense, my staff tells me that \non the Web site Cardweb.com, there is a free interest calculator that \ndoes these calculations in under a second. Moreover, I am told that \nbanks make these calculations internally to determine credit risk. The \nexpense of making these disclosures would be minimal.\n  Percentage rates and balances are constantly changing, and each \nmonth, the credit card companies are able to assess the minimum \npayment, late fees, over-the-limit fees and finance charges for \nmillions of accounts.\n  If the credit card companies can put in their bills what the minimum \nmonthly payment is, they can certainly figure out how to disclose to \ntheir customers how much it might cost them if they stick to that \nminimum payment.\n  The credit card industry is the most profitable sector of banking, \nand in 2006 it made $36.8 billion in profits--an increase of nearly 80 \npercent from their profits in 2000. I don't think they will have any \ntrouble implementing the requirements of this bill.\n  I believe that this legislation is extraordinarily important and that \nit will reduce bankruptcies. In the face of the subprime mortgage \ncrisis, and as we appear to be heading toward a recession, this bill is \nneeded now more than ever.\n  The harsh effects of the 2005 bankruptcy bill are starting to become \napparent. I continue to believe that a bill requiring a limited but \nmeaningful disclosure by credit card companies is a necessary \naccompaniment. I think you will see consumers acting more cautiously if \nthese disclosures are made, and I believe that will be good for the \nbankruptcy courts in terms of reducing their caseloads, and also good \nfor American consumers.\n  The credit card debt problem facing our Nation is significant. I \nbelieve that this bill is an important step in providing individuals \nwith the information needed to act responsibly, and it does so with a \nminimal burden on the industry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S107]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2542\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today in Washington, DC, thousands \nof people of all ages are taking part in the annual March for Life and \nstaking a claim for the rights of the unborn. I commend them and am in \nawe of their great dedication to the cause of protecting life. I share \ntheir strong pro-life beliefs, and I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of the Child Custody Protection Act that is being introduced \ntoday.\n  This is one of the most important pieces of legislation to be \nintroduced during this Congress, and for good reason. While more than \n20 States require a minor to receive parental consent prior to \nobtaining an abortion, these laws are being violated. Today, minors, \nwith the assistance of adults--who are not their parents--are being \ntransported across State lines to receive abortions without obtaining \nparental consent. We need to end this circumvention of State laws and, \nfar more importantly, the consequences such actions have on life.\n\n[[Page S108]]\n\n  This legislation would make it a Federal offense to knowingly \ntransport a minor across a State line for the purpose of an abortion, \nin circumvention of a State's parental consent or notification laws, \nunless it is needed to save the life of the minor. We have attempted to \nenact similar legislation in previous Congresses without success, and \nit is critical that we do not allow opponents to further stall its \nenactment.\n  I am and always have been pro-life, and my record during my tenure in \nCongress reflects my strong belief that life is sacred. We must stand \nup for the rights of the unborn and do all that we can to enact this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Reed, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Brown):\n  S. 2544. A bill to provide for a program of temporary extended \nunemployment compensation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is clear that our economy is going \nfrom bad to worse. Every day the headlines bring more bad news. Fuel \nprices are going through the roof. Millions of families are at risk of \nlosing their homes. Bankruptcies have risen by 40 percent in the last \nyear alone.\n  Most alarming, we are seeing a drastic rise in the number of \nAmericans out of work. In December, half a million more Americans were \nunemployed than the month before. Today nearly 8 million Americans are \nlooking for a job and can't find one. The national unemployment rate \nhas shot up to 5 percent--the biggest increase since the last \nrecession. Experts say this number will rise well above 6 percent in \n2009. Vulnerable parts of our population have been hit even harder--\nlast month, 9 percent of African-American workers were unemployed, up \nsharply from 8.4 percent in November. Latino workers now have an \nunemployment rate of 6 percent.\n  What's more, we are seeing a large number of out-of-work Americans \nwho still can't find a new job months later. Nearly one out of five \nAmericans who is looking for work has been out of a job for over 6 \nmonths--compared with roughly one out of ten in 2001, before the last \nrecession. With only 4 million job openings and nearly 8 million \nunemployed Americans, there are two workers for every job. As \nunemployment rises, there will be even more workers competing for each \njob. As highlighted in yesterday's front-page article in the Washington \nPost, this problem is affecting workers across our economy--even those \nwith college educations and years of experience can't find work.\n  These aren't just statistics. These numbers are coworkers, our \nrelatives, our neighbors. For each and every one of those families, a \npink slip can spell economic disaster.\n  Losing a job isn't just losing a paycheck--it can mean losing the \nresults of years of hard work and sacrifice.\n  For too many families, losing a job means losing health insurance. \nWithout insurance, an unexpected hospital stay--from a broken leg or a \ncancer diagnosis--means certain financial disaster. Mr. President, 77 \npercent of middle class Americans do not have enough assets to pay \nessential expenses for 3 months. Without a paycheck, the rising price \nof daily necessities--housing, gasoline, and even groceries--becomes \nimpossible to afford.\n  Our unemployment insurance program is intended to help workers \nweather a job loss. Workers pay into the program throughout their \ncareers. If they lose their jobs, they can collect a benefit while they \nlook for work. The amounts are modest--typically less than half of a \nworker's regular wages--but they help families to pay their rent, keep \nthe house warm, and put food on the table.\n  In good economic times, such benefits are enough to tide workers and \ntheir families over for the few weeks it takes to find a job. But these \nare not good times. It is taking longer and longer for unemployed \nAmericans to find new work. Over 1.3 million Americans have been \nlooking for a job for 6 months or more. As a result, an increasing \nnumber of workers have not found a new job by the time their \nunemployment benefits run out. Over the past year, over 2.6 million \nAmericans--or 35 percent of all unemployed workers--have exhausted \ntheir unemployment benefits. Unless we respond soon, these and other \nfamilies will be left in the cold.\n  So we must act, and we must act now, to help these workers before \nfinancial disaster strikes. That is why I am introducing legislation \ntoday to give workers the help they need and have earned. The Emergency \nUnemployment Compensation Extension Act will ensure that Americans who \nkeep looking for work but can't find a job after 6 months will be \neligible for up to 20 weeks of additional benefits. In very high-\nunemployment States, workers could also receive up to 13 more weeks of \nbenefits. Because out-of-work families are facing skyrocketing costs of \ngas, home heating, food, and housing, long-term unemployed workers will \ntemporarily receive $50 extra each week to help pay their bills.\n  Providing this extension is a matter of fairness. We owe it to all \nworkers who have lost their jobs in this struggling economy to provide \nhelp while they look for new jobs. Out-of-work Americans have worked \nhard all their lives. They have paid into the unemployment insurance \nsystem with the promise they would receive its protection when our \neconomy is in crisis. Part of the American Dream is the opportunity to \nwork hard, provide for your family, put your children through school, \nand save for retirement. When the economy isn't working the way it \nshould and the jobs simply aren't there, we must stick together. We \nmust take care of those who can't find a job.\n  But there's another major reason to act. Economists agree that \nextending unemployment benefits is a powerful, cost-effective way to \ndeliver a boost to the economy. The extension of benefits puts money \ninto the hands of those who need assistance the most and are most \nlikely to spend it immediately on basic essentials. This means money is \nflowing immediately to local businesses, which will in turn provide a \nfurther economic boost.\n  Indeed, according to a report by Mark Zandi of Moody's, each dollar \ninvested in benefits to out-of-work Americans leads to a $1.73 increase \nin growth--the most of any measure tested. That compares with only \npennies on the dollar for cuts in income tax rates or cuts in taxes on \ninvestments.\n  The Congressional Budget Office agrees. Its report last week on \nshort-term economic stimulus found that extending unemployment benefits \nis among the most cost-effective, potent, temporary steps that Congress \ncan take to jump-start our economy.\n  This is a tried and true approach to helping working families in \neconomic downturns. In each recession since the late 1950s, Congress \nhas extended unemployment benefits to those who have exhausted their \nbenefits and can't find work. It has often done so by overwhelming, \nbipartisan votes. Layoffs don't discriminate by party.\n  Extending unemployment benefits is the right thing to do for the \neconomy and the fair thing to do for workers. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in helping out-of-work Americans and putting our economy back \non track.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/01/22/senate-section/article/S108-1", "month": "01", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S108-S109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 419--HONORING THE LIFE AND EXTRAORDINARY \n                      CONTRIBUTIONS OF DIANE WOLF\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Coleman) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

RESOLUTION OF APOLOGY TO NATIVE PEOPLES OF UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the ancestors of today's Native Peoples inhabited the \n     land of the present-day United States since time immemorial \n     and for thousands of years before the arrival of people of \n     European descent;\n       (2) for millennia, Native Peoples have honored, protected, \n     and stewarded this land we cherish;\n       (3) Native Peoples are spiritual people with a deep and \n     abiding belief in the Creator, and for millennia Native \n     Peoples have maintained a powerful spiritual connection to \n     this land, as evidenced by their customs and legends;\n       (4) the arrival of Europeans in North America opened a new \n     chapter in the history of Native Peoples;\n       (5) while establishment of permanent European settlements \n     in North America did stir conflict with nearby Indian tribes, \n     peaceful and mutually beneficial interactions also took \n     place;\n       (6) the foundational English settlements in Jamestown, \n     Virginia, and Plymouth, Massachusetts, owed their survival in \n     large measure to the compassion and aid of Native Peoples in \n     the vicinities of the settlements;\n       (7) in the infancy of the United States, the founders of \n     the Republic expressed their desire for a just relationship \n     with the Indian tribes, as evidenced by the Northwest \n     Ordinance enacted by Congress in 1787, which begins with the \n     phrase, ``The utmost good faith shall always be observed \n     toward the Indians'';\n       (8) Indian tribes provided great assistance to the \n     fledgling Republic as it strengthened and grew, including \n     invaluable help to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on \n     their epic journey from St. Louis, Missouri, to the Pacific \n     Coast;\n       (9) Native Peoples and non-Native settlers engaged in \n     numerous armed conflicts;\n       (10) the Federal Government violated many of the treaties \n     ratified by Congress and other diplomatic agreements with \n     Indian tribes;\n       (11) the United States should address the broken treaties \n     and many of the more ill-conceived Federal policies that \n     followed, such as extermination, termination, forced removal \n     and relocation, the outlawing of traditional religions, and \n     the destruction of sacred places;\n       (12) the United States forced Indian tribes and their \n     citizens to move away from their traditional homelands and \n     onto federally established and controlled reservations, in \n     accordance with such Acts as the Act of May 28, 1830 (4 Stat. \n     411, chapter 148) (commonly known as the ``Indian Removal \n     Act'');\n       (13) many Native Peoples suffered and perished--\n       (A) during the execution of the official Federal Government \n     policy of forced removal, including the infamous Trail of \n     Tears and Long Walk;\n       (B) during bloody armed confrontations and massacres, such \n     as the Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 and the Wounded Knee \n     Massacre in 1890; and\n       (C) on numerous Indian reservations;\n       (14) the Federal Government condemned the traditions, \n     beliefs, and customs of Native Peoples and endeavored to \n     assimilate them by such policies as the redistribution of \n     land under the Act of February 8, 1887 (25 U.S.C. 331; 24 \n     Stat. 388, chapter 119) (commonly known as the ``General \n     Allotment Act''), and the forcible removal of Native children \n     from their families to faraway boarding schools where their \n     Native practices and languages were degraded and forbidden;\n       (15) officials of the Federal Government and private United \n     States citizens harmed Native Peoples by the unlawful \n     acquisition of recognized tribal land and the theft of tribal \n     resources and assets from recognized tribal land;\n       (16) the policies of the Federal Government toward Indian \n     tribes and the breaking of covenants with Indian tribes have \n     contributed to the severe social ills and economic troubles \n     in many Native communities today;\n       (17) despite the wrongs committed against Native Peoples by \n     the United States, Native Peoples have remained committed to \n     the protection of this great land, as evidenced by the fact \n     that, on a per capita basis, more Native Peoples have served \n     in the United States Armed Forces and placed themselves in \n     harm's way in defense of the United States in every major \n     military conflict than any other ethnic group;\n       (18) Indian tribes have actively influenced the public life \n     of the United States by continued cooperation with Congress \n     and the\n\n[[Page S110]]\n\n     Department of the Interior, through the involvement of Native \n     individuals in official Federal Government positions, and by \n     leadership of their own sovereign Indian tribes;\n       (19) Indian tribes are resilient and determined to \n     preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their \n     unique cultural identities;\n       (20) the National Museum of the American Indian was \n     established within the Smithsonian Institution as a living \n     memorial to Native Peoples and their traditions; and\n       (21) Native Peoples are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable rights, and among those are life, \n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n       (b) Acknowledgment and Apology.--The United States, acting \n     through Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the special legal and political relationship \n     Indian tribes have with the United States and the solemn \n     covenant with the land we share;\n       (2) commends and honors Native Peoples for the thousands of \n     years that they have stewarded and protected this land;\n       (3) recognizes that there have been years of official \n     depredations, ill-conceived policies, and the breaking of \n     covenants by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes;\n       (4) apologizes on behalf of the people of the United States \n     to all Native Peoples for the many instances of violence, \n     maltreatment, and neglect inflicted on Native Peoples by \n     citizens of the United States;\n       (5) expresses its regret for the ramifications of former \n     wrongs and its commitment to build on the positive \n     relationships of the past and present to move toward a \n     brighter future where all the people of this land live \n     reconciled as brothers and sisters, and harmoniously steward \n     and protect this land together;\n       (6) urges the President to acknowledge the wrongs of the \n     United States against Indian tribes in the history of the \n     United States in order to bring healing to this land by \n     providing a proper foundation for reconciliation between the \n     United States and Indian tribes; and\n       (7) commends the State governments that have begun \n     reconciliation efforts with recognized Indian tribes located \n     in their boundaries and encourages all State governments \n     similarly to work toward reconciling relationships with \n     Indian tribes within their boundaries.\n       (c) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this section--\n       (1) authorizes or supports any claim against the United \n     States; or\n       (2) serves as a settlement of any claim against the United \n     States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3894.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Injunction \nof Secrecy be removed from the following treaties transmitted to the \nSenate on January 22, 2008, by the President of the United States: \nExtradition Treaty with Romania and Protocol to the Treaty on Mutual \nLegal Assistance in Criminal Matters with Romania, Treaty Document No. \n110-11; Extradition Treaty with Bulgaria and an Agreement on Certain \nAspects of Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters with Bulgaria, \nTreaty Document No. 110-12; and International Convention on Control of \nHarmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, Treaty Document No. 110-13; I \nfurther ask that the treaties be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that they be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's messages be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the \nUnited States of America and Romania (the ``Extradition Treaty'' or the \n``Treaty'') and the Protocol to the Treaty between the United States of \nAmerica and Romania on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters (the \n``Protocol''), both signed at Bucharest on September 10, 2007. I also \ntransmit, for the information of the Senate, the reports of the \nDepartment of State with respect to the Extradition Treaty and \nProtocol.\n  The Extradition Treaty would replace the outdated Extradition Treaty \nbetween the United States and Romania, signed in Bucharest on July 23, \n1924, and the Supplementary Extradition Treaty, signed in Bucharest on \nNovember 10, 1936. The Protocol amends the Treaty Between the United \nStates of America and Romania on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal \nMatters, signed in Washington on May 26, 1999 (the ``1999 Mutual Legal \nAssistance Treaty''). Both the Extradition Treaty and the Protocol also \nfulfill the requirements for bilateral instruments (between the United \nStates and each European Union (EU) Member State) that are contained in \nthe Extradition and Mutual Legal Assistance Agreements between the \nUnited States and the EU currently before the Senate.\n  The Extradition Treaty follows generally the form and content of \nother extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States. It \nwould replace an outmoded list of extraditable offenses with a modern \n``dual criminality'' approach, which would enable extradition for such \noffenses as money laundering and other newer offenses not appearing on \nthe list. The Treaty also contains a modernized ``political offense'' \nclause, and it provides that neither Party shall refuse extradition \nbased on the citizenship of the person sought. Finally, the new Treaty \nincorporates a series of procedural improvements to streamline and \nspeed the extradition process. The Protocol primarily serves to amend \nthe 1999 Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in areas required pursuant to \nthe U.S.-EU Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement, specifically: mutual \nlegal assistance to administrative authorities; expedited transmission \nof requests; use limitations; identification of bank information; joint \ninvestigative teams; and video conferencing.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Extradition Treaty and the Protocol, along with the U.S.-EU \nExtradition and Mutual Legal Assistance Agreements and the other \nrelated bilateral instruments between the United States and European \nUnion Member States.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, January 22, 2008.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the \nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of the \nRepublic of Bulgaria (the ``Extradition Treaty'' or the ``Treaty'') and \nthe Agreement on Certain Aspects of Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal \nMatters between the Government of the United States of America and the \nGovernment of the\n\n[[Page S155]]\n\nRepublic of Bulgaria (the ``MLA Agreement''), both signed at Sofia on \nSeptember 19, 2007. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, \nthe report of the Department of State with respect to the Extradition \nTreaty and the MLA Agreement.\n  The new Extradition Treaty would replace the outdated Extradition \nTreaty between the United States and Bulgaria, signed in Sofia on March \n19, 1924, and the Supplementary Extradition Treaty, signed in \nWashington on June 8, 1934. The MLA Agreement is the first agreement \nbetween the two countries on mutual legal assistance in criminal \nmatters. Both the Extradition Treaty and the MLA Agreement fulfill the \nrequirements for bilateral instruments (between the United States and \neach European Union (EU) Member State) that are contained in the \nExtradition and Mutual Legal Assistance Agreements between the United \nStates and the EU currently before the Senate.\n  The Extradition Treaty follows generally the form and content of \nother extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States. It \nwould replace an outmoded list of extraditable offenses with a modern \n``dual criminality'' approach, which would enable extradition for such \noffenses as money laundering, and other newer offenses not appearing on \nthe list. The Treaty also contains a modernized ``political offense'' \nclause, and it provides that extradition shall not be refused based on \nthe nationality of a person sought for any of a comprehensive list of \nserious offenses. Finally, the new Treaty incorporates a series of \nprocedural improvements to streamline and speed the extradition \nprocess.\n  Because the United States and Bulgaria do not have a bilateral mutual \nlegal assistance treaty in force between them, the MLA Agreement is a \npartial treaty governing only those issues regulated by the U.S.-EU \nMutual Legal Assistance Agreement, specifically: identification of bank \ninformation, joint investigative teams, video-conferencing, expedited \ntransmission of requests, assistance to administrative authorities, use \nlimitations, confidentiality, and grounds for refusal. This approach is \nconsistent with that taken with the other EU Member States (Denmark, \nFinland, Malta, Portugal, Slovak Republic, and Slovenia) with which the \nUnited States did not have an existing mutual legal assistance treaty.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Extradition Treaty and MLA Agreement, along with the U.S.-EU \nExtradition and Mutual Legal Assistance Agreements and the other \nrelated bilateral instruments between the United States and European \nUnion Member States.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, January 22, 2008.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to its \nratification, the International Convention on the Control of Harmful \nAnti-Fouling Systems on Ships, 2001 (the ``Convention'').\n  The Convention aims to control the harmful effects of anti-fouling \nsystems, which are used on the hulls of ships to prevent the growth of \nmarine organisms. These systems are necessary to increase fuel \nefficiency and minimize the transport of hull-borne species; however, \nanti-fouling systems can also have negative effects on the marine \nenvironment, including when a vessel remains in place for a period of \ntime (such as in port).\n  To mitigate these effects, the Convention prohibits Parties from \nusing organotin-based anti-fouling systems on their ships, and it \nprohibits ships that use such systems from entering Parties' ports, \nshipyards, or offshore terminals. The Convention authorizes controls on \nuse of other anti-fouling systems that could be added in the future, \nafter a comprehensive review process.\n  The Convention was adopted at a Diplomatic Conference of the \nInternational Maritime Organization in October 2001 and signed by the \nUnited States on December 12, 2002. The United States played a \nleadership role in the negotiation and development of the Convention. \nWith Panama's ratification of the Convention on September 17, 2007, 25 \nStates representing over 25 percent of the world's merchant shipping \ntonnage have now ratified the Convention. Therefore, the Convention \nwill enter into force on September 17, 2008. Organotin-based anti-\nfouling systems are specifically regulated through the Organotin Anti-\nFouling Paint Control Act of 1988 (OAPCA), 33 U.S.C. 2401-2410. New \nlegislation is required to fully implement the Convention and will take \nthe form of a complete revision and replacement of OAPCA. All \ninterested executive branch agencies support ratification. I recommend \nthat the Senate give early and favorable consideration to the \nConvention and give its advice and consent to its ratification, with \nthe declaration set out in the analysis of Article 16 in the attached \narticle-by-article analysis.\n                                                      George W.
