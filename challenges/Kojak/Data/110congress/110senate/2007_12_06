Mr. President, I always try and be aware of what happens in \nthe morning news. The first thing I do when I get up in the morning is \nlisten to what is on the radio as to what has developed over the night. \nEveryone knows I have criticized the President on occasion, but I think \nit is also appropriate, when we hear some good news, to throw an \naccolade toward the President on occasions when there are good things \nto talk about.\n  I am confident of the reports we get this morning that the President \nsent a personal letter to North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-Il. He sent a \nletter. That is important. I have not read the letter, but all the news \naccounts indicate it is meant as a message to the leader of North \nKorea, to send a message that we want to work with North Korea. That is \na positive step to breathe new energy into our diplomatic efforts with \nNorth Korea.\n  I have long advocated that we must reach out to people, even though \nwe don't like how they are conducting their government. Diplomacy must \nbe grounded in communication and the personal touch. In taking this \nstep with North Korea, I believe President Bush is taking a page out of \nRonald Reagan's book of diplomacy.\n  There was no elected official, at the time President Reagan was \nelected President, who more disliked the Soviet Union and the Communist \nway of government and life. But the President, President Reagan, \nreached out to them. In his first day in office, he sent diplomats to \nthe Soviet Union to try to work things out. As a result of that, he \nheld meetings with people he didn't admire and maybe even respect, but \nhe did that because he believed, as did Jim Baker, as Secretary of \nState, that it was the right thing to do. And it proved to be the right \nthing to do.\n\n  Too many throughout the world have come to view America's approach \nthis past 7 years as ``shoot first, talk later.'' I take this letter as \na sign that President Bush has learned that communication is not a sign \nof weakness but a sign of strength.\n  As I have been saying since the national intelligence report on Iran \nwas published earlier this week, we should be taking a diplomatic surge \napproach to Iran. The President should make Secretary Rice and \nSecretary Gates available to meet with their Iranian counterparts to \nbegin those long overdue diplomatic efforts.\n  On another subject, Secretary Paulson this morning, with the \nPresident, will unveil the administration's strategy to address the \ncrisis in subprime lending. We know the effort will not cover \neverything, but it is a step in the right direction. We don't know the \ndetails of this plan yet, but I am glad to see the White House \nbeginning to address this awful situation that now threatens the homes, \nsecurity, and the way of life of millions of Americans, including about \n150,000 Nevadans.\n  In Nevada, we continue to work hard locally with constituent services \nand in education to make at-risk homeowners aware of the options \navailable to them. This crisis calls for national leadership and we \nlook forward to Secretary Paulson's proposal. We believe our proposal, \nFHA Modernization Act, goes even further than the administration's.\n  Earlier this week, Secretary Paulson called upon Congress to pass the \nFHA bill. Mr. President, we have been trying to do that. We have been \nprevented from passing it because of the Republicans. Secretary Paulson \nis part of a Republican administration. He should lean on the minority \nhere in the Senate to allow us to get this passed. I call once again \nupon Senate Republicans to heed the call of millions of at-risk \nhomeowners and to heed the call of Secretary Paulson, to pass the FHA \nModernization Act. The only thing standing in the way of passing this \nbill, so we do not pass it, is the Republicans.\n  On November 15, we tried at the same time to pass the FHA Act to \nassist at-risk homeowners and the Transportation-HUD appropriations \nconference report. That bill was so important because, in that, Senator \nMurray provided $200 million for foreclosure counseling and mitigation. \nWe have learned over the months this foreclosure crisis has been before \nus that people simply need to know how to get out of the problem they \nhave. People in the home will lose, the lender will lose, the community \nwhere the home is located will lose. We need to try to keep people in \nthese homes. That is why the FHA Modernization Act is so important.\n  The Banking Committee sent the FHA Modernization Act to the floor \nwith a 20-to-1 vote. As I said, Secretary Paulson, whom I respect, \ncalled for Congress to pass it. We can't do it unless he gets his \nRepublican Senators to support this.\n  Much of the burden for this crisis that exists in America today has \nto be met by the Finance Committee. The chairman of the Finance \nCommittee is on the floor today. With him being present, I am going to \nask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration \nof Calendar No. 481, S. 2338, the FHA Modernization Act; and that the \nDodd-Shelby amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table, and any statement relating to this \nmatter be printed at an appropriate place as if given.\n  Mr. President, before I hear from my Republican colleagues as to \nwhether there is going to be objection, let me repeat: The Secretary of \nthe Treasury, appointed by President Bush, has called for passage of \nthis legislation. We want it passed. We hope it could be passed. It \nwould do a great deal to alleviate some of the problems facing our \ncountry.\n  I met yesterday with realtors from Nevada. They said if this passed, \nit would be a tremendous boost to their ability to work out some of the \nproblems we are having in Nevada, as we are having around the country.\n  I came to the floor to say positive things about the President's \nactions to help as many as 200,000 people. That is, their efforts \ntoday, his and Secretary Paulson's efforts today, will help about \n200,000 people. That is about 10 percent of the people in real trouble.\n  Is that enough? Of course it is not enough. But it is a step in the \nright direction. This FHA unanimous consent request I have made is also \na tremendously big step in the right direction. I hope my Republican \ncolleagues will not object and we can go forward with this legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I object on behalf of Senator Coburn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S14809]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14808-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14808-S14809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NORTH KOREA AND THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour of debate, prior to a vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 3996, with the time equally \ndivided between the two leaders or their designees, with the 20 minutes \nimmediately prior to the vote to be divided 10 minutes each for the \nleaders, with the majority leader controlling the final 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. What is the order of recognition? Is it the Democratic \nside or Republican side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no order of recognition.\n  Mr. GREGG. Does the Senator wish to proceed?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. You go ahead.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will be happy to allow you.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the 1931 film classic, \n``Frankenstein,'' the character Dr. Waldman tells Dr. Frankenstein:\n\n       You have created a monster, and it will destroy you.\n\n  That is how the AMT looks to the Tax Code. That is what it looks \nlike. It is a monster. It is a thing of dread for many Americans. \nUnless we act, it will destroy the entire tax system. If we don't act \npretty soon, the AMT tax will be greater than the individual Federal \nincome tax. This tax is a problem for taxpayers in all 50 States. I \nmust give a few numbers as to what will happen if we don't extend the \nAMT patch.\n  Let's take Texas. The number of Texans subject to the alternative \nminimum tax, if we do not act this year, would increase from roughly \n150,000 taxpayers in Texas to 870,000 taxpayers. That is about a \nsixfold increase in 1 year.\n  The number of Nevadans subject to AMT would increase from about \n15,000 to about 100,000--again, a little over a sixfold increase.\n  The number of South Carolinians would increase from 30,000 to \n190,000, again a large increase, about 6 times.\n  That is about average across the country, six times more Americans \nwill pay more taxes under the AMT if we don't act, compared to what \nthey were otherwise paying.\n  Even taxpayers who do not pay the AMT tax are hurt. Why? Because \ntaxpayers have to calculate not only the regular tax, but taxpayers \nthen have to calculate the alternative minimum tax. That is the law. \nYou have to do both.\n  First, you have to calculate all your regular taxes. Then you have to \ncalculate what taxes you may pay under a whole separate system of AMT. \nSo even though you may not pay more under the alternative minimum tax, \nyou have still got to go through a second calculation. That is not a \nlot of fun. Then, if the second calculation shows you pay more under \nthe alternative minimum tax, guess what. You have to pay more. You \ncannot choose to pay the lesser of the two; you have to pay the greater \nof the two. That is the law.\n  Again, the monster created by the Congress years ago, unintended \nconsequences, but a monster we can eliminate, if not destroy, if we \ntake action today.\n  Calculating taxes once is scary enough. Calculating taxes twice is \nalmost enough to destroy a person. It may also cause significant \nfinancial hardship. Why? Because in today's economy, families depend on \nthat refund check. It is getting close to Christmas. People are buying \npresents. Sometimes they run up their credit cards a little bit. They \nare depending upon that refund check to pay off their credit card \nbalances. A lot of Americans do that. A lot of Americans do that.\n  Think of the taxpayers who think they are going to get a refund from \nthe Federal Government. But then, if we do not fix this AMT problem, \nwhat happens? They get the letter in the mail telling them they have to \npay more taxes because of the AMT. Talk about your horror story.\n  Here is an example of how AMT hits working families. Let us take a \nmarried couple, four young children. What is their household income? A \nwhopping $75,000 a year. Their regular income taxes should be about \n$1,800. That is probably what they pay. This is after the standard \ndeduction and after the child tax credit.\n  Again, a family with a $75,000 income, family of four, pays about \nalmost $2,000. Not quite, because they are able to take a standard \ndeduction for the child tax credit.\n  Well, let's see what happens when we calculate the alternative \nminimum tax. Same family. Same income. The amount more than doubles \nthis family's tax liability. It raises their tax from $1,800 to $3,800. \nMore than twice. More than twice.\n  That is a family earning $75,000. Not a huge, big-income family. That \nis a $75,000 family. The AMT hits this family not because they are \nrich, because they are not. Why? Because they have four kids. That is \nkind of how it works. It is perverse. If you have more children, you \npay more taxes. That is kind of nutty, but that is what it is today.\n  The AMT will cost taxpayers because it costs the Federal Government. \nA delay will create delayed tax return filings, and last minute \nlegislation will delay the issuance of Federal refunds. With each extra \nday we delay, the greater the cost. The greater the cost to taxpayers, \nthe greater the cost to the IRS. The cost mounts up.\n  Let's look at some of the costs of delay. If the IRS has to postpone \naccepting returns to the early part of the filing season, say January \n28, this would delay the receipt of more than 6.5 million returns, \ndelay the issuing of more than 5.5 million refunds, totaling more than \n$17 billion, delay about $17 billion worth.\n  A delay in fixing the alternative minimum tax affects States. We are \nnot just talking about the Federal income tax, we are talking also \nabout State taxes. Why? Because most State taxes are tied to the \nFederal tax system.\n  A delay in the Senate will mean not only a delay in the Federal tax \nreceipts but also a delay in the State tax refunds, Federal and State.\n  A delay will also mean States that are already financially strapped \ncould have a cash crunch. Think of the States' coffers. Their normal \nflow of tax revenues will not be coming in. Many States are very \ntightly budgeted. I know that is true in the State represented by the \nofficer in the chair. I hear many times about the tight fiscal \nsituation in that State.\n  That is true for most States. If tax agencies cannot reprogram their \ncomputer systems in time, States and the IRS are concerned taxpayers \nwill turn back to paper returns. What is the consequence of paper \nreturns? It leads to an increase in processing times and costs as well \nas more errors.\n  Let's take the State of Montana. In Montana, it costs $2 to process \nan electronic return, $2. But it costs $9 to process a paper return. I \ndaresay that disparity is probably true in most States.\n  At a time when families are experiencing hardship, I must say the \nother side of the aisle is playing politics. They are not letting us \nfix this problem. They, in effect, consequently want to increase taxes. \nThey are increasing taxes. How? By causing the alternative minimum tax \nto be imposed upon Americans, by not letting us fix the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  You watch that vote that is coming up. We are not going to get 60 \nvotes. You watch how, when the leader is going to request we take up \nthe House-passed bill, and the substitute measure where we fix the AMT \npatch, unpaid for, they will object to that. They do not want to fix \nthis problem. They say they do, but their actions are louder than the \nrhetoric. They are raising taxes. They are raising taxes by not \nallowing us to fix the alternative minimum tax patch for 2007.\n  In the 1945 B movie ``House of Dracula,'' the character, Dr. Edelman, \nsays of Frankenstein's monster:\n\n       He's indestructible. Frankenstein's creation is man's \n     challenge to the laws of life and death.\n\n  Let's prevent that from being said about the AMT. Let's prove the AMT \nis\n\n[[Page S14810]]\n\nnot indestructible. Let's move to proceed to the House bill and stop \nthis tax monster.\n  We are going to do this. Let's do it now. We know we are going to fix \nthis one way or another. So I say: Stop playing politics. I say that to \nthe other side of the aisle because they are going to block this next \ncloture vote. They are going to object to the motion asking consent to \npass the alternative minimum tax, unpaid for.\n  I say: Stop the games. Let's get on with it. Let's help do something \nfor the American people. Let's move to proceed to the House bill, stop \nthis tax monster.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee outlining the problems with the AMT. I agree 100 percent with \nhis statement relative to the problems with the AMT. He is absolutely \naccurate. It was a concept passed with the consequences being--with the \nknown consequences being--to make sure people who had high incomes \nwould pay a fair share of taxes.\n  It turns out it was drafted poorly, it was not indexed for inflation. \nAs a result, we have literally millions of people who are paying this \ntax who should not have to pay this tax, and therefore it should be \nrepealed. Actually, it should be repealed permanently. There is no \nreason for us to even go 1 year. We should do the whole thing, get it \ndone.\n  But this bill which is being brought forward on which cloture is \nbeing filed in order to proceed to it is a very bad approach. Because \nbasically what this bill is saying is a tax which was never intended to \nbe in place, people who were never supposed to pay this tax and, \ntherefore, to correct it is not giving them a tax cut, it is simply \nsaying: You are going to be taxed the way we expected you to be taxed. \nOr to put it another way: If the alternative minimum tax goes forward, \npeople are going to pay a tax they should not have to pay because it \nwas never perceived they would have to pay it.\n  A bill which should accomplish that, which should give those people \nrelief, is being coupled with tax increases on people who should not \nhave to pay new taxes to correct the alternative minimum tax problem.\n  It is also being coupled with a bill which has some bad policy in it. \nFor example, this bill will stop, stop the IRS from proceeding with \ninvestigations and action, potential action, against people who are \nusing the Virgin Islands as a tax shelter. There are 279 investigations \ngoing forward right now relative to Americans who have basically \ncreated a shell lifestyle in the Virgin Islands so they can avoid taxes \nin the United States, which they probably owe.\n  It is estimated there may be as much as $370 million of taxes owed to \nthe United States by those high-income individuals. What does this bill \ndo that came to us from the House? It says: We are going to stop that. \nWe can no longer investigate those people. The IRS can no longer \ncontinue to proceed with an action against those people who are \nbasically trying to escape American tax law.\n  It also, this bill, includes in it a tax deduction for State \nlegislators during periods when they are not in session. How about a \nlittle gift to our friends in the State legislature maybe in New York. \nSo that if the New York legislator does not even go to Albany, they are \nstill able to deduct their per-diem expense.\n  That is called porkbarrel tax policy, I suspect. Those are terrible \npolicies. But the larger policy which is bad, which is in the bill \nbefore us, is we are essentially going to hit partnerships and \nindividuals with something called a carried interest tax, the practical \neffect of which will be that people who are involved in the financial \nbusiness of this world--in the United States, not the world, people who \nare involved in the financial business in this country--and I know \nthere is not a lot of sympathy for those folks because they make a lot \nof money. We would all like to make a lot of money like that. But these \nfolks are essentially the engine of a large part of our economy. They \nare the ones who are creating the capital which is then invested in the \nbusinesses. They are the entrepreneurs who then create jobs. Jobs do \nnot appear from thin air. They do not. They appear because someone out \nthere is a creative individual who says: I have an idea. I am going to \nstart this little company. I am going to start this little restaurant. \nI am going to start this little business.\n  They build it, and then they get to a certain point where they need \nmore money in order to expand it to create more jobs. Where do they get \nthe more money? It does not appear from thin air. It appears from the \nfact that we have financial markets, the most viable capital markets in \nthe world where people can raise money. They go into the market, and \nthey say to the people who are the professionals: We need X amount of \ndollars in order to expand our business so we can create more jobs in \nNew Jersey or in New Hampshire or in Montana or in Texas. We are coming \nto you to help us raise capital.\n  Those folks go out and they raise the capital. They invest it in \nthose businesses and those businesses create jobs, those entrepreneurs \ncreate jobs. What this bill says is: Those people who are in those \nfinancial markets will receive a brandnew tax on what they consider to \nbe the way they raise money and create wealth for Americans by creating \njobs, in what they consider to be a fair way to do it, which under the \ntax law today they are not taxed for it. It is a brandnew tax. What is \nthe practical implication of putting this new tax in place in order to \npay for the elimination of a 1-year kicking down the road of the \nalternative minimum tax expansion? Which should be done.\n\n  The practical implication of doing it by raising taxes in this way is \nthat, first, people who should have not paid taxes under the AMT will \nnot have to pay their taxes. That is good. We should not have counted \nthat revenue anyway.\n  But, second, you are going to put in place a new tax system which \nwould drive those people who create that financial incentive, which \ncreates jobs, which gives business people and small entrepreneurs in \nthis country the revenue and capital they need to create jobs, you will \ndrive them overseas. We will be exporting jobs again because we are in \nglobal competition in the area of capital.\n  One of our biggest problems in this country today is a lot of the \ncapital that is being formed in this world today, which used to be done \nin New York, where if you wanted to raise capital in this world, you \nused to come to New York. Unfortunately, it is a world competition, and \nnow places such as London are competing with us, and they are being \nvery effective in their competition.\n  One of the reasons they are able to compete with us effectively is we \nhave put a lot of restrictions on our people which have been maybe a \nlittle bit over the top and, more importantly, we have a tax policy \nwhich has not been constructive, which has not encouraged people to \nstay here. It encourages them to go overseas.\n  The effect of this proposal will be to even aggravate that further. \nWe will be exporting more jobs. More importantly, not only will we be \nexporting the job of the person in the financial market, we will be \nexporting the creation of the capital. That is serious. Because that \ncapital is the feed corn for the expansion of our economy.\n  You should not be raising taxes at this time. That is another point \nthat should be made--this alternative minimum tax proposal which comes \nto us from the House raises taxes. That is pure and simple. We are \nheaded into potentially an economic slowdown. That is the way it looks. \nBecause of the subprime crisis, because of the capital market crisis, \nwe are heading into some sort of a slowdown. Hopefully, it will not be \nsevere, but it could be difficult. There is no question about that.\n  To raise taxes in the face of that type of a slowdown is the absolute \nopposite of what any reasonable person who has experienced any economic \nslowdown would do. In fact, recently I was interested to read what \nRobert Reich, who was Secretary of Labor under the Clinton \nadministration and who is readily acknowledged as being a liberal \neconomist, and a very talented one by the way, he went to Dartmouth, so \nI know he is talented.\n  Robert Reich said: A tax increase at this time would be foolish. What \nwe should be talking about is a tax cut.\n\n[[Page S14811]]\n\nActually, what we should be talking about, and what we on our side \nwould like to do, quite honestly, is put in place an alternative \nminimum tax fix which is permanent. That has been proposed by a number \nof us on our side.\n  Let's correct this problem so we do not have to deal with it this \nyear, next year, or the year after. That is the first thing we should \ndo. Short of that, we should put one in that is a little bit longer, at \nleast, so there is some predictability in the tax law.\n  But under no circumstances should we put in place an AMT fix which is \ncoupled with a tax increase or which is coupled with terrible policies \nsuch as this Virgin Island loophole and this State legislator loophole \nthat was put in this bill. That is why we resist this approach.\n\n  The Republican leader came to the floor a couple days ago and \nsuggested three or four different avenues where we could correct this \nproblem. They were all fairly reasonable. I don't know why they were \nrejected by the other side of the aisle. My sense is that we should be \nable to work this out because I honestly believe, when I listen to the \nchairman of the committee, that there is not that much difference \nbetween where he wants to go and where our side would like to end up, \nwhich is let's straighten out the AMT. Let's put all this additional \ntax policy and these tax increases which have come from the House \naside. Let's say: The House got off on the wrong track. Let's just take \nthis approach of doing AMT and do AMT and fix that, and then, if the \nHouse wants to come back with a tax increase bill, we will fight that \nout on a separate agenda.\n  We can't on our side support a bill and vote for cloture on a bill \nwhich would mean we would be shut off from a lot of our amendments, \nvote in a way which would basically put us in a position which would \npotentially lead to a tax increase in order to correct what is an \nunderlying important problem. Obviously, this is a motion to proceed, \nso we might not be shut off from amendments, but I suspect the motion \nto proceed will be followed very closely by the filing of cloture on \nthe underlying bill.\n  I am not too concerned about the fact that we would not be allowed \nour approach. If the position of the other side of the aisle is, we are \nwilling to give you your votes, let's set that up right now. Let's take \nthe Republican leader's position, set up three or four votes in tandem, \nmake them all 60-vote hurdles, if that is what it requires--and that is \nwhat it will require because pay-go is going to get waived on every one \nof them--and vote on them--bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Let's not go \nthrough this exercise on cloture. We want to correct the AMT problem. \nWe think it should be corrected. We don't think the way to correct it \nis to raise taxes on the productive side of the American agenda and \npotentially throw us into a further slowdown of the economy or force \npeople to go overseas in order to raise capital or, alternatively, put \nin place policies which basically make the Virgin Islands a safe haven \nfor people who want to avoid American taxes or give State legislators \nthe opportunity to claim a per diem deduction when they are not even \ngoing to work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator from \nNew Hampshire. I say to my friend, frankly, I would not have written \nthe House bill in the way it was written. I don't agree with everything \nin the House bill. In fact, I think there are some measures there that \nprobably should be addressed and amended. I also think, though, that we \nneed to get to the House-passed bill so we can fix the AMT. We can't \nfix the AMT until we get to that bill. Once we get to that bill, any \nSenator, irrespective of whether cloture has been filed, can always \nfile a motion to strike. So if there are measures in the House bill \nthat the Senator does not like or the Senator from Texas doesn't like \nor anybody doesn't like, that motion to strike is available.\n  If we get to the House bill, I am going to offer a compromise which I \nthink the vast majority of the Members of this body will accept. We \nneed to get to the bill. We need to vote cloture and get to the bill so \nwe can cure this AMT problem, offer amendments that Senators might find \nobjectionable to the House bill. At the same time, I am going to offer \na compromise proposal which I believe will dispose of it. I urge my \nfriends on the other side to let us get on the bill. Then we can vote \nto strike. We can vote on this compromise proposal I will offer.\n  I mentioned that there are various versions we could vote on. One is \njust straight AMT unpaid for, period. That is an option. To get there, \nwe need to get to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, because I don't think this is inconsistent \nwith what the Senator from Montana, chairman of the Finance Committee, \nhas asked for, I renew the Republican leader's request from yesterday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at a time determined by the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate \nproceed to consideration of H.R. 3996, the House-passed AMT bill, and \nit be considered under the following limitations: there be 1 hour of \ndebate on the bill equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, followed by a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nbill; provided further that if cloture is not invoked, then the only \namendments in order to the bill be the following offered in the \nfollowing order: a substitute amendment to be offered by Senator \nMcConnell or his designee which is to be an offset AMT extension and an \nunoffset extenders package, a Baucus or designee first-degree amendment \nto the McConnell substitute which is to be a set of offsets for the \nextender package, a Sessions amendment related to AMT and exemptions, \nan Ensign amendment which is an AMT repeal and extends other expiring \nprovisions, and a DeMint amendment which relates to the AMT and flat \ntax; provided further that there be an additional 2 hours of debate on \nthe bill equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; \nthat there be a time limitation of 2 hours for debate on each amendment \nequally divided in the usual form; provided that each amendment require \n60 votes in the affirmative for adoption and that each amendment that \ndoes not receive 60 votes then be withdrawn.\n  I further ask that notwithstanding the adoption of any substitute \namendment, the other amendments be in order; and finally, that \nfollowing consideration of the above amendments, 60 votes be required \nfor passage of the bill, as amended, if amended.\n  This outlines a procedure to accomplish what I believe the Senator \nfrom Montana requested because it does have his first degree. There are \nthree other amendments in there, but they are all subject to 60 votes--\nthe Sessions, Ensign, and DeMint. If they fail, they fail. One presumes \nthat, depending on the position of the Senator from Montana, since he \ncontrols more than 40 votes on his side, that would happen and that we \nwould then proceed in this way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, I remind all of us, we are \nhere to solve a very imminent problem; that is, the alternative minimum \ntax. The IRS is having fits, frankly, because they are unable to send \nout the right returns, programs, and so forth, to help the American \npublic avoid this AMT for 2007. The other provisions listed in that \nconsent have nothing to do with the alternative minimum tax. One is the \nBush tax cuts. They don't expire until 2010. We are talking about 2007, \nright now, this month. Then there is the flat tax. That has nothing to \ndo with the alternative minimum tax. That is a whole other issue that \nhas nothing to do with what we are trying to accomplish today. I urge \nSenators to keep their eye on the ball. Let's get the AMT patch passed. \nThat is what we are talking about.\n  I must, on behalf of the majority leader, object. I can't agree to a \nprocedure on the floor without the presence of the majority leader. I \njust point out the pitfalls of that request which prevent us from \ngetting to a real problem, and that is solving the AMT for the tax year \n2007.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the objection of the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S14812]]\n\nMontana. I understand he believes the suggestion he is proposing is the \nright way to proceed. I would note that this subjects everything to a \ntime limit. Yes, the flat tax is going to be debated for 2 hours, and, \nno, it is not going to get 60 votes, so it will not be in the final \npackage. Yes, the Ensign proposal, which is essentially a repeal of the \nAMT and also extends the cap gains dividend rates--I believe that is \nthe proposal--would be brought forward. It would be debated for 2 \nhours, and then we would move on. I actually hope that one might pass.\n  In any event, this sets out a pretty tight timeframe. If you take all \nthe factors here, we could finish this by sometime around 7 o'clock \ntonight, assuming everybody wants to talk for 2 hours, which they \nprobably wouldn't, and be done. We would get it done, get the AMT \nstraightened out, and have done some good work around here. I suspect--\nthough I won't guarantee this--the final resolution of this proposal, \nwhich Senator McConnell made yesterday, would be closer to what the \nSenator from Montana wants than the bill he is suggesting we vote \ncloture on relative to proceeding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Chair how much time \nremains on this side of the aisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 25 seconds, and for Senator \nBaucus, 8 minutes 12 seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes for \nmyself and then the remainder of our time to the Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am not without sympathy for the position \nargued by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. I think \nthe list of horribles he has recounted by the fact that the AMT is not \nindexed and will cover up to roughly, I believe the figure is now, 23 \nmillion taxpayers unless we act--I am not without sympathy for what he \nis trying to do here. But the problem is, we are not going to agree on \nthis side to raise taxes against the American people in order to pay \nfor a tax cut for others. It is simply that clear. We are not going to \nagree to raising taxes, particularly at a fragile time for the economy, \nby what some have estimated would be $80 billion a year.\n  I believe three simple principles will help us find a solution. One \nis that we ought to protect the middle class from the rise of the AMT \nwhich President Clinton vetoed a full repeal of in 1999. I wish he had \nnot done that then. That would have protected us from where we are \ntoday. We ought to pass the expiring tax provisions, the so-called tax \nextenders for capital gains and dividend rates and other tax relief \nwhich have contributed to 50 months of continuous and uninterrupted job \ngrowth since tax extenders relief was passed in 2003. We ought to do \nboth without raising taxes on the American people.\n  Unfortunately, we know a tax increase is like throwing a wet blanket \non the American economy. The AMT, if we don't act, will hit about \n870,000 of my constituents, up from 150,000 now. It sounds to me as if \nthe distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee is sympathetic to \nthe direction we would like to move that this bill, unfortunately, does \nnot represent. But as long as we are presented with a choice of cutting \nthe AMT by raising taxes, I don't believe we are going to see any \nprogress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the AMT was initially designed to catch \nabout 155 people who were not paying taxes but were immensely wealthy \nand getting all kinds of income every year. Today, there are 4 million \npeople who are paying the AMT. If we don't do something about it, there \nwill be 25 million tomorrow. To be honest with you, because we have \ndelayed so long, we are going to be in a bind as far as even getting \nthe software done, the paperwork done, the IRS work done to be able to \ngive people their refunds this next year because of the delay we have \nhad. I respect the distinguished chairman of the committee. It has been \na very difficult committee to manage, and he has done as well as \nanybody I can imagine.\n  We need to fix the alternative minimum tax, the AMT. There is no \nargument in this chamber about that. If we fail to act, 25 million \nAmericans might have to write checks to Uncle Sam for thousands of \ndollars.\n  So we agree on fixing the AMT.\n  But the devil is in the details, and I cannot support a plan that \nprevents a tax increase on millions of Americans by raising taxes on \nothers.\n  Congress never anticipated having anywhere near this level of AMT \nrevenues to begin with, so we should not be raising taxes permanently \nto make up for that phantom lost revenue.\n  We are well past time for serious action on the AMT.\n  Almost 3 weeks ago, I came to the floor to discuss the financial and \npolitical ramifications of Congress' failure to fix the AMT.\n  We had a crisis then.\n  It is worsening by the day.\n  Even if we were to patch the AMT today, the American people will \nsuffer from our inaction.\n  We have known that the AMT train was coming down the tracks all year.\n  This failure to act is setting new standards for ineptitude.\n  Three weeks ago, the failure to patch the AMT was merely creating \nuncertainty for millions of Americans who would be subject to it if we \ndropped the ball.\n  Three weeks later, these poor folks are barely the half of it.\n  Now billions of dollars in tax refunds risk being delayed because of \ninaction.\n  On November 26--11 days ago the chairman of the IRS Oversight Board \nsent a letter to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  His grim assessment of the situation is worth our review.\n  The filing season is expected to start on January 14, but that date \nis now in jeopardy.\n  IRS computer programs are set to process tax returns under current \nlaw.\n  The IRS cannot flip a switch and process millions of tax returns in \nJanuary, when Congress changes the law on Christmas Eve.\n  According to the IRS Oversight Board, the IRS would be able to start \nprocessing tax returns within 7 weeks of the enactment of an AMT patch.\n  So if we were to enact an AMT patch today, tax filing season would \nstart almost 2 weeks late.\n  That delay would lead to 6.7 million delayed tax returns and $17 \nbillion in delayed refunds.\n  What if we delayed the start of tax season 1 more week?\n  Then we are looking at 15.5 million delayed tax returns and $39 \nbillion in delayed refunds.\n  Push it back another 2 weeks--37.7 million delayed tax returns and \n$87 billion in refunds delayed.\n  Many Americans actually look forward to getting their W-2 in the \nmail. Their employer withholds too much money from their paycheck every \nyear, and the W-2 allows them to file a return and get that money back.\n  And now with electronic filing, Americans are able to get those \nrefunds even more quickly.\n  Utahns depend on their refunds.\n  They count on their refunds.\n  Undermining that confidence is much worse than a lump of coal in a \nstocking.\n  We are now in the Christmas season.\n  I am sure that the movie ``Christmas Vacation'' will be on television \nsoon.\n  That movie contains a lesson that we should all heed.\n  In that movie, Clark Griswold, assumes he is going to get his annual \nChristmas bonus.\n  That Christmas bonus is as reliable as a weekly paycheck.\n  And when that bonus did not come, he--flat--out--went--nuts.\n  The political philosophy of Clark Griswold is one that I would \ncommend to my colleagues.\n  It is one shared by the American people. If you mess with my family's \nfinancial security, you better watch out.\n  The Senate's failure to patch the AMT in a timely fashion is going to \ndelay millions of tax refunds, and we should not be surprised when the \nAmerican people--like Clark Griswold--go nuts.\n  Right now, Americans are likely making decisions about the Christmas\n\n[[Page S14813]]\n\ngifts they are going to buy, at least partially, based on their tax \nrefund.\n  They assume they are getting that tax refund.\n  And they assume they are getting it on time.\n  Further delay is no longer acceptable.\n  Yesterday on the floor, Republicans were blamed for holding up \npassage of an AMT patch.\n  That is funny.\n  When Republicans were in the majority, we managed to pass an AMT \npatch early in the year, no later than May 11.\n  We did it without permanent tax hikes to pay for 1-year AMT fixes.\n  We did it without including special interest giveaways, and we did it \nwithout delaying tax refunds.\n  Democrats did tell us yesterday on the floor that they are the party \nof change.\n  On the AMT at least, they seem to be succeeding.\n  To fix the AMT they propose raising taxes.\n  To pass important tax extenders they are raising taxes.\n  And their efforts have now jeopardized the tax filing season and \nrefunds for the hard working Americans who depend on them.\n  When times change, they sure do change.\n  We are about to have a vote on the AMT.\n  I support AMT relief. I support AMT repeal.\n  But I will not support this fake tax relief.\n  I am not the only one. The Democrats' plan to fix the AMT with \npermanent tax increases ought to fail.\n  And for good reason.\n  We should not be paying for temporary tax cuts with permanent tax \nincreases, nor should we be putting the economy at risk by passing \nunnecessary tax hikes.\n  When this episode is over, we need to get down to the real business \nof fixing this AMT so we can get Americans the tax refunds they expect \nand the tax relief they deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I just want to make the fundamental point \nthat if we don't act, we will be raising taxes on 19 million Americans. \nWe have to act to prevent a tax increase from going into place. We on \nour side ask to vote for cloture so as to get to the bill which \naccomplishes that result of preventing 19 million Americans from paying \ngreater income taxes. We have to get to the bill so we can pass that \nlegislation. It can always be amended by any Senator who has a problem \nwith other provisions that might be in this bill. I respect that. In \nfact, I would agree with some of those amendments, I am quite certain, \nand motions to strike are always available.\n  We need to get to the bill so we can prevent a tax increase on 19 \nmillion Americans, called the alternative minimum tax, from going into \neffect. To the degree to which the other side prevents us from getting \nto the bill, that indicates to me they want to increase taxes on those \n19 million Americans. I hope that is not true, but their actions \nindicate that it is true. Unless they totally change and say, yes, we \nshould get to the bill to fix this AMT problem, I have to conclude they \nwant to increase taxes on those 19 million Americans.\n  I see no other Senators who wish to speak, so I note the absence of a \nquorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before we cast our votes this morning, \nAmericans should know exactly what we are voting on. This is not a vote \non fixing the AMT; this is a vote to raise taxes. Every year for the \nlast 4 years, Republicans in Congress have found a way, usually by May \nof the year in question, to correct a glitch in the Tax Code that \nthreatens to affect more and more families each year.\n  This is a middle-class tax that was never meant to be. It was created \nto make sure 155 super-rich individuals couldn't avoid paying taxes. \nBut because the people who wrote it didn't account for inflation, it \nnow threatens 25 million middle-class families.\n  Republicans have always found a way to deal with this problem with \nthe tax laws, and we did it without raising taxes. But the majority \nthat now controls Congress has a different view. They don't want to \nprotect the 25 million Americans who get hit by this glitch over the \nnext few months, unless Republicans agree to raise taxes on other \nAmericans in the process.\n  Let me say that again. What we are talking about here is extending \ncurrent tax law, which normally we have done, and adding a new \ncondition to that, saying we are only going to extend this tax break if \nwe raise taxes on a whole lot of other Americans. Now, Republicans will \nrespond to this proposal in the same way we have responded to it \npublicly and privately all year: No deal. No tax hike.\n  Democrats thought they could force us into accepting this proposal by \nwaiting until the last days of the session to call a vote, but they \nwere wrong. What they have forced instead is a crisis. Unless they fix \nthis glitch, millions of Americans--including more than 3 million in \nNew York, 98,000 in Nevada, and 819,000 in Illinois--will get a big \nsurprise when they sit down to do their taxes over the next few months. \nMillions more will face delays in getting the tax refund checks they \ncount on every year.\n  The majority needs to find a way to fix this problem before it gets \neven worse. We have been warning them about it all year long. The \nsenior Republican on the Finance Committee reminded us yesterday that \nhe has spoken on the Senate floor on this issue no fewer than 12 times \nsince last January. Senator Grassley has spoken on this issue no fewer \nthan 12 times since last January. The Treasury Secretary sent us urgent \nletters. The IRS sent us urgent letters. There is really no excuse for \nthe delay.\n  This is a problem we can solve. We have shown the Democrats how. We \ndon't need the majority leader to do a backflip off the Secretary's \nchair, as he suggested yesterday. We want him to give us a fix that \ndoes not raise taxes, that is fair, that is simple. This will work, and \nthis will not put the majority leader or anyone else at risk of any \nphysical harm.\n  So far, the majority has refused our offer. So here we are, about to \nvote on a massive tax hike that we know would not pass the Senate--and \nwhich we know the President wouldn't even sign if it did pass the \nSenate--instead of doing our job and fixing this middle-class tax hike.\n  With all due respect, this is no way to legislate. Let me be very \nclear to my colleagues across the aisle: Republicans will not raise \ntaxes--will not raise taxes--in exchange for blocking a tax that was \nnever meant to be. Our position has never been a secret. The Democrats \nhave known it all year.\n  I will vote against this massive tax hike, and I urge all of our \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the Clinton years we did some good \nthings for this country, and when the history books are written, one of \nthe things that will be paramount in those accounts will be what \nPresident Clinton did, with his allies in Congress, to turn the country \naround economically. During the Clinton years, we were paying down the \ndebt by half a trillion dollars. We were spending less money than we \nwere taking in. We can all look back to those days when Alan Greenspan \ntold us in committees assembled that we should cut back. We were paying \ndown the debt too quickly.\n  When President Bush took office, there was a $7 trillion surplus over \n10 years. With all of the things that he has done to bankrupt this \ncountry, we are now in debt of some $10 trillion.\n  The bill we have before us is a bill that says this tax needs to be \npatched, but it should be paid for.\n  That is what we did in the Clinton years. That is what we did in our \nbudget that we passed here. Mr. President, we passed the first budget \nin this Senate in 3 years--our modest majority--by one vote, because \nTim Johnson was\n\n[[Page S14814]]\n\nsick. We passed again, following the Clinton example, a balanced budget \nwhere we said we believed if we are going to have new programs, they \nshould be paid for. It is called pay-go. We said if there are going to \nbe cuts in taxes, they should be paid for.\n  The Speaker followed this, and we now have a bill from the House that \ntakes care of the patch, but it pays for it. Isn't that what the \nAmerican people want? Isn't that the example we should set for them--\nthat if we spend some money, we have to make provisions to pay for it? \nIf you have a home and you suddenly decide you need something, such as \na new refrigerator, and your credit card is at its maximum, then you \ncannot buy that refrigerator. There has to be some ability in this \nCongress to treat this body just as a family treats its own budget.\n  The wailing and crying we are hearing here is that they ``find it \noffensive''--those were the words of my distinguished Republican \ncolleague, Senator McConnell, yesterday--to have to pay for these tax \ncuts. Well, I hope everyone understands that we are trying to do what \nis right, that we are trying to have the Government of the United \nStates not be one that is buried in red ink all of the time.\n  This is a $50 billion patch. Should it not be paid for? The answer \nis, obviously, yes. I hope everybody votes for cloture on this most \nimportant piece of legislation.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 487, H.R. 3996, the AMT tax bill.\n         Harry Reid, Dick Durbin, Patty Murray, Max Baucus, Jay \n           Rockefeller, Patrick Leahy, Daniel K.

Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request I am \ngoing to enter in just a minute, but I would like to say that I extend \nmy congratulations to Lamar Alexander in his recent victory to be part \nof the Republican leadership. I respect and admire him. He will do a \nwonderful job.\n  I also extend my appreciation to Mr. Jon Kyl, a Senator from Arizona, \na neighboring State of Nevada's, who is going to replace Trent Lott. I \nhave expressed to Senator Kyl personally--I haven't had that \nopportunity with Senator Alexander because we didn't know how that vote \nwould turn out, but I expressed to Senator Kyl my admiration and \nrespect for him. I know he will do a good job for the State of Arizona, \nthe country, and the Senate, and I look forward to working with both of \nthem.\n  As we often do on the Senate floor, as Senator Kyl knows--before \ncoming here he was a distinguished lawyer, and I spent a lot of time in \nthe courtroom myself--it is totally appropriate that we on the Senate \nfloor advocate for our constituency, for our party, and for individual \nSenators in the best way we know how. But it is also very important \nthat we maintain cordial relationships.\n  As we learned in our court experiences, no matter how difficult the \ncase might be, no matter how tense it might be arguing to a jury or to \na judge, when that courtroom is adjourned, the attorneys walk out, \nshake hands, go have a sandwich, have a drink, and go on and prepare \nfor the next case. And that is what I say to my friends, Lamar \nAlexander and Jon Kyl. We are going to have some debates on the Senate \nfloor. That is what the Senate is all about. Some say it is the \ngreatest debating organization in the history of the world. I don't \nknow whether that is the case, but I have been involved in a few \ndebates and a few tense times on the floor, but I always try--and I \nhaven't always been totally successful at this--to put my emotions \naside and walk off the Senate floor and try to be friends with those I \nwas advocating against.\n  So I say to these two fine Senators from the States of Tennessee and \nArizona, I wish them the very best in their new duties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14814-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14814-S14815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3996\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to consideration of the House AMT bill, H.R. 3996; that all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of Senator Baucus's \namendment, No. 3804, providing for a 1-year unpaid patch for AMT \nextension be substituted in lieu thereof; the bill be read a third time \nand passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  So for everyone here, Mr. President, in nonlegal words, what I have \nasked for is that we proceed in spite of how I would rather we do this, \nthat we proceed to vote for AMT, a 1-year patch that is not paid for. I \nhave already given a speech prior to the vote on the motion to invoke \ncloture how wrong I think this is, but I also understand how important \nit is we have the patch. This patch would affect people who make from \n$75,000 to $500,000 a year, the average tax of some $2,000. This tax \nwas not meant to cover those people and, therefore, we should do the \npatch. I would rather it were paid for.\n  So I am asking unanimous consent that we be allowed to vote on this \nby simply accepting this. There wouldn't need to be a vote; no debate. \nIf we get no objections to this, then the AMT would be patched for 1 \nyear, and we would send it on to the House for their concurrence.\n\n[[Page S14815]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I suspect at a later time \nthis will, hopefully, be worked out--hopefully sooner rather than \nlater--but at this time I am going to have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would simply say to my friend, I hope that \nis the case. I hope we can move to this. I am a little suspect because \nwe have been trying to work something out for quite a long time now. I \nwill renew this request sometime later today, and I hope we can \naccomplish what we need to get accomplished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think most of us are a little distressed \nthat the other side is objecting to a request which is a huge \nconcession on the part of this Senator, as well as most of the Senators \non this side of the aisle, and that would be helping the other side, \nand that is that we are agreeing to pass AMT not paid for. Why? Because \nwe need to get the AMT patch fixed. We don't want the American \ntaxpayers to have to pay additional taxes under the alternative \nminimum. We want to get this fixed right away.\n  It is also important to remind us that time is of the essence because \nthe IRS has to get out the correct forms. The computer programs have to \nbe written properly. So I very much hope that very quickly the other \nside will no longer object and we can get this passed.\n  Mr. President, this reminds me of an old joke, and the joke goes like \nthis: There was a big flood, and a man of faith heard about it on the \nradio. But he did not flee to higher ground. He said: No, I'll put my \ntrust in God. I am not going to flee to higher ground, even though \nthere is this big flood, which I heard about on the radio. I'll put my \ntrust in God.\n  Well, the waters surrounded the man's home. And as he was standing on \nhis front porch, a boat came up and the skipper said: Jump in, I'll \ntake you to safety. And the man said: No, I'm going to put my trust in \nGod.\n\n  Well, the boat went away, and the water rose up to the roof. So the \nman stood on the roof, and a helicopter came and dropped a ladder, and \nthe pilot yelled down: Climb up the ladder, I'll save you. But the man, \nsaid: No, I'm going to stay. I'll put my trust in God.\n  So the helicopter flew away, and the water continued to rise, and the \nman drowned. The man went to Heaven, and God asked him: What are you \ndoing here? The man said: I put my trust in you, and you let me down.\n  Well, God said: What do you mean I let you down? I sent you a \nmessage, I sent you a boat, I sent you a helicopter. I tried to save \nyou three times.\n  I think that is what the Republican caucus has done to the AMT. The \nHouse passed a bill to prevent the AMT from hitting 19 million more \ntaxpayers, but the Republican caucus said, no, we will wait for our own \nlegislation. The majority leader asked unanimous consent to consider a \ncompromise amendment that did not pay for the AMT but just paid for the \nextenders. The Republican caucus said, no, we will wait for our own \nlegislation. And now the majority leader has once again asked consent \nto allow us to consider an amendment that does nothing but prevent new \ntaxpayers from being hit by the AMT, and once again the Republican \ncaucus said, no, we will wait for our own legislation.\n  Mr. President, at this point I want everyone to know if the AMT hits \nmore taxpayers next year, it is not because of the House of \nRepresentatives. If the AMT hits more taxpayers next year, it is not \nbecause of the majority leader. If the AMT hits more taxpayers next \nyear, it is not because of the Democratic caucus. If the AMT hits more \ntaxpayers next year, it is because of the Republican caucus. That is \nclear. They cannot take yes for an answer.\n  We are trying to set it up so we can vote on a unanimous consent \nrequest to fix the AMT, unpaid for, and get it done now, but the \nRepublican caucus says, no. They cannot take yes for an answer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Dunigan, Jr.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Commonwealth of Kentucky is mourning today because \nof the loss of one of our finest soldiers, and I am speaking of SSG Joe \nL. Dunigan, Jr., of Benton. He was 37 years old.\n  Staff Sergeant Dunigan's assignment was guarding a convoy of U.S. \nmarines near Fallujah in Iraq when on March 11, 2004, an explosive \ndevice, set by terrorists, detonated near his humvee, tragically taking \nhis life.\n  For the valor and bravery he displayed over two decades of service, \nthe U.S. Army honored Staff Sergeant Dunigan with numerous medals and \nawards, including the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, and the \nMeritorious Service Medal.\n  Staff Sergeant Dunigan, who will always be remembered by his family \nas Joey, wore his country's uniform for 20 years because he was proud \nto serve. Joey ``lived his life the way he served his country--he was \ngung-ho about everything,'' says his stepfather, Sammie Bryant. And \nJoey was gung-ho from a very early age.\n  His family remembers that growing up Joey loved playing army. His \nfavorite toy was GI Joe. In fact, family members often called him GI \nJoey. As a young boy, he participated in Cub Scouting and was an avid \nplayer of baseball and football.\n  Joey was also musically inclined, playing the trombone in the \nMarshall County High School Marching Marshals band. He enjoyed watching \nNASCAR races and was a big fan of\n\n[[Page S14816]]\n\ndriver Jeff Gordon. In fact, his family remembers fondly the time Joey \nwas able to attend a NASCAR race at the Talladega Superspeedway in \nTalladega, AL, and he saw Jeff Gordon bring home the checkered flag.\n  Joey graduated from Marshall County High School in May of 1984, and \nthat August he enlisted in the U.S. Army, a month before his 18th \nbirthday. He told his mother, Dena Bryant, that she should either give \nher permission for him to enlist at age 17 or he would enlist as soon \nas he turned 18, but either way, he was enlisting. ``He was very \nserious about enlisting because he wanted to serve his country,'' says \na letter written by Joey's family and sent to me by his mother, Dena. \nSo Dena gave her permission, and Joey became a soldier.\n  After completing basic training in Fort Benning, GA, Joey deployed to \nGermany for his first tour of duty. Over the course of his Army career, \nhe would also serve two tours of duty in South Korea and inspire many \nyounger soldiers through his work as an Army recruiter stationed in \nNashville.\n  In September 2003, Joey was deployed to Iraq as a member of the 1st \nBattalion, 16th Infantry Regiment, 1st Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, \nbased at Fort Riley, KS.\n  Wherever he served, Joey excelled at earning the respect and \nadmiration of his fellow soldiers. ``He would have made an excellent \ndrill instructor,'' says his stepfather, Sammie. ``When he walked into \na room, you could hear him above all the others.''\n  Family was important to Joey Dunigan. With Joey's guidance, his \nyounger brother, Michael Bryant, followed Joey's example and joined the \nU.S. Air Force. And at the center of Joey's life were his wife, Misty, \nand his two sons, Dustin and Jessie.\n  As an older, more experienced soldier, Joey looked after the younger \nmen serving alongside him. He knew the difficulties of serving far away \nfrom family and loved ones. In an email he wrote to his mother, Dena, \nJoey wrote, ``Please continue to remember me and the guys.''\n  He shared with his fellow soldiers his sturdy sense of humor, even in \nthe face of hard combat duty. Despite their sadness, family and friends \nbreak into smiles when remembering Joey Dunigan. ``He didn't want to \nhave sad moments,'' Dena recalls. ``He didn't like to be serious. He \nwas a gung-ho, vivacious young man. He was happy, bubbly, infectious.''\n  The day after Staff Sergeant Dunigan's family received the tragic \nnews of his death, an American flag flew at half-staff outside of Dena \nand Sammie Bryant's home. Joey was buried at the cemetery of his home \nchurch in Benton, KY,'' on March 21, 2004.\n  He will be forever remembered by his wife, Misty; his sons, Dustin \nand Jessie; his mother and stepfather, Dena and Sammie Bryant; his \nfather, Joe; his sister, Robin Colley; his brother, Michael Bryant; his \ngrandfather, Paul Henson; and many other beloved family members and \nfriends.\n  I want to leave my colleagues with the words of Joey's family, \nwritten in that letter sent to me by his mother that I mentioned \nearlier. ``Joey is a hero,'' they write. ``He loved God, his family, \nMarshall County and his country. He was born to and dedicated to \nprotect his country and fellow man.''\n  I'm glad Mrs. Bryant sent me this letter. It expresses the depths of \nher son's courage and convictions far better than I can. In return, I \nwant his family to know that the U.S. Senate salutes SSG Joe L. Dunigan \nJr.'s service. And his country will always honor his selfless \nsacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today with my colleague \nSenator Smith because many Oregonians are hurting at home today. For 3 \ndays this week our State has been slammed by a storm, the strength of \nwhich boggles the mind--hurricane force winds with gusts exceeding 120 \nmiles an hour and almost a foot of rain, raising water levels in some \nareas by 25 feet in less than 48 hours. Hundreds of our people are now \nin shelters, tens of thousands are without power and don't have phones.\n  Thousands of Oregonians have been willing to step forward with \nincredible acts of courage and generosity. Using helicopters and boats, \nthe Oregon National Guard and the Coast Guard have come through for our \nfolks, rescuing hundreds of people trapped by rising water. Along with \nactivating the National Guard, the Governor has brought every State \nagency in to help take care of the needs of the displaced, get \ncommunications restored, fix the roads, clear the bridges, and begin to \nassess the extraordinary damage.\n  We especially today, both of Oregon's Senators, thank the Oregon \nchapter of the Red Cross, because they immediately moved into the \naffected areas and opened shelters. They provided meals and they have \nnow been assisting with the cleanup.\n  The Governor has asked the President to declare a major disaster in \nour State and all of the Oregon congressional delegation joins the \nGovernor in urging the President to grant this request immediately.\n  Folks from FEMA, the emergency management agency, have arrived in our \nState. They are going to begin making formal damage assessments today.\n  Senator Smith and I talked to Secretary Chertoff on the phone and we \nasked for the Department of Homeland Security to pull out all the stops \nto aid our State immediately. The immediate priority is to get our \ncitizens the help they need to survive during these critical days. Once \nthe full extent of the damage is known, Oregon and Washington, the \nhard-hit Pacific Northwest, are going to need Federal assistance in \nrecovering from the disaster. This is surely going to entail rebuilding \nroads and other essential parts of our infrastructure.\n  Senator Smith and I are committed this morning to getting the help \nthat is so urgently needed by the people of Oregon. We believe it is \ncritical in terms of timing that this help be made available now so \nfolks can get back on their feet. We intend to pursue a variety of \noptions, including adding emergency funding to future spending bills if \nthat is necessary.\n  I yield the rest of my time to my colleague Senator Smith. We believe \non Oregon issues there are no partisan questions. Today the people of \nour State are hurting and both of Oregon's Senators are committed to \ngetting the help that is needed to sustain lives at home, to the \nPacific Northwest, and the people of Oregon immediately.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for being here with me \ntoday. Moments ago, we phoned Secretary Chertoff to discuss how we, as \nOregon Senators, can best help those of our State who have been \ndevastated by this storm. Both Senator Wyden and I wish we could be \nwith them now. On Monday, Senator Wyden and I hosted our sixth annual \neconomic forum in Portland. We rushed to the airport after the event in \nthe midst of this incredible storm to find that our outgoing flight was \nunable land in such horrendous conditions. We fortunate enough to find \nanother flight to Washington so we could be present for Tuesday's vote.\n  Again, we would both like to be with the citizens of our State. We \nare instead using what leverage we have in Washington to ensure the \nFederal Government responds to the best of its ability. We have called \nupon the President to declare this event a major disaster and free up \nFederal resources to begin rebuilding this devastated area.\n  We would like in particular to commend FEMA and the U.S. Coast Guard. \nFEMA took a lot of criticism as a result of Hurricane Katrina, but \ntheir response in Oregon has been spectacular. We thank them on behalf \nof all Oregonians.\n  We also thank the Coast Guard. Within the first 24 hours, the Coast \nGuard responded to well over 600 emergency calls and was able to save a \ntremendous number of lives. For this, we thank them.\n  As I consider our country, our values and the kinds of catastrophes \nthat have beset our country, we understand that we cannot stop Mother \nNature. But these catastrophes cannot and will not break the spirit of \nthe American people. I look at the great motto above your desk, sir, E \npluribus unum--out of\n\n[[Page S14817]]\n\nmany, one. I am reminded that when events like this occur, the many \nshow up and become one. They risk their own lives to save others. This \nis a tremendous act of selflessness and I applaud the heros fighting to \nsave our fellow Oregonians.\n  I thank our Federal responders, and I urge a disaster declaration as \nsoon as possible. In the Northwest, we have natural disasters ranging \nfrom earthquakes to volcanoes. And there are storms that barrel in off \nthe Pacific which can do an unbelievable amount of damage. They cause \nlandslides, tear the roofs off our homes, and swell our rivers to \nrecord-breaking levels. Near the town of Tillamook, a river rose \nliterally 20.5 feet within just a few hours, sweeping away livestock, \nhomes, and tragically, unsuspecting residents. But the response from \nall types of government and nongovernment organizations, including the \nRed Cross, has been magnificent.\n  Many church communities are coming to the rescue. Communications have \nbeen lost. Amateur radio operators have filled the airwaves, connecting \nrescuers to those in need of rescue. We thank them and pledge that--as \nunited Oregon Senators--we will do whatever we can for the sake of our \nState. We thank the Federal Government for their swift response and \nagain urge an immediate disaster declaration to strengthen our ability \nto heal the psychological and physical wound left by this storm. We \nwill begin to repair the damage that has afflicted so many counties in \nOregon.\n  I assure the people of our State that we in the Federal Government \nwill do our part. We will stay on this job until it is done and until \nOregon has fully recovered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise on behalf of more than \n130,000 New Jersey homeowners who have a subprime mortgage. I rise on \nbehalf of the 7 million American homeowners with a subprime mortgage, \nand I rise on behalf of the more than 2 million Americans who are or \nmay be facing foreclosure in the coming year. This is a national crisis \nand certainly the time to respond is now.\n  Families across this country are having their homes ripped from their \ngrasp, and there is no end in sight. Some have been saying that the \nstorm is over and others have been sitting silently as the black clouds \nroll by, but the reality is this storm is going to get worse. More \nfamilies are going to be facing foreclosure, more homes are going to be \nlost, and more damage is going to be done to our economy unless we act. \nThere is no point in letting an invisible hand guide this destruction. \nIf we have any sense of human compassion, we will help these families.\n  Many families are in trouble because they got a deal they didn't \nunderstand, a loan they couldn't afford, and now their adjustable rate \nmortgages are resetting. But these families are only the beginning. The \nstorm is only going to get worse. Many of the adjustable rate mortgages \nthat were made in 2006 will explode with higher interest rates sometime \nin 2008. Another type of adjustable rate mortgages, known as payment \noption, is set to explode after that.\n  Already, foreclosure rates have doubled and tripled in many areas. \nHundreds of thousands of families are already losing their homes. Over \nthe next year, absent strong action, the wave will build into a \nmortgage tsunami.\n  Not only will families lose their homes, often the largest asset they \nhave, but the ripple effects will devastate neighborhoods and the \nbroader economy.\n  If we do not act now to help those families, the effects will be \ncatastrophic. We can see the storm coming. We know the damage it will \ncause. So we had better reinforce our levies. In Congress, we should be \nworking to help hundreds of thousands of homeowners modify their \nmortgages to avoid foreclosure. We should be working to pass a bill \nthat will help homeowners modify their loan, for example, in a \nbankruptcy proceeding. We must pass, over Republican objections that we \nhave had, legislation to modernize the Federal Housing Administration.\n  But this is the beginning. Banks and lenders, without the prodding of \nCongress, should be reaching out to help those troubled homeowners \nrenegotiate their loan terms. This is not a suggestion, this is an \nexpectation. President Bush is announcing today his plan to address \nthis crisis. He has reached an agreement with major mortgage firms to \nfreeze interest rates for 5 years for financially troubled homeowners.\n  While I applaud the President for taking a step in the right \ndirection, the plan simply does not seem to go far enough. It seems to \noperate under the assumption we only have to do what is minimally \nnecessary. Depending on the details of this plan, on how they determine \nwho is eligible, many homeowners may be left out in the cold. A \nstrictly narrow approach will keep relief out of reach for many who \nneed it.\n  I am concerned about the family next in line when they close the door \non eligibility. I am concerned about the millions of Americans who \ncannot pay their bills, and I am concerned President Bush's plan will \nonly help a fraction of the families at risk.\n  Hard-working families are at a crisis in America, and in a time of \ncrisis they expect strong and bold leadership to help them through. We \nneed to provide that leadership. Congress, the administration, and the \nindustry all have key roles to play to help those families.\n  But what about the families who have yet to sign that stack of papers \nto get their future mortgage loan? What about when my son or daughter \nor yours buys their first home? What about the homeowner who needs to \nrefinance out of an unsustainable mortgage? In order to protect those \nfamilies, we need to make sure we stop predatory lending before it \nstarts.\n  As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, I have repeatedly said \nthat in order to prevent the mortgage crisis from happening again, we \nneed to find the root of the problem and fix it. That requires all \nparties--all parties--to step to the plate and admit where they went \nwrong.\n  A ``not me'' attitude will simply not work. Everybody who was \nresponsible must be held accountable. I am proud to be working with \nChairman Dodd on a bill that will hold all parties accountable.\n  Now, when I considered what I hoped to see in a final bill, I looked \nat all of those responsible parties, from the regulators, to the \nlenders, to the brokers and beyond. But one particular piece concerned \nme; that is, the secondary market. In order to understand what I am \ntalking about, I think it might help to step back for a moment and walk \nthrough the life of a subprime loan.\n  A consumer decides to seek a loan to purchase a home or refinance an \nexisting mortgage or, more likely, a broker or lender approaches a \nconsumer about a new loan. As soon as the loan settles, the broker gets \na commission from both the consumer and the lender.\n  Now, here is where the secondary market comes in. Within 90 days \nafter that consumer signs those settlement papers, the lender sells the \nloan to that secondary market, essentially selling the loan to Wall \nStreet. That lender then washes its hands of the loan, but keeps the \nfees, regardless of what happens later on.\n  Once in the secondary market, the loan is bundled with thousands of \nother loans into what we call a mortgage-backed security. This bundle \nof loans then passes through one or more corporate entities on its way \nto the trust where it will reside.\n\n[[Page S14818]]\n\n  The trust is usually a private company with an investing firm. The \ntrust then slices those bundles of loans into different categories \ncalled tranches, and investors purchase security interests in the \ntranches.\n  The trust is considered the owner of the loan, and the investors are \nrepresented by a trustee who acts on behalf of the trust. A servicer, \npossibly the original lender, possibly another company, services the \nloan on behalf of the trust, meaning they collect and remit payments, \nmonitor the accounts, and provide monthly reports to the trustees.\n  Because the servicer is the only one in direct contact with the \nhomeowner, most homeowners think the servicer is actually the owner of \ntheir loan. If the home goes into foreclosure, it is the trust that \nforecloses. But for the homeowner, they may not know who is foreclosing \non them.\n  Even if a homeowner had a predatory loan and has a good argument \nagainst foreclosure, if that homeowner cannot identify the owner of the \nloan and hold them liable, they cannot save their home. That is the \nlife of a loan. It is no wonder it is a process few understand. \nEssentially, the loan is a hot potato. It gets tossed from the broker \nto the lender to the trustee. Along the way each one wipes their hands \nof responsibility after they send the loan on down the chain. When a \nbad deal is made, each one points the finger at the previous owner.\n  Well, it is time to stop passing the buck. For me, that buck must \nstop with Wall Street. We cannot allow Wall Street to purchase loans \nwithout scrutinizing the details of that loan. If the trustee had to \nmake sure each loan was a good loan, that it meets specific standards \nand practices, and the lender had to make sure it was a good loan, the \nbrokers would have to stop making bad loans because they would not be \nable to sell them if they did.\n  That is why I support a strong liability standard. If a loan is made \nillegally or contains illegal terms, the homeowner should be able to \nsue the owner of their loan. Otherwise, whom do they hold accountable? \nTheir broker and lender could both be long gone. Nearly 100 subprime \nlenders have gone out of business in the last year alone, and then \nwhere does the borrower go for protection? They have to be able to \nreach the holder of the loan.\n  Without assignee liability, a subprime bill has no teeth. Yes, of \ncourse, we need stronger broker and lender standards, but we also need \na standard for Wall Street.\n  Let me be clear. I am not talking about holding specific investors \naccountable who act much like shareholders in a public company. They \nwould see a reduction in the value of their stock if the company \nexperienced financial losses but would not be personally responsible \nfor those losses. I am talking about the trusts, the company who owns \nthe loan. That is who must be liable.\n\n  This is not a popular provision I am calling for, but I think it is \nthe right thing to do. We are in a crisis in America. It is going to \ntake bold decisions to get the system back on track.\n  These are not kinks that are going to work themselves out. We have \nseen that the industry is not going to police itself. Voluntarily \nchanges are needed, but the bottom line is, without accountability, we \nare not going to see responsible behavior.\n  As I said at the opening of these remarks, I am standing today for \nthe American homeowner. If we want to prevent a similar problem from \nhappening again in 5 or 10 years' time, our final subprime bill must \nhold Wall Street accountable.\n  There are steps we must take today in order to help tomorrow's \nhomeowners. We cannot kick the can down the road. Let's make sure our \nhomeowners get fair, sustainable mortgages and that future homeowners \nare not caught in a future subprime storm. Enough is enough. It is time \nfor real changes.\n  I have enjoyed working with Chairman Dodd on this issue over the past \nfew months. I look forward, under his leadership, to passing a strong \nsubprime lending bill to help millions of American families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in anger, in disbelief, and \nin disgust over the bureaucratic inner workings of Washington. There is \na program called the Abandoned Mine Lands Program. It was created as a \nFederal-State partnership. The Federal Government collects the money \nand then it is designed to return half to the States.\n  Over many years, administrations of both parties have failed to honor \nthe Federal Government's responsibility and commitment to the States \nand to the tribes. I recently learned the Office of Surface Mining has \ndecided to delay and withhold $600 million in funding owed to the \npeople of Wyoming and to deny hundreds of millions of dollars more owed \nto States nationwide.\n  They have used an internal policy memo to manipulate the law. Doing \nso is nothing short of outrageous. This most recent decision reeks of \nbureaucratic doublespeak, and it does it to achieve an outcome I \nbelieve was predetermined. I cannot attempt to explain their decision \nor their reasoning because the decision, to me, was already \npredetermined.\n  This action represents a sad example of why so many Americans, and \nwhy my constituents back home in Wyoming, have lost faith in \nWashington. The words of the Washington bureaucrats ring hollow. I am, \nfrankly, amazed, amazed the bureaucrats can take the clear language, \nthe language from this body that says: Payments shall be made in seven \nequal installments. And then they twist those words into a grant \nprogram requiring review and making an application. Their \ninterpretation is inconsistent with the law that was debated by this \nbody last year and signed by the President.\n  Their interpretation is nothing less than nonsense and obstructive. \nThis summer, 17 days after I was sworn into the Senate, I opposed the \nnomination of the Director of the Office of Surface Mining in the \nEnergy Committee over this very issue.\n  I asked specific questions and did not get specific answers. Now \nthis. I take our legislative oversight responsibilities very seriously. \nI pledge to you, I pledge to the people of Wyoming, and I pledge to the \npeople of the other States and the other tribes to whom Washington owes \nmoney that I will explore every avenue, every avenue available, to \nright this wrong.\n  Let's be clear: This money is not Washington's money. This money \nbelongs to the States and to the people. It does not belong to \nWashington. It does certainly not belong to Washington's evasive \nbureaucracy.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for months since the writing has been on \nthe wall about the depth and magnitude of the subprime loan crisis, I \nhave said time and time again that the Bush administration needs to \ntake off its ideological handcuffs and act quickly to prevent millions \nof families from losing their homes. To the credit of Treasury \nSecretary Paulson, he seems to have loosened the administration's \nideological handcuffs when it comes to the subprime mortgage crisis. \nBut the burning question is whether this administration's plan, \nannounced today, will go far enough in helping families in need, \nparticularly when it is being announced at the exact same time \nRepublicans in Congress are blocking critical commonsense help targeted \ntoward these same borrowers. The President and Secretary Paulson say \nthey are for FHA reform. Yet, a half hour ago, when Senator Reid asked \nfor it to come to the floor, Republican colleagues blocked the bill. \nHas the White House stopped sending memos to the Republicans in the \nHouse and the Senate? What is going on here?\n  While I agree with Secretary Paulson that wide-scale loan \nmodifications are key in helping prevent the foreclosure\n\n[[Page S14819]]\n\ncrisis, I am hearing that the plan being announced will be limited and \ntargeted to only a limited set of borrowers who are at risk of losing \ntheir homes. I am hearing that one of my constituents, Mrs. Diaz from \nStaten Island, a hospital clerk I met as I talked about this issue back \nin New York, would not be helped by this plan. She and hundreds of \nthousands of other hard-working families seeking help are unlikely to \nqualify for the administration's plan. Over 230,000 Americans will have \nlost their homes due to foreclosure in the second half of this year \nalone. Just today, foreclosures reached an alltime high, as did the \nnumber of Americans who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments. \nMany of these are people who could afford their homes if not for the \ndubious subprime loans they received. We know none of those families \nwill be helped in this plan.\n  The bottom line with the administration's plan is there are too many \nfamilies that may be left out and too little disclosure and \ntransparency to ensure families that do qualify are being helped. If, \nas it has been reported, the plan will exclude subprimes with resets \nbefore January 1, 2008, then, according to Joint Economic Committee \nestimates, the plan will not cover 115,000 homeowners who will be \nforeclosed this quarter, let alone the additional 300,000 to 400,000 \nwhose subprime resets have taken place in the second half of this year. \nThat is already close to half a million not being helped.\n  It has also been reported that the payment freeze will cover only \nborrowers who are current in their payments. By definition, this will \nexclude many of the borrowers who most need help. They could be a \ncouple of months in arrears. With help, they could solve their \nproblems, work out some kind of refinancing. They are out.\n  Frankly, I am also concerned about how this plan will be implemented. \nWe have heard for the last 6 months from servicers that they have been \nmodifying many troubled loans, but it turns out this is not exactly the \ncase. What is going to change in their calculus now? Do we have \nconfidence that investors won't line up to bring lawsuits and bring \nthis process to a grinding halt before it even begins?\n  Even if this plan is sound, the devil will be in the details of its \nimplementation. For that reason, it is imperative that the \nadministration gather and make public data from the mortgage servicers \nand lenders about what they are doing. We can't simply trust; we must \ntrust but verify.\n  For a solution to the subprime crisis to be successful, it must be \ntransparent enough that all interested parties, including homeowners, \ninvestors, and policymakers, can verify that families are being helped. \nThis is even more true when it comes to this administration which has \ncontinually told us that the subprime crisis is being contained. Some \nkey information needs to be provided to the public, including the \nnumber of mortgages covered by the freeze, the number and types of \nmodifications offered, the number of loans which are refinanced by \nFHASecure, and the number of loans foreclosed.\n  We need to get this right now and make sure we do everything we can \nto make this rescue effort successful because if we wait 3 months, 6 \nmonths, a year, the subprime crisis might overwhelm the economy and \nplunge us into recession. The Joint Economic Committee which I chair \nestimated that the spillover from the subprime foreclosure crisis could \nexceed $100 billion for homeowners, their neighbors, and the local tax \nbase. On top of the subprime foreclosure losses, the continuing housing \nslump could be a massive blow to the economy. Economists such as Robert \nShiller, who recently spoke before our committee, estimate that a 10-\npercent decline in housing prices could lead to an overall $2.3 \ntrillion economic loss at a time when this country can least afford it. \nWhat does that mean for Mrs. Diaz and the millions of other families \nwho have lost their homes on the brink of foreclosure or for their \nneighbors, because their neighbors are worrying too. When our homes are \nworth less than they were only a year ago, it is difficult to make \nmortgage payments each month. But when there isn't much in the bank \naccount to pay high energy and health care bills, people get anxious. \nInstead of easing American anxiety, Republicans in this body and, for \ntoo many months, in this administration have ignored that anxiety. \nWhile we have been pushing to help American families, they have been \nnowhere to be found.\n  There are things we can do beyond what Secretary Paulson has \nproposed. Senators Brown, Casey, and I, with critical help from Senator \nMurray, got $200 million in the appropriations bill for housing \ncounseling organizations that can provide help. But instead of \nenthusiastically lining up behind this funding to help homeowners, the \nadministration is threatening to veto this critical funding which could \nhelp loan modification efforts like those being pushed by Secretary \nPaulson. Instead of letting us pass an FHA reform bill that will allow \nthis critical agency to help refinance troubled homeowners, as we \nspeak, Senate Republicans are blocking progress on this proposal for \nideological reasons.\n  Yes, there are some, both in the White House and on the other side of \nthe aisle, who believe in no Government involvement, let the chips fall \nwhere they may. That will hurt millions and millions of innocent \npeople. That could lead to a recession. That is not what the American \npeople want.\n  I say to the President and to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, take off your ideological handcuffs. Solve this problem that is \nafflicting America. The American people are not ideologues left or \nright. They want commonsense, practical solutions to solve this \nproblem. The most frustrating aspect is that we know how to solve this \nproblem in good part, but we are being blocked every step of the way.\n\n  Again, Secretary Paulson and the President's announcement is a good \nfirst step. For the first time, they are taking off the ideological \nstraitjacket and putting their toe in the water. But now they have to \nget into the pool. This is not a small problem. This is not something \nthat takes minor and half-baked measures to solve. The American people \nare waiting. The homeowners on the brink of foreclosure are waiting. \nBut so are their neighbors and so is every business owner in this \neconomy.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to take off the blinders, stop \nblocking assistance to families who will lose their homes unless we \nact, allow us to pass commonsense measures, and convince this \nadministration not to veto help for American homeowners during this \nholiday season.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York, \nSenator Schumer, who has been a leader on this issue involving our \nNation's crisis involving subprime mortgages. He has made constructive \nsuggestions and was the author, with several colleagues, of an \namendment to the Transportation bill that provided some $200 million \nfor housing counselors--important advice and help for families facing \nforeclosure. I thank him for that leadership and for his remarks.\n  There has been a lot of talk on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue \nabout the so-called national mortgage crisis. It is more than a \nmortgage crisis; it is an economic crisis. This is a crisis for \neveryone facing foreclosure, for their neighbors who watch the values \nof their homes decline, for local governments that will see revenues \nfrom property taxes diminish, and for every company struggling to \nfinance a business with the banking industry that has contributed to \nthese foreclosures. It is a crisis for all Americans. It is time this \nadministration woke up to that reality.\n  Over 2 million Americans are about to lose their homes to \nforeclosure, and 44.5 million Americans who live in their neighborhoods \nwill watch the values of their homes diminish. A home for many families \nis their most important and valuable asset. Through no fault of their \nown, many people will see that asset losing value. It will lose value \nat their expense. They know it.\n  We also know as well that homeowners living near foreclosed \nproperties may see as much as $5,000 in the values of their home going \ndown. I represent the State of Illinois. In the county of Cook, which \nis where you find the city of Chicago, we find some 29,000 foreclosures \nthat are looming, and we estimate that some 2 million residences in \nCook County will see their value go down as a result. That is\n\n[[Page S14820]]\n\ntwo-thirds of the residences in the county of Cook, one of the largest \ncounties in America.\n  I went to the West Side of Chicago recently with Alderman Bob \nFioretti. We walked through a neighborhood where houses are boarded up \nbecause of foreclosure, where auction signs are out in the front \nyard. Bob told me that many of these same townhouses were selling for \n$300,000 or more just recently, and now they are on the auction block \nfor around $100,000. What does that mean for the neighbor who spent \n$300,000 on his home, and now watches an auction of the next-door \nneighbor's old house, at $100,000? It is bad news. It is bad news for \nAmerica.\n\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors projects that this crisis will result \nin 524,000 fewer jobs in America--that is pretty obvious from the \nhousing industry alone--a drop in consumer spending, the loss of \nbillions of dollars in tax revenue, and a slowdown of economic growth \nin America. This is not a small issue. It is a major issue when it \ncomes to the American economy.\n  As the chief economist of Moody's Economy.com said yesterday in a \nhearing I chaired:\n\n       There is a substantial risk that the housing downturn and \n     surging foreclosures will result in a national economic \n     recession.\n\n  If what we face is truly an economic crisis, the response from this \nadministration has been totally inadequate. We have convened summits to \nget the industry to agree that we have a problem. We have suggested \nrefinancing guidelines to ease industry bickering about how to help \npeople refinance. We have pressured the industry to reach out to \nborrowers early and help them before the families get too deep in debt. \nThey are all positive steps. But Moody's reports that for most loan \nservicers, only 1 percent of the loans whose interest rates jumped in \nthe first half of this year have been modified to help the homeowners \ncontinue to pay for their homes. Nothing beyond that meager industry \nresponse has been done by this Government to deal with this reality. \nThat is completely inadequate. Much more needs to be done, and it must \nbe done now.\n  Compare our situation to what happened in the late 1920s in America, \nwhen housing prices in another crisis dropped 30 percent. In 1932, \nCongress collaborated with the real estate industry to establish the \nFederal Home Loan Bank system, modeled after the Federal Reserve, to \ncreate a special lender of last resort for real estate. A year later, \nCongress modified bankruptcy law to allow insolvent wage earners to \nprotect themselves from eviction. A year after that, Congress created \nthe Federal Housing Administration which insured mortgages that were \nreasonable for the borrower by insisting on solid mortgage terms. In \n1938, Congress created Fannie Mae, eventually leading to huge \nsecuritization of mortgages. Compare that to what we are talking about \nnow: jawboning, some conversations, saying let's hope major parts of \nthe industry decide they want to cooperate. That is not leadership. \nThat is begging.\n  This list of Government actions taken 75 years ago highlights how \nlittle we have done to deal with this current economic crisis. Let me \ntell my colleagues what we proposed in this Democratic Congress: a bill \nby Senator Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, to reform \nthe Federal Housing Administration and make loans available to families \nwho desperately need them; a bill by Senator Schumer, chairman of the \nJoint Economic Committee, allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to \npurchase more loans and provide more liquidity in the market; a bill I \nhave introduced, allowing mortgages on primary residences to be \nmodified in bankruptcy court as a last resort so that families don't \nlose their homes.\n  FHA. Fannie Mae. Bankruptcy. The Congresses in the late 1920s and the \nearly 1930s understood the magnitude of the challenge and they acted. \nAs for the Congress of this year, some of us get it, but unfortunately, \nour efforts to pass this legislation have in many instances been \nstopped by the Republican minority. That is unfortunate. It is a \npattern that has emerged in this Congress. The floor of the Senate has \nbeen virtually empty this week. We haven't seen Senators come to the \nfloor proposing important legislation to deal with America's economic \ncrisis and to take seriously the economic challenges facing families. \nNo. Once in a while, a Republican Senator comes to the floor to try to \nstop the business of the Senate. Under the arcane Senate rules, they \ncan do it, and they have done it.\n  We tried to bring up the alternative minimum tax. It is a tax which \nis creeping forward and enveloping more and more taxpayers every year. \nSome 19 million Americans will be hit by this tax, which was never the \nintention when it was created. We wanted to bring a bill to the floor \nthis morning, a bill to change this and protect those taxpayers. The \nvote on the bill was 47 to 47. Not one single Republican Senator voted \nto stop the alternative minimum tax from hitting 19 million Americans. \nNot one would cross the aisle. Why? There is no reason. No reason was \ngiven, other than the fact that time and time again, the Republican \nminority wants to stop the business of the Senate, whether it is a tax \nthat needs to be reformed or a mortgage crisis that needs to be \naddressed. Time and time again, the Republicans are using yesterday's \ntactics of obstruction, yesterday's tactics of creating obstacles, when \nAmerica wants bipartisan cooperation and compromise. That is why we are \nhere.\n  The Democrats have a scant majority--51 to 49. Under the Senate \nrules, there is not a lot we can do. It takes 60 votes for important \ndecisions. The Republicans know it, and they are determined to stop any \nprogress when it comes to solving America's problems. We want change. \nWe want to move forward. They are stuck in the past--yesterday's party \nusing yesterday's tactics. The American people are watching.\n  Well, let me say that this administration has come forward with a \nplan dealing with the mortgage issue. It is short-term relief to deal \nwith exploding interest rates for some families. It is good, but not \ngood enough. From the details we received thus far, it has been \nreported that only 12 percent of subprime borrowers--about 240,000 \nhomeowners--will be eligible for this help. That is unfortunate. Twelve \npercent. When we have over 2 million--maybe 3 million--Americans facing \nforeclosure, we are going to only help one out of eight. That is it? \nThat is as good as it can get? I don't accept it. Even fewer may be \nhelped, we may find out eventually. After jumping through all the \nhoops, we may find that it may be a 10-percent solution for some. Not \ngood enough.\n\n  One of the millions of people who will still lose their home even if \nthe Bush plan is adopted is Nettie McGee, who I met a couple of days \nago. What a great lady. Nettie McGee is 73 years old. She lives on the \nsouth side of Chicago. She worked real hard during her life in a \npicture frame factory. She retired, and at the age of 65 her dream came \ntrue. For the first time in her life, Nettie McGee was able to buy a \nhome. She is so proud of it. She talks about that home. She came to us \nyesterday in a hearing and told us what it meant to finally have her \ndream come true. Well, she ran into a problem. It turned out her \nbackyard wasn't on the same tax bill as her home. She got notice in \n2005 that the taxes hadn't been paid on the backyard because they were \nbeing sent somewhere else. She didn't know it. She was $5,000 in debt \nto pay her property taxes. This poor lady didn't have it. She was \nliving on Social Security. She saw an ad on TV--we see them all the \ntime--you can get a mortgage; you can refinance. She called the number.\n  The next thing you know, the next day up pops a fellow who says: Oh, \nwe can answer all your prayers. We are going to provide you $5,000, and \nwe are going to refinance your house. Well, Ms. McGee said she was \ninvited to a closing. Think of how fast this was moving. The following \nweek she went to a closing. She said that in less than 15 minutes they \nshoved 40 pages in front of her and kept turning the pages and said, \nkeep signing, keep signing, keep signing, and she did. She walked out \nthe door with the money she needed to pay off her taxes. She felt \npretty good about it. She went home and started making her payments. \nEverything was fine until 2 months ago when they called her and said: \nIncidentally, Ms. McGee, those papers you signed mean you have an \nadjustable rate mortgage now. It is not a fixed rate mortgage. Instead \nof paying some 7\n\n[[Page S14821]]\n\npercent, you are going to pay 10 percent in interest. That meant that \nher monthly payments went up $200 a month. A Member of Congress may not \nmiss $200 a month, but Ms. McGee will. The monthly payment which she is \nnow required to make will take all of the money that is sent to her in \nher Social Security check. She is about to lose that home. After 10 \nyears of living her dream, she is about to lose it. She is one of the \nvictims we are talking about, because of the resetting of an adjustable \nrate mortgage.\n  One would hope Ms. McGee is the kind of person to be helped by the \nadministration's suggestion on mortgages, but sadly, she is not. She \nwouldn't qualify, and that is sad. It tells you that this is a safety \nnet that has too big a hole in it and that a lot of poor people are \ngoing to fall through.\n  I have a plan that will go further than the Bush administration plan. \nI want to change the bankruptcy laws for about a fourth of the people \nfacing foreclosure who end up in bankruptcy court. I want to give them \na chance. If they have enough income, the court can order changing the \nterms of the mortgage, the interest rate and the principal, no lower \nthan the fair market value of the property as of the time of the \nbankruptcy, and by renegotiating the terms, the people may be able to \nstay in their homes.\n  What happens if the proposal I have made doesn't become law? Well, \nthere will be a real foreclosure. They will have to leave their homes. \nTheir homes will be sold on the market. For the lender, what does it \nmean when you go through foreclosure? It means $50,000 in debts from \nthe foreclosure process. It also means facing the possibility--the very \nreal possibility--that you are going to lose 20 to 30 percent of the \nvalue of the loan in a foreclosure sale.\n  That is the reality, and I hope we can change it. I hope that what we \ncall a mortgage crisis today will become a crisis we respond to as a \nnation on a bipartisan basis: Congress and the President helping the \nAmerican people realize their American dreams, live in their homes, and \nnot see the value of their neighborhoods diminish.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator Brownback is here. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business. Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14821-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14821-S14824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEM CELL RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a recent enormous \nscientific breakthrough on a topic that has engaged this body for much \nof the past 8 years. I think this is a day that many of us--I think \nperhaps all of us--have hoped would take place. I ask unanimous consent \nto include in the Record at the end of my remarks an article that broke \nlose right around Thanksgiving.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this article is by Dr. James Thomson, \nUniversity of Wisconsin. Some may recognize that name. His name has \nbeen used on this floor many times during the past 8 years on the issue \nof embryonic stem cell research. He is the man who discovered human \nembryonic stem cells about 10 years ago and described them as being \nwhat is called pluripotent, which means that an embryonic stem cell \ncould form any other type of cell tissue in the body, whether it is for \nthe eye, brain, bone, or skin. Any type of cell tissue could regenerate \non a fast basis, and it was thought that these sorts of pluripotent \nembryonic stem cells were going to solve a number of our human health \nproblems. Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle embraced the \nnews and said this is a fabulous thing and we are going to be able to \nnow cure a number of people from diseases who have had great problems \nand difficulties, and we want cures for them.\n  There was an ethical glitch with it in that it took the destruction \nof a human embryo to get these human embryonic stem cells, and therein \nensued a fight that engaged the country and engaged the world about the \ntension between cures and an ethical recognition of human life and the \nsacredness of human life. It has been a long debate. I am hopeful that \nthe article I submitted into the Record is the bookend on the other end \nof this debate that was started by Professor Thomson and that, in many \nrespects, I hope is ended by Professor Thompson and his colleagues.\n  In this article they describe a new type of pluripotent stem cell \nthat is manipulated by man. They call it an induced pluripotent stem \ncell. This is an elegant and simple process where they take a skin cell \nfrom an individual and they reprogram it to be able to act like an \nembryonic stem cell, or what they call an induced pluripotent stem \ncell. They then are able to get it to generate more embryonic-like stem \ncells that are pluripotent and which then can be used to treat diseases \nor to study diseases, thus removing the need to develop and have a \nhuman embryo destroyed, or the origination of the embryonic stem cells, \nthus removing the problem of not being able to get a genetic match so \nthat we have to go to a cloned embryonic stem cell, or a cloned human \nto create an embryonic stem cell that matches genetically. You don't \nhave to do that. Get a person's skin cells, reprogram them, back in, \npluripotent, to form any type of cell--elegant, simple.\n  There are still many barriers to go on embryonic-like stem cells \nanyway because they have had a problem with tumor formation. But on the \nethical issue, I am hopeful we are on the other bookend, and it is now \nover; that we don't need to destroy young human life for cures; that we \ndon't need to destroy them for pluripotent cells; that we can do it \nmuch simpler and ethically and that good ethics is good science.\n  I put a description up here of what Dr. Thomson said on this subject. \nThere was a University of Tokyo professor who came out with an article \nthe same day, using a slightly different or modified technique, to be \nable to do this in humans. The University of Tokyo professor had done \nthis earlier in mice and now has perfected it in human cells. He came \nout saying the same thing:\n\n       These induced pluripotent cells described here meet the \n     defining criteria we originally proposed for human ES cells, \n     with the significant exception that the induced pluripotent \n     cells are not derived from embryos.\n\n  That was Dr. James Thomson.\n  I want to speak about this to my colleagues because we have had so \nmany debates on the Senate floor about this topic. I hope my colleagues \nwill research this. A number of people in the scientific field are \nsaying: Great, but let's not stop embryonic stem cell work and \ndestroying embryos for research purposes. Or let's not stop human \ncloning because it appears now that the only reason to clone a human \nwould be to bring a human to live birth at this point in time, which \nstill has everybody in this body opposed to that type of human cloning.\n  It is noteworthy that the ``father'' of Dolly the sheep has said he \nhas given up on human cloning to go to this type of technique rather \nthan human cloning to provide these sorts of cures and research.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my comments a Telegraph article from the United \nKingdom in which Ian Wilmut announced he is shunning human cloning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it is my hope that we can move together \nin finding cures and developing research that cures humans that is \nethical and sound and doesn't destroy young human life.\n  We have been able to do quite a bit of this already. We recently \nfound there was scientific work done by a Northwestern University \nprofessor in developing cures and treatments for type I diabetes using \nstem cells. Again, this is adult stem cells, which is ethical and \nmoral, no problem with it. The only problem I found with it is that the \nNorthwestern professor was having to do this in Brazil rather than in \nthe United States to get support and funding. He is saying this:\n\n       Though too early to call it a cure, the procedure has \n     enabled the young people, who have type I diabetes, to live \n     insulin-free so\n\n[[Page S14822]]\n\n     far, some as long as 3 years. The treatment involves stem \n     cell transplants from the patient's own blood.\n\n  For parents who are dealing with juvenile diabetes and those \ndifficulties, this is fabulous news in humans. We need more of it, and \nwe need it to take place in the United States and not Brazil. Nothing \nagainst Brazil. I am glad for it to take place there, but I want it \nhere for our children. We now have--as I have said previously on the \nfloor--73 different human applications for adult stem cells. We have \nnot been able to come up with any in the embryonic field yet. I think a \nbigger number--and we will verify this for my colleagues, as it is not \nverified yet--is somewhere north of 400,000 people who are now being \ntreated with adult or cord blood stem cells in the United States and \ndifferent places around the world, the majority being U.S. citizens. Of \ncourse, we don't have any in the embryonic field because it continues \nto struggle with tumor formation as an issue. These are wonderful \nnumbers of treatments that we are getting in different human maladies \nand, hopefully, we can verify that number of 400,000 people being \ntreated with stem cells, getting heart tissue and spinal cord tissue to \nregenerate, and Parkinson's treatment is coming forward. This is a \nbeautiful set of treatments--all ethical.\n  I want to look at the budgetary numbers briefly to remind my \ncolleagues where we have invested taxpayer funding in this field. It is \nmy hope that as we look at the numbers--we have an ethical issue on \nhuman embryonic stem cell research, and I believe we have crossed over \nthe line. I hope we can continue to look at our funding issues, where \nwe are putting a lot of money, and have put a lot of money, into \nembryonic stem cell research. We are looking at $140 million in fiscal \nyear 2006 and over half a billion since 2002 in embryonic stem cell \nresearch of both human and nonhuman types. We have not cured a single \npatient yet with that money.\n  May I submit to my colleagues that with over half a billion dollars, \nwe could be treating and developing these cures in the United States \nand not in Brazil.\n  In trying to set aside all of the sharp edges that have now been \nassociated with this debate, and focusing just on patients and treating \npeople, I hope we will say we are all in this for cures, for treating \npeople. So if I could take portions of these funds and put it into \ntreating people and getting more people treated for Parkinson's, \ncongestive heart failure, or diabetes--all the things that we are \nactually doing in humans today but that need more research in funding--\nthat we would say: OK, you are right. We don't have to go the embryonic \nstem cell route now. Let's go to where people are getting treated and \ntreat people.\n  This is about curing people. That is what we have debated and talked \nabout for some period of time, curing people. We have one that is \nworking and one that doesn't. Yet we have invested pretty heavily in \nthis.\n  I ask my colleagues if there is some way that we could put the swords \ndown and talk about this rationally, stop the fighting and say how do \nwe treat people. I believe that is our objective.\n  With that, I thank my colleagues for their indulgence in this debate. \nIt will continue to come up. The next issue will be human animal \ncrosses. I advise my colleagues on this, you will see people pushing to \ncross genetic materials from animals into humans. They are going to say \nit is going to cure a lot of people. I think it is an enormous ethical \nboundary that we should not cross at this point in time, with our \nunderstanding of life and what it is to be human. I hope before we go \nthat route, we will all get together and say we are going to pause for \na while on this one. This is too big for all of us, and we want to \nthink about this for a while--left, right, middle. We have a ways to go \nto get some cures. We are getting them. We don't need to cross over to \nthat. We can think about that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n  Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Lines Derived from Human Somatic Cells\n\n       Somatic cell nuclear transfer allows trans-acting factors \n     present in the mammalian oocyte to reprogram somatic cell \n     nuclei to an undifferentiated state. Here we show that four \n     factors (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28) are sufficient to \n     reprogram human somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells that \n     exhibit the essential characteristics of embryonic stem \n     cells. These human induced pluripotent stem cells have normal \n     karyotypes, express telomerase activity, express cell surface \n     markers and genes that characterize human ES cells, and \n     maintain the developmental potential to differentiate into \n     advanced derivatives of all three primary germ layers. Such \n     human induced pluripotent cell lines should be useful in the \n     production of new disease models and in drug development as \n     well as application in transplantation medicine once \n     technical limitations (for example, mutation through viral \n     integration) are eliminated.\n       Mammalian embryogenesis elaborates distinct developmental \n     stages in a strict temporal order. Nonetheless, because \n     development is dictated by epigenetic rather than genetic \n     events, differentiation is, in principle, reversible. The \n     cloning of Dolly demonstrated that nuclei from mammalian \n     differentiated cells can be reprogrammed to an \n     undifferentiated state by trans-acting factors present in the \n     oocyte (1), and this discovery led to a search for factors \n     that could mediate similar reprogramming without somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer. Recently. four transcription factors (Oct4, \n     Sox2, c-myc, and Klf4) were shown to be sufficient to \n     reprogram mouse fibroblasts to undifferentiated, pluripotent \n     stem cells (termed induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells) (2-\n     5). Reprogramming human cells by defined factors would allow \n     the generation of patient-specific pluripotent cell lines \n     without somatic cell nuclear transfer, but the observation \n     that the expression of c-Myc causes death and differentiation \n     of human ES cells suggests that combinations of factors \n     lacking this gene are required to reprogram human cells (6). \n     Here we demonstrate that OCT4, S0X2, NANOG, and LIN28 are \n     sufficient to reprogram human somatic cells.\n       Human ES cells can reprogram myeloid precursors through \n     cell fusion (7). To identify candidate reprogramming factors, \n     we compiled a list of genes with enriched expression in human \n     ES cells relative to myeloid precursors, and prioritized the \n     list based on known involvement in the establishment or \n     maintenance of pluripotency (table S1). We then cloned these \n     genes into a lentiviral vector (fig. S1) to screen for \n     combinations of genes that could reprogram the differentiated \n     derivatives of an OCT4 knock-in human ES cell line generated \n     through homologous recombination (8). In this cell line, the \n     expression of neomycin phosphotransferase, which make cells \n     resistant to geneticin, is driven by an endogenous OCT4 \n     promoter, a gene that is highly expressed in pluripotent \n     cells but not in differentiated cells. Thus reprogramming \n     events reactivating the OCT4 promoter can be recovered by \n     geneticin selection. The first combination of 14 genes we \n     selected (table S2) directed reprogramming of adherent cells \n     derived from human ES cell-derived CD45+ hematopoietic cells \n     (7, 9), to geneticin-resistant (OCT4 positive) colonies with \n     an ES cell-morphology (fig. S2A) (10). These geneticin-\n     resistant colonies expressed typical human ES cell-specific \n     cell surface markers (fig. S2B) and formed teratomas when \n     injected into immunocompromised SCID-beige mice (fig. S2C).\n       By testing subsets of the 14 initial genes. we identified a \n     core set of 4 genes, OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28, that were \n     capable of reprogramming human ES cell-derived somatic cells \n     with a mesenchymal phenotype (Fig. 1A and fig. S3). Removal \n     of either OCT4 or SOX2 from the reprogramming mixture \n     eliminated the appearance of geneticin resistant (OCT4 \n     positive) reprogrammed mesenchymal clones (Fig. 1A). NANOG \n     showed a beneficial effect in clone recovery from human ES \n     cell-derived mesenchymal cells but was not required for the \n     initial appearance of such clones (Fig. 1A). These results \n     are consistent with cell fusion-mediated reprogramming \n     experiments, where overexpression of Nanog in mouse ES \n     cells resulted in over a 200-fold increase in \n     reprogramming efficiency (11). The expression of NANOG \n     also improves the cloning efficiency of human ES cells \n     (12). and thus could increase the survival rate of early \n     reprogrammed cells. LIN28 had a consistent but more modest \n     effect on reprogrammed mesenchymal cell clone recovery \n     (Fig. 1A).\n       We next tested whether OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28 are \n     sufficient to reprogram primary, genetically unmodified, \n     diploid human fibroblasts. We initially chose IMR90 fetal \n     fibroblasts because these diploid human cells are being \n     extensively characterized by the ENCODE Consortium (13), are \n     readily available through the American Type Culture \n     Collection (ATCC, Catalog No. CCL-186) and have published DNA \n     fingerprints that allow confirmation of the origin of \n     reprogrammed clones. IMR90 cells also proliferate robustly \n     for more than 20 passages before undergoing senescence but \n     grow slowly in human ES cell culture conditions, a difference \n     that provides a proliferative advantage to reprogrammed \n     clones and aids in their selection by morphological criteria \n     (compact colonies, high nucleus to cytoplasm ratios, and \n     prominent nucleoli) alone (14, 15). IMR90 cells were \n     transduced with a combination of OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and \n     LIN28. Colonies with a human ES cell morphology (iPS \n     colonies) first became visible after 12 days \n     posttransduction. On day 20, a total of 198 iPS colonies were \n     visible from 0.9 million starting IMR90 cells whereas no iPS \n     colonies were observed in non-\n\n[[Page S14823]]\n\n     transduced controls. Forty-one iPS colonies were picked, 35 \n     of which were successfully expanded for an additional three \n     weeks. Four clones (iPS(IMR90)1-4) with minimal \n     differentiation were selected for continued expansion and \n     detailed analysis.\n       Each of the four iPS(IMR90) clones had a typical human ES \n     cell morphology (Fig. 1B) and a normal karyotype at both 6 \n     and 17 weeks of culture (Fig. 2A). Each iPS(IMR90) clone \n     expressed telomerase activity (Fig. 2B) and the human ES \n     cell-specific cell surface antigens SSEA-3, SSEA-4, Tra-1-60 \n     and Tra-1-81 (Fig. 2C) whereas the parental IMR90 cells did \n     not. Microarray analyses of gene expression of the four \n     iPS(IMR90) clones confirmed a similarity to five human ES \n     cell lines (H1, H7, H9, H13 and H14) and a dissimilarity to \n     IMR90 cells (Fig. 3, table S3, and fig. S4). Although there \n     was some variation in gene expression between different \n     iPS(IMR90) clones (fig. S5), the variation was actually less \n     than that between different human ES cell lines (Fig. 3A and \n     table S3). For each of the iPS(IMR90) clones, the expression \n     of the endogenous OCT4 and NANOG was at levels similar to \n     that of human ES cells, but the exogenous expression of these \n     genes varied between clones and between genes (Fig. 3B). For \n     OCT4, some expression from the transgene was detectable in \n     all of the clones, but for NANOG, most of the clones \n     demonstrated minimal exogenous expression, suggesting \n     silencing of the transgene during reprogramming. Analyses \n     of the methylation status of the OCT4 promoter showed \n     differential methylation between human ES cells and IMR90 \n     cells (fig. S6). All four iPS(IMR90) clones exhibited a \n     demethylation pattern similar to that of human ES cells \n     and distinct from the parental IMR90 cells. Both embryoid \n     body (fig. S7) and teratoma formation (Fig. 4) \n     demonstrated that all four of the reprogrammed iPS(IMR90) \n     clones had the developmental potential to give rise to \n     differentiated derivatives of all three primary germ \n     layers. DNA fingerprinting analyses (short tandem repeat-\n     STR) confirmed that these iPS clones were derived from \n     IMR90 cells and confirmed that they were not from the \n     human ES cell lines we have in the laboratory (table S4). \n     The STR analysis published on the ATCC website for IMR90 \n     cells employed the same primer sets and confirms the \n     identity of the IMR90 cells used for these experiments. \n     The iPS(IMR90) clones were passaged at the same ratio \n     (1:6) and frequency (every 5 days) as human ES cells, had \n     doubling times similar to that of the human H1 ES cell \n     line assessed under the same conditions (table S5), and as \n     of this writing, have been in continuous culture for 22 \n     weeks with no observed period of replicative crisis. \n     Starting with an initial 4 wells of a 6-well plate of iPS \n     cells (one clone/well, approximately 1 million cells), \n     after 4 weeks of additional culture, 40 total 10-cm dishes \n     (representing approximately 350 million cells) of the 4 \n     iPS(IMR90) clones were cryopreserved and confirmed to have \n     normal karyotypes.\n       Since IMR90 cells are of fetal origin, we next examined \n     reprogramming of postnatal fibroblasts. Human newborn \n     foreskin fibroblasts (ATCC, Catalog No. CRL-2097) were \n     transduced with OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28. From 0.6 \n     million foreskin fibroblasts, we obtained 57 iPS colonies. No \n     iPS colonies were observed in non-transduced controls. \n     Twenty-seven out of 29 picked colonies were successfully \n     expanded for three passages, four of which (iPS(foreskin)-l \n     to 4) were selected for continued expansion and analyses. DNA \n     fingerprinting of the iPS(foreskin) clones matched the \n     fingerprints for the parental fibroblast cell line published \n     on the ATCC website (table S4).\n       Each of the four iPS(foreskin) clones had a human ES cell \n     morphology (fig. S8A), had a normal karyotype (fig. S8B), and \n     expressed telomerase, cell surface markers, and genes \n     characteristic of human ES cells (Figs. 2 and 3 and fig. S5). \n     Each of the four iPS(foreskin) clones proliferated robustly, \n     and as of this writing, have been in continuous culture for \n     14 weeks. Each clone demonstrated multilineage \n     differentiation both in embryoid bodies and teratomas (figs. \n     S9 and S10); however, unlike the iPS(IMR90) clones, there was \n     variation between the clones in the lineages apparent in \n     teratomas examined at 5 weeks. In particular, neural \n     differentiation was common in teratomas from iPS(foreskin) \n     clones 1 and 2 (fig. S9A), but was largely absent in \n     teratomas from iPS(foreskin) clones 3 and 4. Instead, \n     there were multiple foci of columnar epithelial cells \n     reminiscent of primitive ectoderm (fig. S9D). This is \n     consistent with the embryoid body data (fig. Sl0), where \n     the increase in PAX6 (a neural marker) in iPS(foreskin) \n     clones 3 and 4 was minimal compared to the other clones, a \n     difference that correlated with a failure to downregulate \n     NANOG and OCT4. A possible explanation for these \n     differences is that specific integration sites in these \n     clones allowed continued high expression of the lentiviral \n     transgenes, partially blocking differentiation.\n       PCR for the four transgenes revealed that OCT4, SOX2, and \n     NANOG were integrated into all four of the iPS(IMR90) clones \n     and all four of the iPS(foreskin) clones, but that LIN28 was \n     absent from one iPS(IMR90) clone (#4) and from one \n     iPS(foreskin) clone (#1) (Fig. 2D). Thus, although LIN28 can \n     influence the frequency of reprogramming (Fig. 1A), these \n     results confirm that it is not absolutely required for the \n     initial reprogramming, nor is it subsequently required for \n     the stable expansion of reprogrammed cells.\n       The human iPS cells described here meet the defining \n     criteria we originally proposed for human ES cells (14), with \n     the significant exception that the iPS cells are not derived \n     from embryos. Similar to human ES cells, human iPS cells \n     should prove useful for studying the development and function \n     of human tissues, for discovering and testing new drugs, and \n     for transplantation medicine. For transplantation therapies \n     based on these cells, with the exception of autoimmune \n     diseases, patient-specific iPS cell lines should largely \n     eliminate the concern of immune rejection. It is important to \n     understand, however, that before the cells can be used in the \n     clinic, additional work is required to avoid vectors that \n     integrate into the genome, potentially introducing mutations \n     at the insertion site. For drug development, human iPS cells \n     should make it easier to generate panels of cell lines that \n     more closely reflect the genetic diversity of a population, \n     and should make it possible to generate cell lines from \n     individuals predisposed to specific diseases. Human ES cells \n     remain controversial because their derivation involves the \n     destruction of human preimplantation embryos and iPS cells \n     remove this concern. However, further work is needed to \n     determine if human iPS cells differ in clinically significant \n     ways from ES cells.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n              Dolly Creator Prof Ian Wilmut Shuns Cloning\n\n                          (By Roger Highfield)\n\n       The scientist who created Dolly the sheep, a breakthrough \n     that provoked headlines around the world a decade ago, is to \n     abandon the cloning technique he pioneered to create her.\n       Prof Ian Wilmut's decision to turn his back on \n     ``therapeutic cloning'', just days after US researchers \n     announced a breakthrough in the cloning of primates, will \n     send shockwaves through the scientific establishment.\n       He and his team made headlines around the world in 1997 \n     when they unveiled Dolly, born July of the year before.\n       But now he has decided not to pursue a licence to clone \n     human embryos, which he was awarded just two years ago, as \n     part of a drive to find new treatments for the devastating \n     degenerative condition, Motor Neuron disease.\n       Prof Wilmut, who works at Edinburgh University, believes a \n     rival method pioneered in Japan has better potential for \n     making human embryonic cells which can be used to grow a \n     patient's own cells and tissues for a vast range of \n     treatments, from treating strokes to heart attacks and \n     Parkinson's, and will be less controversial than the Dolly \n     method, known as ``nuclear transfer.''\n       His announcement could mark the beginning of the end for \n     therapeutic cloning, on which tens of millions of pounds have \n     been spent worldwide over the past decade. ``I decided a few \n     weeks ago not to pursue nuclear transfer,'' Prof Wilmut said.\n       Most of his motivation is practical but he admits the \n     Japanese approach is also ``easier to accept socially.''\n       His inspiration comes from the research by Prof Shinya \n     Yamanaka at Kyoto University, which suggests a way to create \n     human embryo stem cells without the need for human eggs, \n     which are in extremely short supply, and without the need to \n     create and destroy human cloned embryos, which is bitterly \n     opposed by the pro life movement.\n       Prof Yamanaka has shown in mice how to turn skin cells into \n     what look like versatile stem cells potentially capable of \n     overcoming the effects of disease.\n       This pioneering work to revert adult cells to an embryonic \n     state has been reproduced by a team in America and Prof \n     Yamanaka is, according to one British stem cell scientist, \n     thought to have achieved the same feat in human cells.\n       This work has profound significance because it suggests \n     that after a heart attack, for example, skin cells from a \n     patient might one day be manipulated by adding a cocktail of \n     small molecules to form muscle cells to repair damage to the \n     heart, or brain cells to repair the effects of Parkinson's. \n     Because they are the patient's own cells, they would not be \n     rejected.\n       In theory, these reprogrammed cells could be converted into \n     any of the 200 other type in the body, even the collections \n     of different cell types that make up tissues and, in the very \n     long term, organs too. Prof Wilmut said it was ``extremely \n     exciting and astonishing'' and that he now plans to do \n     research in this area.\n       This approach, he says, represents, the future for stem \n     cell research, rather than the nuclear transfer method that \n     his large team used more than a decade ago at the Roslin \n     Institute, near Edinburgh, to create Dolly.\n       In this method, the DNA contents of an adult cell are put \n     into an emptied egg and stimulated with a shock of \n     electricity to develop into a cloned embryo, which must be \n     then dismantled to yield the flexible stem cells.\n       More than a decade ago, biologists though the mechanisms \n     that picked the relevant DNA code that made a cell adopt the \n     identity of skin, rather than muscle, brain or whatever, were \n     so complex and so rigidly fixed that it would not be possible \n     to undo them.\n       They were amazed when this deeply-held conviction was \n     overturned by Dolly, the first mammal to be cloned from an \n     adult cell, a feat with numerous practical applications, most \n     remarkably in stem cell science.\n       But although ``therapeutic cloning'' offers a way to get a \n     patient's own embryonic stem cells to generate unlimited \n     supplies of cells\n\n[[Page S14824]]\n\n     and tissue there is an intense search for alternatives \n     because of pressure from the pro-life lobby, the opposition \n     of President George W Bush and ever present concerns about \n     cloning babies.\n       Prof Wilmut's decision signals the lack of progress in \n     extending his team's pioneering work on Dolly to humans.\n       The hurdles seem to have been overcome a few years ago by a \n     team led by Prof Hwang Woo-Suk in South Korea, with whom he \n     set up a collaboration.\n       Then it was discovered Prof Hwang's work was fraudulent. \n     ``We spent a long time talking to him before discovering it \n     was all a fraud,'' he said. ``I never really got started \n     again after that.''\n       And Prof Wilmut believes there is still a long way to go \n     for therapeutic cloning to work, despite the headlines \n     greeting this week's announcement in Nature by Dr Shoukhrat \n     Mitalipov and colleagues at Oregon Health & Science \n     University, Beaverton, that they cloned primate embryos.\n       In all Dr Mitalipov used 304 eggs from 14 rhesus monkeys to \n     make two lines of embryonic stem cells, one of which was \n     chromosomally abnormal. Dr Mitalipov himself admits the \n     efficiency is low and, though his work is a ``proof of \n     principle'' and the efficiency of his methods has improved, \n     he admits it is not yet a cost effective medical option.\n       Cloning is still too wasteful of precious human eggs, which \n     are in great demand for fertility treatments, to consider for \n     creating embryonic stem cells. ``It is a nice success but a \n     bit limited,'' commented Prof Wilmut. ``Given the low \n     efficiency, you wonder just how long nuclear transfer will \n     have a useful life.''\n       Nor is it clear, he said, why the Oregon team was \n     successful, which will hamper attempts to improve their \n     methods. Instead, Prof Wilmut is backing direct reprogramming \n     or ``de-differentiation'', the embryo free route pursued by \n     Prof Yamanaka, which he finds ``100 times more interesting.''\n       ``The odds are that by the time we make nuclear transfer \n     work in humans, direct reprogramming will work too.\n       I am anticipating that before too long we will be able to \n     use the Yamanaka approach to achieve the same, without making \n     human embryos. I have no doubt that in the long term, direct \n     reprogramming will be more productive, though we can't be \n     sure exactly when, next year or five years into the future.''\n       Prof Yamanaka's work suggests the dream of converting adult \n     cells into those that can grow into many different types can \n     be realised remarkably easily.\n       When his team used a virus to add four genes (called Oct4, \n     Sox2, c-Myc and KIf4) into adult mouse fibroblast cells they \n     found they could find resulting embryo-like cells by sifting \n     the result for the one in 10,000 cells that make proteins \n     Nanog or Oct4, both typical markers of embryonic cells.\n       When they studied how genes are used in these reprogrammed \n     cells, ``called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells'', they \n     were typical of the activity seen in an embryo. In the test \n     tube, the new cells look and grow like embryonic stem cells.\n       And they were also able to generate viable chimaeras from \n     the cells, where the embryo cells created by the new method \n     could be mixed with those of a mouse embryo to grow into a \n     viable adult which could pass on the DNA of the reprogrammed \n     cells to the next generation.\n       Nonetheless, there will have to be much work to establish \n     that they behave like embryo cells, let alone see if they are \n     safe enough to use in the body. Even so, in the short term \n     they will offer an invaluable way to create lines of cells \n     from people with serious diseases, such as motor neuron \n     disease, to shed light on the mechanisms.\n       Given the history of fraud in this field, the Oregon \n     research was reproduced by Dr David Cram and colleagues at \n     Monash University, Melbourne. ``At this stage, nuclear \n     transfer to create pluripotent stem cell lines remains an \n     inefficient process,'' said Dr Cram.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14824-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14824-S14826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX AND 3-PERCENT WITHHOLDING\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today to \nspeak about two very important issues to America's taxpayers.\n  The first, of course, is the alternative minimum tax on which we had \na cloture vote this morning. That is a very serious matter. I voted \nagainst a motion to proceed because I do not believe the best way to \nprevent a tax increase on 25 million taxpayers is to raise taxes \nelsewhere by about $80 billion. There is an old phrase out there saying \nthat you are going to rob Peter to pay Paul. Obviously, Peter feels his \npocket has been picked, but Paul might feel pretty good about it. And \nthat is the scheme that was played out here. It is a switch game that \ngoes on. The alternative minimum tax is important, but you don't do \nwhat they are doing. How can you give a tax break that is already going \nout somewhere else and raising taxes to give it? That is the issue at \nhand. I hope the majority is serious about protecting millions of \nmiddle-class taxpayers by bringing realistic, bipartisan legislation to \nfix the AMT, something both sides of the aisle can and, in all \nfairness, should support.\n  Even though I did not support how this legislation was crafted, there \nis a provision in the tax extender package that I wish to highlight \nbecause it is very important to taxpayers.\n  The bill we just voted on contained a provision to delay for 1 year a \nFederal mandate that requires every level of government--Federal, \nState, and local--to deduct and withhold a 3-percent tax on all \npayments of goods and services if that government spends $100 million \nor more for those goods and services. Oh, yes, that is a shuffle game \nthat has been going on in the Finance Committees in the House and the \nSenate for some time, and it was slipped in as a way to grab some \nmoney. I saw that coming early on and began to object to it and began \nto look at the figures on it when others of us were saying: Well, gee, \nI thought that was an ability to raise some more money. I was pleased \nthis issue was finally addressed, but what we need is full repeal of \nthis terrible tax policy, not just a 1-year delay, although I must say \na 1-year delay is going to awaken a lot of my colleagues because their \nState, county, and city governments are going to be calling, if they \nhaven't already, saying: Wake up, you are putting a substantial tax on \ntop of us.\n  I have come to the floor of the Senate today to renew a promise I \nmade over a year ago. The same day this Senate provided tax relief for \nmillions of Americans by passing the Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act of 2005, for which I voted, I pledged to do all I \ncould to remove this terrible provision I just talked about that was \nquietly slipped into the conference report as a last-minute revenue \nraiser. So I stand here today to renew that pledge.\n  Last year, I told Members of the Senate this provision would not go \nunnoticed, and I was right. Once taxpayers learned what this Congress \nhad done in the middle of the night when somebody wasn't watching, they \nbegan to react. Angry taxpayers from across the Nation are joining \nforces, organizing coalitions, and rallying grassroots support to fix \nthis unjust tax policy. I applaud them for their efforts, and I am here \nto help them.\n  Let me take a couple of minutes to share what hundreds of angry \ntaxpayers shared with me. I want every Member of the Senate to listen \ncarefully. I want them to understand how this 3-percent tax withholding \nwill affect each and every one of their constituents. I want them to \nunderstand why this mandatory 3-percent withholding tax is so bad.\n  First, 3-percent withholding was justified in the name of closing a \ntax gap. Proponents argued it would improve compliance. I will show a \nchart. They say it will improve tax compliance by approximately $7 \nbillion over 5 years. I do not agree, and neither do the numbers.\n  These numbers are based on the Joint Tax Committee's original \nestimates. These numbers are simply slightly different when we take the \n1-year delay that was in the provision that was on the floor this \nmorning into account. But these numbers tell the story of why this is \nsuch a terrible provision.\n  In 2011, the first year this provision goes into effect, this 3-\npercent withholding tax accounts for about $6.79 billion in new \nrevenue--boom, a big chunk of new revenue. Can't you see the spenders \non the floor of the Senate salivating as they factor that into their \nbudgets and bring down their deficit margins? However, each year after \nthis provision only brings in about $200 million. Why is that? I will \ntell you. Because about $5.8 billion will be rightly returned to the \ntaxpayers each year\n\n[[Page S14825]]\n\nthereafter. So it is a big bubble once, but then it is a constant tax.\n  Proponents argue that 3-percent withholding will improve tax \ncompliance by $7 billion over 5 years. It is simply not true. The real \nvalue of increased tax compliance is only about $200 million. The bulk \nof these revenues, $5.8 billion, are not found. It is not real money. \nThey are accelerated tax receipts. Contemplate that into any private or \npublic budget or revenue and my guess is an accountant would say you \nare cooking the books; you can't get away with that; that is not real \nmoney.\n\n  Many of our taxpayers are already skeptical of what we do around here \nand would suggest we are not dealing in the real world in our desire to \nspend money and pay for it in some way. That is exactly what is \nhappening. The finance committees in the conference that put this in \ncooked the books. As the pressure builds, that is why, well, we better \npush this back for 1 year.\n  Now, even though these estimates say you are bringing in $200 million \nin new revenue, which is a good thing, I guess, I am here to argue that \nthe harmful consequence of withholding 3 percent on all payments of \ngoods and services--and when I said that, the presiding officer brought \nhis head up. The reason he did, and the reason any of us do when we \nhear about these things is, wait a minute, you are taxing goods and \nservices of counties and cities and State government. Why are you doing \nthat? This is going to far and away exceed the benefit we gain from \nadditional tax revenue because somehow it makes its way through, \nobviously, to the constituent at the local level.\n  Not only are their numbers misleading you, but the unintended \nconsequence of this tax withholding are very serious. Who is going to \nbear the burden of enforcement and implementation--the IRS? The Federal \nGovernment? Oh, no. The burden is going to be borne by State and local \ngovernments--your cities, my cities, our counties, our States, and \ncompanies large and small that do business with our Government are \ngoing to have to reach into their pockets in advance. The magical \nthreshold is $100 million. Well, we say that is only for big business. \nWell, a lot of our cities out there today and a lot of our counties out \nthere today and certainly all of our States fit into that category.\n  Let me give an idea of what I am talking about. The State \ncomptroller's office in my State of Idaho, an office that would oversee \ncompliance of all State agencies with this new tax-withholding \nrequirement, conservatively estimates it would cost that office, that \noffice alone, about $358,000 to implement and about $78,000 a year to \ncarry it on. Now, remember this is a State of 1.5 million people. This \nis not 10 million or 12 million or 14 million people. Those are real \ndollars. That is one office in a small State. When you add all the \nother Idaho State agencies and offices that must also comply, those \nnumbers will go up. So it is not overstating the case to say.\n  That tax withholding will collectively cost my State of Idaho \nmillions of dollars to implement.\n  Now, think of what it would cost the State of Colorado, substantially \nlarger than the State of Idaho, or the State of California, Florida or \nTexas. The numbers get big, and the numbers get staggering. What about \nour city and county governments? They will have to comply as well if \nthey spend $100 million a year. That is the threshold.\n  Most counties and cities don't even know what is about to hit them, \nbut there is one that does, and they figured out how much it is going \nto cost them. Let me talk about Miami, Dade County, FL. They expect \nwithholding provisions to cost them $27 million. Let me say it again. \nThe new tax withholding will cost Dade County, FL, $27 million. Now, if \nit costs them that, what do they do? They pay it. Do they cut services \nto their constituents or do they go out and raise taxes to offset it so \nthey don't have to cut services? Because they are going to be forced to \npay it by the Federal Government.\n  It is not a stretch to say this is going to cost our States, our \ncounties, and our city governments millions and millions of dollars a \nyear. That cost, as I said a few moments ago, has to be moved somewhere \nelse. You either cut the services that the counties or the cities \nprovide or you raise taxes to offset. The unsuspecting victim \nultimately then has to be the taxpayer. Either the services they expect \nfrom their government are gone or they take a little more out of their \nback pocket.\n  Proponents of the 3 percent withholding tax are saying this is the \nbest way to make sure everybody pays their fair share of taxes. Well, \nit is a new tax. I disagree. I don't think this is the best way to do \nit. I believe all citizens ought to pay their taxes. I think you and I \nwould agree with that. I also believe our taxes should be \nstraightforward, transparent, and fair. This new withholding tax is not \nstraightforward, it is not transparent, and I suggest it isn't very \nfair. It is simply another way for the Feds to get their hands in the \nhip pocket of every level of government below them and into the poor \ntaxpayer's pocket, ultimately.\n  The new withholding tax, ultimately, will devastate businesses and \ntheir customers across the Nation. Let me explain about businesses now. \nIt isn't just governments that are going to have to be paying this. If \nyou own a business and you have a contract to provide goods and \nservices to the cities or the State, or the Federal Government for that \nmatter, then the Government will not pay you in full. Oh, my goodness. \nYou cut a contract with the Federal Government for ``X'' hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to provide goods and services and they withhold 3 \npercent before they send you the money. So how are you going to deal \nwith that one? Because that is exactly what will happen.\n  Competitive contracting? Very tight. We hope the margins are tight. \nWe want the margins to be tight. So they will keep your money for 12 to \n15 months because it is withheld. So where do you go then to get the \nmoney to provide the goods and services? You go borrow it. That endless \ncircle goes on. Doing business with the Federal Government will be more \ncostly, and, ironically, it will cost the Federal Government more if we \nexpect private contractors to deal with our Government.\n  Here is the problem with that. It will impact nearly every industry \nin our Nation and it will negatively affect nearly every business or \norganization in America that contracts with a government entity to \nprovide goods and services. Many industries, especially health care and \nconstruction, and most small businesses will be particularly hard hit, \nbecause a 3-percent withholding is actually larger than, in many \ninstances, the entire profit on a contract. Think that one through. If \nthe tax withheld is larger than the profit, why would you want to \nengage in business with the Government? This will seriously impede cash \nflow, which for small businesses can mean deciding between meeting a \npayroll, expanding a company or buying needed equipment. We leave small \nbusinesses with only two options: They either pass the cost along to \ntheir consumer and the price of business goes up, or they borrow money \nfrom the bank and make up the shortfall. Of course, when you borrow \nmoney from a bank, it is going to cost you a little money to do it, and \nso down goes the margin of profit, down goes the viability, and down \ngoes the strength and the ability of a small business to compete.\n\n  It is ironic we are forcing these small businesses to take out a loan \nto pay for our mistakes while the Federal Government is essentially \ngetting an interest-free loan from the taxpayer. That is not right.\n  I am on the floor of the Senate today honoring a commitment I made 1 \nyear ago to speak out and to help shape coalitions to make America \naware of what had been slipped into a conference in the dark of night \nthat was going to impact them directly. Well, it is working. Slowly but \nsurely America is awakening to this phantom gain our tax writers \nthought they could get for our tax spenders.\n  I sponsored legislation to repeal the 3-percent withholding. I have \nnot yet won that fight, but to all who are listening, the tax writers \nare starting to blink. That is why the 1-year extension was stuck into \nthis AMT provision, because all of a sudden the pressure is beginning \nto build and those politicians who raise your taxes are slightly \nfeeling the pressure. We have to keep it on because a 1-year extension \nsimply is not good enough. A full repeal is what we must ask for, \nunless we want to pass all of this through to our cities, to\n\n[[Page S14826]]\n\nour counties, to our States, to the business and industry that does \nbusiness with our governments, and ultimately to you, the taxpayer, who \nalways pays the bill in the end no matter who writes the check.\n  So it is important. I hope we can work out the differences we have \nacross the aisle on the AMT. I hope when we do that, the 1-year \nextension will be in there because we will have had one step down a \nroad toward victory in getting the 3-percent withholding tax repealed.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar).

Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about why it is so important that we pass the 2007 farm bill. When \na lot of people think of my home State of Washington, they think about \nSeattle and Boeing and Microsoft, and all those important things, but \nfarming is an incredibly important part of Washington State's economy. \nWe happen to be the eleventh largest farm State in the Nation and we \nare the third largest producer of fruits and vegetables, which are also \nknown around here as specialty crops. This farm bill is very important \nto my home State because it will keep our State healthy and strong.\n  In fact, farming has been an important part of my own personal life. \nMy grandfather moved to the Tri-Cities in central Washington to take a \njob with Welch's Grape Juice factory a long time ago, in the early \n1900s, and my own dad grew up picking asparagus in central Washington. \nMy hometown of Bothell, WA, where I grew up--a small town of about \n1,000 people, now backyard to Microsoft--when I was growing up there, \nwe were surrounded by berry farms. We grew up with a very clear \nunderstanding of how important family farms are to Washington State's \neconomy. So I know personally that passing the farm legislation before \nus is absolutely critical for our farmers, who grow apples or cherries, \npeaches or grapes, asparagus, potatoes, and many of the other important \nproducts to Washington State.\n  I know this is not a perfect bill, this farm bill, but it is the best \nfarm bill in years for my home State farmers, largely because of what \nit does for those specialty crops I talked about. My home State and our \nNation cannot be strong unless our farmers are doing well, and this \nfarm bill helps them stay strong by investing in programs that help \nthem find markets for their crops both here in the United States and \nabroad. Importantly, this bill will help fund research to ensure that \nour farmers have a healthy and safe crop in the future.\n  The Senate now has an opportunity to move forward a very good farm \nbill. Unfortunately, as we all are aware now, we have become bogged \ndown because the Republicans are now insisting on unrelated amendments \nthat threaten to kill the help our farmers need and deserve today. So I \nwant to be clear about what is happening here. Republicans have been \ncomplaining for the last several days about the need to move forward \nlegislation of any kind, but here they are blocking this bill.\n  I hope we can eventually make progress, but I want to talk this \nafternoon about what this farm bill can do and what we are losing if we \ndon't move it forward. The biggest victory in this farm bill for \nWashington State is the $2.2 billion that will help our specialty crop \nfarmers. This is the very first time in this Nation we have addressed \nthese specialty crops in a comprehensive and meaningful way. The money \nin this bill will help carry out programs I have been pushing very hard \nfor in the last several years.\n  In this bill, we have $270 million in block grants. Those block \ngrants will help our local growers increase the competitiveness of \ntheir crops. We have $15 million in badly needed aid for our asparagus \nfarmers, who have been struggling to compete in this global marketplace \nthey are required to be in, because we have been seeing a flood of \ncheap asparagus coming in from Peru.\n  This bill also helps our farmers compete in what we all know is an \nincreasingly global marketplace and to find new markets abroad for \ntheir crops. We know South America and China and other countries are \naggressively pursuing selling their crops in many of these very \nimportant nations overseas. We have to remain competitive and we have \nto give our farmers the ability to get out there and let other people \nknow what we have so we can be competitive in that market.\n  This farm bill, importantly, increases funding for technical \nassistance for the specialty crop programs that will help our farmers \novercome some of the barriers that threaten their ability to export \ntheir crops today. This is so important to my home State. I actually \nwas out in our State last week, as many of us were after the \nThanksgiving holiday. I was in Yakima, WA, where I had a listening \nsession with some of our farmers, and there were some cherry farmers \nthere who are working very hard to develop a new program in Japan. They \nwere talking about how this technical assistance will help them help \nthe Japanese understand how important this is so we can open an entire \nnew market that will help my farmers locally but certainly help our \nNation be competitive in this global marketplace.\n  Another thing this bill will do will be to help ensure that nurseries \ncan continue to have access to safe and virus-free plant materials. \nThis is extremely important. Apples, peaches, and grapes are very \nvulnerable to viruses. A single plant or a single grapevine can infect \nand wipe out an entire established orchard or vineyard. Washington \nState University at Prosser is doing some national research on this \ntopic and they are going to be an incredibly important part of this \nnational clean plant network.\n\n  I also wish to talk about a part of this bill that gets neglected way \ntoo often as we talk about it, and that is the nutritional programs. I \nthink very few people realize that over half of the farm bill goes to \nthese important nutritional programs. Those are the programs that will \nhelp our kids in our schools get access to fresh fruits and vegetables \nin their school lunches. We hear all these reports about obesity. I \nread this morning that the life expectancy of the younger generation is \ngoing to be, for the first time, less than our generation because of \nobesity. We have to make sure our kids, at the very youngest ages, are \ngetting access to the best nutrition possible. This farm bill helps to \ndo that, to make sure fruits and vegetables are part of a nutritious \nlunch and are accessible at an early age when they are beginning to \nunderstand, to learn, and to eat the right things so we don't have \nobesity which, as we all know, leads to a lot of the health care \nproblems in this Nation today.\n  The farm bill also is helpful in terms of the nutritional programs \nfor people who get food stamps and other assistance, so they also get \naccess to fresh, nutritious food. The bill will help end the benefit \nerosion we have seen in the food stamp program over the years, and that \nis especially important today for our low-income families. Our low-\nincome families are struggling today with gas prices rising, health \ncare access, and all the other things that impact them, just as much if \nnot more than most of the rest of our families. Making sure they have \naccess to a food stamp program that makes sure they have adequate \nnutrition is especially keen and especially important right now. To use \nan old cliche, I see this as a win-win. These nutritional programs help \nour children and adults fight obesity and, at the same time, it helps \nour specialty crop growers.\n  Finally, I wish we had been able to include important improvements to \nthe safety net that is so critical to the wheat farmers in my State. I \nhave been working for a number of years now with the wheat farmers in \nWashington State to help improve the countercyclical payment program so \nit will actually work for them. Unfortunately, we could not make \nsignificant changes in this bill, but I am happy the bill holds them \nharmless, and that was important.\n  None of us get everything we want in this bill. I am not out here on \nthe floor\n\n[[Page S14827]]\n\nto hold up this bill because I didn't get one thing I wanted. I am \nworking to move this bill forward because, in the large part, it is \nbest for our Nation's farmers, and I hope we all step back and \nrecognize that. In a democratic body, we have to fight for what we \nbelieve in, but at the end of the day it is our responsibility to make \nsure the larger bill moves forward. I find it very troubling that \nbecause some people didn't get something they wanted, they are now \nstopping this farm bill in the aggregate from moving forward.\n  We have a lot of opportunity now to do good for our farmers, so it is \nvery troubling that we see the Republicans coming to the floor now and \nobjecting to this bill. We have to ask: Why are they objecting? So we \ngo and look at the record, and they are saying they are not allowed to \nget, I think it is over 200 amendments now that are listed here up for \nconsideration on this bill. I was reading through them a few minutes \nago, on what they want us to vote on in order to move this farm bill \nforward. There are over 200 amendments. That is not going to happen in \nthe last 2 weeks we have in this session.\n  At the expense of asking for extraneous amendments that have nothing \nto do with the farm bill, they are holding up these critically \nimportant nutritional programs, programs that our farmers need in order \nto keep their livelihoods going, and sending out all across the Nation \na huge question mark about whether they are going to have what they \nneed as they move into the next growing cycles. I looked at this list \nof amendments. There are amendments they want us to consider on a farm \nbill for fire sprinklers and tort reform and estate tax repeal. They \nmay all be critical issues, but a farm bill is not where we consider \nthese issues.\n  This bill is far too important for our Nation's health and our \neconomy to use it now as a vehicle for some kind of political game. \nOnly once in our modern history has a nonrelevant amendment been added \nto the farm bill. Each and every time we have considered the farm bill, \nthe majority and the minority have worked out a reasonable agreement \nthat helps clear the path forward for this important bill. What we see \ntoday, unfortunately, is a Republican minority that has decided to \nthrow out the history books and continue to set a record-setting pace \nof obstruction and kill the help our farmers need and deserve.\n  Today our families are all struggling--gas prices, energy prices, \nmortgage crisis, health care costs. We have to get beyond the politics \nand make sure our farmers and our kids benefit from the very critical \ninvestments in this farm bill. These aren't just numbers in a bill. As \nyou well know, Madam President, coming from a State that depends on \nagriculture, these programs can make or break people's livelihoods.\n  We have got to come together, and I urge our Republicans to get their \nship in order, come to the table with a reasonable plan to move \nforward, and let us get this bill passed.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14827-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MAKING TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 1965\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the House amendments and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this bipartisan legislation makes \ntechnical changes to legislation I previously introduced, S. 487, along \nwith Senators Bond, Dorgan, Graham, Durbin, Mikulski, Pryor, Cardin, \nIsakson, Coleman, Brown, and Chambliss and which passed the Senate on \nJuly 9, 2007. Companion legislation, H.R. 710, was introduced in the \nHouse by Representatives Charles Norwood and Jay Inslee,\n\n[[Page S14828]]\n\nwhere the bill was renamed in honor of Representative Norwood, a \nlongtime advocate of organ donation, following his passing on February \n13, 2007. This legislation, which applied only to kidneys when first \nintroduced, was subsequently broadened in a Senate substitute amendment \nI offered and the Senate adopted unanimously on July 9, 2007. The \nlegislation was broadened to include paired donation of other organs as \nthe field of transplantation advances, and in order that those advances \nnot be hindered.\n  Today, the House has returned the bill passed by the Senate on July \n9, 2007, with several technical changes and we are all pleased that \nwith its adoption today and fast-track to the President for his \nsignature, the saving of thousands of lives is on the horizon.\n  Our legislation will save lives by increasing the number of kidneys \nand other organs available for transplantation through the process \ncalled paired organ donation. It addresses this relatively new \nprocedure, which is supported by numerous medical organizations, \nincluding the United Network for Organ Sharing, UNOS, the American \nSociety of Transplant Surgeons, the National Kidney Foundation, the \nAssociation of Organ Procurement Organizations, and the American \nSociety of Pediatric Nephrology, as well as many other organ donation \nand transplant organizations. Paired organ donation, which did not \nexist when the National Organ Transplant Act, NOTA, was enacted more \nthan two decades ago, will make it possible for thousands of people who \nwish to donate a kidney or other organ to a spouse, family member or \nfriend, but find that they are medically incompatible, to still become \nliving kidney donors.\n  In the process of organ paired donation, a donor who is willing to \ngive an organ to a family member or a friend, but is biologically \nincompatible, donates to another patient, who also has an incompatible \ndonor. By cross-matching two or more incompatible living donor \nrecipient pairs, more patients can receive organs and more donors can \ngive an organ. Paired organ donation results in donor-recipient \nmatching, that would not otherwise occur.\n  This legislation is necessary because the National Organ Transplant \nAct, NOTA, which contains a prohibition intended by Congress to \npreclude purchasing organs, is unintentionally impeding the \nfacilitation of matching incompatible pairs, as just described. Our \nlegislation would simply add paired donation to the list of other \nliving-related donation exemptions that Congress originally placed in \nNOTA. It removes an unintended impediment to paired donations by \nclarifying ambiguous language in section 301 of the National Organ \nTransplant Act, NOTA. That section has been interpreted by a number of \ntransplant centers to prohibit such donations. In section 301 of NOTA, \nCongress prohibited the buying and selling of organs. Subsection (a), \ntitled ``Prohibition of organ purchases,'' says, ``It shall be unlawful \nfor any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any \nhuman organ for valuable consideration . . .'' This legislation does \nnot remove or alter any current provision of NOTA, but simply adds a \nline to section 301 which states that paired kidney donations do not \nviolate it.\n  Congress surely never intended that the living donation arrangements \nthat permit paired donation be impeded by NOTA. Our bill simply makes \nthat clear. Some transplant professionals involved in these and other \ninnovative living kidney donation arrangements have proceeded in the \nreasonable belief that these arrangements do not violate section of 301 \nof NOTA, but they contend that they are doing so under a cloud.\n\n  No Federal dollars are needed to implement this change. And, for each \npatient who receives a kidney, Medicare will save roughly $220,000 in \nthe end-stage-renal disease program because of the significantly lower \ncost of transplantation compared to dialysis cost. It is essential that \nwe make the intent of Congress explicit so that transplant centers \nwhich have hesitated to implement incompatible living kidney donation \nprograms can feel free to do so.\n  Currently, over 97,000 people are waiting for an organ, including \n72,000 who are waiting for a kidney transplant, over 2,600 of whom are \nin the State of Michigan, as they endure countless hours attached to a \nlife-sustaining dialysis machine hoping that a organ donor will become \navailable before they die. Because of the shortage of available organs, \napproximately 3,800 people die every year while on the waiting list for \na kidney transplant. For them, time is of the essence.\n  Last but certainly not least, the great success we have achieved here \ntoday would not have been possible without the support of my good \nfriend and colleague in the House, Representative John Dingell chair of \nthe House Energy and Commerce Committee and my distinguished and caring \ncolleague in the Senate, Senator Ted Kennedy, chair of the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions. In addition, there are those \nwho energetically led the effort in educating Congress on the need for \npaired donation and they have long been a progressive force in organ \ndonation and transplantation. I thank Dr. Robert M. Merion, professor \nof surgery at the University of Michigan Transplant Center and \nsecretary of the American Society of Transplant Surgeons, ASTS, as well \nas Dr. Goran B. Klintmalm from Baylor University Medical Center and \npresident of the ASTS, for their tireless advocacy for this lifesaving \nlegislation. I would also like to thank Dr. Jeff Crippin, director of \nliver transplants at Washington University in St. Louis, MO, and \npresident of the American Society of Transplantation, AST; Dr. David \nBriscoe, director of transplant research at Children's Hospital in \nBoston, Harvard University; Dr. David Cohen, director of kidney \ntransplant, Columbia University; and Bill Lawrence of United Network of \nOrgan Donor Sharing for his steadfast leadership in the cause of organ \ndonor awareness and organ transplantation.\n\n  Senate passage and enactment of this legislation is a fitting tribute \nthat honors the memory of six members of the University of Michigan \nTransplant Team, who died in a tragic plane crash while on an emergency \nmission to deliver life-saving organs to the University of Michigan \nHospital to save the lives of transplant patients.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues the sentiments expressed by \nMary Sue Coleman, President of the University of Michigan, upon \nlearning of the tragic loss of the six members of the University of \nMichigan Transplant Team. Her remarks, given on June 5, 2007, are as \nfollows:\n\n       Our hearts are broken by the devastating and irreplaceable \n     loss of six members of the Survival Flight transplant team.\n       Every day, the doctors, nurses and flight personnel of \n     Survival Flight do heroic work in saving the lives of others, \n     and that is how we will remember those who perished in \n     Monday's tragedy--as selfless heroes.\n       There is no greater act than that of saving a life, and \n     through our grief, we take comfort in knowing these six men \n     died in the service of a fellow human being.\n       Please hold in your hearts David Ashburn, M.D., a fellow \n     (physician-in-training) in cardiothoracic surgery; Richard \n     Chenault II, a transplant donation specialist with the U-M \n     Transplant Program; Dennis Hoyes, a Marlin air pilot; Rick \n     Lapensee, a transplant donation specialist with the U-M \n     Transplant Program; Bill Serra, a Marlin air pilot; and \n     Martinus (Martin) Spoor, M.D., a cardiac surgeon who had been \n     on the U-M faculty since 2003.\n       Our thoughts and prayers are with their families, friends \n     and colleagues.\n\n  Finally, I would also like to share an excerpt from a letter I \nreceived from Dr. Robert Merion regarding his cherished colleagues and \nfriends who were members of the University of Michigan Transplant Team, \nas follows:\n\n       All of my colleagues who perished in that horrible crash \n     were committed to organ donation. In fact, the U.S. \n     Department of Health and Human Services awarded one of them, \n     Richard Chenault II, its Medal of Honor in 2006 for his \n     successful efforts to increase organ donation at the \n     University of Michigan. All six of these fine men would have \n     been extraordinarily proud to know that their names were \n     being invoked to stimulate final passage of a bill that will \n     provide the gift of life to so many others.\n\n  I commend the Senate on the passage of this much-needed legislation \nand look forward to the President signing it in the days ahead.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about something \nthat is on the minds of a lot of Americans, but also something that \ninitially was addressed by the President and by Secretary Paulson today \nwhen they announced their loan modification program as it relates to \nthe subprime lending crisis that is engulfing many American communities \nand so many families. Despite all the evidence of the size and scope of \nthe subprime crisis, this administration today unveiled what I would \nargue is a tepid plan that would reach only a small number of subprime \nborrowers.\n  I don't think it is too late for the President or Treasury Secretary \nPaulson to come up with a real solution, but this plan is far too \nlittle. It is my opinion that this plan will only affect a few \nborrowers, not enough to meet the need.\n  That is not just my opinion, though, it is the opinion of some \nexperts in the industry. One in particular, Barklays Capital, is \nestimating that this plan announced today will reach only 12 percent of \nall subprime borrowers.\n  Mr. Eric Halperin, the Director of the Center for Responsible \nLending, which institution is a leading expert in this area, was quoted \nin the New York Times as saying:\n\n       I don't see anything that leads me to believe we will see \n     an increase in loan modifications.\n\n  That is just two experts weighing in on something that is critical to \nso many families in America. The fact that the President and Secretary \nPaulson have put a kind of window dressing on these loan modifications \nand the problems that are caused by the subprime crisis doesn't mean \nthat we can feel secure that they are meeting the need that we see \nacross the country. I think the administration has to do more than just \ntalk about this issue and take credit for having some kind of a plan \nbecause we know that more than 2 million subprime loans are about to \nreset at higher rates in the months ahead.\n  This crisis has already slowed economic growth in America and has an \nimpact the world over. It is threatening to push our economy into \nrecession, and still the President and the administration are not \nwilling to truly help homeowners on the brink of foreclosure.\n  The Treasury Secretary has known about these problems for some time, \nas has the administration. I am afraid when Members of Congress weigh \nin on this problem, as so many have--with legislation, with \nsuggestions, with ideas--the administration tends to ignore that advice \nor ignore that plea for help. Just this week I sent a letter to \nSecretary Paulson which was signed by a number of other Senators--\nSenator Schumer, Senator Brown, and also Senator Dodd. We asked the \nSecretary to consider basically five considerations.\n  Let me read what we asked him to examine as he and the President were \npreparing the plan they released today.\n  No. 1, we asked he ensure the eligibility for modification not be too \nnarrow and that people who are affected have every opportunity to \nensure that they remain in their home. No. 2, we asked they make sure \nloan modifications are long enough to ensure the long-term \naffordability of the mortgages and not merely delay a foreclosure. No. \n3, we asked to waive all prepayment penalties. I think that is a \nreasonable request in this kind of crisis. No. 4, we asked the \nSecretary to guarantee the fair treatment of families that are not able \nto avoid foreclosure, even with modifications. No. 5, make sure the \nmodification program must be transparent to allow for independent \nmonitoring. Of these five key points, these five requests, really, it \nis only clear that one has been addressed. One has been addressed by \nfreezing rates for 5 years.\n  A plan that affects only 10 to 12 percent of borrowers, can that kind \nof plan qualify and can most borrowers have confidence in such a plan? \nI don't think so. Unfortunately, Secretary Paulson and the President \nhave come up far too short on their recommendations.\n  So many people here, not just in Washington but across the country, \nknow the effects of this crisis on our country--obviously on families \nand their ability to make ends meet month to month, paying the bills, \nbut also the effect on the economy, really on the world economy. We \nknow, for example, the Joint Economic Committee, of which I am a \nmember--the Presiding Officer is also a member, a proud member from the \nState of Minnesota. She knows when our committee had a chance to review \nthis issue we issued a study, not too long ago, about how much this \nproblem will cost. Just let me give you a couple of numbers which are \nrelevant: 2 million foreclosures. We have heard a lot about that, but \nwe know 2 million will occur by the time the riskiest subprime \nadjustable rate mortgages, the ARMS, will reset over the course of this \nyear and next year. Many thought the crisis was behind us, that we were \nkind of over the hump. A lot of experts believe the worst is yet to \ncome. That is why we needed a real plan by the President, not a half-\nbaked plan.\n  No. 2, the Joint Economic Committee found that approximately $71 \nbillion in housing wealth will be directly destroyed--$71 billion in \nhousing wealth will be directly destroyed. There is another $32 billion \non top of that, $32 billion in housing wealth that will be indirectly \ndestroyed by the spillover effect of foreclosures which reduce the \nvalues throughout a neighborhood.\n  States across the country will lose some $917 million in property tax \nrevenue because of this crisis. The 10 States with the greatest number \nof estimated foreclosures, of course, are some of the larger States: \nCalifornia, Florida, Ohio, New York, Michigan, Texas, Illinois, \nArizona, and my home State of Pennsylvania. I am sure the State of the \nPresiding Officer, Minnesota, is probably close to the top as well. But \nthere are several others close to that ranking.\n  Finally, in terms of the findings of this particular report, on top \nof the losses due to foreclosure, this report also says there will be a \n10-percent decline in housing prices, which would lead to a $2.3 \ntrillion economic loss.\n  We could go on and on about what the problem is, but we know there \nare some solutions on the table. I am one of the cosponsors, along with \nSenators Schumer and Brown, of the Borrowers Protection Act, which \nimposes obligations on some of the players in this market who have not \nbeen regulated, frankly, have not been cracked down on, the so-called \nunregulated brokers and originators. This legislation, the Borrowers \nProtection Act, would do that looking forward, but also in the present \ncontext we have pushed very hard, and the Senate has already passed \nlegislation--of course, the President, like he is about a lot of \nthings, is talking about vetoing this legislation--in which we do have \n$200 million set aside for foreclosure counseling, which a lot of \nfamilies need and a lot of homeowners have a right to expect. There are \nsome short-term and long-term things that we can do but, unfortunately, \nwhat the President and the Secretary did today does not meet that.\n  I want to conclude by quickly moving to another topic for just a few \nmoments before my time is up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14829-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14829-S14830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, to highlight something that was in the \nNew York Times last Friday--it was Friday, November 30--at the bottom \nof page A12, in the midst of all of this discussion we have had in this \ncountry over the National Intelligence Estimate on Iran--and properly \nso that we debate that and discuss that--all of the discussion on \ncrises and challenges in our foreign policies that threaten our \nnational security, the ongoing debate about Iraq, in the midst of all \nof that, we see in the New York Times and other publications a headline \nthat reads as follows:\n\n       In Slovakia, three are held in a uranium smuggling case.\n\n  What is this all about? Well, it is about what a lot of people \nbelieve is maybe the greatest nightmare we face in the country: that a \nsmall group of terrorists can get a hold of fissile material and create \na nuclear weapon, any kind of even unsophisticated nuclear weapon or \ndirty bomb--however you want to describe the various types of weapons \nthat can be developed--and explode it in an American city or explode\n\n[[Page S14830]]\n\nit in a Western city, maybe, across the world.\n  But here is what happened in this case. This is cause for alarm \nbecause of the lack of attention that is being paid to this issue in \nthe press, frankly, and also when the press asks Presidential \ncandidates questions in debates because it has not been a subject of \nmuch debate at all. I am talking about three individuals, two \nHungarians and a Ukrainian, who were arrested last Wednesday after \ntrying to sell highly enriched uranium, according to diplomats in that \npart of the world. Now, it was only half a kilogram, and the poundage \nwas very limited. We know you need a lot more kilograms, a lot more \npounds to have a real threat.\n  But here is the problem. We have an administration that has had a \nseries of recommendations made to it over many years now about ways we \ncan prevent this nightmare from taking place. I gave a speech a couple \nof weeks ago, and a lot of Members of this body have been concerned \nabout this issue for years. But the administration has not shown the \nkind of leadership we need to prevent the nightmare of nuclear \nterrorism.\n  What can we do? Well, there are a couple of things we can do.\n  Very simply, this country could lead an effort, an international \neffort to create a global library of fissile material so we can track \nthis material if an explosion occurred or if a terrorist attack \noccurred. Countries would be accountable if we did that. But this \nadministration has not shown a willingness to show real leadership on \nthis issue.\n  Secondly, we should treat an issue such as this as a crime against \nhumanity. That is another step which should be taken, and this \nadministration should lead that effort. Unfortunately, they have not. \nThey have allowed a real gap in the work to persist so that other \ngroups, international groups, groups here in America, nonproliferation \ngroups across the country have had to take up the ball, so to speak, \nand run with it because this administration does not show the \nleadership.\n  I would ask this administration, I would implore them that even in \nthe last year of an 8-year administration, they take this issue very \nseriously, even if this particular case that was pointed out in the New \nYork Times and other places was by a small group of very \nunsophisticated people across the world. At some point in time, we are \ngoing to be faced with the challenge of a very sophisticated group of \nterrorists. It might be al-Qaida, which is seeking to do this every day \nof the week. That is the nightmare, and we are not prepared for it, we \nare not spending enough time on it. The administration should lead this \neffort. The next administration as well as this Congress has to show \nleadership.\n  That is a gentle but firm reminder from a story just last week. It is \na real threat to our existence, and it is a threat to our national \nsecurity in and of itself.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about a very important \nconstituent of mine, a 6-year-old girl named Abbey Taylor, who was \nseverely hurt this past summer in a pool accident--something that could \nhave been prevented if this body and the House of Representatives had \nacted a few years ago on a pool safety bill. We have an opportunity, \nbefore we go into recess, before the year's end, to do the right thing. \nBut before I talk about that, I would like to make note of the \nPresident's remarks today on the subprime housing crisis that threatens \nour Nation's economy.\n  While I am pleased that after months of trying to wish the problem \naway, the President has finally decided to come forward with a proposal \nfor this problem. Today's announcement is only a small step toward \nhelping homeowners faced with foreclosure. We must do more if we are \ntruly going to address this problem.\n  In the world of subprime lending, the chickens have finally come home \nto roost. Nearly 8.6 percent--or 1 in 12--of subprime mortgages in my \nState, the State of Minnesota, are in foreclosure. Minnesota had the \nfourth highest foreclosure rate in the second quarter of this year. The \nresults of this spike in foreclosures will be devastating for our \nState, as it will be for other States across the country.\n  As the number of foreclosures increase, property values are likely to \ndrop, resulting in decreased tax revenues and increased municipal \nmaintenance costs. Slumping housing values are also likely to result in \ndecreased consumer spending and could jeopardize the overall economy.\n  If we are to contain the economic spillover effect of the subprime \nlending disaster, we must act now.\n  We need additional reforms to protect borrowers, such as ensuring \nthat borrowers actually understand all the terms of their mortgage in a \nsimple, one-page description of their terms, including their ability to \nrepay a loan at both the teaser rate and the adjusted rate. We also \nneed to ensure that homeowners aren't hit with a huge and unexpected \ntax or insurance bill at the end of the year by escrowing that amount.\n  I am a cosponsor of the Borrower's Protection Act that would require \nmortgage lenders and brokers to protect consumers from predatory \nlending practices. Banks should simply not be allowed to offer loans--\nand actually, banks today are regulated in a way that makes sure they \nare not allowed to offer these loans. I want to make sure other \nlenders, nonbank lenders, these predatory lenders are asked to follow \nthe same rules.\n  We need to protect the economy and take comprehensive action now \nbefore it is too late. Millions of families have been waiting for the \nPresident to take a seat at the table, and let's hope as we move \nforward we can enact legislation that truly addresses the needs of \nthese families.\n  But I come here today to discuss, as I said, a constituent of mine, a \nlittle 6-year-old girl named Abbey Taylor, a very brave little girl. I \nhope this story will give people a sense of urgency about moving the \nlegislation that is currently before the Senate. I know we have big \nbills before us--and I come to the floor urging my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to allow these bills to proceed--bills such as \nthe farm bill, which is so important to so many farmers in my State and \nto get these appropriations bills moving. The President has threatened \nto veto, and we have stopped the Transportation bill, despite the move \nof the Democrats to push and push and push the Transportation bill. \nThere are two that have been stopped, and that includes, I will tell my \ncolleagues, $195 million in funding that will help us to complete the \nwork on the I-35W bridge that so tragically fell in the middle of a \nbeautiful day in Minnesota, right in the middle of the river. It should \nnever have happened.\n  Sometimes the bills that we work on here can make a difference in a \nvery small way, in a way that maybe isn't as big and you don't talk \nabout as much on TV, but in a way that can help save lives of girls \nsuch as Abbey Taylor. This legislation has already passed the Commerce \nCommittee unanimously, and it is awaiting our action. This legislation \nwould help prevent serious injury or death to other children. I want to \nconvey the sense of urgency on behalf of Abbey Taylor and her parents \nto each and every one of my colleagues. I want my colleagues to know \nthat families across our country are waiting for us to finally pass \nthis legislation. One of those families waiting is the Taylor family of \nEdina, MN.\n  This summer, their daughter Abbey went swimming at a local pool. She \nwas in a shallow wading pool when she sat over an open drain hole and \nhad most of her intestines torn out by the drain's powerful suction. It \nwas a miraculous gift that she lived. She actually sat up and moved \naway from the suction when so many other children have perished when \nthe same thing has happened. So she somehow managed to stand up and \ntake a few steps before collapsing along the side of the wading pool.\n\n[[Page S14831]]\n\n  She remained hospitalized for weeks after undergoing several \nsurgeries. She will survive, thanks to a miracle, but doctors expect \nshe will need a feeding tube the rest of her life. She is now on a list \nfor transplant.\n  What happened to this little 6-year-old girl on a summer day in \nMinnesota is horrific. My own daughter's name is Abigail, and hearing \nabout this incident brings chills to any parent. When I first saw the \nstory in our local newspaper, I had to stop reading it because the \ndetails of it were so disturbing. This is something that we can \nprevent, and this is something that is every parent's nightmare. You \nlook at this first as a mother: Your daughter is enjoying a beautiful \nsummer day having fun playing at the local pool. This is not just the \ndeep end of the pool. This was the kiddie wading pool. But suddenly \nsomething terrible happens and your life is changed forever. That is \nwhat happened to the Taylors.\n  When it was first reported, like everyone else, I thought it was some \nkind of a freak, one-of-a-kind incident. I never thought I would spend \ntime talking about it on the Senate floor. I didn't think I would have \nto come to the Senate floor twice to talk about it, when, in fact, the \nbill that addresses this passed our committee unanimously and has \nalready passed through the Senate years back. But then I learned this \nwas not the first time this has happened. As it turns out, although \nmost pools are safe and well maintained, this type of incident has \nhappened too many times before, resulting in the death of several dozen \nchildren over the past 15 years.\n  It even has a name. It is called pool entrapment. It occurs when a \nchild becomes stuck on a drain and is unable to escape due to the high \nvelocity and pressure of the water that is being sucked into the drain. \nAnother scenario occurs when hair or jewelry gets sucked into the \ndrain, making it difficult for a child to pull free. According to the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission, the pressure on some pool drains \ncan be as strong as 300 pounds per inch. In fact, several years ago, \nthe Commission produced an educational video on this danger. It showed \na muscle-bound man trying to pull a ball off a swimming pool drain \nusing both arms and all of his might and he couldn't do it. The suction \nforce was too powerful.\n\n  Two years ago, the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a report \nsaying it was aware of at least 27 deaths and many more emergency room \nvisits and hospitalizations due to this entrapment. Most of these \nvictims were children. It is unclear how many actual entrapment \nincidents there have been that have not resulted in death but instead \nsevere injury because entrapment is a little known risk, and it is \npossible that many swimming pool drowning deaths or other injuries have \nnot been classified as entrapment.\n  This legislation must pass. The legislation has several important \nprovisions. It would take the Consumer Product Safety Commission's \nstandards for pool drains, which are now voluntary, and make them \nmandatory. It would prohibit the manufacture, sale or distribution of \ndrain covers that do not meet the standards established by the \nCommission.\n  Most importantly--and this was an enormous improvement over the past \nbill that this body passed years ago--it requires that all public pools \nin this country, including hotels, apartments, local municipal pools, \nand other pools intended for multiple users be equipped with \nantientrapment drain covers. These covers are something like 30 bucks \napiece. This was the amendment I introduced on behalf of children such \nas Abbey, and I am proud it has now been included in the bill.\n  In addition, we have an agreement on another provision that would \nrequire that all of these public pools with single-made drains \nincorporate an additional layer of protection to guard against suction-\nrelated drowning. Again, this is about $130 we are talking here--not \nabout private pools but about huge public pools that are used by \nthousands and thousands and thousands of children.\n  This legislation is called the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa \nSafety Act, named in the memory of 7-year-old Virginia Graeme, who was \na granddaughter of former Secretary of State James Baker. I talked to \nSecretary of State Baker just about a week ago, and we both concur in \nour frustration that while this legislation has huge bipartisan \nsupport, it is being held up by one of our colleagues, someone on the \nother side of the aisle, someone who I think has said he wants to work \nwith us and wants to get this through, but we have been so far \nunsuccessful, despite several efforts. I talked to James Baker. But \njust as importantly, every other week I talk to the Taylors, and they \nalways ask me if we have gotten this legislation passed yet.\n  Now, what do you say when you talk, as I do, to the father of this \nlittle girl, Abbey Taylor, who continues to struggle in the months that \nhave passed since losing her intestines? Do you tell them that, well, \nwe passed it unanimously through the committee, but now it is stuck, \nthat one person is able to hold up a bill that 99 other people support? \nThese parents are so courageous that they have moved on from that, and \nthey even want her severe injury discussed today. They wanted me to \ndiscuss this. They want the world to know what happened to her because \nthey don't want it to happen to another little girl again. They are not \nafraid to have us talk about what happened to their little daughter \nbecause they want it to never happen to another child again.\n  There is a saying that when an accident happens that could reasonably \nhave been prevented, then it is not really accurate to call it an \naccident. It is actually a failure. In the case of injuries and deaths \ncaused by pool entrapment, it is not a failure by children or their \nparents. They have a reasonable expectation to think their child can go \ninto a public wading pool and not lose their intestines. It is really a \nfailure of our country, of our product safety laws, and we all have to \ntake responsibility for it, just as we have to take responsibility for \nthese toxic toys that shouldn't be on our shores and in our stores, \nwhich is something else that we need to get done before we go home for \nthe holidays. It is a failure, whether it is about the toys or whether \nit is about these pool drains. It is a failure that is within our power \nto correct, a problem that can be faced through reasonable measures and \nfixed by legislation.\n  I think the fact that Senator Stevens supports this bill and has \nworked with us on it and the fact that we have Republican support for \nthis bill shows this isn't some whacky legislation. We worked with \npeople on both sides. We worked with the manufacturers. We worked with \nthe consumer groups. We came up with a reasonable bill.\n  So I ask my colleagues: What am I supposed to tell this dad when I \ntalk to him tonight? Am I supposed to tell him that some rules in the \nSenate say that one person can hold up a bill against the will of the \nentire body? I don't want to tell him that. I want to tell him we were \nable to work this out and get this bill through and to make sure no \nother parents are sitting in a waiting room in a hospital for weeks \nwhile they are trying to find out if their daughter is going to live or \nif there is going to be a transplant for their daughter. I want to tell \nthem this isn't going to happen again.\n  On behalf of Abbey Taylor and the Taylor family and for the health \nand safety of all of our children, I urge the Senate to take quick \naction to pass these simple consumer measures that are before us; to \npass the measure about the toys, to pass the measure about the pool \ndrains. We are dealing with huge issues in this body: the war in Iraq, \nforeign intelligence, we are talking about the farm bill, and we want \nthem to pass. But these consumer bills can actually have an impact \nimmediately in a little child's life. So let's go back and get this \ndone.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I note the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today with great \nconcern and frustration, as I know my colleagues in the majority feel, \nabout the\n\n[[Page S14832]]\n\nfact that as we continue to work hard to make the changes our American \nfamilies wanted to happen to improve their lives, we are stopped over \nand over and over again.\n  I have a running chart, as my colleagues know. As of this afternoon, \nwe are now up to 57 Republican filibusters. Tomorrow, we will be voting \non cloture again, and it will then be 58 and then 59.\n  So we find ourselves in a situation that is, first of all, historic \nin that the top number of filibusters ever recorded in the Senate for a \n2-year session is 61; 61 times there were filibusters within a 2-year \nperiod. Now, in less than a year--and we are not even done--we will \nprobably hit 61 before we leave. But we are at 57 times that the \nRepublicans have filibustered to stop us from making progress, from \nsolving problems, from getting things done that the American people, \nAmerican families are desperate to have done.\n  We look at the fact that we have tried to change the children's \nhealth care policy to cover 10 million children in this country--in \nthat case, we have bipartisan support, and that is the way we ought to \noperate. The children's health care plan is an example of the way we \nought to work together. I commend my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. In that case, we have the President doing the blocking. So when \nwe talk about children's health insurance, our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle got a lot of pressure for working with us and doing \nthe right thing, to add 10 million more children to be able to receive \nhealth insurance. Working families who are working one, two, and three \njobs don't have health insurance. But we have worked together. Even \nthough we could override the Presidential veto here, they could not get \nenough Republican votes in the House. We want to get children's health \ninsurance done.\n  We have been working very hard and have a majority of Members to \nchange the policy in Iraq, to get our brave men and women out of the \nmiddle of a civil war, and to be able to change the policy to one that \nwill directly affect the threats facing Americans, to address what we \nought to be doing in the world to keep us safe, change that policy, \nredeploy, bring our people home and out of harm's way, out of a civil \nwar. We have a majority of Members who voted with us to do that. But we \ncould not get that policy done--we have not yet, but we are going to \nkeep trying; we are not stopping.\n  But filibusters over and over again have blocked us from making the \nchange we need in Iraq--troop rotations, protecting our troops, and \nbeing able to make sure that if they are deployed for 12 months, they \ncan have 12 months at home and be able to rest and see their families \nand have retraining. Senator Webb brought forward an amendment that \nsays to our troops: We understand what is happening, and if we are \nsending you on one deployment and two and three redeployments, we ought \nto be following the current military policy of having the same number \nof days at home as we have you in harm's way in the theater.\n  We have a majority of the votes. We have a substantial majority of \nvotes--56 votes or 57 votes--to change the policy to support our \ntroops. Yet we have filibuster after filibuster after filibuster, \ntaking 60 votes to stop. We have not had enough Republican colleagues \njoin with us to stop those filibusters. Tomorrow, we are going to vote \non whether to end a filibuster.\n  I am amazed, as a member of the Agriculture Committee--and proudly a \nmember. When everybody thinks of Michigan, they think of automobiles, \nand we are proud of that, too, but our No. 2 industry is agriculture. I \nam very proud to have worked with colleagues in a bipartisan way to \nhave a bill developed that is terrific for Michigan. It provides not \nonly support for traditional commodities and agriculture, but it moves \nus to alternative energy. We want to be saying in Michigan: Buy your \nfuel from Middle America, not the Middle East.\n  The Agriculture Committee put forward a farm bill that moves us in \nthat direction. It addresses nutrition and more opportunities for \nchildren in schools to have fresh fruits and vegetables, conservation--\nthere are provisions in there that affect the Great Lakes which I am \nproud to have included. We have fruits and vegetables, for the first \ntime, recognized as half of the crops we grow as a permanent part of \nthe farm bill. You would think people would be raring to go to pass \nthis new policy that improves or provides reforms and moves us in a \ndirection to reflect a better future for rural America and fuel \nsecurity.\n  This is our third week at least that we have seen filibustering of \nthe farm bill. Tomorrow, we will have a vote on whether that filibuster \nwill end. We will see what happens and whether we will go from 57 \nfilibusters to 58 and then 59 on the Energy bill. The reality is that \nwe have important work to do to support rural communities in Michigan \nand across the country, to address energy needs, alternative fuels, \nbiofuels, to address nutrition for our children and families, to \nsupport traditional agriculture that is working very hard and providing \nus with the food we need, the food security we need for this country. \nThis farm bill does that.\n  I applaud our chairman, Senator Harkin, for his efforts, and all \nthose involved, including Senators Conrad and Chambliss and all who \nhave worked together on a bipartisan basis. Even though we have a \nbipartisan basis, unanimous support in the committee, we come to the \nfloor one more time.\n  The big strategy on the Republican side is to just stop change, stop, \nstop, stop, block anything from happening. What we are seeing--I am \nassuming it is pretty clear what the strategy is--is the White House \nworking with the leadership on the other side of the aisle to make sure \nwe cannot get things done for the American people, stopping us from \nmoving forward. It is also clear that, hopefully, after next year's \nelection, we will have a few more folks on this side of the aisle so we \ncan move forward on those things we have had trouble moving forward on \nright now. They are certainly making the case for more change and more \nadditions to the majority in this process.\n  We have also seen another critical area that we are all reading about \nand hearing about from constituents--certainly, I talk to people every \nsingle weekend when I go home, as well as during the week here--and \nthat is the question of the mortgage crisis, what is happening in the \nhousing industry, not just the subprime but in the prime housing \nmarket, and what is happening across the country. We see the White \nHouse is finally engaged, and we are glad to see that. We hear that we \nneed to take action, and we have a tax issue I sponsored to make sure \nfolks not only don't lose their home but don't get a tax bill on top of \nit. But we hear from Secretary Paulson and others that the FHA is \nimportant--FHA modernization, passed by the House--an important part of \ngetting more capital in the marketplace.\n  We have too many families now who have lost or will lose their homes. \nFor most families, middle-income families who buy a house try to get it \nin a spot where they can have good schools. For most families, the \nequity in their homes is their primary savings.\n  We hear that FHA modernization is important to do. Our leader, \nMajority Leader Reid, came to the floor a couple of weeks ago and asked \nunanimous consent to go to that FHA modernization bill which the \nadministration says they support and they are urging us to pass. It has \npassed in the House. Yet when our leader comes to the floor, \nrecognizing as he does that he represents a\n\n[[Page S14833]]\n\nState heavily hit as well on the question of foreclosures, and asks \nunanimous consent and one more time, the leader on the Republican side \nobjects.\n  All we see are efforts to stop changes that are critically important \nfor the families of America, the economy of America, the businesses of \nAmerica to make sure we can keep the middle class of this country and \nkeep the middle-class American dream alive. That is what we are all \nabout.\n  I thought it was stunning yesterday when, again, the Republican \nleader came to the floor saying nothing is getting done, nothing is \ngetting done. Then Senator Murray, who chairs so ably our \nTransportation and Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, asked unanimous \nconsent to take up this critical bill that relates to infrastructure. \nWe have bridges in Minnesota and other places around the country--we \ncertainly have all seen the pictures from Minnesota, what happened in \nMinneapolis with the bridge collapse. Certainly that would be a \npriority. I know it certainly has been a priority for Senator \nKlobuchar, who has spoken eloquently and has made sure there are \nresources and help for her State. One would think that after a long \nspeech about how nothing was happening in the Senate that our \nRepublican colleagues would welcome Senator Murray coming to the floor \nto move forward on this important bill, written in a bipartisan way, \npassed by the Senate to bring forward the conference committee report \non housing and transportation, a bill that includes dollars, again, \nthat the administration says they want and support--$200 million for \neducation and for consumer outreach to help those who are in bad loan \nsituations, who face resets or foreclosures next year, to have the \nopportunity to sit down and work out a different mortgage situation to \nrefinance.\n  I applaud Secretary Paulson for setting up a 1-800 number and wanting \nto reach out to help those families. We have $200 million in our budget \nwhich the administration says they support. Yet when Senator Murray \ncomes to the floor as chair of that effort, again what do we hear? ``I \nobject, Mr. President.'' ``I object, Mr. President.''\n  One more time, we are in the middle of a mortgage crisis, affecting \nnot only our families, not only middle-class Americans all over the \ncountry, but it is now rippling out to the entire economy. Yet when our \nleader comes to the floor, when our leader asks to move forward on \nthose issues that we can do together now, we get: ``I object, Mr. \nPresident.'' We get another filibuster.\n  I don't know who is advising the White House and the Republican \nleadership on this strategy, but sooner or later this is going to catch \nup with them when they are objecting to the changes that are needed to \nimprove the lives of middle-class Americans, whether it be help in a \nmortgage crisis, whether it be children's health insurance, whether it \nbe helping rural America in addressing our alternative energy needs, a \nfarm bill, whether it be supporting our troops, changing the policy in \nIraq--I could go on and on.\n  I should mention we are finding the same thing as it relates to \ntrying to get a budget for this coming year to stop a cut in physician \npayments through Medicare which we have to get done.\n  Our chairman of the Finance Committee is leading this effort and is \nstrongly committed to fixing this policy that would provide cuts and \nwanting to advocate we not do it just for next year but 2 years, as \nwell as a number of other things we need to do with Medicare. We are \nstruggling right now to make that happen.\n  On the appropriations front--and this is stunning to me--we see a \nsituation where on the one hand, the administration is willing to spend \n$12 billion a month and counting in Iraq, not paid for, going right on \nto the deficit. I have a beautiful new granddaughter, my first \ngrandchild, and she is going to help pay for that deficit. All the kids \nbeing born today will help pay for that huge deficit that has been \ncreated. And that is OK, according to the administration, that is OK. \nThey want more money and they do not pay for it, do not budget for it--\nmore money. But when we put forward a modest 2-percent increase in \ninvestments for America, to restore some of the cuts that the President \nhas made in community policing or in health research, education \nfunding, in those items that invest in American families, American \ncommunities, just a 2-percent increase, the President says: No, too \nmuch. He is willing to take us to the brink of a Government shutdown, \nbut a 2-percent increase for America? Too much. Mr. President, $12 \nbillion a month in Iraq, not paid for--paid for by our kids and \ngrandkids that is OK.\n  We find ourselves once again with filibuster, filibuster, filibuster \non the Republican side, stopping us. Now we are back saying: OK, in \norder to get appropriations done for this year, we will split the \ndifference. Instead of a 2-percent investment increase for American \ncommunities and families, we will say 1 percent, which is less than we \nspend in Iraq, $11 billion less than we spend in 1 month in Iraq, and \nwe hear that is also not supported.\n  It is time we focus on what needs to be done to make sure those \nworking hard every day, who care about their families, who want to make \nsure they have a job, have health care, and have the great American \ndream, send the kids to college, have the support they need. That is \nwhat we are about. That is what we are about--fighting for those folks \nwho work hard every day who care about their kids. They want to see a \nchange from what has been happening, and that is what we are fighting \nfor.\n  I close indicating there is good news. I see my wonderful colleague \nfrom Rhode Island, who has been a champion for us as it relates to \nchanging the policy in Iraq and supporting our troops. This must be a \n``Rhode Island moment'' because we have the distinguished junior \nSenator from Rhode Island presiding, of whom we are so proud. I see his \nsenior colleague here as well.\n  In conclusion, I paint a very bleak picture, a very frustrating \npicture, and we feel it every day. Nobody feels it more than our \nleader, who is laser focused on getting through all of this obstruction \nto get things done for the American people.\n  But the good news is, in spite of 57 filibusters, we have gotten \nthings done, and we will continue to get things done. It may take twice \nas long. It may take 100 filibusters, it may take 150 filibusters, but \nwe are not going to stop because what is at stake is our American way \nof life. What is at stake is the ability for families to enjoy the \nAmerican dream.\n\n  We have raised the minimum wage for the first time in a decade for \nour families. We have made college more affordable by passing the \nlargest student financial aid package since the GI bill. My dad went to \nschool after World War II on the GI bill, and I know he would not have \nbeen able to go to school without it.\n  I am proud that on our watch in this new majority we have put in \nplace changes that will allow more young people to have that American \ndream, to be able to go to college, and to be able to come out of \ncollege without the kind of debt that weighs one down for years and \nyears. We want to help them with that.\n  We passed finally on our watch--and this happened quickly; it has not \nhappened since 2001, but on our watch, we passed the 9/11 \nrecommendations, to focus on the real threats, to keep us safe. I am \nproud of the fact that a provision I have been very involved in, making \nsure radios work, radio interoperability, has been included so we can \nsupport our police and firefighters, so they can talk to each other, so \nwe do not have again a situation where brave first responders are \nrunning into buildings, running into towers they should have been \nrunning out of. We got that done.\n  We passed a very important water resources bill that has been \nlanguishing here for years. Coming from a Great Lakes State, this is \nimportant to us. I commend Senator Boxer and all of those who worked, \nagain, on a wonderful bipartisan basis--she and Senator Inhofe--in \nputting that bill together.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, sometimes we do business that is not \nlegislative, it is oversight. We have done a lot of oversight on Iraq \npolicy, on no-bid contracts, on Blackwater, and private contracting, in \nmany areas where there had been no oversight for years. Our people have \naggressively, as chairs of the committees, been doing oversight.\n  One area that has resulted in change that was needed were the \nhearings with\n\n[[Page S14834]]\n\nthe former Attorney General that focused on the fact that our U.S. \nattorneys did not have the independence they needed. They were being \nused politically. The change occurred when the Attorney General was \nforced to step down. We have made a major step forward in preserving \nthe independence of the U.S. attorneys.\n  There are numerous other issues I could mention, and I will not. \nSuffice to say, we are getting business done. We are getting results \nfor middle-class Americans every day. Evidently, all of our hard-\nworking results have raised a red flag down at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue. They said: Whoa, whoa, whoa, you are making too \nmany good things happen, too many changes happen that families are \ngoing to like, that American people are going to like. We better slow \nthis thing down.\n  So now we are in a situation where even those efforts we have worked \non in good faith on a bipartisan basis--that is what we do here. We \ncannot get anything done if we don't work together, people of good \nfaith working together. Even those issues have been slowed down and \nstopped because it is felt now that the best thing to do is to make \nsure the Democrats cannot make any more positive changes happen so it \nis clear the differences in values and priorities among this \nadministration and their supporters and the new majority.\n  Fifty-seven filibusters and counting. The American people expect us \nto stop this situation. This needs to stop. Enough is enough. There is \na lot of work to be done, serious work. The American people expect us \nto do it, and we are committed to getting it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14834-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14834-S14835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MORTGAGE LENDING CRISIS\n\n  Mr. REED. First, I thank the Senator from Michigan for her kind words \nand also for her tremendous leadership as the leader of our Democratic \ncaucus on so many issues, and a great representative of her State of \nMichigan. I thank the Senator.\n  Today, Mr. President, the Bush administration announced a proposal to \nhelp stem the burgeoning crisis in foreclosures across this country. It \nis a welcome step, but it is a very timid step. It is one that is long \noverdue, in my estimation. This crisis has been evolving over many \nmonths, and the White House and the Treasury have taken a very long \ntime to get to this moment and to propose this plan. And it is cautious \nplan, and only a partial approach to a very complicated and very \ndangerous problem.\n  The problem is dangerous in the sense that millions of American \nhomeowners are facing the peril of losing their homes to foreclosure \nbecause of the exotic mortgages that were sold to them with low \nintroductory rates and now are being triggered to reset to relatively \nhigh rates, forcing many people to make the choice between giving up \ntheir home or giving up everything else to pay for their mortgage. That \nis the human aspect. And we are seeing it in our home State of Rhode \nIsland, Mr. President, a record number of foreclosures, page after page \nin the newspaper of homes that are going to be foreclosed upon.\n  This has an effect not only on the individual family but on the \ncommunity as a whole because as homes are foreclosed in a neighborhood, \nthey lower the value of the other homes. It has a ripple effect.\n  I was meeting just a few weeks ago with the mayor of Central Falls, \nRI, who pointed out the increased number of foreclosed homes in his \ncommunity, and also the mayor of Pawtucket, who has seen a significant \nincrease in foreclosures. This goes right to the fabric of a community. \nSo on the individual family level, on a community level, and now on a \nnationwide, indeed, global level, this liquidity crisis, this crisis in \ncredit, is threatening the ability of our economy to function \nefficiently, to provide resources, credit, and loans not just to \nhomeowners, but to industry and business as well.\n  So the White House acted today, and I applaud their action, but it is \ntimid. The proposed plan will only address a very small fraction of the \nforeclosure problem, and the Administration has yet to talk about and \ndeal with the larger issues of economic growth and continuing an \nadequate supply of credit in our economy.\n  According to Treasury officials, and an analysis that has been done \nby financial institutions, this initiative will help about 200,000 \npeople. But the reality is there are millions of Americans who are \nfacing the danger of foreclosure. This 200,000 is just a small \nfraction. It is better than zero, which was the President and the \nadministration's position just a couple of months ago as they worked on \nthis, but it is not adequate to the daunting challenge of the \nforeclosure crisis which is facing America today.\n  Indeed, the plan itself relies on a very complicated and, indeed, \nconvoluted process. There are two classes of inquiry. First, they have \nto determine if the borrower is eligible for this relief, and then they \nhave to go through another analysis to determine what type of relief \nthe borrower would be eligible for. In addition, it appears the \nborrower is in the position of having to contact their lender or \nservicer if they would like to figure out if they are eligible for a \nloan modification. This is not the responsibility of the lender or \nservicer. In other words, this is not a systematic approach to relief. \nThis is rather a case by case approach, involving very elaborate \nprocedures which I don't think will in effect reach all the eligible \nhomeowners who are in danger of losing their homes. I think this \napproach is backwards. It should be the obligation of the lenders and \nservicers to reach out to the borrowers who are in danger of default, \nto help walk them through the process. And it should be a much more \nefficient process.\n  Today the President offered an 800 number to borrowers, but there are \na profusion of 800 numbers, all the way from buying a salad maker to \nbuying an exercise machine. I don't think an 800 number is going to be \nable to engage people who are fearful about losing their homes and \nactually get them involved in this process and keep them involved. So I \nthink this is a shortcoming in the approach, which is already a limited \napproach.\n  Finally, this plan has not been ratified and accepted \nenthusiastically by all of the important investors and the other \nindustry players. The final plan was characterized as an agreement with \nthe HOPE NOW industry coalition. This coalition consists mainly of \ntrade groups and has no real ability to implement the plan. They are \nnot the spokesperson for all of the people who will actually have to do \nthe work, and the list of members seems to be a partial list at best.\n  So for many reasons this plan is really just a set of guidelines \nregarding how the Administration would like to see part of this problem \nworked out but does not have the action-forcing devices and the \nincentives for the servicers, the lenders, and all of the people who \nreally can make this work to go out and put it into effect.\n  We need to do much more, and there are several things we should do. \nWe need to do much more because this is a burgeoning crisis. I can \nrecall last April convening a committee meeting, as I chair the \nSubcommittee on Securities, Insurance and Investment, and we had \nwitnesses from some of the major investment banks in New York City and \nthe rating agencies. We had individuals who were facing the problem of \nforeclosure, and at that point industry was describing this as a rather \nnarrow, self-contained crisis pertaining only to subprime mortgages. \nThey talked in terms of this being about a $19 billion problem, which \nin a worldwide economy is not a staggering amount of money. It is to \nyou and I, but not in a worldwide economy. And they also essentially \nsaid, well, this is over. The market has already corrected itself.\n\n  It is not over. It is now spilling over into other forms of \nsecurities. It is now eroding, as I suggested initially, because of \npsychological factors as well as financial factors, confidence in the \noverall banking system and the economy's ability to function.\n  In the newly released Mortgage Bankers Association National \nDelinquency Survey, the rate of loans entering the foreclosure process \nwas approximately .78 percent. That is up 32 basis points from 1 year \nago. This is a problem that is growing. This is not at all a self-\ncontained problem. This is a growing problem. This is the highest\n\n[[Page S14835]]\n\nrate of loans entering foreclosure ever recorded in this survey--ever \nrecorded, going back many years. So this is not only an increasing \nproblem, it is a significant problem in our economy and in the lives of \nAmericans everywhere. The percentage of loans actually in the \nforeclosure process also increased to 1.69 percent, which is also the \nhighest level ever recorded.\n  In Rhode Island, we have the dubious distinction, Mr. President, of \nthe highest foreclosure rates in New England. The percent of loans that \nwere seriously delinquent or in the process of foreclosure in the third \nquarter of this year was 3.23 percent, and the percent of subprime \nloans in this category was 14.97 percent. So for our own home State, we \nare seeing an explosion of these foreclosures.\n  We are also seeing, simultaneously, the largest price declines in the \nhousing sector since the Great Depression. Not only are people losing \ntheir homes, but those who are still paying their monthly mortgages are \nseeing the value of their homes diminish significantly. For so many \npeople, that was their whole source of wealth. In fact, I would suggest \nthat it was one of the major reasons that consumption and consumer \nactivity were so robust over the last several years. As energy prices \nwent up, as other factors intervened, what kept consumers in the game \nwas this notion they were wealthy because their house was appreciating \nevery year. That has changed, and that will have an effect.\n  At least one housing expert I talked to thinks this housing downturn \nis going to be one of the longest we have experienced in the last 50 \nyears. Instead of lasting an average of 24 months, he expects it to \nlast up to 48 months, which would take us to at least 2 years from now.\n  What we know now is that the banks and the rating agencies \nunderestimated the underlying risk in many of the financial products \noffered to home buyers, and their actions have resulted in serious \nconsequences to the availability of credit and to the capital markets \nin both our economy and the worldwide economy. What started out as a \nproblem centered on subprime loans has spread to other parts of the \nmarket and the economy. And there need to be serious policy \nrecommendations to address these problems as well.\n  Now, what we have to do is a series of steps, none of which is the \nmagic solution, but they are all collectively important. We cannot stop \ntoday with the announcement by the administration. Secretary Paulson \nhimself has urged Congress to pass the FHA Modernization Act. The \nadministration should take the next logical step and not simply be \ncheering from the sidelines, but get in the fight and encourage those \nin this body who are holding up that FHA bill to let it go. Words are \nimportant, but deeds are more telling. So if the Secretary is truly \ninterested in getting that bill moving, he needs to come up here and be \ntalking to the members of the Republican caucus who are holding up this \nbill.\n  We also need the administration's leadership in passing bankruptcy \nreform. Senator Durbin has an excellent bill that will allow borrowers \nand lenders to renegotiate the terms of their mortgages so that people \ncan stay in their homes as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.\n  We need Tax Code changes so that borrowers would not pay Federal \ntaxes on the debt discharged by lenders on their home mortgages the so-\ncalled short sale. There are some people who recognize they can't keep \ntheir home. They can sell the home at a loss, and with an agreement \nfrom the lender at a price less than the value of their mortgage. The \nlender takes this discharge as a loss, and the IRS, under current tax \nlaw, determines that this is income for the borrower and taxes it. We \nneed to change that.\n  In fact, Senator Stabenow has a bill to do just that, and it was part \nof the proposal that Senator Baucus offered earlier today in \nconjunction with AMT.\n  Finally, I think we have to have a substantial increase in the \navailability of housing counseling, and this is included in the bill I \nintroduced, called the HOPE Act. An increase in housing counseling \nfunds is also in the appropriations for Transportation, Housing, and \nother agencies bill which has received a veto threat from the \nPresident.\n  In the HOPE Act, I also have suggested that we include mandatory loss \nmitigation requirements; that a lender has the obligation to work with \na borrower to see if there is a way to avoid foreclosure if it is \neconomically feasible to do so.\n  We need to work together--the Congress, the administration, the \nregulators, and the industry--toward the goal of keeping American \nfamilies in their homes, and we also have to recognize that if we don't \nact coherently, comprehensively, and in a timely fashion, what \npresented as a small subprime loan crisis and has burgeoned into a \nnational foreclosure crisis could undermine economic progress in this \ncountry and maybe across the globe.\n  Time is wasting. We have to move forward. I urge my colleagues to do \nso.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am gratified that at long last the \nSenate is acting to keep the alternative minimum tax from hitting 19 \nmillion more American taxpayers.\n  We tried to save those 19 million families from AMT on November 15, \nwhen the majority leader asked the Senate to do so. We tried to save \nthose 19 million families from the AMT on repeated occasions this week. \nMost recently, today we tried to save those 19 million families from \nthe AMT by moving to the House-passed bill. When the other side blocked \nus, we tried to save those 19 million families from the AMT by asking \nconsent to pass the legislation that we have before us now. But at \nevery step, the Republican caucus objected.\n  I am gratified that at long last the Republican caucus has agreed to \nlet us act. Perhaps the third time is the charm--or the fourth or the \nfifth. In any event, here we are.\n  I will support this effort to save those 19 million families from the \nAMT. The bill before us is plainly not my first choice of how to do so, \nbut this is our best choice to do so. Let me once again remind people \nwhy we need to act. That is, we need to act because if we do not, \nnearly 12 million families with incomes between $100,000 and $200,000 \nwill pay the AMT next year. We need to act because if we don't, 5 \nmillion families with incomes between $75,000 and $100,000 will pay the \nAMT next year. We need to act because if we don't, remarkably, nearly \n2\\1/2\\ million families with incomes of less than $75,000 will have to \npay the AMT next year. We need to stop that from happening. We need to \nkeep the AMT from hitting any more families than it already does.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I will yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  I am obviously very pleased that the Senate has finally come to the \npoint of voting on something in 2007 to take care of the alternative \nminimum tax problem. I would rather have gone through this process \nseveral months ago but better late than never.\n  Over the course of this year, I have given 12 Senate floor speeches \nanalyzing the alternative minimum tax and describing the problem it \nposes for middle-class taxpayers, and I have done that in great detail. \nAs I said so many times--before, hoping, and now I am glad to say the \nSenate Democratic leadership seems to realize--the AMT should not be \noffset.\n  I also wish to thank my good friend, Chairman Baucus, for all of his \nhard work this year and for several years to protect middle-income \ntaxpayers from the AMT. Chairman Baucus did our country a great service \nby pushing for this compromise that can garner, we hope, the support of \nDemocrats and Republicans. Although we did not mark up in committee, \nChairman Baucus rolled up his sleeves and got to work to find a middle \nground. That middle ground is before us. He has consistently avoided \nbitter partisanship and always worked to do the right thing.\n  Tonight, I ask my friends in the House Democratic leadership, \nassuming we get the votes to pass this product before us, to follow the \nexample of Chairman Baucus and the Senate Democratic leadership and \nfinish this job to give the assurance that is necessary to these 23 \nmillion taxpayers that they are not going to be hit by a tax they were \nnever expected to pay in the first place.\n  Everyone has thus far made partisan points. That episode must cease. \nThose obsessed with their tax-increase-biased version of pay-go must \nturn now to the people's business. Those who want to raise more taxes \nto pay for a tax that was never meant to raise revenue from the middle \nclass have made their points. The record is clear. My friends in the \nHouse Democratic leadership need to cease punishing the 23 million \nmiddle-income taxpayers with a pay-go obsession.\n  I say to my friends in the House Democratic leadership, we can talk \nuntil we are blue in the face. The bottom line is we need to change the \ntax laws with respect to AMT. That law change needs congressional \naction and Presidential signature. Anything else is just plain talk.\n  Last night, I suggested a path to get all parties to an agreement on \nchanging the law on the AMT patch. By ``all parties,'' I am referring \nto House Democrats, House Republicans, Senate Democrats, Senate \nRepublicans, and I have to include the President because without an \nagreement we will not get a law, and a law has to be signed. Without a \nlaw change, 23 million families face an unexpected tax increase that we \nthink will be about $2,000 per family. Without a rapid law change, we \nmake things even worse during filing season. We are going to have a \nfiasco of another 27 million families and individual taxpayers hurt, \nwaiting for a refund.\n  I reiterate my suggestion tonight. It is in a letter from Chairman \nRangel, Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member McCrery, and myself. That \nletter, dated October 31 this year, contains the tests that ought to be \napplied to any proposal in substance or process on the AMT patch \nlegislation. Here is one sentence, ``We''--the four of us:\n\n     We plan to do everything possible to enact AMT relief \n     legislation in a form mutually agreeable to the Congress and \n     the President before the end of the year.\n\n  Chairman Baucus and the Senate Democratic leadership are trying to \nmeet this test with this agreement which is before us now. Now the \nDemocratic leadership in the House needs to follow through. We Senators \nhopefully will pass this package that is agreeable to the President and \nthe House. What do we all agree on? We agree the patch needs to get \ndone, so that is the base of what will pass the Senate, we hope. If \nHouse Democrats continue to insist on offsets for a patch--we hope that \ndoesn't happen.\n  The President and congressional Republicans disagree with the \nDemocrats on the need for offsets. Offsets for the patch are not \nmutually agreeable, as the letter we sent implies. They fail the tax \nwriter's test. On extenders, the House wants 1 year, the Senate wants 2 \nyears. President Bush had 1 year in his budget. Maybe 2 years might be \nmutually agreeable. On this point, offsets are not mutually agreeable. \nBut it looks as if we will defer on next year's extenders.\n  On this year's AMT patch, we need to make law. To make law, the \nproposals must be mutually agreeable. The only proposal that is \nmutually agreeable is an unoffset AMT patch. Let's get to the law \nchange and end the AMT patch dilemma.\n  I urge the House Democratic leadership to pass the AMT patch bill and \nsend it to the President. It is in a form the President will sign. We \nmust change the law now. We owe it to the 23 million families who could \nbe hit by the AMT. We owe it to the additional 27 million families and \nindividuals who face delayed refunds.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my good friend for \nhis warm compliments. I deeply appreciate it. He is a gentleman. He is \na good man. I thank him very much for that.\n  I see Senator Sherrod Brown would like to speak. We are getting close \nto 6:15. I wonder if Senators might agree to extend the time allowable \nfor debate until we finally vote, say, 10 more minutes equally divided \non both sides, if that is agreeable to the Senator from Iowa?\n  I ask unanimous consent and make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from Ohio \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. BROWN pertaining to the introduction of S. 2431 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is with great reluctance that I \nplan to oppose the AMT bill before us. While I strongly support \nproviding AMT relief to middle-class taxpayers, I simply cannot support \nan AMT patch that is not paid for. Let's be clear on what we are doing \nhere today: we are voting on a bill that will require us to increase \nour deficit by $50 billion. Our children and grandchildren will have to \npay\n\n[[Page S14837]]\n\nback the funds we are borrowing today, with interest.\n  There are many ways we could have been responsible and paid for this \nmeasure, but the President of the United States and the Republican \nCongress have refused to consider them. One option in a bill that I \nintroduced would have paid for this AMT relief by increasing the taxes \non investment profits for millionaires, many of whom enjoy an unjust \ntax benefit that allows them to pay a lower tax rate than struggling \nmiddle-class families. Under my proposal, a small number of taxpayers \nwith incomes over $1 million per year could have funded a patch to \nbenefit approximately 20 million Americans.\n  The President of the United States and the Republicans in Congress \nbelieve that borrowing money from foreign nations, for our children to \nrepay, is the best way to finance our government. I do not, and \ntherefore I must oppose this measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't see anybody who wishes to speak \nnow, but we do have to wait a few minutes before we call the vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time being equally \ndivided between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes of debate left.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Ten minutes of debate left, 5 on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If Senators are not here to use it, they can yield it \nback so we can vote, can't they?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We have to wait a few minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Oh, sorry. I was in the same position. I wanted to go, \nthey have to come. We have to yield to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from \nIowa and the Senator from Montana for bringing the bill to the floor. \nEarlier in the day, we had a discussion about the underlying bill, \nwhich is the bill that came over from the House, and the reservations I \nhad about this, specifically the fact that it raises taxes.\n  It raises them in an inappropriate way, in a way, in my opinion, \nwhich would chill economic expansion in this country, would undermine \nour ability to create capital in this country and, as a result, would \nundermine the ability of entrepreneurs to go out and create jobs.\n  It would have the effect of exporting jobs offshore, as a practical \nmatter in the financial markets and, unfortunately, would probably have \nan equally detrimental effect of encouraging places such as London to \nbecome even more aggressive as they compete for our capital formation \nactivity, which has always historically occurred in New York City, \nwhich plays a large role in the energy of our Nation's economy.\n  So the underlying bill has serious problems as it came over from the \nHouse. It also had a specific earmark to basically benefit essentially \n290 people who are using the Virgin Islands as a tax shelter. It had \nanother specific earmark to benefit State legislators who would get a \nper diem for not even showing up at their State legislature. It was a \nvery poor bill.\n  The proposal as brought forward from the Senator from Montana is an \nexcellent approach: Let's take care of the AMT for next year. Let's \nmove on. Let's do this quickly so the people who are being subject to \nthis or may be brought into this improperly, who were never supposed to \nbe brought into this, can be relieved of that burden.\n  Of course, there is the issue of whether there should be an offset. \nWell, of course, there should not be an offset. Looking at it from a \nbudgeteer's standpoint, in my opinion, these are all phantom funds. We \nbasically know the alternative minimum tax is not going to generate \nthese revenues that we score as coming in because we know the AMT was \nnever intended to tax 26 million Americans or 20 million Americans. We \nknow that.\n  But because of the rules, the arcane rules we have around here for \nbudgeting, we basically have to include those revenues in this \nbaseline, even though we know we are never going to tax people at those \nlevels because it would be totally unfair and inappropriate. So I \ncongratulate the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Iowa for \ncoming forward with this approach to resolve this matter. I look \nforward to voting for the proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. I thank him for his leadership and the leadership of the \nSenator from Iowa in attempting to address the problem we confront.\n  I rise today as chairman of the Budget Committee in direct \ncontradiction of my colleague on the other side to say: When nobody \nanticipated using these revenues: Really?\n  How it is then that all this money was in the President's budget? All \nthis money was in every budget printed by Republicans and Democrats. \nThe only way any of these budgets balance is with this revenue.\n  Now, I would acknowledge it makes absolutely no sense to tax these \npeople with the alternative minimum tax. It was never adjusted for \ninflation. That would not be a fair outcome. But it ought to be paid \nfor. The revenue ought to be replaced, either by spending cuts or by \nother revenue.\n  Because if we do not pay for it, we are going to borrow it. Where are \nwe going to borrow it? Well, we are going to borrow about half of it \nfrom abroad, most of it from the Chinese and the Japanese.\n  So while I very much recognize the difficult situation we are in, and \nI applaud the chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member \nfor grappling this, with trying to find a way to handle this problem, I \ncannot support providing this measure without it being paid for. That \nis what pay-go is about, to require that any new spending or new tax \ncuts or other revenue changes be offset. If we do not do it, we have to \nborrow it. We increasingly have to borrow it from abroad. That is not a \nwise course to pursue. Again, I recognize the extremely difficult \nsituation we are in because some will resist doing anything other than \nallowing AMT to be eliminated for this 1 year without an offset.\n  I, personally, think that is a mistake. I think it is a mistake for \nthe country. I think that money ought to be replaced, it ought to be \noffset. Again, when people say: Well, nobody ever anticipated this \nrevenue, that is not the case. Everybody who wrote a budget around here \nanticipated it. Every single budget, including the President's, \nincluding every budget written by Republicans or Democrats, included \nthis revenue.\n  While it would be a serious mistake to allow the AMT to go forward \nand hit 23 million American families, I believe the answer is to pay \nfor it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my time not be \ncounted against the time that is remaining under the previous unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a number of Senators because of the \nbad\n\n[[Page S14838]]\n\nweather who are caught in traffic. I have two alternatives. One is when \ntime is up, go into a quorum call. What I would like to do, because I \nknow other people want to get the vote over and leave, what I would \nlike to do, is let everyone know I would drag the vote. We do not have \nanything to do after the vote anyway. Unless there is some objection, I \nwould let people know we are going to not be able to complete the vote \nprobably until around 7 o'clock. I have two people, I understand one is \na Democrat, one is a Republican. So if no one complains, I am going to \ngo ahead and let the vote occur as required at approximately 6:25, and \nthen I will drag the vote. Does anybody care about that?\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding the Democrats, under the \ncontrol of Senator Baucus, are ready to yield back time. I want \neveryone to understand the vote is going to take more than the ordinary \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I assume all time is yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading \nof the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, certainly the Senate is a place for \nsquabbles. We have had lots of them. But also with the work that has to \nbe done in this body, sometimes it takes a little debate here and \nthere.\n  Today has been an important day for the Senate. We have been in a \nquorum call a lot. But during the time there were speeches being made \non rare occasion here, there was a lot of work being done. The AMT is \nnow done. I don't know that that is the case yet, but I heard that the \nHouse indicated they will accept our bill. That is quite important.\n  We have been working for weeks on the farm bill. A cloture vote is \nset at 9 o'clock in the morning, or whatever time we agree to. Maybe we \nwould have gotten cloture on that, I don't know. I am happy with this \nagreement. It will be a lot of work, but we will finish the farm bill \nbefore we leave, unless something untoward happens.\n  This has been a day of progress. Tomorrow we will finish work on the \nfarm bill, and there will be one vote. After we do that, the two \nmanagers, Senators Harkin and Chambliss, said they will work through \namendments tomorrow. There are a lot of amendments that can be agreed \nto. We want Senators, tomorrow and Monday--there will be no votes on \nMonday, but if Senators feel strongly about an amendment, work with the \nmanagers and have that offered and have that be one of the 40. \nHopefully, we can set up votes for Tuesday and finish the bill sometime \nbefore we leave here.\n  On the Energy bill, we are going to have a cloture vote in the \nmorning. From all indications I have gotten from the minority, cloture \nwill not be invoked. I will give a speech and others will. We would \nhave Saturday, Sunday, and Monday to try to come up with how we are \ngoing to proceed on this matter afterward. I hope we can work something \nout by consent; otherwise, because of the way we have the bill, I have \nthe authority to do certain things. I would rather do it by consent. I \nwill do the best I can to be as cooperative as possible with the \nminority. It is an extremely important piece of legislation. I think \nthere is a mindset of everyone here to do an energy bill. The question \nis, what is in it? If we have a bill, will it be signed by the \nPresident?\n  I understand all of the moving parts of the bill. But we have made \nprogress today with AMT, the farm bill, and now the Energy bill, on \nwhich we have had an agreement to move this up 1 day and not be here \nSaturday.\n  For everyone who thinks we don't get a lot done, we and our staffs \nwill be heavily involved in the matters I have outlined over the \nweekend. So I appreciate the cooperation of the Senators to get to the \npoint where we are, and I feel pretty good about the day's work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just say I do agree with the \nmajority leader that we made some substantial progress today. First of \nall, on the principle that in order to extend tax relief to one set of \nAmericans we don't have to raise taxes on another set of Americans, all \nbut five Members of the\n\n[[Page S14839]]\n\nSenate concurred in that approach to extension of the AMT relief. I \nthink that is an extremely important principle to be established in the \nSenate.\n  With regard to the farm bill, there is widespread agreement on both \nsides of the aisle that we ought to pass a farm bill and we ought to \npass it as soon as possible. I think getting the consent agreement to \nget the amendments down to 20 on each side is a significant step in \nthat direction. I am pleased to hear the majority leader would like for \nus to stay on that bill, make progress on it, and finish it before \nChristmas. That is certainly my view as well.\n  With regard to the Energy bill, we understand there are two highly \ncontentious, well-publicized provisions of tax increases that have been \ninserted by the House: At a time when oil is close to $100 a barrel, \nmany of us think a tax increase is not a good idea, and the wind \nmandate, which is particularly onerous on those of us in the Southeast \nwhere there is not much wind, which basically means, in effect, a \nmandatory rate increase for utilities and for utility ratepayers all \nacross the Southeast. I am hopeful we can get those two items out of \nthat bill.\n  The President has indicated he will veto the bill, and I think there \nis a view on the other side of the aisle, as well as on our side, that \nwe would like to have an energy bill actually enacted into law; that \nis, signed by the President. As the majority leader has indicated, \nhopefully we can get those problems removed from the Energy bill next \nweek and move toward a Presidential signature.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will allow me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has been cleared by floor staff. The \nunanimous consent request I just entered needs a clarification. So I \nask unanimous consent that it be clarified that nothing else be in \norder prior to the vote tomorrow morning--no points of order. I think \nthere is a general understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The senior Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I just want to say that I have no \nobjection. I wish to comment on the Energy bill. It has been a long \ntime getting here, and it still is not finished. There are provisions \nof that Energy bill that, if passed, will be superb for the people of \nthis country. It is too bad the bill is laden now with two provisions \nthat we did not have in our bill, that we did not contemplate. We will \nhave to work our way and see what happens. They are serious. They are \nserious enough to cause the President to veto the bill. I am hopeful we \nwill be able to find our way to get those two provisions out--the tax \nprovision and the provision with reference to mandatory 15-percent \nalternative energy fuels in our States. Those two are very difficult. \nIf we keep any of them in, our work is going to be for naught.\n  So I hope everybody understands the situation. It will be an \nexcellent bill without those provisions, and there may be a few other \ncleanup provisions we need in the House bill. We will work on them in \nthe next few days.\n  I thank the leaders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the floor situation, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore is notified there \nare no orders in effect.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I speak out of order for no more than 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14839-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MONONGAH, WEST VIRGINIA, MINE DISASTER\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as a son of West Virginia's southern \ncoalfields who grew up in a coal miner's home and married a coal \nminer's daughter, I note that today is the 100th anniversary of the \nMonongah, WV, mine disaster, a particularly momentous and solemn \nobservance for the coal miners of West Virginia.\n  The Monongah, WV, mine disaster remains today the worst industrial \naccident in American history. At least 362 coal miners lost their lives \nin that explosion on that cold December day, December 6, 1907. The \ntruth is, some of the miners inside Fairmont Coal Company's No. 6 and \nNo. 8 mines were boys--mere children, in fact--whose names did not \nappear on the company's official ledgers. So we may never know exactly \nhow many lives were lost inside that mine on that dark day.\n  Sadly, many more miners across West Virginia and the Nation would \nperish, including another 78 miners in an explosion in that same West \nVirginia community a little over 60 years later, before Congress would \nrespond with the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969.\n  Coal miners are a different breed. Coal miners are bound together in \nways perhaps not unlike the bonds that develop between soldiers or \nothers whose occupations are inherently dangerous. Coal miners share a \nvocabulary foreign to most outsiders. Coal miners must place great \ntrust in the persons next to them for their safety. Although mortal \ndanger stalks them daily, in every minute of every day, this mutual \ntrust and mutual dependence creates unusually strong bonds. Coal miners \nenjoy an unusually deep camaraderie.\n  Today in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Montana, Virginia, \nUtah, Alabama, Wyoming, and West Virginia, coal miners are marking the \n100th anniversary--that is today--of the Monongah, WV, mine disaster. \nThey do it with reverence, and they honor their survivors. In West \nVirginia, we also mark December 6 as Miner Day and celebrate all coal \nminers--past, present, and future.\n  Coal remains today, this very moment, the backbone of America's \nenergy supply. Over half of all the electricity we consume every day--\nand some of it is burning here tonight in the ceiling of this Hall--\nover half of all the electricity we consume every day is provided by \ncoal miners. We must protect those coal miners. The names Alma, Darby, \nCrandall Canyon, and Sago remind us that mine disasters are not simply \na part of the coal industry's past; they are part of our present.\n  As we remember the miners who lost their lives at Monongah on that \ncold December day in 1907, let us also recommit ourselves to protecting \nthe health and the safety of all those men and women who so bravely \ntoil in our coal mines today. May we also take a moment to consider \nthat the current political debate regarding the future of coal--black \ndiamonds--in our national energy policy is taking place under lights--\nright here, for example--under lights illuminated by the work of coal \nminers, in the warmth of furnaces fueled by coal miners and completely \nindependent of any foreign sheik or imam, thanks to coal miners--coal \nminers such as my dad, coal miners such as my wife's father, coal \nminers such as my brother-in-law. Coal miners, coal miners, coal \nminers--may God bless them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the work of \nthe Snowsports Outreach Society, SOS Outreach, based in Vail, CO, which \nis dedicated to providing outdoor recreation and confidence-building \nopportunities to underprivileged youth.\n  The snow sports industry is an essential part of Colorado's \nlifestyle, economy, and image. Colorado's mountainous terrain and \nworld-class resorts have set the standard for the ultimate experience \nin sliding on snow. As a skier, I understand the importance of this \noutdoor activity--in all its forms--\n\n[[Page S14840]]\n\nfor its health benefits as well as the recreation economy of Colorado \nand the country's ski resorts.\n  SOS Outreach complements the benefits of snow sports by providing \ndynamic programs to 2,500 youth in need nationwide. During the current \nseason, 2,000 Colorado participants will be enrolled in a 7-year \ncurriculum. I am proud to recognize the work that they do to grow the \nsport and promote positive self-esteem in their participants.\n  Now celebrating its 14th anniversary, SOS Outreach was founded in \nVail, CO, in 1993. SOS Outreach is a grassroots, 501(c)(3) \norganization. Through the work of its founder and executive director, \nArn Menconi, and former director of snowboarding for Vail Resorts, Ray \nSforzo, a charity was developed that appealed to the mountain resort's \ndesire to build the community by serving underprivileged youth.\n  SOS Outreach first introduced youth to the benefits of outdoor \nrecreation during the 1995/1996 season when they taught 40 youth \nsnowboarding. They were provided with one day of free lessons, \nequipment, and lift tickets. Since their first season, SOS Outreach has \npartnered with mountain resorts, youth agencies, foundations, \ncorporations, and individual donors to expand its nationally recognized \ncurriculum and serve over 7,500 youth. SOS Outreach is further \nleveraging their partnerships to expand their programs and include \nskiing. Over 7,000 program days will be provided at 29 resorts across \nthe country, 13 in the State of Colorado.\n  SOS Outreach provides participants with a high-quality, resilience-\nbased program that positively impacts a participant's self-esteem and \nability to participate positively within their communities; supports \nunderserved youth through adult mentorship; and encourages personal \ncharacter education through SOS Outreach's five core values: courage, \ndiscipline, integrity, wisdom, and compassion.\n  SOS Outreach would not be successful without the substantial support \nof the following individuals and organizations. I would like to \nrecognize and thank each of them for sustaining such a program in \nColorado:\n  Bill Jensen and Kara Heide of Vail Resorts; Ken Gart and everyone at \nSpecialty Sports Venture; Chris Ryman of Booth Creek Ski Holdings; \nColorado Mountain Resorts for their donation of lift tickets, lessons, \nand rental equipment; Harry Frampton and Ceil Folz of the Vail Valley \nFoundation; Robert Veitch of the Harold W. Shaw and Mary Louise Shaw \nFoundation; Linda Childers of the Daniels Fund; William Hybl of the El \nPomar Foundation; Bill Cotton of Optic Nerve Sunglasses; Robert \nMarcovitch of K2 Inc.; Mike West of 686; Wendy and Mike Carey of \nSeirus; Chaos Hats; Ride Snowboards; Salomon Sports; Sutherland \nFoundation; Bob Hernreich; Kay and Craig Tuber; to the staff of SOS \nOutreach: Arn and Anne Menconi, Michelle Hartel, Jon Garrou, Seth \nEhrlich, Jody Link, Thersa Bisio; and the hundreds of adults that give \nof themselves to be positive mentors to these young people.\n  Mr. President, I wish to recognize SOS Outreach for its work and \nextend my wishes for its continued success.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I object to the unanimous consent \nagreement to pass S. 2338, the FHA modernization bill.\n  The Senate has twice attempted to pass a complex and critical \nmortgage reform bill without the opportunity for debate or amendment. I \ncertainly understand the importance of this issue, which is why I \nbelieve the bill must be afforded time for proper scrutiny and debate \nby the Senate. It is naive, irresponsible and reckless for the Senate \nto claim it can fix this national challenge by rubberstamping our \napproval for this legislation without the opportunity to improve the \nbill through amendments.\n  More importantly, however, this bill is not the proper response to \nthe housing crisis. This bill increases the availability of government-\nbacked mortgages, adding a liability to the taxpayer of $1.6 billion in \ngovernment-backed loans. This bill greatly increases the loan limit \nwhich the government may insure, while simultaneously decreasing the \ndown payment requirement for borrowers. This only makes taxpayers \nliable for billions of dollars in loans that may default. The solution \nto the mortgage crisis is fewer risky loans, not more.\n  Proponents of the legislation have argued that this bill is a low-\nrisk way for the government to prevent future subprime foreclosures. \nHowever, this bill only creates more opportunities for borrowers to \nreceive government-backed loans, increasing the liability on American \ncitizens, but not preventing the possibility of delinquency or default.\n  According to a recent analysis by the Wall Street Journal, many \nsubprime borrowers are not delinquent because they cannot afford \nincreasing adjustable rates, but because they cannot afford their \ninitial rates in the first place. The Wall Street Journal states:\n\n       It is true that many subprime borrowers were sold a toxic \n     mortgage by unscrupulous mortgage brokers. However, the \n     primary reason for the spike in subprime delinquencies so far \n     is that many subprime borrowers have taken on more debt than \n     they can pay back using any reasonable interest rate.\n\n  It would be unconscionable to shift this burden on to the Federal \nGovernment, especially at a time when our national debt stands well \nover $9.1 trillion, or $30,132 per citizen.\n  Sixty-one economists from universities and think-tanks from across \nAmerica released an open letter to the U.S. Congress advising against \n``excessive new regulations or federal interventions'' to deal with \ncredit repricing in the subprime mortgage market. The letter warns: \n``Legislation to create new underwriting standards will reduce \ncompetition and restrict consumer access to credit. Additionally, \nefforts to bail out or shore up lending institutions create a moral \nhazard that would slow the adjustments required in the marketplace. . . \n. These [bail out] proposals would fundamentally alter the workings of \nthe mortgage market, leaving consumers with fewer choices when seeking \nto buy a home and potentially increasing taxpayer exposure for bad \nloans.''\n  The American people agree that making government-backed loans more \navailable is not the right response. According to a survey conducted by \nHarris Interactive on behalf of the National Taxpayers Union, NTU, when \nasked which statement most closely reflects their views of allowing \nFederal agencies to increase the size of the loans they can insure and \nreduce downpayment requirements, 66 percent of respondents answered \nthat ``these proposals are nothing more than a taxpayer-funded bailout \nof banks and lenders that provided and profited from these risky \nloans.'' Furthermore, 60 percent of respondents said taxpayers would be \nmost negatively affected if the government were to bail out the \nsubprime mortgage market.\n  I do believe the Senate should debate this issue, and examine what \ncan be done to keep borrowers from defaulting and ensure that Americans \nare able to stay in their homes. I believe lenders must take \nresponsibility for their loans, including full disclosure about the \nterms of the agreement and the possibility of default, and borrowers \nmust be responsible for the agreement into which they enter. Mortgage \nbrokers, real estate agents and other lenders should be transparent \nwith their lending conditions and must be accountable for full \ndisclosure to borrowers. However, I do not believe it is the job of the \ngovernment to bail out default mortgages and loans and it is not the \nproper role of the government to insure loans with taxpayer dollars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14840-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14840-S14841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MAJOR THOMAS A.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize MAJ Thomas A. \nRogers, Jr. of the U.S. Air Force for the exceptional work he rendered \nthis past year while serving as a legislative fellow on my staff. Major \nRogers is completing his Capitol Hill fellowship this month, and it is \nmy hope that he has benefited as much from this experience as have I \nfrom having him on my staff.\n  In 1995, after his graduation from the Washington University Law \nSchool in St. Louis, Major Rogers received his commission in the U.S. \nAir Force. Since that time Major Rogers has served at base legal \noffices from Korea to Germany, as an area defense counsel, as the \ndeputy chief, plans and requirements, Air Force Legal Information \nServices, and as an instructor at the Air Force Judge Advocate General \nSchool. Major Rogers has also deployed to Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan \nin\n\n[[Page S14841]]\n\nsupport of the global war on terror. Major Rogers has received numerous \nawards and commendations during his service including the Bronze Star \nand the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal. He was also honored in \n2005 as the 20th Air Force Outstanding Young Judge Advocate.\n  Mr. President, I want to give my heartfelt thank you to Thom for his \nservice. His eagerness to tackle issues which were new to him and to \nadvance the goals I have set for my staff on behalf of both the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces and the citizens of New Mexico were truly \ncommendable. I have no doubt that as Thom continues his military \ncareer, he will achieve great things for both the U.S. Air Force and \nhis country, and I wish him the very best of luck in all his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14841-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING GEORGE OSMOND\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in honor of a friend \nof mine, Mr. George Osmond, who, on Thursday, November 6, passed away. \nWhile most people will likely remember George as the patriarch of one \nof our Nation's most famous entertainment families, he should also be \nremembered as a great humanitarian and entrepreneur.\n  George was born in 1917 in Star Valley, WY. As a young man, in 1941, \nhe enlisted in the Army and served honorably during World War II. In \n1944, he was stationed at the U.S. Army's General Depot in Ogden, UT, \nwhere he met his wife, Olive May Davis. George and Olive were married \nin December 1944 and had nine children, eight boys and one girl.\n  To most, George's early professional life was quite normal. He began \nhis career selling real estate and life insurance. He later took a \nposition as the Ogden Postmaster. During that time, his sons began to \nstudy music; George taught them to sing barbershop and helped them get \ninvitations to perform at community events. His family first entered \nthe national spotlight when four of his sons, Alan, Wayne, Merrill and \nJay, formed a quartet known as ``the Osmond Brothers'' and began \nperforming at Disneyland and on The Andy Williams Show.\n  Over the years, seven of his nine children would perform a variety of \nmusic styles all over the world. All counted, the Osmond family has \nrecorded 142 albums, selling 100 million copies with 51 gold and \nplatinum recordings. George, himself, worked as the manager of his \nchildren's music careers, working to make sure they remained grounded \nand focused on the importance of family.\n  One of the lesser known facts about the Osmond family is that two of \nthe Osmond children, the oldest sons Virl and Tom, were born deaf. \nWhile these two sons were never music performers, they were closely \ninvolved with their father's charitable efforts, working with him to \nestablish The Osmond Foundation, which later became the Children's \nMiracle Network.\n  The Children's Miracle Network is now headquartered in Salt Lake City \nand has, to date, raised more $3 billion, which is distributed directly \nto a network of 170 hospitals. These funds are raised specifically for \nchildren's hospitals, medical research and community awareness of \nchildren's health issues. It is the largest organization of its kind in \nthe world and is, in addition to their many children and grandchildren, \nGeorge and Olive Osmond's greatest legacy.\n  Mr. President, I knew George Osmond for many years. He was, above all \nelse, devoted to his family and a man of integrity. I thoroughly \nenjoyed the opportunities I have had over the years to work with him \nand his family on several charitable endeavors. George was truly a \nremarkable man who leaves a long legacy here with us in his passing. I \nwant to express my deepest condolences to George's family and thank \nthem for their wonderful example of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14841-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14841-S14842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING SALLY SMITH\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a great friend \nof mine and a wonderful woman and leader. Sally Smith passed away \nDecember 1, 2007, from complications related to myeloma. Sally founded \nthe Lab School in Washington, DC, one of the premier educational \ninstitutions in the Nation for students with learning disabilities. The \nLab School is a place where children with learning disabilities are \nnurtured, taught, given the tools to succeed and the opportunity to \nflourish. And nearly all of them do.\n  I had heard what an extraordinary place the Lab School is and decided \nI wanted to find out for myself. On a crisp autumn morning about 4 \nyears ago, I decided to drop by the Lab School on my way into work. I \nwas amazed as I walked into the Castle, which is the main building of \nthe school. As Sally hadn't arrived yet, I was invited to wait in her \noffice. The door was always open as Sally welcomed anyone and everyone. \nSoon a woman came in looking like a bright rainbow with brilliant \ncolors flowing and dazzling from head to toe. As I spoke with Sally \nabout the school and its mission I quickly came to understand what a \nunique and wonderful place this was. The Lab School is a safe haven for \nso many kids who are bright and smart and eager to learn but can't \nlearn in traditional ways. Sally through her hard work and years of \ndedication has truly created a grand new doorway to education for kids \nwho found the doors to other schools closed to them. From that day on I \nbecame great friends with Sally and supported the school in any way \nthat I could. I have attended the annual Gala Awards Dinner which has \nraised much needed funds for the schools and honored people like \nCharles Schwab and Magic Johnson who had grown up with learning \ndisabilities and struggled until they found a pathway to education. I \nalways looked forward to visiting with Sally and offered to help in any \nway that I could.\n  Sally first saw the need for a school to help children with learning \ndisabilities to learn and grow when her son Gary was in the first \ngrade. While Gary was bright and creative, he was unable to read and do \nsimple math. When Gary began to have trouble at school, his parents \nfound that he had severe learning disabilities. The school he was \nattending gave them few options to help their son learn, and Sally \nbegan to realize that for Gary to excel and reach his potential he \nwould need to be given the opportunity to learn in a way tailored to \nhis unique needs. Using what she had learned in graduate school course \nwork in education and observing that her son learned best through \nstorytelling and acting things out, she set out in 1967 to create a \nschool that would use these tools to teach children with learning \ndisabilities.\n  Rather than learning through lectures and traditional textbook \nexercises, Sally set out to create a curriculum that would allow for \nartistic, visual, hands-on learning. She invited artist friends to \nserve as teachers and sought the help of many acquaintances to raise \nfunds that would make the dream of the Lab School a reality. The Lab \nSchool has now for 40 years given students like Gary a chance to \nsucceed. From this life learning opportunity, nearly all Lab School \nalumni graduate and over 90 percent find their way to college.\n  We can only imagine where these students would be without the love \nand dedication of Sally Smith. Where others saw kids who couldn't learn \nand were disruptive, Sally saw kids eager to learn and let their \ncreativity bloom in their own special way. And why should these \nchildren, the future of our Nation, be pushed aside and forgotten about \nwhen they have so much potential and so many gifts to give?\n  The Lab School over the years has expanded and now has nearly 325 \nstudents enrolled. It reaches another 250 through tutoring programs for \nchildren and adults and many more through summer camps and outreach \nservices. The school also opened a campus in Baltimore. Sally was also \na professor at American University's School of Education and was in \ncharge of the master's degree program specializing in learning \ndisabilities. She has authored 10 books on effectively teaching \nstudents with learning disabilities and conducted workshops for \neducators of learning disabled children.\n  Sally's legacy and nurturing teaching style that sought to include \nand find the potential of each student will never be forgotten by those \nwhose lives she touched. Not only did her students\n\n[[Page S14842]]\n\nlearn a great deal from Sally, but we all can.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of an article from the December 4, \n2007, edition of the Washington Post entitled ``The Teacher at the Head \nof the Class'' be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 4, 2007]\n\n                  The Teacher at the Head of the Class\n\n                           (By Ellen Edwards)\n\n       At first glance you might have thought you had come upon \n     some improbable tropical bird, full of color and feathers, \n     dressed in layers of patterns on patterns, a pile of rolling \n     blond curls on her head.\n       This, of course, is what captivated children when they \n     first looked at Sally Smith, the founder and director of the \n     Lab School of Washington, one of the nation's premier places \n     for students with learning disabilities. She didn't look like \n     any other adult in their experience, and they discovered she \n     didn't think like any other head of school, either.\n       Sally Smith, who died Saturday from complications of \n     myeloma at 78, looked right back at those young faces and saw \n     potential, intelligence, the charm and grace of childhood.\n       Where other schools saw kids who didn't pay attention, she \n     saw kids who viewed the world in creative ways. Where other \n     schools saw frustration and anger, she saw kids desperate to \n     learn, and she created a school for them. She gave them \n     respect, she gave them hope and she gave them the tools to \n     succeed.\n       Her own son's difficulties with learning caused her to look \n     for ways to teach him, and from the beginning, even before \n     she became a nationally known educator, she placed the \n     responsibility directly on adults in charge. In the school \n     handbook, Smith wrote, ``our philosophy is based on the \n     belief that a child's failure to learn means that the \n     teaching staff has not yet found a way to help him. It is up \n     to the adults to seek out the routes by which each child \n     learns, to discover his strengths and interests and to \n     experiment until effective techniques are found.''\n       Anyone who ever met Sally has a story to tell. She was \n     larger than life: in her size and presence, in her ambitions, \n     in her throaty voice advocating her ideas. She cultivated \n     artists, and often had them to her Cleveland Park home. She \n     cultivated support for the Lab School, from wealthy and \n     powerful potential donors to parents who could give only \n     their time. Her fundraising gala highlighted learning-\n     disabled achievers, who over the years have included Charles \n     Schwab, Magic Johnson, Robert Rauschenberg, Cher and James \n     Carville. In a closed-door session, the students would face \n     those big names and ask blunt and painful questions: ``Did \n     you feel stupid compared with your siblings?'' ``Were your \n     parents embarrassed by you?'' ``How did you feel when you \n     were asked to read out loud in class?''\n       The core of all of Smith's techniques, in her 10 books and \n     the PBS series about her work, is empathy. I first heard her \n     name a decade ago from a reading specialist in the Midwest \n     when I was beginning to think I might have a dyslexic child.\n       You're near Sally Smith's school, aren't you?'' she asked \n     me. ``That's the place.'' She said it with such confidence \n     and certainty that I knew I had better figure out who Sally \n     Smith was.\n       I met Sally first as a reporter, sitting in her office and \n     listening to her talk about students the Lab School has \n     taught. I remember in particular the story of the young boy \n     who was good at numbers but not good at reading. The Lab \n     faculty, which individualizes homework, a study plan, \n     classwork, everything, for every student, put him in charge \n     of the school store. He loved selling things. They found a \n     way to catch his interest and motivate him to learn to read. \n     He grew up and out of Lab, and, Smith boasted, had become a \n     successful businessman.\n       She talked about another student who learned \n     kinesthetically, through movement. The teachers spread \n     patterns out on the floor for him to learn math, a map for \n     him to learn geography, and he danced his way through \n     learning.\n       She told me how often tears had been shed in that office, \n     which was crowded with art from students and professionals, \n     and which had an open door policy so vigorously enforced that \n     most people didn't think she even had a door. Parents came to \n     her desperate to find a school where their child would be \n     accepted and challenged, where they could learn and not be \n     warehoused until they dropped out. They brought with them \n     horror stories from other schools that had treated their kids \n     as if they were stupid, made them feel terrible about \n     themselves and chucked them in the corner as a lost cause.\n       After a few months at Lab, they often wept again, with \n     gratitude, because the school meant no more endless rounds of \n     tutors and therapists. It meant free time after school for \n     exhausted children who worked hard every minute of the school \n     day. It meant an end to the isolation of parenting a child \n     who learned differently, because the school community \n     embraced the potential of these children.\n       Five years ago I met Sally again, but this time as the \n     parent of a prospective student. It was clear my son had the \n     family dyslexia gene, and reading was going to be a struggle. \n     He enrolled for third grade, where 12 students in his class \n     had four educators.\n       His lead teacher that year spent a long time figuring out \n     how to get him interested in reading. Of course he was \n     interested, but it was so hard and frustrating for him that \n     he pushed it away. Finally, she realized his interest in \n     baseball might do it. Every day, his homework consisted of \n     reading lessons she had taken from news stories about \n     baseball and had rewritten at his reading level. Every day \n     she created a page of four or five questions for him to \n     answer from his reading. Little by little, his reading got \n     better. He was studying without realizing it. He thought he \n     was just having fun.\n       This learning environment was Sally Smith's creation, her \n     gift to the world of education. She saw how arts could teach \n     all kinds of things, and she shaped the Lab School around the \n     arts. She hired artists as teachers because she knew they \n     would think creatively. They taught sophisticated content \n     without reading.\n       In his first year there, the mythologies of ancient times \n     were taught through what was called Gods Club. The students \n     were taught by Cleopatra, complete with headdress. The \n     students dressed in togas. Each took the identity of a Greek \n     god. To enter the classroom, they used passwords that changed \n     every day, such as ``Corinthian,'' which taught them the name \n     of a column's capital. A painted Nile River ran through the \n     middle of the classroom just as the real Nile runs through \n     Egypt.\n       When the winter break came, and we took our son to the \n     Egyptian galleries at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, he \n     read the hieroglyphics to us while we listened slack-jawed.\n       This was her famous Academic Club method, one of the many \n     she shared as professor in charge of American University's \n     masters program for special education. Our son went on to \n     Knights and Ladies Club, taught by Eleanor of Aquitaine, and \n     Renaissance Club taught by Lorenzo de Medici. He jousted and \n     learned about Holy Wars, made cheese and tasted ravioli, \n     painted a fresco and took on the persona of Dante.\n       He learned, and after four years he moved on to a \n     mainstream school, which was Smith's ultimate goal for all \n     her students.\n       A couple of months ago, my son was visiting the school and \n     saw Smith. She was in a wheelchair, dressed in her usual eye-\n     popping splendor. She took his hand and asked him how he \n     liked his new school.\n       She really wanted to know the answer, and she really \n     listened when he gave it. That was Sally Smith's \n     genius.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14842-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14842-S14843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING CHARLES E. ``BUTCH'' JOECKEL\n\n Mr. HAGEL.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay \ntribute to the extraordinary life and work of Joseph Atkins Nickerson, \nJr., of Chatham, MA, a retired builder and prominent local historian \nwho passed away on November 23 at the age of 89. Joe lived his entire \nlife in the town of Chatham. The only exception was during his service \nto the Navy during World War II.\n  Joe was a direct descendent of the founders of Chatham, and he will \nalways be remembered for his leadership in preserving the town's \nhistory. He had an extraordinary ability to recall people, places, and \ndates, and his story-telling skill was legendary.\n  Joe was a member of numerous local sports teams in his youth, and at \nthe age of 22 he pitched a no hit, no run, no walk, 22 strike-out \nperfect baseball game for the local Chatham team. He was also an \noriginal member of the Chatham Town Band, and played the clarinet \nbeautifully in concerts and parades for over 50 years. His skills as a \ntown musician were a great source of pride for all his family.\n  Joe served the town in many other ways as well. He was a volunteer \nfireman, a member of the School Building Committee, president and \nhistorian of the Chatham Historical Society, a founding member of the \nConservation Association, president of the Boston Glass Club, and a \nmember of the Retired Men's Club.\n  In recent years, Joe and his beloved wife Gerry worked together to \nwrite a book, ``Chatham Sea Captains in The Age of Sail.'' Before he \npassed away he was delighted to learn that his long-awaited book would \nbe published by History Press, Inc. of Charleston, SC, in February \n2008. I am sure it will be a wonderful memorial to Joe and a delight to \nthe people of Chatham and all of us who love Cape Cod. His remarkable \nlife and his commitment to the community will continue to inspire us \nall for years to come, and we mourn the passing of this amazing son of \nChatham.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14843-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14843-3", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14843-4", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:37 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S. 888.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     New York urging the New York State Congressional Delegation \n     to make the Do Not Call Registry permanent; to the Committee \n     on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Do Not Call Registry was established in the \n     State of New York in 2000 to protect citizens from unwanted \n     sales calls; it was made more effective in 2003, when it \n     merged with the National Do Not Call Registry; and\n       Whereas, the National Do Not Call Registry provides \n     citizens across the state and country with the privacy they \n     deserve and adequate penalties for businesses which violate \n     that privacy by persisting with unwanted phone calls; and\n       Whereas, the merging of the two Do Not Call Registries has \n     effectively protected New York State residents from \n     bothersome and unwanted phone solicitations for the last five \n     years; and\n       Whereas, Due to the five year expiration of the National Do \n     Not Call Registry, many of the first enrollees will soon \n     again be vulnerable to telephone solicitations unless they \n     re-enroll; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That this Legislative Body pause in its \n     deliberations to urge the New York State Congressional \n     Delegation to eliminate the 5-year expiration date and make \n     the National Do Not Call Registry permanent; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Resolution, suitably \n     engrossed, be transmitted to the President of the Senate of \n     the United States, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each member of the Congress of the \n     United States from the State of New York.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-262. A resolution adopted by the California State Lands \n     Commission expressing its support for S. 1870 and H.R. 2421; \n     to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the California State Lands Commission has \n     jurisdiction over the state-owned tide and submerged lands \n     below the mean high tide line out to three miles from the \n     coast as well as the lands underlying California's bays, \n     lakes, and rivers; and\n       Whereas, the Commission is charged with managing these \n     lands pursuant to the Public Trust Doctrine, common law that \n     requires these lands to be used for commerce, fishing, \n     navigation, recreation, and environmental protection; and\n       Whereas, the Commission has acquired thousands of acres of \n     valuable wetlands and lands to be restored to wetlands such \n     as Bolsa Chica and the Cosumnes River wetlands; and\n       Whereas, the Commission is gravely concerned about the \n     adverse effects greenhouse gases and climate change will have \n     on the environmental, economic, and public value of the state \n     lands it holds in trust; and\n       Whereas, wetlands have been identified as significant \n     storehouses of carbon, possibly storing as much as 40% of \n     global terrestrial carbon; and\n       Whereas, the drainage and degradation of wetlands releases \n     large quantities of carbon dioxide (the gas that accounts for \n     at least 60% of global warming) as well as other greenhouse \n     gases contributing to climate change; and\n       Whereas, there are approximately 100 million wetland acres \n     remaining in the continental United States, which are \n     decreasing about 60,000 acres annually; and\n       Whereas, if wetlands are functioning properly, they provide \n     not only protection against global warming, but also water \n     quality protection, fish and wildlife habitat, natural \n     floodwater storage, reduction in the erosive potential of \n     surface water, and popular recreational uses; and\n       Whereas, wetlands have been used to manage wastewater: as \n     the water passes through the wetlands, suspended particles \n     settle; pollutants are broken down by plants, microorganisms, \n     and sediment; nutrients are absorbed; and pathogens die off; \n     and\n       Whereas, wetlands are among the most biologically \n     productive ecosystems, essential to the survival of more than \n     one-third of the threatened and endangered species in the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, wetlands provide public use benefits, supplying \n     opportunities for enjoying nature, hiking, biking, bird \n     watching, hunting, fishing, and scientific study, which in \n     the aggregate, generate several billions of dollars annually \n     in the United States; and\n       Whereas, in 1972, Congress passed the Clean Water Act \n     (``the Act'') to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, \n     and biological integrity of the Nation's waters. The Act \n     contains Section 404, which established a permit program \n     involving the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. \n     Army Corps of Engineers (``the Corps'') to regulate \n     discharges of pollutants (e.g. waste discharge and dredged \n     and fill materials) into waters of the United States; and\n       Whereas, in 1977, the Corps issued final regulations on the \n     permit program and explicitly included in its definition of \n     ``waters of the United States'' any ``isolated wetlands and \n     lakes, intermittent streams, prairie potholes, and other \n     waters that are not part of the tributary system to \n     interstate waters or to navigable waters of the United \n     States, the degradation or destruction of which could affect \n     interstate commerce.''; and\n       Whereas, in 2001 and compounded by a joint decision in \n     2006, the United States Supreme Court, first in Solid Waste \n     Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers (SWANCC) and then in Rapanos v. United States, \n     issued decisions that reduced the jurisdictional scope of the \n     Clean Water Act, undermining decades of clean water \n     protection, and jeopardizing the future of wetlands and other \n     waters of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the opinions of the split court in Rapanos have \n     created great confusion as to the actual scope of the Clean \n     Water Act, making implementation of the Act resource \n     intensive and subject to litigation; and\n       Whereas, the Clean Water Restoration Act of 2007, \n     introduced by Senator Feingold through S. 1870, and \n     Congressman Oberstar through H.R. 2421, seeks to end \n     jurisdictional confusion left in the wake of the Rapanos case \n     by codifying the Corps' definition of ``waters of the United \n     States,'' which federal agencies have used to enforce the \n     Clean Water Act for over 30 years; Therefore be it\n       Resolved by the California State Lands Commission, That it \n     supports the Clean Water Restoration Act of 2007 (S. 1870 and \n     H.R. 2421), which would affirm federal protections for waters \n     of the United States, including wetlands, tributaries, \n     headwaters and streams, through the Clean Water Act; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Commission's Executive Officer transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Governor of California, to the \n     Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate, to \n     the Speaker and Minority Leader of the United States House of \n     Representatives, to the Chairs and Ranking Minority Members \n     of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, the \n     House Committee on Energy and Commerce, to each Senator and \n     Representative from California in the Congress of the United \n     States, to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and to the \n     Environmental Protection Agency.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-263.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging the Secretary \n     of State to increase efforts to urge the People's Republic of \n     China to halt its violation of the human rights of its \n     citizens; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 109\n\n       Whereas, Falun Gong, which is also known as Falun Dafa, is \n     a traditional Chinese discipline of personal beliefs that is \n     based on the principles of truthfulness, compassion, and \n     forbearance. Falun Gong attracts millions of people of all \n     ages and backgrounds is practiced in over 80 countries over \n     the world; and\n       Whereas, over the past several years, authorities in the \n     People's Republic of China have taken strong and brutal \n     actions against practitioners of Falun Gong. Reports indicate \n     that tens of thousands of people have been tortured and sent \n     to labor camps, and property owned by those who follow this \n     discipline has been destroyed or confiscated. Independent \n     investigations also report that large-scale organ harvesting \n     for transplant involves organs taken from non- consenting \n     prisoners, with the major target group being Falun Gong \n     practitioners; and\n       Whereas, the persecution of practitioners of Falun Gong is \n     in apparent violation of the People's Republic of China's own \n     constitution and a flagrant violation of standards of human \n     rights recognized by the United Nations and most governments \n     of the world; and\n       Whereas, citizens of Michigan who practice Falun Gong and \n     those who understand this discipline cannot fathom the \n     reaction of the Chinese authorities. Indeed, those who value \n     human rights seek an increase of efforts to urge the People's \n     Republic of China to halt this persecution; Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we urge the \n     United States Secretary of State to increase efforts to urge \n     the People's Republic of China to recognize and protect the \n     human rights of its citizens and halt the persecution of and \n     forced harvesting of organs from practitioners of Falun Gong; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, that copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the United States Secretary of State, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-265. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     enact federal legislation designed to prevent elder abuse; to \n     the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 207\n\n       Whereas, the number of older Americans is increasing, and \n     with it the problem of elder abuse and exploitation. Older \n     Americans constitute a vulnerable population that often \n     suffer physical and emotional abuse and can often be targets \n     of identity theft and other fraudulent financial schemes; and\n       Whereas, in response to concerns about elder abuse, federal \n     legislation has been introduced that would focus attention on \n     this problem and promote an infrastructure at the federal, \n     state, and local levels to protect these vulnerable \n     Americans. The Elder Justice Act, S. 1070 and H.R. 1783, \n     would assure that individuals and organizations on the front \n     lines, who are fighting elder abuse, have the resources and \n     information needed to carry out their fight; and\n       Whereas, This legislation would create a comprehensive and \n     multidisciplinary approach to protecting older Americans. The \n     Elder Justice Act would improve research and data collection, \n     enhance training of individuals who fight elder abuse, and \n     promote the development of an effective adult fiduciary \n     system, including an adult guardianship system. Among other \n     things, this legislation would also create a short and long \n     term strategic plan for the development and coordination of \n     elder justice research, programs, and training; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to enact federal \n     legislation designed to prevent elder abuse; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-266. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Michigan urging Congress to \n     repeal Title II of the REAL ID Act of 2005; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 176\n\n       Whereas, the state of Michigan denounces and condemns all \n     acts of terrorism, wherever the acts occur; and\n       Whereas, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention \n     Act (IRTP) of 2004 called for reforms that would make \n     identification documents more secure, harder to force, and \n     more difficult to fraudulently obtain; and\n       Whereas, the IRTP Act of 2004 recognized that imposing \n     federal mandates and standards onto state driver's licenses \n     raised important questions on the federal government's \n     ability and role in interfering with identification cards \n     wholly owned by the states, especially when there are federal \n     alternatives. As a result, the Act sought to establish \n     identification security guidelines by a shared and negotiated \n     rulemaking process in full partnership with the states; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act of 2005, without benefit of Senate \n     hearings or testimony, was abruptly attached as a rider to a \n     must-pass military spending and tsunami relief bill (PL 109-\n     13). Its passage effectively repealed the negotiated \n     rulemaking process already under way as a result of the IRTP \n     Act of 2004, replacing it with methodology designed to \n     directly impose federal standards onto a state's wholly owned \n     licenses under REAL ID. The draft rules for obtaining a REAL \n     ID are more stringent than those the federal government \n     requires for its own passports or social security cards; and\n       Whereas, under these new standards, the REAL ID Act sets \n     mandated deadlines in the near future under which Michigan's \n     current licenses cannot be used for any federal purpose, \n     including, but not limited to, activities such as boarding \n     domestic airline flights, opening most bank accounts, and \n     gaining entrance to federal buildings such as courts. While \n     citizens could alternatively use passports for such purposes, \n     whether or not non-REAL ID licenses could still be used for \n     the federal purpose of obtaining a passport has not been \n     definitively clarified; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act puts the Department of Homeland \n     Security in charge of determining the as of yet published \n     final rules that would mandate what information would be \n     included on Michigan's driver's licenses, with whom the data \n     must be shared, what biometrics may ultimately be used on the \n     cards, and what encoding or other machine-readable technology \n     may ultimately be required. Such action creates a precedent \n     where different or additional rules could also be created \n     again by the federal government in the future; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act would mandate that Michigan must \n     link parts of its Secretary of State database to the \n     departments of motor vehicles of all other states, in effect \n     creating a single shared national database, while at the same \n     time REAL ID sets no\n\n[[Page S14847]]\n\n     standards whatsoever on the security measures that states \n     must use for gateway access to other states' databases, \n     allows for non-governmental third parties to administer such \n     databases, and sets absolutely no limits on how non-\n     governmental entities will mandate use of the cards for \n     goods, services, or other purposes; and\n       Whereas, Real ID is an unfunded mandate and the Department \n     of Homeland Security estimates that the regulations will cost \n     the states and consumers $23 billion to implement; and\n       Whereas, regardless of who pays for the costs of REAL ID, \n     it would federalize Michigan's driver's licenses by \n     determining under what conditions the card can be used, what \n     information has to be collected and put on the cards, what \n     machine-readable technology the information is encoded under, \n     and to whom the state must give such data. This \n     federalization and creation of a de facto national \n     identification card occurs without the benefit of a shared, \n     negotiated rulemaking process with the states regarding the \n     co-option of their wholly owned licenses; and\n       Whereas, as a result of these concerns and a recognition \n     that needed reforms can be accomplished without the negative \n     aspects of REAL ID, seventeen states have already passed \n     bills or resolutions rejecting, asking for repeal, or putting \n     limitation on whether or not they will participate in REAL \n     ID. These states include Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, \n     Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, \n     New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, \n     Tennessee, and Washington. Ten other states have anti-REAL ID \n     initiatives that have passed one chamber; and\n       Whereas, Federal S. 117, the Identification Security \n     Enhancement Act of 2006 sponsored by Senators Sununu (R-NH) \n     and Akaka (D-HI), and similar current legislation, replaces \n     REAL ID with language taken from the original Intelligence \n     Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The proposed \n     legislation takes a more measured approach to mandating \n     tougher standards for driver's licenses by requiring that new \n     guidelines be developed by a shared rulemaking process that \n     would fully involve all states and other key stakeholders; \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize Congress to repeal Title II of the REAL ID Act of \n     2005, and to support a return to a negotiated rulemaking \n     process with the states, such as called for in S. 117, the \n     Identification Security Enhancement Act of 2006; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Michigan Legislature will not \n     appropriate funds nor enact legislation for the \n     implementation of Title II of the REAL ID Act of 2005; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-267.

Other political \n     prisoners, who were serving equally disproportionate \n     sentences, have already been released, first, under the \n     Administration of Jimmy Carter, and subsequently, in 1999, \n     under the Administration of William J. Clinton.\n       The cause for the release of these fellow countrymen has \n     united Puerto Ricans of all creeds. Political, religious and \n     civic institutions have claimed for the return home of Carlos \n     Alberto, Oscar and Haydee. Their long imprisonment, far from \n     serving a purpose, has become a sign of inhumanity and \n     injustice. International entities have joined the consensus \n     reached in Puerto Rico for the release of our prisoners.\n       The Senate of Puerto Rico also joins in solidarity to \n     petition the President of the United States, George W.

A bill to permit employees to request, and to ensure \nemployers consider requests for, flexible work terms and conditions, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the American workplace has changed \nsignificantly in recent years. In the new global economy, many \nbusinesses are open around the clock--and employees often work long \nshifts and unpredictable hours. With computers and cell phones, \nemployers can reach employees almost any time, anywhere. Hard economic \ntimes require many men and women to work longer hours or hold multiple \njobs. Almost 8 million Americans now juggle the demands of at least two \njobs, and tens of millions more find it increasingly difficult to \nachieve a fair balance between their work and their family.\n  These and other shifts in our society mean that many Americans and \ntheir\n\n[[Page S14850]]\n\nfamilies are stretched to the limit. Two-thirds of all families in our \ncountry are headed by either two employed parents or a single working \nparent, and parents are working outside the home longer hours than \never--an average of 91 hours a week for dual income couples.\n  As the population ages, more and more Americans must also care for \nelderly parents and relatives. An aging population also means more \nolder workers, who want to stay on the job, but don't want or can't \nmanage long hours any more. Expanding populations in metropolitan areas \nmean longer commutes. A recent Gallup poll found that about a third of \nAmerican workers spend an hour or more a day getting to and from work.\n  Our working families deserve a 21st century answer for these 21st \ncentury job challenges. Greater flexibility is an essential part of the \nresponse. More than 80 percent of workers would like more flexibility \nin their jobs. Almost half of them, however, worry that asking for such \nflexibility will jeopardize their careers.\n  The Working Families Flexibility Act I am introducing today will give \nemployees the ability to ask for flexible arrangements without fear. \nFlexible scheduling will enable working parents to coordinate child \ncare more effectively and spend more time with their children. It can \neven help workers be better parents. Studies show that parents with \ngreater control over their schedules spend more time with their \nchildren.\n  For employees with long commutes, telecommuting reduces stress and \ntime wasted time wasted on the road. Many workers say they are just as \nproductive at home, and sometimes even more so.\n  Flexibility also lets more people stay in the workforce who otherwise \ncould not. Often coming into the office for a traditional 8 hour day, \nfive days a week isn't possible for elderly workers or persons with \ndisabilities. With flexible scheduling and telecommuting, these workers \ncan continue on the job.\n  Flexibility is also good for business. Persons with flexible work \narrangements are more reliable employees. In a recent survey, two- \nthirds of workers with flexible schedules missed less work because of \nsuch arrangements.\n  They are also happier employees. Another study showed that almost \nthree times as many workers in companies that offer flexibility felt \nsatisfied with their jobs, compared to workers without such options. \nCompanies that offer flexibility also discover that it helps them \nattract and retain better employees.\n  The Working Families Flexibility Act brings workers and employers \ntogether to find creative ways to provide such flexibilities. Our \nlegislation allows those who know their jobs best--the ones actually \ndoing the work--to suggest changes as to when and where they do their \nwork. It creates a process for workers and employers to come up with \nsolutions that best fit their particular circumstances.\n  We know that laws like this will benefit both employers and \nemployees. Great Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands, have adopted \nsimilar laws with great success. 90 percent of British workers now have \nflexible work options, compare to only about a quarter of American \nworkers. Last year 91 percent of British employers who had employee \nrequests for flexibility were able to grant them. It is making the \nworkers more satisfied with their jobs. Those who took advantage of \nflexibility were 50 percent more satisfied with their work arrangements \nthan workers who did not.\n  We all fill many roles in our lives. We are workers, parents, sons \nand daughters, and members of our communities. We struggle to do well \nin each responsibility. But when the demands of work overshadow the \nrest of our lives, our lives feel out of balance. This legislation \ngives millions of American workers the opportunity to restore that \nbalance--to be good employees and responsible citizens and family \nmembers, too. They deserve no less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 2421. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax benefits to individuals who have been wrongfully incarcerated; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today, I want to say a few words about \nthe bill I am introducing, the Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act of \n2007. My bill would provide much-needed assistance to individuals who \nhave been wrongfully convicted of a crime and subsequently exonerated \nby clarifiying that State compensation awards are tax-free; and stating \nthat exonerees shall have their first $50,000 of earnings free of \nfederal income and payroll taxes for each year that they were \nwrongfully imprisoned. The second benefit would only apply to those who \nhave never been convicted of a felony for which they were not \nexonerated. If they had a conviction prior to their wrongful \nconviction, they would not be eligible. If they are subsequently \nconvicted, they would lose their eligibility as well.\n  I want to thank Senator Brownback for offering to be the lead \nRepublican cosponsor of my bill. He and I have worked together on a \nnumber of issues now, and I appreciate his willingness to support this \nlegislation.\n  As my colleagues are surely aware, whatever their political leanings \nmay be, this bill addresses an incredibly timely and important issue. \nJust 2 days ago, a Federal prosecutor in Jacksonville, Florida \ndismissed a murder case against a Florida man, based on DNA evidence, \nexonerating him in a 1994 murder. According to the Innocence Project, \nthis man represents the 209th person nationwide exonerated by DNA \ntesting.\n  More and more innocent people are regaining their freedom through \npost-conviction DNA testing. No matter what your view may be of the \ndeath penalty; no matter what your view may be of mandatory sentencing \nlaws; no matter how ``tough on crime'' you want to be--surely everyone \nwould agree that when innocent people spend time in prison for crimes \nthat they did not commit, something of value has been taken from them.\n  In this country, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Yet for those \nwrongfully convicted of a crime, our legal system has failed them. Some \nof the common causes of wrongful convictions include eyewitness \nmisidentification, unreliable or limited evidence tests, and false \ninformation presented by informants. Even more sobering, more than a \nquarter of all prisoners exonerated by DNA evidence had falsely \nconfessed or made incriminating statements, simply to end hours of \naggressive interrogation.\n  Thankfully, advocacy groups such as the Innocence Project and the \nJustice Project have taken on the challenge of addressing what can only \nbe described as a systemic problem. The Innocence Project at the \nCardozo School of Law in New York City has been a tireless leader in \noverturning wrongful convictions, and has led the charge in using DNA \nevidence to prove, once and for all, a person's innocence. With new \nimprovements in DNA testing and technology, we can now positively \nidentify or rule out suspects based on DNA evidence left at the scene \nof a crime. In most wrongful conviction cases, new testing of DNA \nevidence taken from the crime scene years before points to another \nperpetrator.\n  Once released, exonerees face huge and sometimes insurmountable \nchallenges. Multiple studies have shown that upon release, these \nindividuals often have difficulty reentering society. They have lost \nthe prime years of their life, serving time in prison for crimes they \ndid not commit. The vast majority of exonerated individuals entered \nprison in their teens or 20s, and they stayed there while some of their \npeers on the outside settled on careers, married, started families, \nbought homes, and began saving for retirement. They have emerged from \nprison many years behind, and it is difficult to catch up. Think about \nhow much the economy has changed in just the last 10 years, and think \nabout how difficult it would be to adjust if you had spent that time \nbehind bars.\n  Shockingly, despite being imprisoned for an average of 12 years, \nexonerees typically leave prison with less help pre-release counseling, \njob training, substance-abuse treatment, housing assistance and other \nservices than some states offer to paroled prisoners. Even the basic \ntasks that seem so unremarkable to you and I, like going to the grocery \nstore, paying bills, and getting to and from work, are huge tasks for \nsomeone who has spent so much time in prison. In fact, in some cases, \npeople have lost jobs once their employers find out about their past\n\n[[Page S14851]]\n\nconviction, despite the fact that they have been exonerated of the \ncrime. I know that sounds unbelievable, but it's true. You didn't \ncommit the crime, it is proven that you didn't commit the crime, but \nyou still lose your job. Imagine for just a moment if this happened to \none of your friends or family members. You would be outraged. The \nunfairness is heartbreaking.\n  Certainly we can all agree that these individuals deserve and need \nsupport after their release, and lawmakers on both the state and \nfederal level have begun to address the question of compensation for \nwrongfully convicted individuals. In 2004, Congress passed the Justice \nfor All Act, which I am proud to have cosponsored. This bill, among \nother things, raised the cap for potential federal compensation awards \nfor wrongful convictions to $100,000. Although the federal compensation \nhas not been claimed, this landmark piece of legislation set a \nprecedent for state compensation laws. As of now, 22 States have \nfollowed suit and passed compensation laws as well. But the system is a \npatchwork. Some States, such as Maine and New York, provide exonerees \nwith a lump sum as the court sees fit, and cap these awards at specific \nlevels. Other States, such as California and Texas, give compensation \nbased on time spent in jail. Only a few States, such as Louisiana, \noffer compensation to cover costs such as vocational training, medical \nbills and counseling, to aid re-entry.\n  We can and should do more. Of all people known by the Innocence \nProject to have been exonerated through DNA evidence as of August 2007, \nat least 79--nearly 40 percent--didn't receive a dime to compensate \nthem for their years in prison. Even when someone is awarded \ncompensation, they can wait in limbo for years. More than half of those \nwho did receive compensation waited two years or longer after \nexoneration for the first payment, forcing them to rely on family, \nfriends, lawyers, and even strangers for shelter, clothing, food and \nemotional support immediately after their release.\n  The Federal Government cannot and should not offer cash compensation \nfor those who have been wrongfully convicted by state courts, but we do \nhave the power to address how compensation awards are taxed, and how \nthese individuals are taxed once they try to rebuild their lives. We \ncan help even the playing field across all States by changing the law \nto ensure that there are some benefits that will be consistent across \nall 50 States. My bill changes the law in a number of ways to ensure \nthat there are some benefits available to everyone, regardless of which \nState they call home.\n  The first change in my bill is more of a clarification than a new tax \nbenefit. If an exoneree does receive a state compensation award, the \nFederal tax laws are unclear as to whether these awards are taxable. \nAccording to the Innocence Project, the Internal Revenue Service has \nnot yet made any attempts to tax these awards, but the concern remains \nthat the IRS could make such a claim in the future. My bill \nspecifically clarifies that any civil damages, restitution, or other \nmonetary awards related to the wrongful imprisonment are excluded from \ntaxable income.\n  The second change in my bill will help provide much-needed economic \nassistance to exonerees that are trying to rebuild their lives, but \nfinding it hard to make ends meet. My bill says that, for every year \nthat someone was wrongfully imprisoned and then exonerated, up to 15 \nyears, the first $50,000 they earn each year after their release will \nbe free of Federal income and payroll taxes. For married couples filing \njointly, the tax-free amount would be $75,000 per year. Again, the \nbenefit would only apply to those who have never been convicted of a \nfelony. If they had a conviction prior to their wrongful conviction, \nthey would not be eligible. If they are subsequently convicted, they \nwould lose their eligibility as well.\n  In terms of real dollars, let us take the example of someone earning \n$20,000 post-imprisonment. In a typical tax filing scenario, my bill \nwill save them nearly $2,800 in income and payroll taxes. This is a \nreal benefit that can make wages go just that much farther--it can pay \nfor a few months' rent, or a community college course, or any number of \nthings that can help this victim return to a productive life.\n  As my colleagues know, I feel very strongly about justice and \nfairness. I am not one to shy away from making tough decisions to \nstrengthen our laws, but I also believe that when someone has been \ntreated unfairly by the law, it is our responsibility to provide some \nhelp. I sincerely believe that people who have been wrongfully \nconvicted of a crime have had parts of their lives taken from them, \nplain and simple.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on the issue \nof fair compensation for wrongful convictions. I stand ready to work \nwith Senator Brownback and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nincluding the chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, to \nget this bill enacted next year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2423. A bill to facilitate price transparency in markets for the \nsale of emission allowances, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce ``The \nEmission Allowance Market Transparency Act.''\n  This legislation would establish necessary market oversight \nauthorities to prevent Enron-type fraud and manipulation in the new \ngreenhouse gas credit markets that are expected to emerge once Congress \napproves comprehensive climate change legislation.\n  The goal is simple: To prevent the same type of fraud and \nmanipulation that occurred during the Western Energy Crisis from \nhappening if a new greenhouse market is established.\n  The bill would establish transparency and anti-manipulation \nprovisions modeled after energy markets protections that were \nestablished by the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  Additionally, the legislation includes anti-fraud provisions and \nlimits excessive speculation. The bill would establish strong financial \npenalties. Each offense would result in a fine of up to $1 million and \n10 years in jail.\n  Simply put, this legislation is a necessary and critical part of any \nnew carbon trading markets approved by Congress.\n  Specifically, the legislation would require the Environmental \nProtection Agency to create a regulatory structure to oversee the new \ncarbon credit markets.\n  This system would be parallel to the system used by the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Committee FERC for the electricity and natural gas \nmarkets.\n  The EPA would publish market price data in order to increase \ntransparency; monitor trading for manipulation and fraud; and limit the \nsize of speculative holdings to prevent any single trader from being \nable to set the price.\n  The bill would also prohibit traders from: reporting false \ninformation; manipulating the market; and cheating or defrauding \nanother market participant.\n  Any trader who violated this Act would pay a maximum $1 million fine \nand spend 10 years in jail for each offense.\n  We believe that this will strongly discourage traders from seeking to \nmanipulate the market.\n  This legislation is the key part of an effort to prevent newly \nemerging greenhouse gas markets from evolving without rules or \nregulation. These markets are coming, and we need to have the law in \nplace to receive them.\n  California has passed legislation and will soon establish a cap and \ntrade system to control carbon dioxide emissions.\n  Many members of the U.S. Senate support legislation, such as the \nElectric Utility Cap and Trade Act that I have introduced, to establish \na Federal cap and trade system.\n  Legislation sponsored by Senators Warner and Lieberman to establish a \nnational, economy-wide greenhouse gas cap and trade system will be \nmarked up in the Environment and Public Works Committee this week.\n  If we don't set up a framework for oversight, the greenhouse gas \nmarket could turn into a wild west. The market--estimated to be worth \nas much as $300 billion annually--would invite the worst kind of \nmanipulation, fraud, and abuse. The resulting volatility would affect \nconsumer energy costs.\n  This is not a hypothetical. In 2000 and 2001, newly created \nCalifornia energy markets lacked the basic protections in this bill. \nThe electricity and related natural gas markets emerged\n\n[[Page S14852]]\n\nbefore the law caught up, and much of the manipulation that resulted, \nshockingly, was legal.\n  Enron, for instance, ran a market where only they knew the prices. \nWithout market transparency laws, this one-sided market was legal.\n  Enron manipulated natural gas and electricity prices--but nothing in \nthe Natural Gas Act or the Federal Power Act made this manipulation \nunlawful.\n  Only years later, after millions of consumers had been harmed, after \nbillions of dollars had been lost, and after the entire west had \nendured an energy crisis largely fabricated by traders, did Congress \nact.\n  We were able to increase market transparency and prohibiting \nmanipulation in natural gas and electricity markets were adopted.\n  The provisions finally gave a sheriff the ability to impose oversight \nand record-keeping.\n  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has put its new authority \nto good use. It has performed aggressive natural gas market oversight.\n  This summer it brought its first manipulation case, against \nAmaranth--a notorious hedge fund that allegedly manipulated natural gas \nprices month after month.\n  The Emission Allowance Market Transparency Act would establish \ntransparency and anti-manipulation provisions mirroring the provisions \nfrom the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  Markets would be transparent, and manipulation would be illegal.\n  In addition, this legislation adds anti-fraud provisions and limits \nexcessive speculation. These additional market protections are \nlongstanding principles of the Commodity Exchange Act.\n  By mirroring proven market oversight mechanisms that protect market \nparticipants and consumers, this legislation would slip already broken-\nin regulatory concepts onto a new market.\n  This Nation needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and many \neconomists believe that a cap and trade system with a greenhouse gas \nmarket would be the most cost efficient way to guarantee emissions \nreductions.\n  The economists also tell us that markets are most efficient when \nbuyers and sellers have complete information, no market participant can \ncheat another, and prices result from supply and demand, not \nmanipulation.\n  That is why we need to prevent manipulation, fraud, and a lack of \ntransparency.\n  So this legislation would provide buyers and sellers with complete \ninformation; and prevent manipulation, fraud, and excessive \nspeculation.\n  Bottom line: this legislation is vital to protecting the market \nintegrity of greenhouse gas emissions markets, and it should be \nincluded as part of any cap and trade legislation approved by Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2423\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Emission Allowance Market \n     Transparency Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. EMISSION ALLOWANCE MARKET TRANSPARENCY.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to facilitate \n     price transparency in markets for the sale of emission \n     allowances (including markets for real-time, forward, \n     futures, and options) to the maximum extent practicable, \n     taking into consideration--\n       (1) the public interest;\n       (2) the integrity of those markets;\n       (3) fair competition; and\n       (4) protection of consumers.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n       (2) Emission allowance.--The term ``emission allowance'' \n     means any allowance, credit, or other permit issued pursuant \n     to any Federal law (including regulations) to any individual \n     or entity for use in offsetting the emissions of any \n     pollutant (including any greenhouse gas) by the individual or \n     entity.\n       (c) Duties of Administrator.--\n       (1) Regulations.--The Administrator shall promulgate such \n     regulations as the Administrator determines to be necessary \n     to achieve the purpose of this section, including regulations \n     that provide for the dissemination, on a timely basis, of \n     information regarding the availability and prices of emission \n     allowances with respect to--\n       (A) the Administrator;\n       (B) State regulatory authorities;\n       (C) buyers and sellers of the emission allowances; and\n       (D) the public.\n       (2) Obtaining information.\n       (A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the \n     Administrator may--\n       (i) obtain the information described in paragraph (1) \n     directly from any emission allowance market participant; or\n       (ii) enter into an agreement under which another entity \n     obtains and makes public that information.\n       (B) Limitation.--Any activity carried out by the \n     Administrator or another entity to obtain information \n     pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be subject to applicable \n     rules designed to prevent the disclosure of information the \n     disclosure of which would be detrimental to the operation of \n     an effective emission allowance market, as determined by the \n     Administrator.\n       (3) Use of existing price publishers and service \n     providers.--In carrying out this subsection, the \n     Administrator shall--\n       (A) take into consideration the degree of relevant price \n     transparency provided by price publishers and providers of \n     trade processing services in operation on the date of \n     enactment of this Act; and\n       (B) use information and services provided by those \n     publishers and providers to the maximum extent practicable.\n       (d) Actions by Individuals and Entities.--\n       (1) Prohibitions.--It shall be unlawful for any individual \n     or entity--\n       (A) to knowingly provide to the Administrator (or another \n     entity acting pursuant to an agreement described in \n     subsection (c)(2)(A)(ii)) any false information relating to \n     the price or quantity of emission allowances sold, purchased, \n     transferred, banked, or borrowed by the individual or entity, \n     with the intent to fraudulently affect the data being \n     compiled by the Administrator or other entity;\n       (B) directly or indirectly, to use in connection with the \n     purchase or sale of an emission allowance any manipulative or \n     deceptive device or contrivance (within the meaning of \n     section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 \n     U.S.C. 78j(b))), in contravention of such rules and \n     regulations as the Administrator may prescribe to protect the \n     public interest or consumers; or\n       (C) to cheat or defraud, or attempt to cheat or defraud, \n     another market participant, client, or customer.\n       (2) Monitoring.--The Administrator shall monitor trading to \n     prevent false reporting, manipulation, and fraud under this \n     section.\n       (3) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection \n     creates any private right of action.\n       (e) Excessive Speculation.--\n       (1) Finding.--Congress finds that excessive speculation \n     relating to emission allowances--\n       (A) can cause sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or \n     unwarranted changes in the price of emission allowances; and\n       (B) imposes an unnecessary burden on--\n       (i) the development of a well-functioning emission \n     allowance market;\n       (ii) the planning decisions of businesses and industry; and\n       (iii) consumers.\n       (2) Prevention of burdens.--\n       (A) In general.--To prevent, decrease, or eliminate the \n     burdens associated with excessive speculation relating to \n     emission allowances, the Administrator, in accordance with \n     subparagraph (B) and after providing notice and an \n     opportunity for public comment, shall adopt position \n     limitations or position accountability for speculators as the \n     Administrator determines to be necessary on--\n       (i) the quantity of trading transactions allowed to be \n     conducted, and the positions eligible to be held, by any \n     individual or entity in any emission allowance market;

A bill to promote accessibility, accountability, and \nopenness in Government by strengthening section 552 of title 5, United \nStates Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I have joined with Senator Cornyn to \nreintroduce the ``Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National \nGovernment Act--or the OPEN Government Act--the first major reform to \nthe Freedom of Information Act, FOIA, in more than a decade. The Senate \npassed this historic FOIA reform legislation, S. 849, before adjourning \nfor the August recess. But, sadly, this measure has been stalled in the \nHouse Oversight and Government Reform Committee for several months, \npreventing these long-overdue FOIA reforms from being enacted into law.\n  Despite the unfortunate delay of this bill, I remain deeply committed \nto enacting FOIA reform legislation this year. Because time is of the \nessence, I am requesting that this legislation be immediately placed on \nthe Senate Calendar and that the Senate promptly take up and pass this \nbill by unanimous consent, so that it can be sent to the House.\n  The version of the bill introduced today includes ``pay/go'' language \nthat has been requested by the House and eliminates the provision on \ncitations to FOIA exemptions. After needlessly delaying the enactment \nof this bill for several months, I hope that the House Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee will promptly take up this important \nmeasure, so that the House can enact this legislation and send it to \nthe President before the end of the year.\n  As the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade, the OPEN \nGovernment Act will help to reverse the troubling trends of excessive \ndelays and lax FOIA compliance in our government and help to restore \nthe public's trust in their government. This bill will also improve \ntransparency in the Federal Government's FOIA process by: restoring \nmeaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA; imposing real \nconsequences on federal agencies for missing FOIA's 20-day statutory \ndeadline; clarifying that FOIA applies to Government records held by \noutside private contractors; establishing a FOIA hotline service for \nall Federal agencies; and creating a FOIA Ombudsman to provide FOIA \nrequesters and Federal agencies with a meaningful alternative to costly \nlitigation.\n  Specifically, the OPEN Government Act will protect the public's right \nto know, by ensuring that anyone who gathers information to inform the \npublic, including freelance journalists and bloggers, may seek a fee \nwaiver when they request information under FOIA. The bill ensures that \nFederal agencies will not automatically exclude Internet blogs and \nother Web-based forms of media when deciding whether to waive FOIA \nfees. In addition, the bill also clarifies that the definition of news \nmedia, for purposes of FOIA fee waivers, includes free newspapers and \nindividuals performing a media function who do not necessarily have a \nprior history of publication.\n  The bill also restores meaningful deadlines for agency action, by \nensuring that the 20-day statutory clock under FOIA starts when a \nrequest is received by the appropriate component of the agency and \nrequiring that agency FOIA offices get FOIA requests to the appropriate \nagency component within 10 days of the receipt of such requests. The \nbill allows Federal agencies to toll the 20-day clock while they are \nawaiting a response to a reasonable request for information from a FOIA \nrequester on one occasion, or while the agency is awaiting \nclarification regarding a FOIA fee assessment. In addition, to \nencourage agencies to meet the 20-day time limit, the bill requires \nthat an agency refund FOIA search fees if it fails to meet the 20-day \ndeadline, except in the case of exceptional circumstances as defined by \nthe FOIA statute. To address pay/go concerns, the bill requires that \nthese refunds come from annual agency appropriations.\n  The bill also addresses a relatively new concern that, under current \nlaw, Federal agencies have an incentive to delay compliance with FOIA \nrequests until just before a court decision is made that is favorable \nto a FOIA requester. The Supreme Court's decision in Buckhannon Board \nand Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dep't of Health and Human \nResources, 532 U.S. 598, 2001, eliminated the ``catalyst theory'' for \nattorneys' fees recovery under certain Federal civil rights laws. When \napplied to FOIA cases, Buckhannon precludes FOIA requesters from ever \nbeing eligible to recover attorneys' fees under circumstances where an \nagency provides the records requested in the litigation just prior to a \ncourt decision that would have been favorable to the FOIA requestor. \nThe bill clarifies that Buckhannon does not apply to FOIA cases. Under \nthe bill, a FOIA requester can obtain attorneys' fees when he or she \nfiles a lawsuit to obtain records from the Government and the \nGovernment releases those records before the court orders them to do \nso. But this provision would not allow the requester to recover \nattorneys' fees if the requester's claim is wholly insubstantial. To \naddress pay/go concerns, the bill also requires that any attorneys' \nfees assessed under this provision be paid from annually appropriated \nagency funds.\n  To address concerns about the growing costs of FOIA litigation, the \nbill also creates an Office of Government Information Services in the \nNational Archives and creates an ombudsman to mediate agency-level FOIA \ndisputes. In addition the bill ensures that each Federal agency will \nappoint a Chief FOIA Officer, who will monitor the agency's compliance \nwith FOIA requests, and a FOIA Public Liaison who will be available to \nresolve FOIA-related disputes.\n  Finally, the bill does several things to enhance the agency reporting \nand tracking requirements under FOIA. Tracking numbers are not required \nfor FOIA requests that are anticipated to take 10 days or less to \nprocess. The bill creates a tracking system for FOIA requests to assist \nmembers of the public and the media. The bill also establishes a FOIA \nhotline service for all federal agencies, either by telephone or on the \nInternet, to enable requestors to track the status of their FOIA \nrequests. The bill also clarifies that FOIA applies to agency records \nthat are held by outside private contractors, no matter where these \nrecords are located.\n  The Freedom of Information Act is critical to ensuring that all \nAmerican citizens can access information about the workings of their \ngovernment. But, after four decades, this open government law needs to \nbe strengthened. I am pleased that the reforms contained in the OPEN \nGovernment Act will ensure that FOIA is reinvigorated so that it works \nmore effectively for the American people.\n  I commend the bill's chief Republican cosponsor, Senator John Cornyn, \nfor his commitment and dedication to passing FOIA reform legislation \nthis year. I also thank the many cosponsors of this legislation for \ntheir dedication to open government and I thank the Majority Leader for \nhis strong support of this legislation. I am also appreciative of the \nefforts of Senator Kyl in helping us to reach a compromise on this \nlegislation, so that the Senate could consider and pass meaningful FOIA \nreform legislation.\n  But, most importantly, I especially want to thank the many concerned \ncitizens who, knowing the importance of this measure to the American \npeople's right to know, have demanded action on this bill. This bill is \nendorsed by more than 115 business, public interest, and news \norganizations from across the political and ideological spectrum, \nincluding the American Library Association, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, OpenTheGovernment.org, Public Citizen, the Republican Liberty \nCaucus, the Sunshine in Government Initiative and the Vermont Press \nAssociation. The invaluable support of these and many other \norganizations is what led the opponents of this bill to come around and \nsupport this legislation.\n  I hope that by once again passing this important FOIA reform \nlegislation, the Senate will reaffirm the principle that open \ngovernment is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. But, \nrather, it is an American issue and an American value. I encourage all \nof my Senate colleagues, on\n\n[[Page S14854]]\n\nboth sides of the aisle, to unanimously pass this historic bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Openness Promotes \n     Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007'' or the \n     ``OPEN Government Act of 2007''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Freedom of Information Act was signed into law on \n     July 4, 1966, because the American people believe that--\n       (A) our constitutional democracy, our system of self-\n     government, and our commitment to popular sovereignty depends \n     upon the consent of the governed;\n       (B) such consent is not meaningful unless it is informed \n     consent; and\n       (C) as Justice Black noted in his concurring opinion in \n     Barr v. Matteo (360 U.S. 564 (1959)), ``The effective \n     functioning of a free government like ours depends largely on \n     the force of an informed public opinion. This calls for the \n     widest possible understanding of the quality of government \n     service rendered by all elective or appointed public \n     officials or employees.'';\n       (2) the American people firmly believe that our system of \n     government must itself be governed by a presumption of \n     openness;\n       (3) the Freedom of Information Act establishes a ``strong \n     presumption in favor of disclosure'' as noted by the United \n     States Supreme Court in United States Department of State v. \n     Ray (502 U.S. 164 (1991)), a presumption that applies to all \n     agencies governed by that Act;\n       (4) ``disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of \n     the Act,'' as noted by the United States Supreme Court in \n     Department of Air Force v. Rose (425 U.S. 352 (1976));\n       (5) in practice, the Freedom of Information Act has not \n     always lived up to the ideals of that Act; and\n       (6) Congress should regularly review section 552 of title \n     5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of \n     Information Act), in order to determine whether further \n     changes and improvements are necessary to ensure that the \n     Government remains open and accessible to the American people \n     and is always based not upon the ``need to know'' but upon \n     the fundamental ``right to know''.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF FEE STATUS FOR NEWS MEDIA.\n\n       Section 552(a)(4)(A)(ii) of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``The term `a representative of the news media' means any \n     person or entity that gathers information of potential \n     interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial \n     skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and \n     distributes that work to an audience. The term `news' means \n     information that is about current events or that would be of \n     current interest to the public. Examples of news-media \n     entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the \n     public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if \n     such entities qualify as disseminators of `news') who make \n     their products available for purchase by or subscription by \n     or free distribution to the general public. These examples \n     are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery \n     evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic \n     dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications \n     services), such alternative media shall be considered to be \n     news-media entities. A freelance journalist shall be regarded \n     as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can \n     demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through \n     that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually \n     employed by the entity. A publication contract would present \n     a solid basis for such an expectation; the Government may \n     also consider the past publication record of the requester in \n     making such a determination.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. RECOVERY OF ATTORNEY FEES AND LITIGATION COSTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 552(a)(4)(E) of title 5, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(E)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(ii) For purposes of this section, a complainant has \n     substantially prevailed if the complainant has obtained \n     relief through either--\n       ``(I) a judicial order, or an enforceable written agreement \n     or consent decree; or\n       ``(II) a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the \n     agency, provided that the complainant's claim is not \n     insubstantial.''.\n       (b) Limitation.--Notwithstanding section 1304 of title 31, \n     United States Code, no amounts may be obligated or expended \n     from the Claims and Judgment Fund of the United States \n     Treasury to pay the costs resulting from fees assessed under \n     section 552(a)(4)(E) of title 5, United States Code. Any such \n     amounts shall be paid only from funds annually appropriated \n     for the Federal agency against which a claim or judgment has \n     been rendered.\n\n     SEC. 5. DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS FOR ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS \n                   REJECTIONS OF REQUESTS.\n\n       Section 552(a)(4)(F) of title 5, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(i)'' after ``(F)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(ii) The Attorney General shall--\n       ``(I) notify the Special Counsel of each civil action \n     described under the first sentence of clause (i); and\n       ``(II) annually submit a report to Congress on the number \n     of such civil actions in the preceding year.\n       ``(iii) The Special Counsel shall annually submit a report \n     to Congress on the actions taken by the Special Counsel under \n     clause (i).''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 552(e)(1) of title 5, United \n     States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (B)(ii), by inserting after the first \n     comma ``the number of occasions on which each statute was \n     relied upon,'';\n       (2) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ``and average'' after \n     ``median'';\n       (3) in subparagraph (E), by inserting before the semicolon \n     ``, based on the date on which the requests were received by \n     the agency'';\n       (4) by redesignating subparagraphs (F) and (G) as \n     subparagraphs (N) and (O), respectively; and\n       (5) by inserting after subparagraph (E) the following:\n       ``(F) the average number of days for the agency to respond \n     to a request beginning on the date on which the request was \n     received by the agency, the median number of days for the \n     agency to respond to such requests, and the range in number \n     of days for the agency to respond to such requests;\n       ``(G) based on the number of business days that have \n     elapsed since each request was originally received by the \n     agency--\n\n[[Page S14855]]\n\n       ``(i) the number of requests for records to which the \n     agency has responded with a determination within a period up \n     to and including 20 days, and in 20-day increments up to and \n     including 200 days;\n       ``(ii) the number of requests for records to which the \n     agency has responded with a determination within a period \n     greater than 200 days and less than 301 days;\n       ``(iii) the number of requests for records to which the \n     agency has responded with a determination within a period \n     greater than 300 days and less than 401 days; and\n       ``(iv) the number of requests for records to which the \n     agency has responded with a determination within a period \n     greater than 400 days;\n       ``(H) the average number of days for the agency to provide \n     the granted information beginning on the date on which the \n     request was originally filed, the median number of days for \n     the agency to provide the granted information, and the range \n     in number of days for the agency to provide the granted \n     information;\n       ``(I) the median and average number of days for the agency \n     to respond to administrative appeals based on the date on \n     which the appeals originally were received by the agency, the \n     highest number of business days taken by the agency to \n     respond to an administrative appeal, and the lowest number of \n     business days taken by the agency to respond to an \n     administrative appeal;\n       ``(J) data on the 10 active requests with the earliest \n     filing dates pending at each agency, including the amount of \n     time that has elapsed since each request was originally \n     received by the agency;\n       ``(K) data on the 10 active administrative appeals with the \n     earliest filing dates pending before the agency as of \n     September 30 of the preceding year, including the number of \n     business days that have elapsed since the requests were \n     originally received by the agency;\n       ``(L) the number of expedited review requests that are \n     granted and denied, the average and median number of days for \n     adjudicating expedited review requests, and the number \n     adjudicated within the required 10 days;\n       ``(M) the number of fee waiver requests that are granted \n     and denied, and the average and median number of days for \n     adjudicating fee waiver determinations;''.\n       (b) Applicability to Agency and Each Principal Component of \n     the Agency.--Section 552(e) of title 5, United States Code, \n     is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (2) through (5) as \n     paragraphs (3) through (6), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:\n       ``(2) Information in each report submitted under paragraph \n     (1) shall be expressed in terms of each principal component \n     of the agency and for the agency overall.''.\n       (c) Public Availability of Data.--Section 552(e)(3) of \n     title 5, United States Code, (as redesignated by subsection \n     (b) of this section) is amended by adding after the period \n     ``In addition, each agency shall make the raw statistical \n     data used in its reports available electronically to the \n     public upon request.''.\n\n     SEC. 9.

A bill to address emergency shortages in food banks; to the \nCommittee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, across Ohio and the Nation, many families \nrely on food banks to survive. I rise to introduce an emergency \nassistance measure--$40 million in bridge funding for the Emergency \nFood Assistance Program.\n  When a child knows there will be no dinner waiting for her at home, \nthat is an emergency. When a mother or father cannot put food on the \ntable for a family, that is an emergency. When an elderly couple eats \none small meal a day, that is an emergency. Across the country, lines \nat food banks are already longer than they were at this time last year. \nThat is an emergency. It is a health emergency. It is a humanitarian \nemergency.\n  In Ohio, food reserves intended to last until July are projected to \nrun out by February. Food banks are being forced to ration food and \nturn hungry people away already, in a particularly bad time of year. In \nLorain County, in north central and northern Ohio, the food bank has \nrun out of food three times this winter. Remember, it is only early \nDecember. Many of us, especially in this Chamber, who are so very \nblessed, celebrate the holidays by buying presents for our loved ones. \nFor too many families in Ohio and in other States across this country, \nfood on the\n\n[[Page S14856]]\n\ntable will be the greatest gift they can give this holiday season.\n  In Cleveland, one of the food distribution centers is Cooley Avenue \nChurch of God. There, Pastor Richard Bolls hands out food to an elderly \nman, Norm. Of the food bank, Norm says:\n\n       At the end of the month I have just $19 left after paying \n     for my rent, my utilities, and my medicine. Normally I \n     wouldn't get fruit and vegetables to eat. I consider this my \n     ice cream.\n\n  It was 28 degrees and windy in Cleveland on Tuesday, colder today. At \n11 o'clock in the morning, Christian, a native of the Mount Pleasant \narea of Cleveland, and her newborn stood in line for food at the \nCleveland Food Bank, recognized as the No. 1 food bank in the country \nrecently. Christian is a trained nurse's assistant. She has been \nsearching for a job for 6 months since she had her baby, without luck. \nShe notices the price of food she buys at the supermarket seems to rise \nevery day. with the cost of caring for a newborn and the rise in food \nand fuel prices--heating and gasoline--Christian stood in line at the \nfood bank Tuesday because she cannot afford to feed her family without \nsome additional help.\n  Christian and Norm have heartbreaking stories, but their stories are \nnot unique. More Americans are lining up at food banks this year. Most \nare working Ohioans and working people. Many are middle-class \nAmericans, teetering on the edge. Additional funding for the emergency \nfood stamp program is the most immediate Federal solution to the \nnational food crisis.\n  This food bank crisis underscores the need to pass the farm bill. The \nfarm bill is an agriculture bill, it is a hunger bill, it is an energy \nbill, it is a conservation bill. I applaud Chairman Tom Harkin, the \nSenator from Iowa, for his leadership on this bill. This farm bill \nhelps family farmers in Ohio and across the country by strengthening \nthe farm safety net. For the first time ever, farmers will be able to \nenroll in a program that ensures against revenue instability, which for \nmany farmers means either a bad yield or low prices. But either can be \ndevastating.\n  With the right resources and the right incentives, farmers can help \ndecrease our dependence on foreign oil and produce clean, sustainable, \nrenewable energy.\n  This bill, the farm bill which we hope to pass before we leave this \nmonth, increases food stamp benefits and indexes the benefits to \ninflation. When the purchasing power of food stamps erodes, so does our \nprogress against hunger. Food stamps today amount to about $1 per \nperson per meal. A mother with two children gets about $9 in food \nstamps. That is the extent of the benefit.

Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk concerning \nthe upcoming elections in the Republic of Georgia.\n  I am pleased that Senators Biden and Dodd have agreed to cosponsor \nthis legislation. Our goal is to express our strong hopes that the \nRepublic of Georgia will return to the democratic path and embrace a \nfree and fair election process. The United States was founded on the \nprinciples of personal rights and liberties, and we must champion a \nrespect for democracy and human rights. This must include U.S. efforts \nto expand initiatives that promote freedom of the press and freedom of \nthe media worldwide, which I believe underpin a nation's ability to \nrespect human rights and practice democratic governance.\n\n[[Page S14857]]\n\n  The international community has monitored closely developments over \nthe last several weeks and months in the Republic of Georgia. I have \nvisited Georgia on several occasions and consider myself a strong \nfriend of the Georgian people.\n  In 2003 the population of Georgia rose up to overthrow their \ngovernment. The Rose Revolution, as it was called, was truly an \ninspirational moment for supporters of democracy and freedom around the \nworld. President Bush has rightly called Georgia and the government of \nPresident Saakashvilli ``a beacon for democracy.''\n  The Georgian President and a strong cabinet of reform-minded leaders \nhave implemented an aggressive reform agenda with the goal of joining \nthe European Union and the NATO Alliance. This independent course was a \nbrave effort to emerge from the authoritarian shadows of the Soviet \nUnion and reduce its dependency on Russia.\n  In addition to political reforms, Georgia has enjoyed remarkable \neconomic progress. This year the country's economy is estimated to grow \nat a rate of 9 percent and continues to be an international leader in \nits economic reform efforts.\n  Unfortunately, this impressive record has been threatened by recent \nevents that could undermine the progress that has been achieved in \nGeorgia. I was dismayed to learn of the imposition of emergency rule \nand the government's action to assert control over private media \ncompanies. While the threats to Georgia are clear and extremely \ndangerous, the suspension of basic freedoms was a significant step \nbackward on Tbilisi' s path toward a market oriented, democratic \ncountry. It is important that the United States express our concerns \nabout activities that may undermine the strong record that has been \nbuilt by Georgia.\n  I was relieved to learn that emergency rule was ended on November 17 \nand that restrictions on private media will be lifted this week. I \napplaud the efforts by the Department of State to send a strong, clear \nand unequivocal message to the government in Tbilisi.\n  The Republic of Georgia must return to the path of democracy. \nPresident Saakashvili has an opportunity to take important steps in \nthis direction by ensuring that all political parties have equal \nopportunity and access to media coverage and that the election process \nis free and fair. I recommend that the Government of Georgia reject the \nstrategies of some countries, including most recently Russia, to \nfrustrate and interfere with international election monitors, \nparticularly those from the OSCE. Instead, Georgia should take \nadditional steps to ensure that the OSCE and other constructive \norganizations who want to observe the elections can participate fully \nand as quickly as possible.\n  It is my goal that this resolution will serve as encouragement to \nPresident Saakashvili and his government to embrace democracy and \nensure that the upcoming elections are the freest and fairest in \nGeorgian history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14857-1", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 392--RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF EVERGLADES \n                             NATIONAL PARK\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Martinez) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I would like to announce for the \ninformation of the Senate and the public that the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs will hold a hearing entitled, ``United Nations \nDevelopment Program Operations in North Korea.'' In April 2007, the \nUnited Nations Development Program, UNDP, took the unprecedented step \nof shutting down its operations in North Korea due to refusals by the \nNorth Korean government to allow UNDP to increase the transparency and \naccountability of its funding programs there. The Subcommittee's \nDecember 13th hearing will examine UNDP operations in North Korea, \nreviewing evidence and taking testimony on certain problems in the \nrelationship between UNDP and the North Korean government, whether the \nproblems in North Korea are localized or systemic, and whether UNDP has \nsufficient whistleblower and ethics safeguards in place. Witnesses for \nthe upcoming hearing will include representatives of the Government \nAccountability Office and the Department of State. Following the \nhearing, the Subcommittee will receive a public briefing from \nrepresentatives of the United Nations Development Program. A final \nwitness list will be available Tuesday, December 11, 2007.\n  The Subcommittee hearing is scheduled for Thursday, December 13, \n2007, at 2 p.m., in Room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For \nfurther information, please contact Elise Bean of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations at 224-9505.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2007/12/06/senate-section/article/S14998-2", "month": "12", "year": "2007", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                     Committee on Foreign Relations\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and \nremember the victims of yesterday's tragic shooting in Omaha, NE. I \nknow every one of my colleagues joins me in extending our prayers and \ndeepest sympathies to the families and friends of the victims and the \nentire Omaha community.\n  On Wednesday, December 5, 2007, the worst mass slaying in Nebraska \nhistory occurred at the Westroads Mall in Omaha, claiming the lives of \neight victims. The names of those victims are: shoppers Gary Sharf of \nLincoln, NE, and John McDonald of Council Bluffs, IA; and store \nemployees Angie Schuster, Maggie Webb, Janet Jorgensen, Diane Trent, \nGary Joy, and Beverly Flynn, all of Omaha. We must never forget these \nindividuals or the horrible tragedy which took them from us.\n  In addition, five people were wounded. Nebraska stands with each of \nthem on their road to recovery.\n  I concur with the words of Omaha Mayor Mike Fahey, who said, ``We are \na community who will grieve this loss. Omaha is a good city with \nwonderful people.''\n  At Westroads Mall, this time of year is especially lovely with \nholiday decorations and music. That peace and tranquility were forever \nshattered by this senseless act of violence. Today, many Nebraskans are \nasking, ``Why?'' but there are no answers.\n  We are shocked, grief-stricken and in complete disbelief. Things like \nthis should not happen anywhere, but headlines like these are \nunexpected in places such as Omaha. Our community has been altered \nforever--a sentiment reflected in today's headline in the state's \nlargest newspaper, which declared: ``It Happened To Us.''\n  So, now as we are celebrating what should be the most joyous season \nof the year, Nebraskans are preparing to bury our dead. And we are \npraying. We ask the nation to continue to pray with us; and on behalf \nof my fellow Nebraskans, I thank you for all the prayers and \nexpressions of sympathy we have received.\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 394\n\n       Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research, the \n     oldest and largest scientific cancer research organization in \n     the United States, was founded on May 7, 1907, at the Willard \n     Hotel in Washington, DC, by a group of physicians and \n     scientists interested in research to further the \n     investigation into and spread new knowledge about cancer;\n       Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research is \n     focused on every aspect of high-quality, innovative cancer \n     research and is the authoritative source of information and \n     publications about advances in the causes, diagnosis, \n     treatment, and prevention of cancer;\n       Whereas, since its founding, the American Association for \n     Cancer Research has accelerated the growth and dissemination \n     of new knowledge about cancer and the complexity of this \n     disease to speed translation of new discoveries for the \n     benefit of cancer patients, and has provided the information \n     needed by elected officials to make informed decisions on \n     public policy and sustained funding for cancer research;\n       Whereas partnerships with research scientists and the \n     general public, survivors and patient advocates, \n     philanthropic organizations, industry, and government have \n     led to advanced breakthroughs, early detection tools which \n     have increased survival rates, and a better quality of life \n     for cancer survivors;\n       Whereas our national investment in cancer research has \n     yielded substantial returns in terms of research advances and \n     lives saved, with a scholarly estimate that every 1 percent \n     decline in cancer mortality saves our national economy \n     $500,000,000,000;\n\n[[Page S15000]]\n\n       Whereas cancer continues to be one of the most pressing \n     public health concerns, killing 1 American every minute, and \n     12 individuals worldwide every minute;\n       Whereas the American Association for Cancer Research Annual \n     Meeting on April 14 through 18, 2007, was a large and \n     comprehensive gathering of leading cancer researchers, \n     scientists, and clinicians engaged in all aspects of clinical \n     investigations pertaining to human cancer as well as the \n     scientific disciplines of cellular, molecular, and tumor \n     biology, carcinogenesis, chemistry, developmental biology and \n     stem cells, endocrinology, epidemiology and biostatistics, \n     experimental and molecular therapeutics, immunology, \n     radiobiology and radiation oncology, imaging, prevention, and \n     survivorship research;\n       Whereas, as part of its centennial celebration, the \n     American Association for Cancer Research has published \n     ``Landmarks in Cancer Research'' citing the events or \n     discoveries after 1907 that have had a profound effect on \n     advancing our knowledge of the causes, mechanisms, diagnosis, \n     treatment, and prevention of cancer;\n       Whereas these ``Landmarks in Cancer Research'' are intended \n     as an educational, living document, an ever-changing \n     testament to human ingenuity and creativity in the scientific \n     struggle to understand and eliminate the diseases \n     collectively known as cancer;\n       Whereas, because more than 60 percent of all cancer occurs \n     in people over the age of 65, issues relating to the \n     interface of aging and cancer, ranging from the most basic \n     science questions to epidemiologic relationships and to \n     clinical and health services research issues, are of concern \n     to society;
