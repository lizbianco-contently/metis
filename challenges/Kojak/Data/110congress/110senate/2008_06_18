Mr. President, this is a proud moment for our family. I \ncommend our guest Chaplain, Father Pomerleau. For years I have called \nhim ``pere frere,'' which is French for my father brother. Father \nPomerleau is my brother-in-law. He is the brother of my wife Marcelle \nPomerleau Leahy.\n  It was in 1965 when Marcelle and I and Father Pomerleau's parents, \nPhil and Cecile Pomerleau, went to Rome for Father Pomerleau's \nordination to the priesthood. I remember the thrill of our first trip \nabroad, but it was for such a special occasion. He said mass, his first \nmass, in the catacombs in Rome, something we will never forget.\n  Father Pomerleau received his bachelor's degree from the University \nof Notre Dame. He is a Holy Cross priest. They are the ones who run \nNotre Dame. He received his masters there and got his masters in \ntheology from the Gregorian in Rome and his doctorate from the \nUniversity of Denver. He has been the rector of Saint George's in \nSantiago, Chile. He has been a professor at the University of Chile, \npresently a professor at the University of Portland, and is the \nreligious superior for the order there.\n  I can go on forever reciting the long list of his accomplishments. \nMore the way we think of him is this Sunday on Father's Day, he joined \nMarcelle and myself at our home, one of our sons, our daughter, son-in-\nlaw and daughter-in-law, and three grandchildren. We were watching the \nlittle grandchildren climbing into his lap saying: Uncle Claude, Uncle \nClaude, will you read us a story? That was part of his pastorage, too.\n  I am proud to have been able to introduce him. I thank the \ndistinguished leader for letting me have this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5707-6", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this month the Senate Democrats have tried \nto confront many problems which face families across our Nation. From \nlowering taxes and addressing high gasoline taxes to ensuring quality \nhealth care for America's seniors and providing a helping hand to \nAmerican workers who have been unemployed for more than 6 months, time \nand time again, the Senate Republicans have refused to give us an \nopportunity to address these issues. Republican obstruction has gone so \nfar in the Senate that they will not even allow the Senate to debate \nlegislation anymore, refusing to admit that these important concerns \nare worthy of Senate debate.\n  Yesterday, a new record was established in the Senate, one of dubious \nworth in the history of our Nation. But the Republicans have engaged \nnow in 77 filibusters. The record previously for any 2-year session was \n57. We still have another 6 months to go. The Republicans have now \nbroken the record for the number of filibusters.\n  What is a filibuster? It is an effort to stop a bill, to stop a \nnomination, to stop debate, to make certain that the Senate will not \nengage in even debating the issues which the American people consider \nto be most important in their lives. And the Republicans have now \nbroken the Senate record again with 77 filibusters.\n  It may not be news that they have broken the record. We knew this was \ncoming, and I am sure their goal is probably 100 or more filibusters. \nSo they will go down in history as being the most obstruction-oriented \nminority in the history of the Senate.\n  But this was a remarkable week. We will have had four filibusters in \n8 days. What an amazing record. Republicans must point to that with \npride--four filibusters in 8 days, one every 48 hours. They no longer \nseem content to stop legislation dealing with gasoline prices and \nMedicare for our seniors and trying to make sure we give unemployed \nworkers across America enough money to feed their families. That is not \nenough. Now they refuse to even allow us to proceed to the legislation \nto debate it. They are so frightened by the prospect of an open debate \nwith deliberation and amendments, they consistently vote against even \nengaging in debate.\n\n  In a little more than a week, the Republicans have blocked motions to \nproceed and debate the Consumer-First Energy Act, the Medicare \nImprovement Act, and the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act, not \nonce but twice.\n  Upon the conclusion of my remarks and the pending remarks of Senator \nMcConnell from Kentucky, the pending business before the Senate will be \nthe motion to proceed to the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act. We \ntried for the second time yesterday to bring this legislation to the \nfloor so we can have a debate.\n  What is so controversial about this bill that the Republicans would \nfilibuster it not once but twice to stop the Senate from even \nconsidering this bill? This bill passed the House of Representatives \nlast month by a vote of 263 to 160. Thirty-five House Republicans voted \nfor the measure using the Tax Code to help reduce record energy prices \nacross America.\n  What will this bill do? It extends expiring tax provisions that we \nneed to encourage the development of sustainable, environmentally \nsensible renewable energy sources--solar, biomass, geothermal, \nhydropower, and wind.\n  In my home State of Illinois and many States across the Nation, these \ntax incentives have led to the development of wind farms, generating \nelectricity without pollution, providing the energy we need for our \neconomy to grow without endangering the planet on which we live.\n  When we said it is time to renew these tax incentives, let's make \nthis part of our national effort, let's extend these tax provisions, \ncreate more incentives for the development of this energy, the \ndevelopment of new businesses, much needed American jobs, the \nRepublicans said no. Let me be fair about that. Not all of them said \nno. Five Republicans yesterday voted to move forward on this bill, \nenough for them to say back home they are on the right side of history, \nbut calculated in a way so there were never enough Republican votes to \nactually go to the measure. Five--Senators Coleman, Collins, Corker, \nSmith, and Snowe joined all the Democrats present. We had 53 votes at \nthe end of the day. We needed 60.\n  This is not an accident that enough Republicans crossed over to be \nable to say back home that they are doing the right thing for energy \ndevelopment, but not enough to actually move to the bill and debate. It \nhas been a calculated strategy, and it has worked.\n  The Republicans time and again in the Senate have stopped us from \nconsidering measure after measure. They are determined that at the end \nof the day, this Senate, if they have their way, will accomplish \nlittle. They know they were branded in the last Congress as a do-\nnothing Congress. They are determined to stop us. In a closely divided \nSenate, 51 to 49, it is easy for them to hold back enough Members to \nstop us from taking up important measures for America.\n  Let me tell you what this bill would have done, the bill the \nRepublicans opposed and used their filibuster and their votes to stop. \nIt would have extended incentives for biodiesel fuel usage. Of course, \nthat uses vegetable oil to supplement diesel fuel to reduce our \ndependence on Middle Eastern oil. They voted no.\n  E85 gas pumps so that ethanol would be available in more cities \nacross America so we can use this homegrown fuel and have less \ndependence on foreign oil. And the Republicans voted no.\n  Hybrid car purchases, a tax credit to families who buy hybrid cars, \nplug-in hybrids, for example. We know that is the wave of the future. \nWe want to incentivize that market. The Republicans voted no.\n  The bill would have provided $3 billion in tax credit bonds to State \nand local governments so they can take energy conservation measures \nwith their infrastructure.\n  It supports the creation of hundreds of thousands of good-paying \nAmerican jobs right here at home, and the Republicans voted no.\n  In addition, the bill extended the R tax credit which provides \ncritical incentives to over 27,000 companies in America.\n  And finally, this bill would have helped a lot of American families \nby lowering taxes, property tax relief. I can tell you that in my State \nof Illinois, I hear about it wherever I travel--property taxes are too \nhigh. People need a helping hand. But the Republicans voted no.\n\n  We wanted to expand child tax credits for parents with young \nchildren, college tuition deductions for parents with older children, a \ndeduction for classroom expenses for teachers, tax relief for our \ntroops in combat under the earned-income tax credit, and State and \nlocal sales tax deductions for families who live in States that have no \nincome tax--all of that tax relief for working families across America. \nThe Republicans voted no. And to top it off, we did something that, \nfrankly, may be new to the Republican leadership: We paid for it. We \ndidn't put these tax cuts in at the expense of the American deficit. We \ndidn't add to the American debt, not like this war President Bush has \nnow waged for 5\\1/2\\ years, which he has failed to pay for, just adding \nit to the debt of our children. We paid for these tax measures by \nrequiring hedge fund managers to pay taxes on compensation that is \nsitting overseas and delaying a new business tax benefit that hasn't \ngone into effect. But to protect businesses overseas and their workers, \nthe Republicans voted no. They voted no when given a chance for tax \nbreaks for working families and said, instead, they wanted to protect \nthese businesses overseas.\n  Why do they refuse to even debate this bill? Let's be honest about \nit, we are going to need their support to pass it. They are going to \nhave their day in court, if the bill comes to the floor. They are going \nto be able to offer amendments and deliberate.\n  Senator Baucus has proposed a substitute that would do the things the \nHouse would do in their bill and provide even more relief for \nbusinesses and families, including taking care of the\n\n[[Page S5709]]\n\nalternative minimum tax for another year. Why do they refuse to even \nallow these amendments to be offered?\n  I have heard from some of the largest businesses in my State--Boeing, \nCaterpillar, John Deere--and they want this bill, not to mention \nsmaller businesses that rely on these energy tax credits to expand \ntheir reach of new jobs and opportunities in my State. I know families \nin my State want to see this passed, particularly those who are \nbattling with the price of gasoline, the price of utilities, and those \nwith younger college-age children who would benefit from child or \ntuition credits. But the Senate Republicans have chosen obstruction \ninstead--77 Republican filibusters so far, and counting.\n  This isn't the only debate Senate Republicans have denied us and \ndenied the American people. Last week, they filibustered our efforts to \ndebate the Consumer-First Energy Act, which begins addressing the root \ncauses of increasing gasoline prices. Gas and diesel prices are 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes what they were when President Bush took office, and at the same \ntime the profits of the five largest integrated oil companies have more \nthan quadrupled over the past 5 years, to $116 billion in 2007. Total \noil industry profits were $155 billion. Many of us believe these oil \ncompanies must be held accountable. And if we don't hold them \naccountable, the prices will continue to increase. The bill that the \nRepublicans stopped last week would have rolled back a $17 billion \nFederal subsidy to these oil companies. How can we possibly explain or \nrationalize taking $17 billion out of our Treasury at a time when we \nare facing recordbreaking deficits, a war that costs us $15 billion a \nmonth--not paid for--and giving it as a subsidy to the most profitable \nbusinesses in the history of America, the oil companies? I don't \nunderstand it. I would have loved to have heard that debate on that \namendment. We didn't get a chance because the Republicans filibustered \nand refused to produce the votes we needed to bring this measure to the \nfloor.\n  We also wanted to create a windfall profits tax so that some of the \nexcessive profits of these oil companies would be reinvested in America \nin clean, renewable fuels and expanded refinery capacity. The \nRepublicans voted no.\n  We wanted to protect consumers from price gouging. The bill would \ngive the President the authority to declare an energy emergency and set \nan ``unconscionably excessive price'' limit that would be enforced so \nthat consumers would be protected. Of course, the Republicans voted no.\n  We wanted to set limits on oil market price speculation, preventing \nthe traders of U.S. crude oil from avoiding the law and routing their \ntransactions to offshore markets. Speculation is part of the reason the \nprice of a barrel of crude oil is so high. Most people understand that \nif we can stop excessive speculation and manipulation, it will bring \ndown the price of oil and the price of gasoline. The Republicans voted \nno.\n  We want to send a clear message to OPEC that we will allow \nenforcement actions against any company that is colluding to set the \nprice of oil, natural gas, or petroleum products. That is a bipartisan \nmeasure. Senator Kohl of Wisconsin is the one who offered it, but \nSenator Specter joined him. Senator McConnell came to the floor and \ncalled that provision ludicrous, in his words, and then the Republicans \nfollowed his lead and voted no.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act would have prevented price gouging, \nprofit taking, and redirected money away from industry and into \nrenewable energy and expanded refinery capacity. But once again the \nSenate Republicans preferred a filibuster to a real debate. Their \nanswer to all of these issues--drill, drill, drill. We will find enough \noil to take care of America. They ignore the obvious: The United States \nhas within its grasp or reach maybe 4 or 5 percent of the entire known \noil reserves in the world. Every day, every week, every month, every \nyear, we consume 25 percent of the world's oil. We cannot drill our way \nout of this. How many times will the Republicans and the President and \nSenator John--well, sorry, I shouldn't refer to Senator McCain in this \ncontext--how many times will the Republicans and the President say that \nthe answer to all our prayers when it comes to the price of gasoline is \na little patch of real estate in the Alaskan Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge--1.5 million acres--yet failing to say that it will be years \nbefore anything can be produced there and will have a limited impact on \nthe price of gasoline?\n  Last week, Senate Republicans also filibustered consideration of an \neffort to improve the quality of health care for our seniors--the \nMedicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act, supported by the \nAARP, the American Medical Association, and many others.\n  What we are trying to do is stop an effort by the Bush administration \nto cut the reimbursement to doctors who treat Medicare patients. That \nreimbursement is to go into effect July 1. We want to make sure doctors \ncontinue to provide quality care to our seniors and disabled. The bill \nwould have moved us also toward mental health parity by phasing out \nhigh copayments for mental health services, ensuring that seniors and \nthose with disabilities receive Medicare. Finally, it would have made \nit easier to add preventive services to Medicare and address disturbing \nreports of abusive and fraudulent sales and marketing practices by the \nMedicare Advantage plans. These are private insurance companies, \ncharging more than Medicare and making a handsome profit, which are \nbeing protected by many in the Senate. They should be held accountable, \ntoo, particularly when they engage in abusive and fraudulent practices. \nWe have that looming deadline in less than 2 weeks, with many doctors \nfacing a drastic cut in Medicare reimbursement, but the Senate \nRepublicans used the filibuster again and said no, they would not even \nallow the Senate to debate.\n  Finally, yesterday the Senate Republicans objected to the passage of \nthe Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008. That \nmeasure passed in the House 274 to 137, with 49 House Republicans--a \nbipartisan measure. When economic conditions have deteriorated in the \npast five decades, Congress has routinely provided extended \nunemployment benefits--1958, 1961, 1972, 1975, 1982, 1991, and 2002. It \nwas routine and bipartisan.\n  Over the first 3 months of this year, the U.S. economy has lost a \ntotal of 232,000 jobs, and the total number of unemployed in our \ncountry has grown by 1.1 million workers over the last year. The \nunemployment problem is especially severe for the long-term unemployed, \nwho have been looking for work for more than 6 months. In the 1990 \nrecession, the long-term unemployed comprised 9.8 percent of all \nworkers. In the 2001 recession, 696,000 workers were \nunemployed, representing about 11 percent. In May of 2008, there were \n1.6 million American workers unemployed for more than 6 months. That \nrepresents nearly 18 percent of all unemployed workers. Their \nunemployment insurance benefits are not only the right thing to do for \nthese workers, they are the best thing we can do for the economy. \nPutting this money in the hands of an unemployed family means they will \nbe able to pay their rent, pay their utility bills, buy clothes for the \nkids, and the necessities of life. It is money that will create \neconomic growth in America.\n\n  Sadly, the Senate Republicans said no. They believe giving \nunemployment benefits to people who have been out of work will \ndiscourage them from looking for work. They want to starve them into \ntheir next job. That doesn't make sense. It has never made sense. On a \nbipartisan basis, we have said we are going to stand by these families, \nthat we are going to make sure they have food on the table and that \nthey can take care of themselves until they do find that job. But the \nRepublicans used their filibuster to vote no.\n  I understand this morning that the minority leader may come here and \nmake an attempt at a political ``get well'' card. He knows many of his \nRepublican Members have come to him and said they do not like to \ncontinue to vote no. I think they are starting to feel the pain of \nbeing the filibuster party. They know they may be filibustering \nthemselves right out of their Senate seats. So a unanimous consent \nrequest will be made. Unfortunately, it has no hope because it doesn't \ngo to the substance. We had an opportunity yesterday to bring these \nmeasures up, and the day before. If they would have just sent over a \nhalf dozen or maybe\n\n[[Page S5710]]\n\nnine more Republican Senators, we would be debating the very bills they \nare now going to ask us to turn to.\n  So I urge my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, don't \nbecome the filibuster party. Become a party that is willing to work on \na bipartisan basis to solve our Nation's problems.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5710-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, high gas prices continue to frustrate \nthe American people, and so I think it is important that Congress show \nwe are fully engaged on this issue and ready to help in any way we can. \nUnfortunately, that means the parties will have to come together on a \nsolution, something our friends on the other side seem, at least so \nfar, stubbornly unwilling to do.\n  The commonsense solution to this problem, we all know, is a \ncombination of energy exploration in the United States to bring down \nprices in the short term married to a long-term strategy of energy \nindependence through development of clean energy technologies. If we \nare going to help Americans in the short term, obviously we need more \nAmerican energy now, but our friends on the other side don't want to \nhear it. They think Americans should get used to $4-a-gallon gasoline.\n  Asked last week about the sudden spike in gas prices, the Democratic \nnominee for President said he would have preferred a gradual \nadjustment. As I have said several times, and others have, I don't \nthink that is the common view in the United States, and I want to give \nmy colleagues on the other side one more opportunity to say that, in \ntheir view, Americans shouldn't have to get used to $4-a-gallon \ngasoline. I haven't heard a single one of them say so yet, but I can't \nimagine they agree with their nominee that what Americans really needed \nwas a gradual adjustment to $4-a-gallon gasoline.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5710-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FISA LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Another option we could pursue on a bipartisan basis \nis to do what we did last December, which is pass a 6-month extension \non a bipartisan basis. So maybe we can simply extend existing law for \n18 months, the 18-month period being the one we had been discussing \nbefore the bipartisan talks broke off.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nimmediate consideration of a Senate bill, which I will send to the \ndesk, and is a clean 18-month extension of the December Medicare bill. \nI ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time and passed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our greatest successes in this Congress \nhave come when both sides work together. We have seen it many times, \nfrom last year's Energy bill to the economic stimulus package. We \nstarted down the same path when we began the Medicare discussion a few \nmonths ago. Both sides wanted to prevent cuts to physicians in the \nMedicare Program, preserve access to the quality medical care our \nseniors have come to depend on, and improve the program with things \nsuch as electronic prescribing. Unfortunately, the majority walked away \nfrom these bipartisan discussions. With the deadline for action \napproaching at the end of the week, frankly, we need to pass a bill.\n  I am willing to consider many different options. Senator Grassley \ndrafted a bill that would protect Medicare benefits for seniors and \nthat could be signed into law by the President. It should be passed \ntoday in the Senate, but the majority has passed on an opportunity to \ndo that.\n  I am going to resist the temptation to launch into a speech like my \ngood friend from Illinois about how many times legislation has been \nblocked by the minority. I think the finger-pointing at this point on \nthis bill is ridiculous. We have a couple of weeks to pass it. We need \nto get together and pass it.\n  If the other benefits and improvements to Medicare are unacceptable \nto the majority, my side is willing, as I suggested a few moments ago, \nto extend the bill passed in December of last year for 18 months, with \na 1.1 percent update for 2009. It was acceptable enough to pass 6 \nmonths ago by unanimous consent, so it should be acceptable enough now. \nIt is critical we prevent these cuts from taking effect. This bill \nwould do that. The majority, unfortunately, has objected to that path.\n  It is some cause for confusion. I thought our friends on the other \nside were interested in preserving seniors' access to physicians from \nbeing compromised. As physicians face a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare \nreimbursement, we need to be working together. I know I speak for \nmyself as well as Senator Grassley when I say we remain hopeful that \nthe majority will stop playing partisan politics and return to the \nnegotiating table so we can quickly pass this much needed legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5710-6", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5710-S5711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3098\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, I notified my friend on the other side I also \nwanted to ask consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 771, S. 3098, a bill to extend expiring \ntax relief. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That was the extender package, the McConnell-Kyl-\nGrassley package. That includes the 1-year AMT patch omitted by the \nHouse bill that we had a vote on yesterday and extends the provisions \nthat expired in 2007 for 2 years. This is a 1-year\n\n[[Page S5711]]\n\nlonger extension than in the House bill we had the vote on yesterday.\n  S. 3098 does not include any tax hikes, reflecting the position 41 \nSenators took in a letter to Senator Baucus on April 23 of this year.\n  Our Republican alternative also includes the Ensign-Cantwell energy \ntax incentives, which were approved by the Senate earlier this year, 88 \nto 8.\n  In addition, S. 3098 does not contain the New York City earmark. It \nalso does not contain the tax break for trial lawyers. It also does not \ncontain Davis-Bacon expansion. And it also would not be vetoed by the \nPresident.\n  On balance, this is a bill that could pass the Senate and get signed \nby the President. We hope to pass it as soon as possible.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by saying that my good friend on the other \nside of the aisle and I both know how we pass these bills--we pass them \ntogether. As he frequently said when he was in the minority and in a \nposition similar to mine, we are not the House. We are the Senate. It \nis not going to work to turn the Senate into the House. We all know \nthat. Both sides have tried it. We have been in the majority and the \nminority, and the minority always insists they be part of the process.\n  We have two important bills here that clearly need to be completed. \nWe all know how to get there--bipartisan negotiation on the Medicare \nbill and bipartisan negotiation on the tax extender bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to say a word in response to my earlier objections \nand note the bill related to Medicare, presented by the Senator from \nKentucky, the Republican minority leader, failed to include critical \nprovisions that we had in our earlier legislation.\n  Our legislation would have provided financial assistance to low-\nincome Medicare beneficiaries who cannot afford Medicare premiums and \nit would have finally moved us forward on the issue of mental health \nparity. This is an issue that is long overdue. There are millions of \nAmerican families who are struggling with mental health issues. They \nunderstand that the high copayments for mental health services in \neffect deny service to a lot of those who cannot afford them. We wanted \nto address that in the bill. We thought it was a priority. The Senator \nfrom Kentucky in his measure they brought before us did not include \nthat, and that is unfortunate.\n  I say to the Senator from Kentucky, I believe in the battle of ideas \non the floor of the Senate. Looking back, in the time I have been here \nI have lost a lot of amendments on the floor. I have come here, brought \nthe amendments, debated them, subjected them to a vote, and lost. But \nit was a fair fight. People spoke on both sides of the issue. The \nSenate spoke. That is how it should be. If the majority prevails, then \nwe move forward. That is the only way this body can work.\n  But the Republicans have now taken a new approach and that approach \nis: We will not debate issues. We will not deliberate them. It is a \ntake-it-or-leave-it situation. Seventy-seven filibusters have been used \nnow. They are stopping this Medicare bill. Then when they realize how \nbad it looks back home--when they know they cannot explain it to \nseniors and disabled when the doctors who treat them say we are about \nto take a 10-percent pay cut and I may not be able to see you--they \nunderstand it is hard to explain that vote. So then they come to the \nfloor and make a unanimous consent request to say let's drop in a bill \nand take care of the whole problem.\n  That is not the way the Senate works either. We don't want to turn \nthe Senate into the House, but the Republican strategy is turning the \nSenate into a ghost town. We don't do anything here. We have procedural \nvotes three or four times a week and then go home. If those in the \nSenate were paid on the basis of debate, deliberation, amendments, \nbills passed and that kind of effort, we would not earn a minimum wage \naround here because we never get to the substance anymore. There were \n77 Republican filibusters so far, the latest on the energy issue.\n  For the Senator from Kentucky to come forward and say the reason we \ncould not support the idea of moving forward on these energy tax credit \nextenders was because they involved a tax--do you know who was going to \npay that tax? Companies that locate overseas, American companies that \ngo overseas trying to avoid our taxes would have been subject to more \ntaxes. The Senator from Kentucky is saying 41 of his members have taken \na solemn pledge not to raise the taxes of those American companies that \ngo overseas to avoid paying American taxes. How about that? Is that \nwhat we need in America, more incentives to take jobs offshore?\n  Senator Baucus in the Finance Committee had a reasonable approach to \nthis, taking that money and putting it back into America for tax breaks \nfor our families and to encourage energy production for our future, and \nthe Republicans voted no--time and again they vote no. But the American \npeople will have a final vote on November 4. They will remember the \nparty that is trying to move forward an agenda to make this a better \nnation and they will remember the party of filibusters that votes no.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5711-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       The Rising Cost of Energy\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss once again the rising \ncost of energy for Georgians and all Americans. My constituents \ncontinue to suffer due to the ever-increasing price of fuel. They are \nfacing very difficult choices--between food and gasoline--between \ndriving to work to earn money for their families and driving to the \ngrocery store to feed their families.\n  I would like to take just a moment to read some of the letters I have \nreceived from my constituents that I think shed light on the real-world \nimpact high gas prices are having on all Americans:\n  Mr. John Broomfield from Lawrenceville writes:\n\n       We are conserving, recycling, buying compact fluorescent \n     lamps, driving less and slower, but we cannot do this alone. \n     You in Congress must have the foresight and vision to pass \n     policies that will actually help us. Please make it possible \n     for our oil and energy companies to search for and extract \n     our own natural resources. No matter where they are!\n\n  Mrs. Betty Byers from Marietta writes:\n\n       Dear Senator Chambliss,\n       I appreciate all you can do to help develop a program that \n     will allow the exploration of our country's energy sources \n     without materially affecting our environment. We need to \n     break away from relying on other countries (even our enemies) \n     for our energy supplies. The rising price of gasoline is \n     hurting ALL Americans. PLEASE--put our families first before \n     environmentalists. We are all hurting from the rising cost of \n     gasoline. Please do something ASAP.\n\n  I was pleased to hear yesterday both President Bush and Senator \nMcCain highlight their support for oil and gas leases in the Outer \nContinental Shelf. I think their public support for this effort will \nraise the profile of this important way in which Congress can act to \nhelp increase our supply of oil and gas to help lower gas prices for \nall Americans.\n  Is this the only answer? Absolutely not. But certainly this is the \nright direction to go.\n  The Department of the Interior released a comprehensive inventory of\n\n[[Page S5712]]\n\nOCS resources in February 2006 that estimated reserves of 8.5 billion \nbarrels of oil and 29.3 trillion cubic feet--tcf--of natural gas. \nCongress has imposed moratoria on much of the OCS since 1982 through \nthe annual Interior appropriation bills.\n  Some contend that lifting the moratoria would pose unacceptable \nenvironmental risks and threaten coastal tourism industries.\n  First, that is simply not true. In 2005, we suffered significant \ndamage in the gulf coast region of our country as a result of \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita. Yet off the coast of Louisiana, off the \ncoast of Mississippi, off the coast of Texas, off the coast of Alabama, \nwhere Hurricane Katrina came through, we saw not one drop of oil \nspilled even though there are hundreds and hundreds of oil-producing \nplatforms in that region of the gulf.\n  I come from a coastal State. There is nothing I would ever do that \nwould in any way endanger the pristine beaches in my State or the \ncoastal regions of any other State. But, simply stated, we now have the \ntechnology in place to ensure that type of thing never happens.\n  Second, we can do this in a way that ultimately lets the individual \ncoastal States decide whether or not to opt out of this moratorium. So \ninstead of politicians in Washington dictating what will happen off the \ncoast of my home State of Georgia, the people of Georgia and the \nGovernor of Georgia will get the ultimate decision. I am hopeful the \nSenate will come together to take this first step to increase our \nsupply.\n  Would I like to see more development? Sure. I support the \ndevelopment, not just of the OCS but in other regions of our country \ntoo, where we know we have vast resources of energy. We need to make \nsure that when we do explore, we do it in the right way, that we do \nnothing that will endanger the environment of any part of our country. \nBut we do have the technology to make sure that happens--whether it is \non the Outer Continental Shelf, whether it is in the shale of the Rocky \nMountains, or whether it is in the ANWR region of Alaska or other areas \nof this country where geologists are fairly certain that we do have \nadditional resources. This will add to the supply we have so that, long \nterm as well as short term, we can see gas prices in this country \nstabilize and hopefully begin to come back down to something more \nreasonable than what we are looking at today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n            Diesel Supplemental Environmental Projects Bill\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here on the Senate \nfloor this morning with my colleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich. I \nwant to reflect on what Senator Chambliss just spoke about with respect \nto energy.\n  There are a wide variety of things we need to do: create biofuels, \nconserve energy. I think we need to incentivize a greater reliance on \nalternative and renewable forms of energy, including solar, wind, and \ngeothermal. I believe we need to incentivize--and we are \nincentivizing--a new generation of nuclear powerplants in this country. \nNine applications are in. We expect another 30 or so over the next \ncouple of years, a wide variety of things: plug-in hybrid vehicles, \nvery low emission diesel engines, and the list goes on and on. We do \nnot need any one of them. We, frankly, need to do almost all of them.\n  One of my colleagues, one of the people I most enjoy working with in \nthe Senate, is a former Governor from Ohio. We worked together for many \nyears in the National Governors Association. Now I have the pleasure of \nworking with him in the Senate.\n  Among the issues we worked on, we served together on the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. He came to me about 3 years ago and said: \nLet's talk about diesel emissions.\n  I said: OK. And I said: What do you want to say?\n  He said--I will paraphrase what he said: There is good news and bad \nnews about diesel emissions.\n  I said: What is it?\n  He said: The good news is, diesel engines last a long time.\n  I said: OK.\n  Then he went on to say, and the bad news is, diesel engines last a \nlong time. The old diesels we have on the road today, and most of the \ndiesels we have on the road are old diesels, and there are millions of \nthem. They are in trucks and buses and ships. They are in locomotives. \nBut mostly, though, diesels put out a lot of bad emissions, bad stuff, \nthat we end up breathing.\n  What Senator Voinovich came up with in 2005--he was good enough to \nlet me be the lead Democrat on the legislation--was the proposal that \nsays: Why do we not create a grant program, through EPA, that provides \nincentive money for State and local governments, for school districts \nwith buses, for private truck companies and so forth, to incentivize \nthem to begin to use new technology that goes into the diesel engines \nand reduces diesel emissions by as much as 80, 85 percent?\n  I said: That sounds like a great idea. I would be pleased to be your \nDemocratic lead sponsor. A number of others ended up joining us. I \nthink that Senator Clinton was among them. But there were a variety of \nRepublicans and Democrats who joined us.\n  I remember going to a press conference with Senator Voinovich about \n100 yards from where we are today. We introduced the legislation that \nday. The next week there may have been a hearing--there may not have \nbeen a hearing. The next week after I think the legislation passed the \nSenate. Within a month or so, it was the law. I have never seen \nlegislation move so quickly in my life.\n  We were here earlier this morning with one of the earlier discussions \non the floor talking about filibusters and how our Republican friends \nare slow walking legislation, something that we were accused of doing \nwhen they were in the majority years ago.\n  But it is wonderful to have an example, once 3 years ago, with the \npassage of the Diesel Emission Reduction Act, and more recently with a \nchange to the act which actually makes it even better, to see that we \ncan still work together, we can set aside our partisan differences, \nDemocrats and Republicans can find common ground, actually address our \nproblems and resolve them.\n  So that sort of sets the stage for today. I think each of us is going \nto be recognized for 10 minutes, and when I run out of time, I may ask \nfor a little bit of extra time if there is not a press of colleagues \nwho want to come to the floor.\n  But let me start off by laying the groundwork and to say a special \nthank-you to our colleagues in the House of Representative and in the \nSenate for passing S. 2146. It is a bipartisan bill that gives EPA the \nauthority to accept, as part of air quality settlements, diesel \nemission reduction supplemental environmental projects.\n  What does that mean? That means, when EPA enters into some kind of \nenforcement action against a polluter, for example, and out of that \nenforcement action comes a requirement for the polluter to pay certain \nfines or charges, the idea is, how can that money be used by EPA?\n  We want to make sure that money can be used by EPA to further reduce \ndiesel emissions; to install this technology, diesel emissions \nreduction technology, in buses, in trucks, in all kinds of emitters of \npollution of diesels. So we ran into a problem with this over the last \ncouple of years.\n  Today--actually yesterday--the legislation was passed. We resolved \nthat problem. I also wish to thank some of our colleagues--Senators \nInhofe, Clinton, Cardin, Alexander--for joining Senator Voinovich and \nme on this latest version of this legislation.\n  This is a small bill. This is a small bill with big consequences, big \nconsequences for jumpstarting the effort to clean up our Nation's \ndiesel vehicle fleet and making our air cleaner and toxin free. Like a \nnumber of our colleagues, I am a strong advocate for diesel engines, \nclean diesel engines. They are powerful, they are fuel efficient, and \nwith the implementation of EPA's new fuel and engine regulations, they \nwill also be a lot cleaner. However, dirty diesel emissions can be \ndeadly. Reducing emissions from diesel engines is one of the most \nimportant air quality challenges facing our country. This week we are \ngoing to do something about it.\n  EPA estimates there are some 11 million diesel engines in America \nthat lack the latest pollution control technology. When diesel engines \nare built today for cars, trucks, buses, and so\n\n[[Page S5713]]\n\nforth, they are required to have the latest technology. The fuel they \nuse is very low in sulphur content today, so we end up dramatically \nreducing the kind of damage and threat to our public health.\n  But there are 11 million old diesels out on the road, and they are \ngoing out on the road for a long time. Taken together, these engines \nproduce something like 1,000 tons of particulate matter every day. I \nwill talk a little bit more about particulate matter in a moment.\n  As a result, dirty diesel emissions are linked to some 21,000 \npremature deaths, hundreds of thousands of asthma attacks, millions of \nlost workdays, and numerous other health impacts every year. In fact, \ndiesel soot is linked to more premature deaths in this country than \nfirearms, HIV, or drunk driving. The risks are nationwide, but they are \nespecially high risk in urban areas.\n  I have a chart here. Let me see if I can point out a couple of \nthings. First of all, here is Ohio. Here is Ohio, where I went to Ohio \nState University, along with my colleague, George Voinovich. Here is \nCleveland, OH, where Senator Voinovich is from. This is dark red. This \nis dark red. In fact, much of Ohio is dark red.\n  Over here is Delaware. Delaware is in an area of our country which is \ndark red. If you look down at the color code, there from the lowest \nimpact, which is pink in color, to the highest impact, which is like a \ndark red color. For Nebraska, our Presiding Officer's State, it is \nlooking pretty good, part of it in the pink.\n  But what we want to make sure is that the whole country is in the \npink; not in the dark red, not in the red, not in the dark pink. We \nwant to make sure it is in the light pink. What that means is healthier \nair for us to breathe for us and our families.\n  Why is diesel so toxic? Let me take a moment to show this. This is a \ndiesel particle. It looks big, doesn't it? But in reality they are very \nsmall. You cannot even see them with the eye. But we breathe them, \nnonetheless. The fact is, as we walk about Washington, DC, or wherever \nwe live, we probably breathe some of these little babies as well.\n\n  But at the core is something called elemental carbon. Around that \ncore are organic carbon compounds. Around that, in the yellow here, \nsecondary sulphate and nitrate. Surrounding them are metals. Then \nsurrounding that on the outer core are toxins.\n  Diesel exhaust is a mixture of vapors and fine particles. The small \nparticles have a core of carbons, as I pointed out, with a layer of \ntoxins, many of which can cause cancer.\n  Here we have a picture of the lungs--in fact, two lungs. We have in \nfine detail--some of this matter is hard to tell. This is called the \nalveoli. That is where the oxygen that we breathe in is actually \ntransferred into the blood system. And when these particles get down \nthis far, they get into the blood system. That is what causes cancer.\n  But the fine particles can get deep into our lungs to cause \ninflammation. They cause scarring of the lungs, and some of that leads \nto bronchitis. It can lead to asthma. But when they get down into the \nbloodstream itself, they get spread all over the body and cause lung \ncancer and spread cancer to other parts of our bodies.\n  If that were not enough, these carcinogens can cause not just cancer \nbut death. And some of the 21,000 people who will die this year will \ndie not from bronchitis, not from asthma or asthma attacks, but they \nwill die from cancer. This is why poor air quality, caused by old, \ndirty diesel engines, can lead to higher than average cancer rates for \nthose living along heavily traveled interstates, highways such as \nInterstate 95 which stretches all the way from Maine in the north down \nto Florida. It runs right through my State of Delaware and a bunch of \nother States, too, on the east coast. And what we have--notice this \ncurve--what we have is the zone of greatest exposure.\n  When you have a highway such as I-95--or it can be Interstate 70 or \nany other interstate or densely traveled highway, especially one with a \nlot of buses and trucks on it, what you see is a concentration of \ndiesel exhaust right around the highways. And the threat to our health \nis the greatest for those who travel the highways or live or work in \nthe near proximity of those highways.\n  That is the bad news. Here is the good news. The good news is we now \nhave the pollution control technology to greatly reduce these deadly \ndiesel particles and therefore greatly impact human health.\n  In 2004, the EPA began to address these public health concerns by \nrequiring that all new heavy-duty highway diesel vehicles had to \ninstall pollution control technology starting in 2007. We also changed \nthe law with respect to sulphur content. It is 15 parts per million \nsulphur fuel that is sold, I think, after last year. It began last \nyear. They had to reduce the sulphur content rather dramatically.\n  However, this ruling is a problem because it does nothing for the \nmillions of diesel engines that are already on the roadways, as I said \nearlier. Reducing diesel emissions in the current fleet could save an \nestimated 100,000 lives between now and the year 2030.\n  In response to what the EPA did in 2004, Congress passed the Diesel \nEmission Reduction Act, which Senator Voinovich introduced, and was \ngood enough to let me and others join him in doing that. That program, \nagain, established the voluntary national and State grant loan program \nto clean up some of those old diesel engines in buses and trucks and \ntrains and ships.\n  Our intention was to build upon a program that EPA already had in \nplace which allowed air quality polluters to fund diesel cleanup \nprograms as part of their settlement with EPA.\n  For example, in October of last year, EPA reached a settlement \nagreement with a company called American Electric Power. As part of \nthat settlement, American Electric Power will spend about $21 million \nretrofitting diesel engines with pollution controls. In fiscal year \n2008--that is the year we are in right now--Congress appropriated $49 \nmillion to help fund the Diesel Emission Reduction Act.\n  So we had, on one hand, a settlement with American Electric Power, a \n$21 million settlement, the moneys of which were to be used for diesel \nemission reduction technology. Then we provided an appropriation in \n2008, $49 million, to help fund the same program.\n  Put that money together, I think it adds up to about $70 million. \nThat is enough money to have a significant impact on diesel emissions \nand to improve our air quality.\n  Unfortunately, EPA determined that if Congress funds through an \nappropriation the Diesel Emission Reduction Act grants, EPA could no \nlonger accept diesel projects as part of air quality enforcement \nsettlements. They could not use the $21 million they got in the \nsettlement from American Electric to also help fund the program.\n  There is enough need. We could spend 10 times the amount of money we \nappropriated to help clean up diesel emissions. The need is huge. There \nare 11 million vehicles. We could spend money for a long time, and a \nlot more money than we are appropriating. But the idea of having $70 \nmillion versus $49 million is a big thing. We want to make sure we have \nand use the money from these settlements. So it does not make much \nsense to me or to Senator Voinovich.\n  The EPA said: Sorry, our hands are tied. We think this is the law, \nand we have to abide by it. What this bill does is it corrects the \nunintended consequence of successfully funding the Diesel Emission \nReduction Act. As a result, we are going to be able to use settlement \nmoney. We are going to be able to use money that we appropriated for \ndiesel emission reductions. We will be able to use the combined amount; \nparcel it out to States for grants and for loans and to get diesel \nemissions down and under control.\n  The House amended our bill and said: We want to add the District of \nColumbia to the 50 States that can participate in this grant program \nestablished by the Diesel Emission Reduction Act.\n  Let me close by saying, I do not think there is a silver bullet to \nreduce the environmental risks that lead to cancer, that lead to \nasthma, or to death. But cleaning up emissions from our Nation's diesel \nfleet is certainly a positive step. It is a diesel fleet that can help \nus use more judicially the resources that we have in this country, to \nuse them more wisely but to be able to use that diesel engine in a way \nthat doesn't threaten our health. That is a very good thing.\n\n  In closing, I thank Senator Voinovich for the terrific leadership he\n\n[[Page S5714]]\n\nprovided over the years on this particular subject and for allowing \nothers to work with him, to enact the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act \nand then to join me in coming back and saying the unintended \nconsequence, where the EPA couldn't spend the settlement money and \nappropriations to finance diesel retrofits, that we had to take care of \nthat. They can spend them both and reduce emissions.\n  Senator Voinovich and I sometimes lament how difficult it is to get \nanything done around here. On a day such as today, when it is a \nbeautiful day outside, clear skies, beautiful day, walking from the \ntrain station, walking right up Delaware Avenue, seeing the Capitol at \nthe top of the hill, the green trees, blue skies, the sun shining, it \nwas beautiful. We wish to make sure that more days look like today, not \nonly in Washington, DC, but all over the country, that the air is safe \nto breathe.\n  With this legislation, it will be a lot safer for years to come. I \nsalute my friend, Senator Voinovich, for helping make it happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, ordinarily I don't come over and speak \nin morning business. As so with many Members of the Senate, I could be \nat three places at the same time and justify each one of them. I came \ntoday because of the fact that our colleagues and the citizens of this \ncountry need to know there are many instances where both Republicans \nand Democrats can come together and get something done. I have been \nvery fortunate over the years to know the Presiding Officer, a former \nGovernor, to know Governor Carper, now Senator Carper. We worked \ntogether in the National Governors Association. I think sometimes we \nwere more effective as Governors getting things done than as Members of \nthe Senate.\n  The fact is, we came together a couple of years ago and realized that \none of the most significant sources of pollution, in terms of \nparticulate matter, were emissions from diesel engines. As Senator \nCarper pointed out, we now have new vehicles on the road that are much \ncleaner than anything we have seen before. We also knew there were some \n11 million on- and off-road vehicles that would be around a long time \nand that if we were going to make significant improvement in reducing \nemissions from diesel engines, we needed a new program. We got together \nand supported the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, a bipartisan bill. We \nmust have had 25 or 30 sponsors, over 150 groups supported it. That was \nthe fastest bill I have ever seen passed around here. I think we had it \ndone in 45 days.\n  The program today is currently supported by over 250 environmental, \nindustry, and public interest groups. When DERA was announced, the EPA \nestimated the 5-year program, $200 million per year, would achieve $10 \nbillion in health benefits. Senator Carper has done a very good job of \ntalking about how these particulates are harmful. As a matter of fact, \nI am going to check into a program that is being funded by the EPA in \nCincinnati, where they are measuring the impact of diesel engines on \ninfants in urban areas. Preliminary information I have received \nindicates it is a very serious problem. Anything we can do to deal with \nreducing these emissions is significant. In addition, we talk about \ndoing something about pollution. This legislation, if fully funded, \nwill result in the most significant reductions of particulates of any \nprogram in the country. It will help communities, such as mine in Ohio \nand others around the country, to meet new requirements that have come \nout for ozone and particulate matter.\n  The need for this program from fiscal year 2003 to 2005 was great, \nbut EPA was only able to fund 25 percent of the applications under the \nClean School Bus Program. A lot of school buses need to have this kind \nof technology. Without it, they are carting kids around, and when they \nstop, the stuff is being poured out. It is very significant.\n  Over that period, from 2003 to 2005, only a third of Ohio's \napplications were funded, 5 out of 15, but broad support for DERA is \nchanging this situation. People are starting to realize this is a neat \nprogram. It is really working. For fiscal year 2008, DERA was funded at \nalmost $50 million. The House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee has \nacted to increase DERA funding to $65 million for 2009.\n  The thing that is neat about this is that we look at supporting \nprograms. I always asked the question, as I am sure the Presiding \nOfficer did when he was Governor and Senator Carper when he was \nGovernor: How much more money do you leverage with the money you are \nspending? In other words, the State puts money in, and how many other \npeople are willing to kick in and make a difference? In this program, \nwe have 50 States participating. In order for the States to \nparticipate, they have to create their own State-level programs. States \ncan get more Federal funding by adding State dollars. So if the State \nmatches the Federal allocation dollar for dollar, it will receive an \nadditional 50-percent allocation. This is a real incentive for States \nto get involved. When we first put this program together, we thought, \nfor every dollar we put out, we would leverage another $3 from State \nand local government. Also, the private sector is really interested in \nthis program. My State has taken a leadership role in that effort. A \ncoalition of groups have come together in Ohio to use the Congestion \nMitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, the CMAQ Program, as we \nknow it, to fund diesel retrofits. CMAQ provides State and local \ngovernments funding for transportation projects to help meet air \nquality requirements, and the funds are apportioned to State \ntransportation agencies based on population and air quality programs in \nthe region.\n  Still more money is needed. Enforcement settlements have been a good \nsource of funding for diesel retrofits. For example, from 2001 to 2006, \nEPA entered into diesel emission reduction Supplemental Environmental \nProjects valued at $45 million. In 2007, an enforcement settlement with \nAEP, American Electric Power, a company in my State, included \napproximately $21 million for diesel retrofits. In other words, \ncompanies that have been fined have been able to take the money they \nhave been fined and put it into this fabulous program that reduces \ndiesel emissions.\n  Last July, though, the EPA issued a policy that eliminated the use of \nthis money to finance diesel retrofits. It is hard to believe. This \npolicy was based on the Agency's interpretation of the Miscellaneous \nReceipts Act and prohibits the Agency from accepting SEPs that fund \nactivities for which the Agency received funds through appropriations, \na lot of gobbledygook. EPA's inability to enter into diesel emission \nreduction SEPs has eliminated an important tool for environmental \nprotection. What this bill basically says is, we are going to amend the \nMiscellaneous Receipts Act and say that in addition to the money we \nappropriate for this program, they can also use SEP money for this \nprogram. Everyone believes this is a very meritorious action we are \ntaking. It will increase substantially the amount of money that is made \navailable.\n  I am hopeful that in the next several years, we will see one of the \nmost robust programs in the world underway with the diesel emissions \nprogram. We pass stuff around here, we debate it, but so often nothing \nhappens. Here is a perfect case of where Republicans and Democrats have \nworked together on something that means something. It is going to help. \nIt is the kind of program I can go back to Ohio and say, when they are \ncomplaining about the ozone and the particulate and what are you doing \nto help us: We have the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act that is going to \nmake a difference for you and your community. Hopefully, working \ntogether, as I mentioned, we will see some significant reductions in \nemissions and significant improvement in public health, particularly \nfor our children.\n  Again, I publicly acknowledge the great partnership Senator Carper \nand I have had. There are so many things we work on. When we finally \nget to them, such as the Clean Air Act we had a couple years ago, we \njust missed making it happen. But on this one, we did make it happen. I \nam hopeful that Senator Carper and I, working in the Clean Air and \nNuclear Safety Subcommittee, will be able to collaborate on other \nsignificant legislation that\n\n[[Page S5715]]\n\nwill make a real difference for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. The Presiding Officer who is leaving the chair was \nGovernor of Nebraska, and he had the opportunity to work with Senator \nVoinovich and myself at that time. Among the people we worked with was \nthe father of our brand new Presiding Officer, the former Governor \nCasey. We have been reflecting back on the way it was and how we worked \nso well across party lines in those days. The legislation that we \ncelebrated passage of yesterday is another indication we can still do \nthat right here in the Senate.\n  I wish to ask a question, through the Presiding Officer, of Senator \nVoinovich. Senator Voinovich mentioned leveraging. Every dollar we \nappropriate in Federal dollars, EPA is now able to use for Supplemental \nEnvironmental Projects to install clean diesel technology to clean up \nemissions of diesel. He mentioned we actually leveraged some money from \nother sources, State and local governments, maybe school districts, \nprivate companies too. So for every $1 of Federal, we get another $3 to \nuse from other sources. My recollection is that in terms of cost \nbenefit--cost being how much it costs to install the technology--there \nis a health benefit that is a lot greater than the $1 we spend on the \ntechnology itself. I want to say it is $12, $13. I ask Senator \nVoinovich, if I may, through the Presiding Officer, is my recollection \ncorrect? Is there a 13-to-1 benefit in terms of a $1 investment in the \ntechnology and $13 in payoff, in terms of health benefits?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I think it is much more than that. If \nyou look at the numbers I used in my presentation, it is much greater \nthan that in terms of the public health benefits that are derived as a \nresult of the program.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, you were not presiding when we looked at \nthis map earlier, but this is a map of the United States, obviously. \nThis is a map that shows the mortality risks from U.S. diesel \nemissions. The best color to have is pink, and those States have \nrelatively low diesel emissions and fairly low threats for whether it \nis bronchitis or asthma or cancer from diesel emissions.\n  If you happen to be from a State such as Ohio--where Senator \nVoinovich is from, and where I spent part of my youth and went to \ncollege--or if you happen to be from Delaware or happen to be from the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, things are a bit grimmer.\n  What we have come up with, thanks in large part to Senator \nVoinovich's leadership, is a way to turn the dark red to pink. We want \nto get the whole country in the pink. Hopefully, in a relatively few \nyears we, will.\n  The last point I want to mention--Senator Voinovich comes from a \nState that builds a lot of cars, trucks, and vans. Delaware has the \nonly two automobile assembly plants that still exist anywhere up and \ndown the east coast. We are fearful of losing our Chrysler plant at the \nend of next year, and we would be down to a single GM plant. Chrysler \nhas invested in a new technology with Daimler, and their technology is \nfor low-emission diesel vehicles--very low emission diesel vehicles. \nThe emissions are so low and the fuel efficiency is so high, the people \nwho buy those very low-emission diesel vehicles starting, I think, next \nyear, will be eligible for the same kind of tax credit they would get \nby buying a hybrid vehicle today, with a tax credit anywhere from $500 \nto $3,500 per vehicle.\n  We want to encourage people to buy those low-emission diesel engines. \nBut as people are buying those very low-emission, highly energy-\nefficient diesels, we want to make sure the other 11 million old diesel \nengines that are on the road--that are not as fuel efficient; that are \nnot as clean burning--that we get to work at cleaning them up.\n  The good thing we have accomplished, working with House and Senate \nDemocrats and Republicans, is we are striking a blow for clean air but \nnot at the cost of energy efficiency.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will yield the floor.\n  Again, I say to my friend, Senator Voinovich: On to more battles. We \nwill take on more battles, and we will do good things.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 12 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Delaware. I \nwonder, through the Chair, if he needs to speak.\n  Mr. CARPER. I just did. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                               Gas Prices\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have invited Tennesseans to send me \ne-mails or to write letters about how high gas prices are affecting \ntheir daily lives. I am hearing from a lot of them.\n  Pat Taylor of Morristown, TN, who is the director of the local Meals \non Wheels program, tells me the drivers travel 1,100 miles a day to \ndeliver meals, but food and gasoline prices could force many meal \nrecipients into retirement homes if something is not done. Mileage \nreimbursements are not sufficiently covering the expenditures of \ndrivers.\n  Dr. Kathryn Stewart, of Winchester, TN, tells me that the school \nnutrition director has had to raise school lunch prices 50 cents per \nmeal to compensate for the rise in gas and food prices, but they will \nstill lose money this year. She worries about the future of her \nbusiness there.\n  Abbie Byrom, of Johnson City, TN--that is in the eastern part of our \nState--is a third-year medical student at East Tennessee State \nUniversity. She lives on loans through the school system. But, she \nsays, cost-of-living loans do not cover expenses on traveling to all \nthe area hospitals and medical centers. She says most of her fellow \nstudents are living by maxing out their credit cards.\n  Jerry and Judy Wilson, of Monterey, TN, run a weekend concessions \nbusiness, but sales have been cut in half because of rising gas prices. \nThey say: People can't come to the events because of fuel prices.\n  Joshua Yarbrough, of Franklin, TN, moved his family with three \nchildren to a larger house in Franklin, outside Nashville, 4 years ago, \nand is now having trouble paying his mortgage because of rising gas \nprices.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, \nfollowing my remarks, each of these letters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. So, Mr. President, given the extraordinary impact of \n$4-a-gallon gasoline on the people of Tennessee and the people of this \ncountry, they are looking to us in the Senate and the Congress to do \nsomething about this.\n  I noticed there are some interesting new professors of economics on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle who seem to be trying to repeal the \nlaw of supply and demand. I have been studying this strange \ndevelopment, and I am trying to trace the source of it. It would appear \nthat maybe the source of it is the young new chairman of the department \nof economics on that side of the aisle, because the New York Times \nreports this morning that Senator Obama opposes drilling in Alaska, and \nsays he is ``not a proponent,'' in his words, of nuclear power, which \nprovides 20 percent of our electricity today and 70 percent of our \nclean carbon-free electricity. He would consider banning new coal \nplants without clean coal technology. Coal produces 45 percent of our \nelectricity today. In 2006, he voted against further exploration in the \nGulf of Mexico for oil and gas, in a portion of the Gulf known as Lease \n181. More than 70 Senators from both sides of the aisle voted for it, \nwhich, so far as I can tell, leaves Senator Obama with not much more \nthan a national windmill policy, as opposed to a national energy \npolicy, for this great United States of America, which consumes every \nyear 25 percent of the energy in the world.\n  Of course, it leaves these new professors of economics with the \ndemand\n\n[[Page S5716]]\n\npart of the supply-and-demand equation.\n  We Republicans also believe in demand. We are for green buildings. We \nbelieve most of the new buildings ought to be green buildings. That is \nprobably the easiest way to save electricity. Japan has discovered over \nthe last several years that most of its failure to reach the Kyoto \nstandards it was trying to achieve came from the inefficiency of \nbuildings.\n  Half of us on the Republican side voted for the fuel efficiency \nstandards in December. That has to do with the demand side of the \nequation--using less oil, less energy. The Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory scientists told me that the single most important thing we \ncould do as a Congress would be to increase the fuel efficiency \nstandards by 40 percent. That means the cars and trucks in America \nshould average 35 miles per gallon by the year 2020. We voted to do \nthat in a bipartisan way. So we agree on that part of demand as well.\n  Then we Republicans, as well as many Democrats, I am sure, are ready \nto give strong support to the idea of plug-in electric cars and trucks.\n  I was in Nashville on Monday with Congressman Bud Cramer, who is a \nDemocratic Congressman from Alabama. He and I cochair the TVA \nCongressional Caucus.\n  The question we presented for the hearing was, Will electric plug-in \ncars and trucks help lower $4 gas prices? I believe the answer is yes, \nand so did a lot of the people who came to see the cars.\n  One of the vehicles there was a plug-in electric car made by the A123 \ncompany in Boston. It is a Toyota Prius, of which there are now a \nmillion on the road, and the A123 company had converted the Prius, \nwhich is a 40-miles-per-gallon car, into an electric plug-in vehicle, \nand it is now a 100-miles-per-gallon car. All they did was replace the \ncar's smaller rechargeable battery with a larger rechargeable battery, \nand they put a cord on the back of it and the driver plugs the cord in \nat night at his house in a wall socket and he charges it up for 60 \ncents. So instead of filling it up for $70, he is charging it up for 60 \ncents.\n  According to the General Motors Company witness who testified at our \nhearing on Monday, 75 percent of us drive fewer than 40 miles a day. I \nknow I drive less than 40 miles a day going back and forth when I am in \nWashington, so if I were driving that electric plug-in car, I would be \nusing no gasoline whatsoever.\n  So plug-in cars and trucks are a real prospect and a real important \npart of the demand part of the supply-and-demand law we strongly \nsupport on this side of the aisle, and so do many Democrats as well. It \nis 100 percent American energy. GM, Toyota, Nissan, Ford--all are going \nto be selling these cars to Americans in the year 2010, which is a \nmodel year that is about a year and a half away. Sixty cents is the \ncost of the charge for a 30-mile drive. It is about the same amount of \nelectricity it takes to use your water heater for 1 day. It doesn't \nrequire new powerplants because the Tennessee Valley Authority chairman \nwho was at the hearing told us that they have plenty of extra \nelectricity at night when our lights are off, so we can plug in at \nnight.\n  This involves trucks too. There were FedEx delivery truck witnesses \nat the hearing. They are already using hybrid delivery trucks, and they \nare planning to use that technology for big trucks.\n  If we were to electrify half our cars and trucks in America over \ntime--which is 120 million, since we have about 240 million cars and \ntrucks in this country--we could cut in half the amount of oil we \nimport. That would cut from $500 billion to $250 billion the amount of \nmoney we are sending overseas to people, many of whom are funding \nterrorists who are trying to kill us. It would strengthen the dollar. \nIt would certainly lower fuel costs for those who are plugging in their \ncars instead of driving them--or plugging them in instead of filling \nthem with gasoline--and it would reduce the demand for oil so much that \nit would surely reduce the price of gasoline as well.\n  Plug-in electric cars and trucks would lead us to support a number of \nother initiatives: Smart meters so that in our homes we could pay TVA--\nor whoever our electric utility is--a little more in the afternoon for \nelectricity used at peak power, but at night we would have cheap power \nfor our plug-in vehicles. Battery research. The additional cost of such \na plug-in vehicle is determined primarily by how rapidly we can develop \nbatteries that will take a charge to allow 40, 60, 80, 100, or even \nmore miles each time because we will be running coal plants at night to \nprovide this electricity. We would need to clean up our coal plants, \nbut we should be doing that anyway, whether they are in Pennsylvania or \nTennessee or Ohio. We need to get rid of the sulfur and the nitrogen \nand the mercury, and we need a crash program to find a practical way to \nrecapture the carbon from coal plants if we are serious about dealing \nwith climate change.\n  So there are a number of policy changes we on the Republican side of \nthe aisle are ready to make to lower gas prices and to honor the law of \nsupply and demand. But the problem is the new professors of economics \non that side of the aisle, led by Senator Obama, are trying to take the \nword ``supply'' out of the law of supply and demand. If we are going to \ndrive plug-in electric cars and trucks, we are going to need a supply \nof electricity, so we need to be building five or six nuclear \npowerplants a year. But the professors on that side say they are not \nproponents of that; they don't think it's part of the solution. It has \nto be a part of the solution in a country that uses 25 percent of all \nof the electricity in the world.\n  It would be embarrassing to say that France is ahead of us in this, \nbut they are. Eighty percent of the electricity in France is from \nnuclear powerplants. It is clean--no mercury, no sulfur, no nitrogen, \nno carbon. They meet the climate change standards today, and if they \nshift in France to driving electric cars and trucks, they will have no \nproblem. They can plug them in at night to recharge them. They will \nhave no pollution problems. They will reduce their dependence on oil. \nThey will save money in their pockets. They won't be exporting money to \nMiddle Eastern countries or to others that may be funding terrorists. \nThey will be ahead of us if we don't advance the technology we invented \nand begin to build five or six new nuclear plants a year for the \nforeseeable future.\n  We also need to take the ill-advised moratorium off oil shale. We \nhave plenty of oil shale in the ground and new environmentally sound \nways to get it out of the ground. That is a part of supply as well. \nMost of that is in our Western States.\n  We also need to give other States the opportunity to do what Texas, \nLouisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi already do, which is to explore 50 \nmiles offshore for oil and gas. We have plenty of that. We could be \nproducing an extra million barrels a day of oil and gas from offshore \nexploration, and by adding to the supply we would be reducing the price \nof gasoline and bringing it down below $4. We need to change the law \nand do that. Senator McCain says we need to do it.\n  What would it involve to give States that option? The Virginia State \nLegislature, for example, has said they would like to explore off the \ncoast of Virginia, at least for natural gas. So we need to lift the \nFederal moratorium and the Presidential Executive order that keeps them \nfrom doing that offshore. If I were the Governor of Virginia, I would \ncertainly want to do it. I would put the rigs 50 miles out where no one \ncould see them.\n\n  We know we can do it in an environmentally clean way. We heard a lot \nof bad things as a result of Hurricane Katrina, but we didn't hear of \none oil spill from any of the oil and gas rigs that are all in the Gulf \nof Mexico. So we know how to drill cleanly. The oil spills we have are \nfrom cargo freighters that are bringing oil from overseas to us. That \nis where the problem is. If we were exploring offshore for our own oil \nand gas, we would not only be lowering our gas prices, but we would be \nproviding States and the Federal Government with additional revenue as \nwell. Under the formula we passed in 2006 for Lease 181 in the Gulf of \nMexico, Virginia would get 37.5 percent of the dollars. What would that \ndo for Virginia? They already have a good higher education system, but \nI think if I were the Governor, I would say: Let's put a lot of that in \na trust fund for higher education and make the Virginia colleges and \nuniversities the best in the world\n\n[[Page S5717]]\n\nwithout raising taxes. Let's put some of it to nourish the beaches of \nVirginia. Let's maybe use some of it for roads or for health care or \nfor lowering taxes. They could do all of that with their three-eighths \nof those revenues.\n  We also said that one-eighth of the money from that offshore \nexploration in Lease 181 would go to the State side of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund for city parks and greenways and open spaces in \nPennsylvania and Tennessee and all across this country, which we have \nbeen trying to do for 40 years. The whole idea of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund enacted in the 1960s was to say: We will fund it up \nto $900 million a year from money from offshore oil and gas \nexploration; we recognize that exploration is an environmental burden, \nso we will turn part of it into an environmental benefit. We have never \nfully funded the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and this is a way to \ndo that.\n  There are other ideas--Senator Salazar, Senator Kyl, and I join in \nthis as well--to take some of the excessive money from offshore \ndrilling and fully fund the National Park Centennial Initiative that \nPresident Bush has proposed to celebrate the 100th anniversary of our \nNational Park System. I know of the excitement around the Great Smoky \nMountains National Park as we have added 55 new park personnel to that \npark and a lot of new private funding for park projects simply because \nof this Centennial Initiative the President has proposed. We need to \nfund it, and this would be a way to fund it.\n  So we need a supply of electricity if we are going to drive electric \ncars. We need oil shale if we are going to continue to produce oil, \nfrom which gasoline is made. We need offshore exploration--another way \nto increase the supply of oil.\n  I believe, as do many others on our side of the aisle, that we should \nalso be exploring in Alaska. Jay Leno said the other night that the \nDemocrats objected to that because they said it wouldn't produce any \noil for 10 years. Well, as Jay Leno said, that is what the Democrats \nsaid 10 years ago. Presidents and Senators are supposed to look ahead, \nto look down the road. If we can add a million barrels of oil a day \nfrom Alaska; if we can add a million barrels of oil a day from offshore \nexploration; if we can add 2 million barrels of oil a day from oil \nshale, which we can do; if we can build five or six nuclear plants a \nyear and help us create carbon-free, clean energy so we can electrify \nour cars and trucks and reduce our demand for oil, then we will have \nlower gas prices because we will be honoring the immutable law of \nsupply and demand which says find more and use less.\n  The difference between us is that on this side of the aisle we \nbelieve in the law of supply and demand: find more and use less. On \nthat side of the aisle, they seem to believe in a different economics, \nwhich is use less. They want to repeal supply and only insist on \ndemand. So there is a fundamental difference.\n  I am glad Senator McCain must have gone to a different college of \neconomics than the one I think I sense on the other side of the aisle. \nHe has suggested that we do both, that we increase our supply and we \nreduce our demand by finding more oil and using less oil. He has \nspecifically supported offshore drilling if States want to do that. He \nhas specifically said we should lift the moratorium on oil shale and \nproceed in an environmentally responsible way to explore for that. He \nhas said as well that we need to move ahead with five or six nuclear \npowerplants a year, and he has been a strong advocate for green \nbuildings, for fuel efficiency, and for plug-in electric vehicles. At \nthe same time, he has said he believes we need to take steps to deal \nwith climate change, emphasizing the importance of nuclear power \nbecause that provides 20 percent of all of our electricity but 70 \npercent of our carbon-free power.\n  So I look forward to the debate over the next few months. It is \nbeginning to come into shape. Two different views of economics: an \nattractive young head of the department from that side of the aisle who \nwants to change the law of supply and demand to only include demand, \nwhich apparently would leave us with a national windmill policy; or a \nmore grizzled Senator who apparently went to a different college of \neconomics who believes in the old-fashioned law of supply and demand \nand would like to focus on both.\n  This will be a debate worthy of the Senate. It will be important to \nall of those Tennesseans who are writing me wanting that $4 per gallon \nprice to go down. My recommendation to them is to vote for Senators and \nvote for Presidents who will both increase our supply and reduce our \ndemand--who will find more, use less, and not try to invent a new \ntheory of economics which will leave us with our lights off and our gas \nprices high.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     From: Pat Taylor\n     Sent: Thu 6/12/2008 9:43 AM\n     To: Alexander,Senator\n     Cc: Susan Luker\n     Subject: Gas Prices Affect Meals On Wheels In East Tennessee\n       Dear Senator Alexander: My name is Pat Taylor.

We are currently serving \n     hundreds of elderly and disabled citizens in the counties of \n     Cocke, Grainger, Hamblen, Jefferson, Monroe, and Sevier. I am \n     writing to you on behalf of all of these homebound clients \n     who receive our meals five days a week. We currently drive \n     1,100 miles per day to deliver these meals. With the increase \n     in food costs as well as gasoline prices, this has become a \n     burden for our program and our delivery aides. They use their \n     own vehicles to deliver. With gas prices rising daily, the \n     mileage reimbursement they receive desperately needs to be \n     increased in order for meal delivery to continue.\n       Anything you can do will be greatly appreciated. Many \n     elderly and disabled Tennesseans are able to avoid being \n     institutionalized because of the daily contact and nutrition \n     provided by the Senior Nutrition Program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Pat Taylor,\n            Director, Douglas Cherokee Economic Authority, Senior \n     Nutrition Program.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Kathryn Stewart\n     Sent: Fri 6/13/2008 2:19 PM\n     To: Alexander, Senator\n     Cc: Dr. Kathryn Stewart\n     Subject: Gas Prices\n       I am the School Nutrition Director for our school system. \n     The rise is food and gas prices has pushed me to raise school \n     lunch prices $.50 per meal, and I still project I will lose \n     $250,000 this year, I have always been in the black. I worry \n     now many people will not be able to pay the increased price \n     for school lunches, and I will lose even more. I have no \n     solutions. What can I do?

I am a third year medical student \n     at Quillen College of Medicine. Currently, we are able to get \n     loans for cost of living based on a budget set by the State \n     University system. During our third year of medical training, \n     we rotate through the Johnson City Medical Center and \n     hospitals in Kingsport and Bristol. For those of us who live \n     in Johnson City, traveling to these other towns costs $250-\n     500 a month (reported from classmates). This is not to \n     mention the students in the rural tract who travel to rural \n     towns such as Mountain City and Rogersville. The cost of gas \n     and groceries has been overwhelming and our governed budget \n     is not covering the costs (transportation allotment, which \n     includes expected car maintenance, is approximately $283 per \n     month). My classmates, with whom I have spoken about these \n     issues, report that they rely upon credit cards to survive \n     toward the end of the semester. Many of them pay off the \n     credit cards when they receive their next loan check, which \n     leaves them over budget once again at the end of the next \n     semester.\n       On a personal note, my family lives in Tullahoma, TN. \n     During my first year of medical school, I was unable to \n     travel to Tullahoma as often as I would have liked due to a \n     very busy schedule. Now the limiting factor is the cost of \n     gasoline, and that's just sad. Please help me and my fellow \n     colleagues make it through the semester without accruing more \n     debt.\n       And, please help me see my family.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Abbie R.

Other \n     years this has helped us to achieve more than we could've \n     with just our jobs. This year our costs have gone up \n     astronomically, and sales\n\n[[Page S5718]]\n\n     are down by more than half. People can't come to the events \n     because of fuel prices!! It has resulted in us not having \n     made one cent of profit yet this year!! It is discouraging to \n     work hard and not get ahead at all. We do not believe that \n     ``punishing'' (taxing) the oil companies will do any good; \n     the companies will expense that cost and pass it right on to \n     us and cut production! We must drill in our country and \n     develop new technologies.\n       Thanks for giving us the opportunity for input.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Jerry and Judy Wilson,\n     Monterey, TN.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Josh Yarbrough\n     Sent: Thu 6/12/2008 10:09 PM\n     To: Alexander, Senator\n     Subject: Gas Prices/Drilling Efforts\n       Dear Senator Alexander: I appreciate your efforts to help \n     Congress see how the American public is affected by high \n     gasoline prices. My story is that I am married with 3 \n     children. Four years ago, we moved to a larger house in the \n     city of Franklin, TN from farther out of town. Of course, we \n     purchased a home that stretched us a little, but we felt that \n     after 4 or 5 years of living here, it would be like our first \n     home--able to make extra payments due to increases in salary \n     over the 5 year period. Last month, we spent $300 at the \n     pump. So, what I'm seeing is that the gas prices are eating \n     into money that I would either be able to save or put toward \n     the house. Having this money available would help all \n     Americans, not just those that over-extended themselves with \n     the whole sub-prime mortgage/adjustable rate mortgage \n     ``crisis''.\n       I applaud the Republicans' efforts to make it possible for \n     Americans to drill for more oil in our own country. \n     Certainly, I agree that researching other forms of energy is \n     a good thing, but the fastest way to be independent of \n     foreign oil is to act decisively now by allowing for more \n     drilling in America. Further, I believe that the government \n     should not be heavily involved in finding the alternative \n     energy sources. I would much prefer to leave that to the \n     private sector. Why should my tax dollars be used for this, \n     when companies who seek profit are willing to do the \n     research?\n       Again, thank you for standing firm in your support of \n     drilling efforts in America! We are proud to have you \n     representing us!\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Joshua L. Yarbrough,\n                                                     Franklin, TN.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Large Defense Contract Awarded to Airbus\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 3 months ago, our U.S. Air Force made a \ndecision that is going to affect our military for decades. Our Air \nForce awarded one of the largest defense contracts in history to the \nEuropean company Airbus.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been here many times to talk about my \nnumerous concerns about this contract and about whether it is in the \nbest interest of our taxpayers and our service men and women for Airbus \nto supply our next generation of aerial refueling tankers. Those \ntankers refuel planes and aircraft that are stationed across the world. \nAs long as we, the United States, control the technology to build those \nrefueling tankers, we control our skies and our own security. But the \nPentagon has yet to justify this decision to give that contract to the \nEuropean company Airbus.\n  Within the next 24 hours, we expect the Government Accountability \nOffice to issue a ruling on one overarching question that has been \nraised about this contract and that is whether the Air Force followed \nthe letter of the law when it made that decision. This GAO decision \nwill not answer whether Airbus will supply the best plane for our \nmilitary, and it will not answer whether buying the Airbus tanker would \ndo permanent harm to our aerospace industry.\n  So I rise today to urge my colleagues to join with me and continue to \nfight to get those answers. It is common sense that before we, the \nCongress, finalize a $35 billion contract, we need to know why the Air \nForce chose a plane that is much bigger and less efficient than it \nasked for--one that cannot use hundreds of our runways, ramps, and \nhangars and one that costs billions of dollars more in fuel and \nmaintenance.\n  We, as Members of Congress, and the people we represent need to know \nwhether our Government should buy a plane that even the Air Force says \nis ``less survivable.'' That means it is less able to keep our men and \nwomen who are in them safe. We need to know what the effect on our \neconomy will be and the effect on our national security if we turn this \ncritical technology over to a company that is owned by a foreign \ngovernment.\n  I was out on the Boeing 767 line the day the Air Force announced its \ndecision. I will never forget the shock and dismay I saw on our \nworkers' faces. After all, they have been making our Nation's refueling \ntankers now for more than 50 years, and they know how important those \ntankers are to the military. In fact, I remember so well this one woman \nrushing over to me on the factory floor to tell me her son actually \nflies those refueling tankers for the Air Force and that she--an \nAmerican mom--wanted to be the one making them for him. She and workers \nacross this country want to know why. Why would we give this contract, \nthis Air Force contract, to a subsidized European company controlled by \nforeign governments that just want to put America's aerospace industry \nout of business and take away her job?\n\n  The U.S. Trade Representative is so concerned about the subsidies \nAirbus receives that it has brought a case against the EU before the \nWorld Trade Organization because of those illegal subsidies. We need to \nknow why in the world we would accuse Airbus of unfair trade practices \non one hand and then turn around and hand them a major piece of our \ndefense industry. We, as Members of Congress and representatives of the \nAmerican people, need to know why our Government would hand them this \ncontract now.\n  In May, employers cut 49,000 jobs. It was the largest 1-month jump in \nunemployment in this country in 22 years. Yet at the same time our \nadministration is sending 44,000 U.S. jobs overseas to build our Air \nForce refueling tankers, when we are hemorrhaging jobs at home in this \ncountry. It does not make sense to me.\n  Some of our colleagues are saying we need to move this process along \nquickly so we can get those planes into the hands of our airmen and \nairwomen. I agree. They need these planes. But this is a contract that \nwill affect our military, it will affect our taxpayers, and it will \naffect our decisions in this country for years to come. So we had \nbetter be thoughtful, conscientious, and thorough. Members of Congress \nhave a responsibility to thoroughly evaluate whether we are buying the \nbest plane for our taxpayers and our men and women who fly those \nplanes. So I hope my colleagues, as we hear from the GAO in the next 24 \nhours, will stand with me and ensure we get this contract right.\n  I see my colleague from Maryland is here to speak, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                 Moving Forward With Energy Legislation\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the people of Maryland and around the \nNation are angry and frustrated. Every time they fill the tank of their \nvehicle with gasoline or look at their utility bills, they get worried. \nI must tell you, they are frustrated and so am I as to why the \nRepublicans are blocking an opportunity for us to even take up this \nlegislation to deal with the rising energy costs and to deal with the \nenergy policies of this country.\n  Republicans have blocked consideration of S. 3044, the Consumer-First \nEnergy Act, and H.R. 6049, the Energy and Tax Extenders Act containing \nrenewable energy incentive programs. People in Maryland and around the \nNation know that when George Bush took the office of President, the \nprice of gasoline was $1.46 a gallon. It is now over $4 a gallon. They \nknow the impact this is having on their lives. There are people in \nMaryland; in Pennsylvania, the State of the Presiding Officer; and \naround this Nation who literally cannot afford to fill their tanks with \ngasoline. They are having to make tough decisions today.\n  There are small businesses that are going out of business because \nthey can't afford the increased energy cost of running their small \nbusinesses, and they do not have options as to how to shift costs in \norder to deal with these\n\n[[Page S5719]]\n\nrising costs without putting it onto the consumers. So this is having a \ndramatic impact on our economy.\n  The people of our Nation are asking us to put aside our partisan \ndifferences. This is too important a subject for the security of our \ncountry, for the economy of our Nation to continue partisan fighting. \nWe need to debate these issues and vote on these issues.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 3044, which provides some \nimmediate help to our consumers on energy cost. It deals with a limited \nnumber of subjects, but they are subjects that can have an impact on \nenergy costs now. It would repeal the tax subsidies that we give the \noil industry--the tax subsidies. We are providing $17 billion of tax \nrelief to the oil industries while they have record profits. Their \nprofits are at record numbers.\n  President Bush said on April 14, 2005 that if the cost of crude was \nat $55 a barrel, the oil industry didn't need additional incentives. \nThe President said: I will tell you, with $55-a-barrel oil, we don't \nneed incentives to oil and gas companies to explore. There are plenty \nof incentives. That was the President of the United States. Well, the \nprice of crude oil now is at $140 a barrel, so we certainly don't need \nto have taxpayers subsidizing the profits of the oil industry. This \nlegislation says: Let's use that money to make America secure. Let's \nput it into renewable energy sources here in America.\n  The legislation would also allow the President to impose a windfall \nprofits tax. I have heard a lot about that from my colleagues, but it \nsimply says that if you are making obscene profits, you should pay some \nadditional taxes. You could avoid the windfall profits tax. All you \nneed to do is invest the profits in clean, affordable, and domestically \nproduced renewable energy. In other words, invest in America's future \nand in America's security.\n  The legislation also goes after speculators. A large part of the cost \nat the pump today for gasoline is because we have investors speculating \nin oil futures, but they are not subject to the normal investment \nrules. They should have margin requirements to be able to speculate. We \nneed energy, we need gasoline at the pump, we don't need it held by \nspeculators, and this legislation would deal with that situation to \nhelp bring down the cost of gasoline.\n  It also deals with the collusive practices of the oil-supplying \ncountries. Let's subject them, to the extent we can, to fair antitrust \nlaws.\n  So this legislation would have an impact in trying to bring down the \ncost of gasoline today.\n  I know the President is going to make a statement saying we can drill \nour way out of this problem. We can't drill our way out of this \nproblem. America has 3 percent of the world's reserves in oil, and we \nconsume 25 percent. We can't drill our way out of it. ANWR, which is \nthe sensitive land in Alaska the President wants us to drill in, \ncontains .6 percent, less than 1 percent, of the world's reserves. We \nhave millions of acres that are open for exploration and drilling \ntoday. The oil industry could use those millions of acres to obtain \nmore energy, and it still wouldn't be enough to deal with our needs, \nbut it would help us on a temporary basis. ANWR represents only a very \nsmall part of that.\n  There are plenty of ways in which we can drill today, but it would \nnot solve our problems. Let me give you one comparison. If we had \npassed the increased energy efficiencies for our automobiles 20 years \nago rather than last year, we would have energy savings in America \nequivalent to more than three times the amount of oil we could get from \nthe ANWR reserves.\n  So in the short term, the bill we have before us is our best hope to \nbring down costs. It will help our consumers. But we do need an energy \npolicy for America. We need to be energy secure, and H.R. 6049, of \nwhich the Republicans are blocking consideration, that deals with \nrenewable energy, would help us obtain that. We need an energy policy \nin America that makes us secure from foreign imported oil. We have to \nbe an energy-independent America. We have to produce our own energy in \nAmerica so we can get off oil for the sake of our national security. We \nshouldn't be financing countries that disagree with our principles and \nour way of life. We need to be energy independent for our economy so we \ndon't have these unpredictable changes in energy costs in America.\n  One of the most frustrating things for American business is they need \nto plan for their costs. They can't plan today because we don't control \nour own energy. So we have to be energy independent for the purposes of \nour economy, and we also need to be energy independent for the sake of \nour environment. Global climate change is real and so we have to get \noff oil.\n  So for all those reasons, we need to invest in renewable energy, we \nneed to invest in better efficiencies, and H.R. 6049 allows us to move \nforward in doing that. Together we can enact legislation to help those \nfrustrated Maryland consumers and drivers and those who live in \nPennsylvania, the Presiding Officer's State, who are worried about \nwhether they will be able to get to work with the rising cost of \nenergy. We can help them today by putting aside our partisan \ndifferences and debating and voting on these issues.\n  This Nation can accomplish anything, if we set our minds to it. I \nknow we have support on both sides of the aisle for an energy policy \nthat makes us energy independent and secure. Let's deal with the \nimmediate problems of the gasoline and energy costs, let's deal with a \nlong-term energy policy that is in the best interest of this Nation, \nand let's start by debating these issues. Let's put aside the \nfilibuster, move forward, bring these bills to the floor of the Senate \nso we can do what Americans expect us to do--debate and act on this \ncritical issue to the future of our country.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       OIL PRICES AND EXPLORATION\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, gas prices this summer could easily be \ntriple what they were when President Bush took office. The dramatic \nincrease in oil prices brought prices for food up along with it, and \nfamilies are facing a painful financial choice when it comes time to \nfill their gas tank: Put a gallon of gas in the car or put a gallon of \nmilk on the kitchen table. When Americans are paying this much to fill \ntheir gas tanks, it is a drain on the whole economy. Businesses are \ncutting jobs, families have already eliminated nonessentials, and many \nare now cutting back on meals. Some people are even contemplating \nchanging their job because they can't afford the gas to get to work.\n  It has become painfully clear that we are in an oil crisis. Some of \nthe forces driving up prices are beyond immediate control--such as the \ndemand from China and India. But some of the factors offer \nopportunities for action.\n  First, market experts have testified before Congress that speculators \nare driving up prices far beyond where the natural forces of supply and \ndemand should take them. Second, we can take steps in this country to \nreduce our demand and our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Last week in the Senate, Democrats brought legislation forward that \nwould attack some of the root causes of the skyrocketing price of oil, \ncut down gas prices that are artificially high, and bring relief to \ndrivers at the pump. That bill, the Consumer-First Energy Act, would \nhave provided that relief by, among other things, ensuring that our \ncommodities markets are functioning fairly so prices can come down from \ntheir artificial highs. The supply- and-demand equation is roughly the \nsame as it was 2 years ago. Yet we have seen prices go through the \nroof. Experts say speculation could be adding anywhere between $50 and \n$80 a barrel to the price of oil.\n  In some respects, I am not surprised this is the one place in the \nmarket that doesn't seem to be regulated. We can see what happened \nunder the administration of a President and Vice President whose \npolitics have always been tied up with the oil companies for whom they \nused to work. Here you have the price of a barrel of oil that has risen \nfrom about $20 a barrel when President Bush took office to about $140 a \nbarrel right now.\n\n[[Page S5720]]\n\n  As we have seen that price rise, what happens? As the price of oil \nhas risen, the profits of big oil companies have risen--from about $20 \nbillion when President Bush took office to about $120 billion right \nnow. The price of oil goes up and profits go up as well. And as the \nprofits have risen for big oil, the price of gas that we pay at the \npump has risen--from under $1.50 a gallon when President Bush took \noffice, in many cases, to, in some cases, over $4 per gallon right now.\n  The Consumer-First Energy Act would have made sure that oil is traded \non a well-regulated, transparent market free from manipulation. But my \ncolleagues on the Republican side of the aisle said no to that \nlegislation. They said no to the American consumer because they \nobviously feel committed to say yes to big oil.\n  Yesterday, once again, the Senate had the chance to help free our \ncountry from the liquid shackles of foreign oil. The Baucus substitute \namendment--had we been able to offer it, had we not been stopped by our \nRepublican colleagues--would have spurred the development of renewable \nenergy by providing almost $20 billion in tax incentives for investment \nin the production, transportation, and conservation of energy.\n  In order to encourage renewable energy industries to build to the \nscale we need them to, we have to send renewable producers the clear \nmessage that their product will have continued support in the future. \nSo the bill would have extended investment tax credits for 6 years to \nensure the continued development of solar energy, fuel cells, and \nmicroturbines, among others.\n  We have seen how important this is in my home State of New Jersey \nwhere the solar industry has created thousands of jobs and helped \n``green'' the Garden State.\n  The bill would have encouraged the production of cellulosic biofuels, \nincluding cellulosic ethanol. It would have encouraged the development \nand use of biodiesel and renewable diesel, encouraged further \ninvestments in advanced technology vehicles, and created a tax credit \nfor alternative refueling stations so that the infrastructure exists in \nour country to make those vehicles viable.\n  So in the face of a broad-based package to encourage new green energy \nsources that would have helped bring down gas prices and end our \ndependence on foreign oil, what did my colleagues on the Republican \nside of the aisle say? They said no again. Republicans said no to \nhelping American consumers because they could not help but say yes to \nbig oil.\n  It is no surprise then when my distinguished colleague from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, delivered his big energy speech yesterday, where did he \ndo it? He did it in the oil capital of the United States. The big plan \nPresident Bush and his Republican allies in Congress are pushing is \nanother example of big oil writing our energy policy, as they have done \nfor the last 8 years.\n  And Senator McCain repeats it. That plan comes down to one thing: \nDrilling, drilling, drilling along the coasts of our country. When John \nMcCain or George Bush talk about opening our coastline to drilling, \nthey make it sound like gasoline is going to gush out from that drill \nstraight out of the ground and right into your car.\n  What they either do not want to tell the public or simply ignore is \nthat, in fact, it will take at least a decade--a decade--to see any \nproduction out of these areas, and even then, the Energy Information \nDepartment tells us this will be a drop in the bucket.\n  Why give the oil companies another handout when they are sitting on \n68 million acres of land leased from the American people which they \nhave yet to explore? I find it hard to believe that Senator McCain \nwould say the Federal Government discourages offshore oil production \nwhen more than 80 percent of the oil that is offshore is already open \nfor production, and oil companies own more than 30 million acres of \nleases in Federal waters they have not used--that they have not used.\n  The vast majority of oil and natural gas resources on Federal land is \nalready open for drilling, and it is not being tapped. Currently, oil \ncompanies are not producing oil or gas on 68 million of the more than \n91 million acres of Federal land under their control. And 31 million of \nthose 68 million acres are offshore.\n  Offshore, these companies are producing on only about 20 percent of \nthe acres they hold, while onshore they are producing less than 30 \npercent of the acres they hold. So one has to wonder, when big oil \npushes relentlessly for more and more land and water to drill, even \nwhen they have millions of acres they have yet to use, it makes us \nwonder if they are not just exploiting this oil crisis to expand the \nreserves on their books in order to inflate their share price. \nCertainly, the needs of American consumers are not what these CEOs are \nlooking out for.\n  If the Senate does not act now, billions of dollars' worth of \nresearch and development tax credits will expire, impeding innovation \nand discovery. As the world becomes increasingly globalized and \ntechnology driven, we must increase our investments in research and \ndevelopment in order to maintain our position as a world leader in the \n21st century.\n  If the Senate does not act, billions of dollars invested in \nalternative, clean sources of energy will cease, and so will our \nprogress to become energy independent. I have heard my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle decry the rising price of gas and talk \nabout developing alternative sources of energy.\n  But when they had the opportunity yesterday, once again they said no, \nas they said no last week on having market speculation taken out of the \nprice of oil, therefore the price of gas.\n  By the way, what would have been offered yesterday had we been able \nto proceed--and hopefully we can proceed on today--is that millions of \nAmericans subject to the alternative minimum tax, placing unfair and \nunnecessary tax increases on middle-class families, could have gotten a \nbreak under the Baucus substitute. That is all that would have been \nable to happen.\n  Finally, here is the bigger picture. We have 2 percent of this \nworld's oil reserves, and we consume 25 percent of the world's oil. We \nare never going to meet growing domestic demand with shrinking domestic \nsupply. The only way to make these numbers balance is to reduce our \ndependence on oil by increasing production of renewable fuels.\n  If we are going to have a secure energy future, there is a lot more \nwe need to do to explore besides oil reserves. We had better start \nexploring the outer reaches of our creativity, not lining the inner \npockets of the corporate oil elite. It is time to say yes to tapping \nour industriousness, harnessing our powers of innovation, and summoning \nup the will to change, that change that has made this country great.\n  We have an opportunity to break our dependence. We have an \nopportunity to tell the oil companies, too, by the way: Pursue the 68 \nmillion acres of land and water you already have licenses and leases \nfor and stop telling us to go potentially risk our environmentally \nsensitive areas in pursuit of oil that will not be achieved for a \ndecade, will not do anything about gas prices today, when you are not \neven moving on the 68 million acres to which you already have access. \nUltimately, all it would do is increase your profits, but it would \ncause States, such as my State of New Jersey, where tourism is the \nsecond largest driver of its economy, to risk the possibility of an oil \nspill on the shores of New Jersey's beaches and kill billions of \ndollars that annually are generated as a result of that.\n  So I do not want to hear from the capital of big oil, our dear \ncolleague and the presumptive Republican nominee tell us the solution \nto our problem is to drill more, when 68 million acres that the big oil \ncompanies have are already not being pursued, when ultimately it will \nnot produce a penny of reduction in gas prices.\n  When we had the opportunity to make a real impact last week on the \nbill that would take the speculation out of the marketplace, stop price \ngouging, and at the same time, when we have an opportunity today, \nbefore the Senate, to make sure that we extend those renewable tax \ncredits, give us better fuel-efficient vehicles, give us better \nrenewable energy sources, and break our addiction to the reality that \nthe reality is that the overwhelming part of oil in this world resides \nnot here in the United States but abroad.\n  That is our challenge and opportunity. It is time to say yes to \nAmerican consumers, time to say no to big oil.\n\n[[Page S5721]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the important work of \nmy Oregon colleagues--Representatives DeFazio, Hooley, Blumenauer, and \nWu--who are coming through today for an Oregon icon, our special Mount \nHood. Last year, Senator Smith and I introduced the Lewis and Clark \nMount Hood Wilderness Act to create an additional 128,000 acres of \nwilderness around the mountain. Our Mount Hood legislation has passed \ncommittee, and I am confident that now, with the House of \nRepresentatives, the other body, going forward with a companion \nmeasure, it is going to be possible to get this measure enacted and \nmove on to a host of additional important land issues for my home \nState.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Alaska.\n\n\n                            Oil Speculation\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as Americans travel with families over \nthe Fourth of July and for summer vacations--on cruises, RV trips, or \non sightseeing tours, to Alaska, hopefully--they are going to be \nshocked by the price of fuel at the pump. This is because the consumers \nof fuel--from airlines to truckers to the fishing captains of the boats \noff the Pacific in my State--must in effect bid against speculators in \nthe oil markets, speculators who will never take delivery of fuel but \nbid up the price and turn it into an inflated profit. Some people will \nbe forced to cancel summer plans--or worse, close their businesses--\nprimarily because fuel costs have increased so much.\n  Today, the average price of a gallon of gas is $4.08. In some parts \nof our State of Alaska, the price of a gallon of gas is over $8. I \nbelieve Congress must take action now to address this issue before \nAmericans can no longer afford even basic activities and the goods they \nneed.\n  Most foreign producers believe Americans will pay any price for oil, \nand Congress validates this each day we fail to implement a \ncomprehensive energy strategy. Americans are being taken advantage of \nnot only by OPEC but by speculators right here in our own country who \nare exempt from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \nHistorically, this has not been a bad problem. Only recently has \nspeculation reached these unsustainable levels.\n  Some speculation when oil consumers use oil futures is bona fide. For \ninstance, an airline might buy fuel at an advanced price for delivery \nin the future to make certain that it has a supply in the future. That \nis legitimate. There is no problem with brokers facilitating even this \ntype of purchase. But Congress must recognize that speculators who are \nnot consumers of oil have taken control of our market. Ultimately, the \nprice Americans must pay for oil and other fuels skyrockets because of \ntheir speculation. Even major institutional investors have taken up oil \nfutures markets as a major asset class in their financial portfolios. \nIn the last 5 years, investments in commodity index funds have jumped \nfrom $13 billion to $260 billion due in large part to oil futures. Let \nme repeat that. Investments in the commodity index funds jumped from \n$13 billion to $260 billion due in large part to oil futures.\n  Excessive speculation in oil futures is causing our economy to \ncontinue its decline. Congress must mandate the CFTC to stringently \nregulate these exchanges.\n  Let me show this chart, Mr. President. This shows the period from \n1986 through 2007. The gold marks on the chart are actual trade volumes \nof oil futures in NYMEX and red is the price of the oil that was paid \non those deliveries. It is easy to see that as these spikes have \noccurred, they have not been related to the delivery of oil, they have \nbeen related to the price of oil--just speculation in terms of the \nfuture delivery of our oil. One economist told me that 30 to 35 percent \nof what we pay at the pump for gasoline today is caused by \nspeculation--these so-called investors. I call them speculators, and I \nthink they all ought to be in jail. This is a terrible situation, \nactually.\n  Our oil crisis has combined with our economic instability and \nexcessive oil speculation to become a vicious cycle. As energy prices \ncontinue to cripple our economy, inflation rises and the dollar \nweakens. One of the few places that investors see a safe bet is in the \nenergy market. They know that worldwide oil demand is increasing and \nwill continue to increase, and so they bid higher and higher for \nspeculative purposes on the delivery of that oil to our own country.\n  Three weeks ago, I stated on the floor that the IEA predicted world \noil demand to increase from 85 million barrels a day to 116 million \nbarrels a day. If that is the future of oil, of course the investors \nwant to increase their position in oil futures. Who wouldn't want to do \nthat, particularly when there is no control over them at all on how \nmuch they can raise the price just by trading paper that represents \nfuture delivery of oil?\n  I believe that immediately the CFTC needs to conduct a review to \nexamine where unregulated trading in oil futures has adversely affected \nthe market--the price we pay at the pump--and to determine what \nregulations need to be adjusted. I would also like to have full \ndisclosure from any entity or person taking part in the oil speculation \ngame so that the American people can see who is buying and selling \ntheir energy but never even hoping to accept delivery. They are just \nbuying pieces of paper to represent the future delivery of oil and they \nare speculating and raising the price to the entity that needs the oil \nin the future.\n  There should be a limit on the extent to which investors in petroleum \nfutures can increase their positions in this important commodity \nmarket. It should be a crime when spectators knowingly manipulate oil \nprices and drive up the price of fuel at the expense of the American \nfamily. Such actions undermine our country's energy stability and our \nenergy security. American consumers are at the mercy of foreign oil \nsellers and domestic oil buyers already, and they should not be forced \nto pay so much more because of speculation.\n  Last year, the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and I each \ncrossed party lines, to a certain extent, to get together to pass a \nchange in the CAFE standards. That was the first Federal increase in \nvehicle fuel efficiency in three decades. Senator Feinstein has been a \nchampion of conservation, and I applaud her.\n  Now we are working together again, on S. 3131. Under the terms of \nthis bill, the CFTC will be required to identify and crack down on the \noil commodity futures markets that have spun out of control. This may \ninvolve the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Intercontinental \nExchange--so-called ICE--and even foreign markets, if necessary, to \naddress this serious problem. Our bill probably needs to be improved to \nmake it even more certain that speculators in oil futures will be \ncharged with a serious crime, and they should have serious penalties.\n  The time is now to act against speculators. I hope the Senate will \nlead in this and try to crack down on speculators. I predict that if we \ndo, we can break this bubble. If we can reduce the price by at least 30 \npercent by prosecuting the speculators, I think we should do it, and we \nshould do it before we go home next week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                     THE FINANCIAL CONSUMER HOTLINE\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a bill that is \nbeing introduced in this body by Senator Schumer and myself that is \ndesigned to help people throughout our country who are having \ntremendous difficulties navigating the various financial institutions \nand who they should talk to when they have various complaints. Right \nnow there are five different institutions of Government that oversee \nfinancial institutions throughout our country. I am on the Banking \nCommittee, and I will tell you that if I had a complaint or something I \nwanted to ask about a financial institution in the State of Tennessee, \nI would have no idea who I should call in regard to that particular \ninstitution. It is not known to the public generally whether \ninstitutions are governed by State charter or governed by Federal \ncharter or by which Federal charter they might be governed.\n  We have introduced a bill called the Financial Consumer Hotline. What \nthis will allow people throughout the country to do is to dial a toll-\nfree number and someone on the other end of that toll-free number would \ndirect that call immediately to the right place. Right now, the FDIC \nhas to redirect 54 percent of the calls it receives to other entities. \nYou can imagine, if you are a consumer in Tennessee or a consumer in \nMaryland or a consumer in Virginia, how frustrating that would be, to \nhave an issue and to have to take time, if you will, to find out about \nthat issue and to not know who to call.\n  When I was mayor of the city of Chattanooga, we had a similar problem \nin that people did not know how to access city government regarding the \nmyriad of issues with which they had to deal. They did not know which \ndepartment of government to contact. We realized that and established \nsomething called a 311 number. Cities all across the country have done \nthe same thing. What that has done is allow people to dial one number \nand call in about any issue and have that registered and know that is \ngoing to be dealt with.\n  I certainly appreciate the tremendous partnership we have established \non this issue with Senator Schumer from New York, who also serves on \nthe Banking Committee and is also aware of the tremendous complications \npeople go through in trying to get to the bottom of whatever issue it \nis.\n  This bill has been introduced. I hope my colleagues in the Senate \nwill consider this legislation. It is something that, by the way, does \nnot cost the taxpayers of this country a dime. There is an entity that \nis directed through regulatory bodies to do this. This is something \nthat does not come out of the taxpayers' pocket. It does not come out \nof our Treasury. I think it will enhance the ability of people \nthroughout our country to navigate and get to the bottom of issues they \nmight have with financial institutions.\n  I notice no one here wishing to speak, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you travel into Maryland or Illinois or \nanywhere across America and ask people what is on your mind, they are \ngoing to tell you it is gasoline prices. Why? Because they have to fill \nthe tank each week and cannot believe how much they are paying with the \ncredit cards and cash in their wallet going out in record amounts to \nfill their cars and trucks and try to get on with their daily lives.\n  Then you go driving down any street in America, there is that big \nsign right in your face: $4.08, $4.25. It is a constant reminder of the \nproblems we face. We have tried, on the Democratic side, to move some \nlegislation to deal with this situation. We tried last week to deal \nwith the energy security bill that would have found a way, we think, to \nstart creating an environment to bring down these prices.\n  It was an effort that most people agree is long overdue. There is a \n$17 billion subsidy to the oil industry. Why would you do that when \nthis industry is recording record profits, not just for their industry \nbut for any American business?\n  We have also tried to deal with energy tax incentives for wind power \nand solar power and things that are the source of power and energy for \nAmerica's economy in the future. Twice now, not once but twice, the \nRepublicans have refused to join us in even bringing these measures to \nthe floor. They keep stopping us cold.\n  The Senate's 51 Democrats and 41 Republicans, with absences, with a \n60-vote requirement for most major legislation, is within the power of \nthe Republicans to stop debate. They have done it repeatedly.\n  There is also a concern across America because the response from the \nRepublican side, not just from our colleagues in the Senate but from \nSenator McCain as well as the President, has been to call on us to \ndrill our way out of this problem.\n  I am afraid people who suggest we can drill for more oil in America \nand take care of our problems do not understand basic math. The United \nStates uses 25 percent of the world's oil supply; we are big users for \na big economy. Do you know what we have in oil reserves out of all the \nknown oil reserves in the world? We have 3 percent, 3 percent of the \nreserves and 25 percent of the usage. You cannot drill your way out of \nthe situation.\n  They do not understand as well that currently there are Federal lands \navailable for drilling that are not being put into production; lands \nthat have already been leased by oil companies. These are lands owned \nby the people of the United States, and the right to drill for oil and \ngas has been leased to a private company that sits on it and does \nnothing.\n  You say to yourself: Well, it cannot be too much because we need oil, \nit is so valuable these days. Oil and gas companies--let me show this \nchart--hold leases to nearly 68 million acres of Federal land that are \nnot producing oil.\n  This land could produce 4.8 million barrels of oil every day. That is \nsix times the peak production of any drilling in Alaska for the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. Every time you ask a Republican what is the \nproblem, they say: Man, if we could drill in Alaska, everything would \nbe just fine. Do you know how many acres are in Alaska? There are 1.5 \nmillion. The oil companies are sitting on leases for 68 million acres \nnow that they are not drilling.\n  If they did not think they were valuable, they would not have bought \nthe leases. But they did. They wait year after year, sitting on these \nleases and keep throwing in our face: Alaska, Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, not telling us it would take 8 to 10 years to bring the first \nbarrel of crude oil out of Alaska, and it would have a minimal impact \non the price of gasoline.\n  Let me show you some charts which kind of tell the story about these \n68 million acres in more graphic terms. There are 68 million acres \nleased to oil companies. These are offshore, 33.5 million leased acres \nunused offshore; 34.5 million leased acres unused onshore.\n  Take a look at the Gulf of Mexico region. I know it is hard to pick \nthis up in my presentation. But the red areas are areas currently under \nlease that are not producing oil and gas, owned by the Federal \nGovernment, leased to private oil companies, and not in production.\n  The blue dots are in production. Look at all the opportunity. So when \nthe President has a press conference, or Senator McCain has a press \nconference, and says: We need to have offshore drilling, the obvious \nquestion, Senator, Mr. President, is: What about all these lands, 68 \nmillion acres of which are under lease right now for drilling and not \nbeing used?\n  Take a look at this as well. I see Senator Dodd has arrived on the \nfloor. He has been one of the proponents of this particular point of \nview. I thank him for this. He is welcome to take a look at the charts \nand use them at any time in the future.\n  Here are 34.5 million acres leased to companies on the onshore site. \nLook at the Western part of the United States. All this red area is \nFederal land currently leased to oil companies for production not in \nproduction. Now take a look at Alaska, 1.5 million acres. That is what \nthey cannot wait to get into.\n  The honest answer is the oil companies have opportunities now to \nproduce\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\nmore oil and gas. It is time for us to stop hearing the excuses. We \nhave to look to the reality. The reality is the oil companies are \nmaking profits at recordbreaking levels. The reality is speculation is \ndriving up the price of oil, and the reality is the President of the \nUnited States has yet to call the oil company executives into the Oval \nOffice to tell them they are wrecking the economy.\n  He has yet to call them in and say: For goodness sakes, start \ndrilling on the land you already lease from the Federal Government. \nInstead, it is always the next horizon--if we could just get into \nAlaska, if we could just get into the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  We shouldn't have to compromise our health or our environment to make \nsure our economy is strong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to continue for 5 minutes in \nmorning business and that time not be deducted from the already \nreserved morning business of 2 hours on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Have no doubt, drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge isn't going to have a dramatic impact when it comes to the \nworld's supply of oil. Even the Department of Energy's Energy \nInformation Administration admits that. By the time the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge would be at peak production, which wouldn't take place \nuntil the year 2030, 22 years from now, refuge oil would make up only \nsix-tenths of 1 percent of the world's oil. If one listens to some of \nthe political rhetoric, they would think there is this vast resource of \noil in Alaska that is going to come to our rescue. It is not. It is a \ndrop in the bucket when we consider today's high gasoline prices. In \nfact, the effect at the gas pump wouldn't be felt for over 20 years, \nand then it is only pennies a gallon.\n  The Arctic Wildlife Refuge is one of America's last pristine, \nuntouched areas. It is home to more than 200 wildlife species, \nincluding polar bears, musk ox, and caribou. President Dwight \nEisenhower set this area aside over 50 years ago and said: This is \nsomething we need to preserve. This is a once-in-a-lifetime-and-beyond \nopportunity to protect some treasure for future generations.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator from Illinois yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I have been listening to the Senator's statement. Today \nI understand the President wants to lift bans on drilling; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is my understanding.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I missed part of the Senator's statement. Don't the \nmassive oil companies already have substantial acreage they could start \ndrilling on right now?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Maryland is correct. There is 68 million \nacres currently under lease to oil companies, Federal land owned by the \npeople for which oil companies are paying money each year for the right \nto drill for oil, 68 million acres and no drilling taking place. So \nwhen the President announces: We just have to find more Federal land to \ndrill on, the obvious question is, why aren't they drilling on the 68 \nmillion acres offshore and onshore they currently have under lease?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I find that shocking. I note that the 68 million acres \nis about six ANWRs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If we consider the 1.5 million acres on which they want \nto drill in ANWR, it is 50 times.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is not fuzzy math.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is not fuzzy math. This 68 million acres would be \nthe size of my home State of Illinois and its adjoining State of \nIndiana together. That is how much they currently have under lease to \ndrill for oil that they are not touching.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the Senator agree, rather than change policies to \nprevent gouging of consumers and speculation in the market, they would \nrather change the subject?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is clearly what they are doing. Anyone who has had a \ncrying baby knows what a pacifier is. You try to get the pacifier in \nthe baby's mouth so they will calm down. They may still be hungry or \ncrying for some other reason, but you try to quiet them down. That is \nwhat we are hearing in response.\n  When people say drill in Alaska or drill offshore, they want to quiet \nus down because when we look at the numbers, the numbers do not \ncompute. If we are going to be honest about energy sources, there is a \nlimit to how much we can drill in territory controlled by America. \nThere is much more we have to do to lessen our dependence on foreign \noil. We are talking about domestic sources--ethanol, biofuels, diesel. \nWe are talking about renewable and sustainable sources of energy such \nas wind power and solar power that would not destroy the planet with \nglobal warming. That is the big challenge.\n  Sadly, for 7\\1/2\\ years, this administration has ignored it. Now we \nare in a terrible situation. I wish this President would show \nleadership and bring in the oil company executives, sit them down in \nthe White House, and tell them they can't keep demanding these high \nprofits at the expense of American families and businesses. Tell them \nto start drilling on lands they are currently leasing; try to challenge \nAmerica to move forward in a fair way to have affordable energy.\n  I am glad the Senator from Maryland joined me in this conversation. I \nknow she has an important agenda she will initiate now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of \nlegislation that I think will help to address some of the most \nimportant challenges facing our Nation's economy today. The Renewable \nEnergy and Job Creation Act of 2008 is a critical step toward forever \nbreaking the crippling hold that foreign oil has on our Nation. It will \nprovide American entrepreneurs with incentives to develop new, \nenvironmentally safe energy technologies and create jobs that will stay \nin the United States, while strengthening all our communities. The bill \nwill also provide important tax breaks for middle and lower income \nfamilies at a time when the economic pressures on them are enormous.\n  To be sure, Americans are waking up to bad news about the economy \neach and every day. For months now we have watched as prices for gas \nand food have climbed. We have witnessed a foreclosure crisis that has \nravaged our economy, and put 7,000 to 8,000 Americans in danger of \nlosing their homes each day to say nothing of the 15,000-16,000 \nAmericans who become neighbors to homes in foreclosure. As if this did \nnot paint a dismal enough picture, since January of this year the \nAmerican labor market has hemorrhaged more than 324,000 jobs and the \nnumber of people seeking unemployment benefits has hit 8.5 million.\n  The time has come to change how our economy operates--and that starts \nwith what our economy largely runs on. The time has come to end our \ndependence on oil.\n  Each day new energy technologies are being developed and advanced, \nand these technologies need help to grow and become viable, cost-\neffective alternatives to oil. For nearly a century, technological \ninnovation and the intellectual capital of our industries have been the \nengine driving American prosperity. But this administration's repeated \nquest to open more of Alaska and more of Florida's coast to drilling \ncomes at a high price indeed--not only at the cost of our environment \nbut also long-term economic stability.\n  By extending tax provisions such as the research and development tax \ncredit, the solar energy and fuel cell investment tax credit and the \nrenewable energy production tax credit, we make a bold statement to the \nworld. We would be saying that the United States is dead serious about \nclean, sustainable, energy independence.\n  The State of Connecticut is home to firms who are at the cutting edge \nof wind and solar energy development. These firms are creating new \njobs, in emerging industries, that will be serving all Americans--jobs \nthat cannot and will not be outsourced, like so many have been under \nthe Bush tax regime.\n  Of course, this bill provides so much more than energy tax breaks. It \nalso extends the child tax credit, the qualified tuition deduction and \nother provisions that help lower and middle-income families make ends \nmeet, and afford higher education costs. According to the Joint \nEconomic Committee,\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\nfrom 2000-2007 the median household income in Connecticut has increased \nby a mere 1 percent. Meanwhile, the cost of a gallon of gasoline in our \nState consistently tops the national average, and the cost of going to \ncollege in the State has risen by 29.1 percent since 1999.\n  For Connecticut, the need to act is clear. And with this bill, we \nare.\n  This legislation is paid for. The cost of these tax provisions will \nnot, as the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 did, merely pass the cost on \nto our children and grandchildren. This bill provides crucial \nincentives for job creation, as well as middle-class tax relief, but it \nalso pays for these benefits. It does so by changing the tax rules for \nexecutive compensation, and delays a rule that would provide incentives \nto firms operating abroad. And so not only do we hope to offset some of \nthe economic ills that America is currently struggling with, this \nlegislation also offers a big step toward restoring fiscal \nresponsibility to our government, which this administration has utterly \nabandoned.\n  Now, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are opposed to \nthis fiscally responsible legislation for no other reason than that \nthey are opposed to paying for tax breaks--opposed to the belief that \nfuture generations should not be stuck with our bill.\n  I see it differently--as does the business community of our Nation \nwhich supports these offsets for a simple reason:\n  Because they recognize the benefits that this legislation will \nprovide not just to their bottom lines but to our economy.\n  Unfortunately, some in this body remain unconvinced--unconvinced that \nthese tax provisions will spur new job creation, move us further \ntowards energy independence, and restart our economy.\n  On June 9, a consortium of more than 300 different American \nbusinesses signed a letter to Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley urging the Senate to work together in a bipartisan manner to \npass this bill. These businesses represent some of the largest \nemployers in our Nation, and at this moment the partisan paralysis that \nis affecting this body has put them in an awkward position. Many of \nthese provisions are set to expire in December, and now is the time \nmany of these employers are working to plan ahead and solidify new \ncontracts, and sign new employees. They are making decisions about \ntheir futures. A recent study estimated that if we do not extend the \ntax provisions in this bill, we will not only lose $19 billion in clean \nenergy investment, but also 116,000 potential green jobs.\n  It is time for us to recognize that to get our economy back on track, \nwe must lead. We must make critical decisions about the future of our \nNation. And above all, we must put politics aside and work on behalf of \nnot our political parties but the American people. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this critically important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5724-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take the floor today as the dean of \nthe Democratic women in the Senate. I say to my colleagues and to all \nwho are watching: We women are mad as hell, and we don't want to take \nit anymore. We are mad that in this institution, when all is said and \ndone, more gets said than gets done.\n  We are here today, united as Democratic women, to be a voice, a voice \nfor change. We have a checklist for change we think we can do before \nthis Congress adjourns.\n  These are issues that focus on the big picture of what our country is \nfacing, but they also focus on the impact these issues have on \nfamilies. We look at macroissues that affect the world and the \nmacaroni-and-cheese issues that affect families.\n  In order to get things done, women have checklists in their daily \nlives--whether it is to get the laundry done or pick the kids up from \nschool. We have a checklist on what we want to do in terms of a \nlegislative agenda. This is not about gender; it is about an agenda. We \ninvite the good men of the Senate to join us, and we hope that people \nfrom the other side will join us. We want to work to bring about \nchange, and we start with wanting to end the gridlock.\n  Look at these issues for which we stand. We want to provide equal pay \nfor equal work, good jobs that stay in the United States, we want to \nmake health care affordable, we want to take care of our military \nfamilies and veterans. If they fought over there, they should have a \nsafety net back here. We also want to restore America's credibility in \nthe world, protect our environment. We are looking out for gas, and we \nare looking out for groceries. We want to make sure there is another \nFEMA. And, along the way, we protect the family checkbook. We want to \nmake sure we get rid of the boondoggles that are eating up our Federal \nbudget.\n  For me, I am the leadoff. But every woman here has an issue to which \nshe will be speaking. What do I want to speak to? I want to speak to \nequal pay for equal work.\n  Members might recall a few weeks ago we brought legislation to the \nfloor to correct the gap in wage discrimination law. We lost that, but \nI said when the vote was over: The issue is not gone. I called upon the \nwomen to put their lipstick on, square their shoulders, suit up, and \nfight for an American revolution. This is why we are here today. This \nis another salvo.\n  Many people think, wage discrimination, didn't we solve that? No. \nWage discrimination still exists. Women are earning just 77 cents for \nevery dollar our male counterparts make. We can see this now in the \nfamous Ledbetter v. Goodyear case. Lilly Ledbetter, a hard-working \nwoman, challenged the system. She didn't find out until years later \nthat she was being paid less than her male counterparts. She took it to \nthe EEOC. The corporation fought her every step of the way. It ended up \nin the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court made an outrageous decision. \nThey said she waited too long to file her complaint. The Court also \nsaid she didn't do it in time.\n  We think it is about time we change the law. What we want to do is \nbring back the Lilly Ledbetter legislation called the Fair Pay \nRestoration Act. We want to bring it back up for a vote because equal \npay for equal work is about fairness. It is about justice. It is about \nrespect. It is going to close the loophole on the so-called statute of \nlimitations on when one can file a wage discrimination case. We believe \nthe current practice has been a good one, but we disagree with the \nSupreme Court.\n  We are going to bring it back up for a vote. We ask our colleagues to \njoin us. We don't want our agenda to die in parliamentary \nentanglements. What we want to do is untangle this law and make sure \nwomen get equal pay and experience it in their personal checkbook, and \nwe have to change the Federal lawbook.\n  We are ready. We are suited up. We have signed up. Join with us. We \nknow the Presiding Officer is one of the great guys in the Senate who \nsupports us. Before we go out at the end of this session, let's bring \nabout change. Let's make America proud of their Congress. Let's turn \nthe page.\n  I yield the floor to my new but very able and experienced colleague \nfrom Missouri, who has been fighting boondoggles in that Federal \ncheckbook.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, the United States is so lucky to have \nthe senior Senator from Maryland in this august body. She is smart and \nfeisty, and she is not willing to yield any\n\n[[Page S5725]]\n\nground when she thinks the people she represents are not being treated \nas they should be.\n  For women in this country, she has been a tremendous beacon of light \nand hope to finally get over some of the barriers that have held women \nback historically. So to the dean of the Senate women, I thank her for \nher leadership as we work on this checklist for change.\n  One of the things we want to check off the list is fiscal \naccountability. It sounds kind of boring, fiscal accountability. It \nsounds like this is where the numbers drone on and one loses track.\n  This is a big deal. This administration has driven us into an \neconomic ditch. The numbers, frankly, are so big it is hard to believe \nthey are real. Federal spending since President Bush took office has \nincreased by almost $1 trillion. Let me say that again. Federal \nspending under this President and under the leadership of the \nRepublican Party has increased by $1 trillion. Our debt has gone up by \n$3.7 trillion. We now have a debt of $9.3 trillion.\n  This is change that is not just important, it is urgent. We must be \nfiscally accountable for taxpayer money. It sounds nice, right? It is a \nmoral imperative for our kids. It is the right thing to do for the \ngeneration that comes behind us, for our children and grandchildren. We \nare presenting them with a train wreck of unprecedented proportion if \nwe don't get our fiscal house in order.\n  So how do we do that? The Checklist for Change is all about being \ntough and accountable with taxpayer money. The way you do that is: \nFirst, how do you spend it? Do you give out contracts based on whom you \nknow? This administration has. Is it about cronyism? Too often it has \nbeen. Is it about no competition? Unfortunately, yes. Is it about cost-\nplus contracts? As a former auditor, I will tell you, cost-plus \ncontracts have no place in Government. Cost-plus means, hey, you can \ncharge the Government whatever you want, and then you get to make money \non top of that.\n  Believe it or not, that is the kind of contracting that ruled the day \nin Iraq. As we were faced with a war that we did not have enough men \nand women to fight, we had to contract out such as our country has \nnever contracted out in a time of war. What happened? We lost--and I am \nbeing conservative now because auditors are conservative by nature--\nliterally, over $150 billion that went up in smoke to waste, fraud, and \nabuse.\n  War profiteering. There has been an orgy of war profiteering during \nthis conflict in Iraq. If we focused on the Department of Defense and \nthe way they contract, we could realize enough savings so every young \nperson in America could have help going to college, so every young \nchild in America could have preschool--if we paid attention to the way \nwe do contracting in the Department of Defense.\n  I will tell you, today is a good day. I wish to say to my colleagues, \ntoday is a good day because today a decision was rendered that shows we \ncan get it right if we force companies to compete and we enforce the \nprovisions of those contracts.\n  A major, expensive contract was the tanker deal at the Department of \nDefense. There was a competition--good news. A company was awarded the \ncontract--fine. There were problems. So what happened? The losing \ncompany went to GAO, under our process of procedures, and said: \nAuditors, take a look at this. You tell us whether this contract was \ndone fairly.\n  The good news is, GAO, as it always does, did its work \nprofessionally, and they announced their decision today and said Boeing \nwas, in fact, treated unfairly in the tanker deal, that Boeing did not \nget a fair shake under that competitive contract, and that, in fact, \nthe Air Force must change its decision as it relates to Boeing and the \ntanker deal.\n  Do I think that is important? Yes. But why is it important? It is \nimportant because what we have said from the beginning is compete these \ncontracts. Do it fairly. Respect taxpayer money. Get a bargain. That is \nwhat women in America relate to because we are all about getting a \nbargain for our families. We need to treat taxpayer money the same way.\n  I am proud to be part of the Checklist for Change. I am proud to be \nemphasizing fiscal accountability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank you very much.\n  I particularly salute the Senator from Maryland. I thank her for her \nleadership of our group of Democratic women. Senator Mikulski has, from \nthe get-go, been there for the women of the Senate. This is the second \ntime I have participated in this Checklist for Change, which she has \nput together.\n  I also salute Senator McCaskill, who was on the floor, who has \nbrought a very talented dimension to our group of women.\n  I think, as the other Democratic women as well come to the floor to \ndiscuss this Checklist for Change, you are going to see one thing; and \nthat one thing is, we are all very committed to this country and very \ncommitted to see this country do the right thing by her people.\n  So it is with a great deal of pleasure that I participate in this \neffort. I thank both of them and the women who will come after me \nspeaking as well.\n  My comments are forged by 15 years on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nWith the exception of Senator Moseley-Braun for a short period of time, \nI am the only woman who has served in history on the Judiciary \nCommittee of the Senate and also serving 7 years as a member of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  I have always taken great stock in the fact that the United States of \nAmerica has been a beacon of hope because people all over the world \nlook to American justice and American human rights for inspiration.\n  We have represented not only a brighter future for people, but we \nhave represented a government of law, a government under the \nConstitution, a government by the people, for the people, with justice \nfor all--not just for a certain few but all.\n  Now that beacon has been dimmed. Despite President Bush's promise \nthat the United States would fight the war on terror consistent with \nAmerican values and ``in the finest traditions of valor,'' the decision \nwas made, as Vice President Cheney said in 2001, to ``go to the dark \nside.''\n  Indeed, this administration has put our Nation on the wrong track in \nso many ways, including: creating a prisoner of war detention facility \nat Guantanamo Bay with a separate, lesser system of justice--now \nrepudiated by the Supreme Court; authorizing interrogation techniques \nthat constitute torture; reopening the nuclear door by seeking to \ndevelop low-yield battlefield nuclear weapons and 100-kiloton nuclear \nbunker busters; countenancing, for the first time, the use of nuclear \nweapons as a first strike against a nonnuclear threat, if chemical or \nbiological weapons were threatened--not used but threatened--against \nthe United States; preemptively invading Iraq, under the guise of \nweapons of mass destruction and a false nexus to al-Qaida.\n  So, today, we see America's credibility in the world diminished, and \nthe administration's policies have become a recruiting tool for our \nenemies. So, in 7\\1/2\\ years, this great country has gone from a nation \nembraced to a nation often tarnished.\n  Yes, the time has come for a change. The time has come to: lay out an \nexit strategy in Iraq so we can begin to bring our people home; close \nGuantanamo, shut it down. The Secretary of Defense says shut it down. \nThe former Secretary of State says shut it down. Governor Kean, \nCongressman Hamilton, a litany of four-star officers and flag officers \nhave said shut it down. It does not become America's values.\n  The time has come to stop America's use of torture; establish a \nuniform standard for detentions and interrogations across our \nGovernment. This is part of the Senate's Intelligence authorization \nbill, and it will remain part of this bill. That bill essentially says \nall elements of the American Government will utilize the Army Field \nManual and the procedures therein, both the prohibitions on eight \nspecific items of torture as well as specific techniques to move ahead.\n  The time has come to use robust diplomacy; create coalitions; listen \nto allies; talk with adversaries. This makes us stronger, not weaker.\n  The time has come to develop a new, sensible nuclear weapons policy, \nso we do not encourage the very kind of proliferation we seek to \nprevent.\n\n[[Page S5726]]\n\n  Yes, the time has come for change. The time has come to restore \nAmerica's credibility as a moral and just nation, dedicated to liberty \nand justice.\n  We are the greatest military and economic power the world has ever \nseen. Our global influence is unmatched. For the past half century, our \ncountry has embraced international cooperation, not out of \nvulnerability or weakness but from a position of strength.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I can finish with this last \nstatement.\n  Our strength as a nation emanates not just from our power but from \nour moral stature and our principled stand for truth, justice, and \nfreedom. It must be restored.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, thank you for your indulgence.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, whom I \nalso compliment. I see my fellow colleague from California. They are \npart of Senator Mikulski's Checklist for Change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California, \nand I am pleased to join my colleagues in calling for the change \nAmericans are hoping for, which this next election opportunity will \nbring, to focus on issues that need so much change in America.\n  One of the items on the top of our Checklist for Change is a FEMA \nthat works, a plan that treats local and State governments as respected \nand able partners, having a disaster plan that spends taxpayer dollars \nwith care and efficiency, having a plan that puts a premium on helping \nfamilies and extended families stay together through an ordeal that \nrocks the economic foundation and future of so many families as they \nare displaced, sometimes for weeks, sometimes for months, and, yes, \neven sometimes for years.\n  We need a new FEMA. We need a muscular, robust, able, efficient, and \neffective FEMA to be a true partner with local and State governments \nand individual businesses and families in times of disaster.\n  I have spoken many times on the floor about the disasters of Katrina \nand Rita and how it affected the gulf coast, from Beaumont to Mobile, \nwith the great city of New Orleans and the metropolitan area being most \ndirectly affected. But we are not isolated in that suffering by any \nmeans.\n  This week, we have seen what is happening today in Iowa, Wisconsin, \nIndiana, and Illinois. There has been $1.5 billion in damages in Iowa \nalone, and 38,000 Iowans have been evacuated. More than 3,500 National \nGuard are deployed. More than 4.8 million sandbags have been used. I \ncould go on and on about the towns that have been completely evacuated.\n  Yes, New Orleans was completely evacuated. So was Saint Bernard \nParish and so were large swaths of Jefferson Parish--a parish of more \nthan 450,000 people--3 years ago this August.\n  But today the towns of Hartford, Palo, and Fredonia have been \ncompletely evacuated--not as large as New Orleans but towns of \nsubstantial populations.\n  The question is, Does FEMA have its housing plan together yet? Is \nthere a plan for people to be able to get their medicines if they are \nrelocated, to get their prescription drugs from their hometown pharmacy \nor their neighborhood? I am not sure that has been done yet.\n  So we need a FEMA that works. We need an administration that \nunderstands it is not just disasters far away but disasters right here \nat home and that homeland security starts with hometown security, where \npeople can be secure in their neighborhoods, in their homes, and that \nthe levees that have been put up to protect them will actually hold the \nwater and will not be breached or overturned.\n  We do not have that confidence right now in America. So not only do \nwe need a new FEMA, but we need a FEMA that will be an advocate for \nproper investments in infrastructure.\n  It is embarrassing, I believe, to be in the atmosphere we are in, \nwhere people can look up and any day a bridge could collapse or any day \na levee could break. We cannot prevent tornadoes. We cannot prevent \nhurricanes. We cannot prevent earthquakes. But I promise you, we can do \na lot more than we are doing now to reform the Federal emergency system \nso it works better with local and State governments so that when \nearthquakes happen, when hurricanes happen, when other disasters \nhappen, the people of the United States are getting the help they need.\n  So that is one of our top issues on our Checklist for Change: a \ndisaster planning and response system second to none.\n  It is a long list. But it is a list that must get done. That is, in \nlarge measure, what this next election is about. It is about the kind \nof leadership that is going to bring about the changes necessary, so \nwhen a business collapses after 20 or 30 years of making a profit, or \nlonger, when families' homes are destroyed, they have a Government they \ncan count on--not to give them charity but to give them a hand up, to \nrespond, to help them get back on their feet economically, spiritually, \nand emotionally. That is what our Government can do.\n  So I am proud to join this team. Again, we are asking for a FEMA that \nworks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from California \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is wonderful to join the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Landrieu, Senator Feinstein, and the other women who \nhave come to join us.\n  I have to say to Senator Mikulski, the dean of the Democratic women, \nhow much I appreciate her leadership and her ability to connect with \nthe American people. When she brought us together the first time--and \nit was a while back--she said: You know, we women at home make a \nchecklist of the things we have to do for our families and the things \nwe have to accomplish for the people who depend on us. Well, let's do \nthe same thing for the people whom we represent. What emerged is each \nof the Democratic women picked an issue she knew we needed to have \nchange on, and we have heard about some of them. As the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I am so proud to have that \nopportunity--the first woman, the first Californian to chair this \ncommittee.\n  I can just say, because I know this: We desperately need change when \nit comes to the environment. When we say the word ``environment,'' some \npeople think about the beautiful ocean, and they should; and they think \nabout beautiful wetlands, and they should; and they think about \nbeautiful lakes and streams and rivers and clean, flowing waterfalls, \nand they think about beautiful creatures that roam our environment, and \nall of that is true. But when we cut through it, a clean and healthy \nenvironment means healthy families. Healthy families means people who \ncan work, kids who can go to school and not have to leave because they \nhave asthma. These are the things we have to remember.\n  For 7\\1/2\\ long years now, since George Bush became President, this \nadministration has done everything it could to roll back landmark \nenvironmental laws. What are these laws? The Clean Air Act, the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the Superfund Act. \nIn every case, they have done this.\n  They have also stopped our progress on global warming. We had a bill \non the floor a couple of weeks ago. They sent out a message that they \nwere going to veto this bill, even before they saw it amended. Imagine.\n  I wish to tell the Senate--and I know there are a lot of folks who \nare watching in their offices--what I mean specifically by this \nterrible record of the Bush administration and why we want change on \nthe environment. The first thing George Bush did--and I don't know if \nthe Presiding Officer remembers--when he became the President in terms \nof the environment is try to weaken safe drinking water standards. He \ntried to actually roll back the standard for arsenic in drinking \nwater--arsenic in drinking water. He tried to slip it through, weaken \nthe standard. I remember working with Senator Mikulski on that issue. \nWe turned it back. We worked in the Senate, and we stopped it. Then, a \nNational Academy of Sciences study found that EPA had actually \nunderestimated the cancer risks from arsenic in tap water, yet there \nwas an effort to roll back the standard for arsenic.\n  Then there is perchlorate. Thirty-five States have a real problem--\nmost of\n\n[[Page S5727]]\n\nour States--with perchlorate that has seeped into drinking water and \nseeped, therefore, into some of our agricultural products. Perchlorate \ncomes from rocket fuel. It is a very dangerous leftover from rocket \nfuel. Let me tell my colleagues, it poses risks to the thyroid and \nspecial risks to pregnant women and infants.\n  The Bush administration not only has failed to set a standard for \nperchlorate, but it has stopped enforcing a law that says the water \ncompanies and the water utilities have to let people know how much \nperchlorate is in their drinking water. They no longer have to test for \nperchlorate. They have not set a standard. Here is their excuse: We \ndon't have enough information. Massachusetts had enough information; \nthey set a standard. California had enough information; they set a \nstandard. But the great big Federal, National Government doesn't have \nenough information. We know perchlorate is dangerous, we know it is an \nendocrine disrupter, and we know what that means for pregnant women and \nchildren. It is bad news. They are doing nothing. That is why we have \nthe environment on our checklist for change.\n  Mercury. Mercury is toxic to the brain. Let me repeat that. Mercury \nis toxic to the brain. We know that. There is no question about it. The \nBush administration, under pressure from big utilities--I ask unanimous \nconsent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Bush administration, under pressure from big \nutilities, set weak requirements for toxic mercury emissions, and now \nthere is a big court case, and believe me, they are going to lose it.\n  There are other things. They slowed down Superfund cleanup. They are \nnot protecting endangered species. They are weak on protecting us from \nsmog pollution, particulate matter that gets into our lungs. We are \ntalking about life and death, and then we are talking about global \nwarming, the future of the planet.\n  Today, the President said to forget the offshore oil drilling \nmoratorium in the most pristine waters of our coastline. Go in there \nand let the oil companies drill. What he didn't tell the American \npeople is his father put that moratorium in place. What he didn't tell \nthe American people is that there are 68 million acres of untapped \nleases the oil companies hold that they haven't drilled on, and he \nwould put at risk God's gift that we have been given on these \ncoastlines and he would jeopardize a $60 billion coastal recreation and \ntourism economy that fosters more than 2 million jobs.\n  I am so proud to stand with the Presiding Officer and the Democratic \nwomen of the Senate, standing next to this checklist for change: Equal \npay for equal work, good jobs, health care, taking care of our military \nand our veterans, restoring our credibility in the world, protecting \nthe environment, making us energy independent, preparing for future \ndisasters, enforcing fiscal accountability, and protecting the family \ncheckbook. This is a moment for change, and we Democratic women of the \nSenate wish to be agents of that change.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski, and thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, before the Senator leaves the floor--\nand we know our good friends, Senators Stabenow and Klobuchar, are here \nwho will speak. We know gas prices are a woman's issue. If anything is \ndriving up groceries and family bills, it is gas.\n  This whole issue today of lifting the ban on drilling--is the Senator \nfrom California aware that there are currently 68 million acres of \nland, Federal land, on which the oil companies have a lease, and if \nthey wanted to drill, they could drill?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right. The Senator from Maryland is reiterating \nwhat I said in my statement. Absolutely. We have learned that they have \n68 million acres of leases, both onshore and offshore, and they are not \ndrilling. They are holding those, I believe, for speculative purposes. \nNow the President announces--even without them lifting a finger on \nthose leases, he wants to destroy the coastlines that are the economic \nengine of the Senator's State, my State, and many other coastal States. \nYes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Does the Senator share my frustration--and I believe \nthe American people's frustration--that the President is trying to \nchange the subject rather than change the policies, particularly the \npolicies where he could, by Executive order, deal with price gouging of \nthe consumer as well as the casino-like speculation that is going on?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. My friend is so right. The Senator from \nMaryland is right.\n  This Senator from California can tell you this: His proposal to \ndestroy our coastline is an economic disaster, and he has avoided going \nafter the oil companies and their supply manipulation. He is ignoring \nthe speculators. We believe they have added $30 to $50 to a barrel of \noil. He is ignoring his Antitrust Division. He is doing nothing.\n\n  By the way, his own administration said today that even if they \nlifted this moratoria and every single inch was drilled--let's just say \nthat were true, although we would never allow that to happen--we \nwouldn't feel one penny of price reduction until 2030. What he said is \nnot true. This is changing the subject, and he is not using the power \nof the Presidency to go after the people who are manipulating this \nmarket. My colleague is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. So if people really want their gas prices lowered \ntoday, they should just e-mail the President and say: Don't change the \nsubject, change the policies. Get rid of price gouging and get rid of \nthe speculation. You can do it by Executive order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly right, I say to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I wish to thank our dean of the \nDemocratic women, Senator Barbara Mikulski, for once again being right \non point and Senator Barbara Boxer for her leadership as it relates to \nprotecting our environment and energy security. She and Senator Maria \nCantwell have been our leaders as it relates to cutting gas prices and \nat the same time doing those things that allow us to protect our \nbeautiful land and water and air. So I wish to thank my colleagues.\n  Listening to the discussion about what is happening in terms of gas \nprices just brings me back to what is an essential part of our \nchecklist for change; that is, making sure Americans have jobs. We are \ngoing to pay those high gas prices which are absolutely outrageous. \nSenator Mikulski is right, it takes a change in policy. Senator Boxer \nis right when she talks about the fact that there are a lot of places \nthe oil companies could be drilling right now. That is the problem. \nRight now, instead of buying more corporate jets and putting more money \ninto bonuses for themselves, if they were to reinvest in the land that \nis already there, that would address their concern about supply. We \nknow what is really happening. Unfortunately, for the last 8 years, we \nhave literally had two oilmen in the White House, and we have watched \nthe price of gasoline go beyond our wildest expectations. I know people \nin Michigan never would have thought we would be at over $4 a gallon.\n  To add insult to injury, during this same time when we are looking at \nforeclosure rates at the highest level in my lifetime, certainly, and \ngas prices at the highest levels, food prices going up, the cost of \nhealth care going up, what is going down--and what is frightening for \nfamilies across America--is their incomes, their jobs, and their \nstandard of living. Just since January, 324,000 good-paying American \njobs have been lost--just since January of this year, 324,000 families \nwithout a job, yet paying those high gas prices, paying those high food \nprices, trying to figure out how to send the kids to college or to pay \ntuition if they are in college. How do I make ends meet? How do I have \nmy piece of the American dream when I am losing my job or my income is \ngoing down?\n  Our checklist for change is about the things Americans want to have \nhappening in this country. It is frightening to see that since 2001, we \nhave lost 3 million--3 million--think about this number--3 million \nmanufacturing jobs in this country. Certainly, the people in Michigan \nhave taken a big hit of that 3 million. But overall now, considering \nall of the policies and the lack of\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\naction, including the dollars being sent to a war in Iraq rather than \nbeing invested here at home, we now are in a situation where 8.5 \nmillion Americans are unemployed--8.5 million Americans.\n  Our Republican colleagues would say: They should just go find a job. \nWe don't want to extend unemployment benefits because that encourages \npeople to stay home. That makes no sense if you are somebody who has \nbeen out of work trying to keep your house, trying to pay the food bill \nand the gas bill and everything else. But the reality is that we have \nabout 4 million jobs in this country right now and 8.5 million people \nout of work--roughly 4 million available jobs and 8.5 million people \nunemployed.\n  We also have what I call a race to the bottom in general economically \nwhere Americans are being told: In a global economy, if you will only \nwork for less, we can be competitive. If you will only lose your \npension, lose your health care, we can be competitive.\n  We reject that. Our checklist for change rejects the notion of a race \nto the bottom and the loss of our American way of life.\n  What we embrace are strategies that create good-paying jobs, middle-\nclass jobs at home in America. What we embrace is a race to the top. We \nwant to export our products--not our jobs--in a global economy. To do \nso means a level playing field on trade, enforcing our trade laws, as \nwell as creating new trade agreements. We want to make sure people are \nnot losing jobs because of the high cost of health care, the burdens on \nsmall and large businesses today. So we believe the race to the top \nmeans a change in the way we fund health care in this country.\n  Finally, we understand it means investing like crazy in education, in \ninnovation. That is the race to the top. That is what we embrace in our \nchecklist for change. I am very proud of the fact that the Democratic \nSenate and House have put together a budget resolution for the next \nyear that focuses on three major areas of job development--jobs and \ninnovation through our green-collar jobs initiative: investing in the \nnew advanced battery technology for the new vehicles; investing in \nconservation and energy efficiency through buildings and other kinds of \nefficiencies that are so important; job training in the new green-\ncollar economy, investing not only in biofuels but making sure the pump \nis actually there, so when you drive your vehicle, you can get biofuel \nor biodiesel--you can actually find a pump. So green-collar jobs are an \nimportant piece of what we have put in place.\n  Secondly, jobs in America. When we are rebuilding highways, bridges, \nand water and sewer systems, those are jobs that will not be exported \noverseas. Those are good-paying jobs in America. Our checklist for \nchange, as well as our budget, believes change should be done, and we \ncan invest in good-paying jobs at home.\n  Finally, in our budget resolution we invest in job training and make \na major investment in opportunity through education, from preschool all \nthe way up to college.\n  We know that serious changes need to be made in the priorities of \nthis country. I had the opportunity a while ago to be on a television \nshow following a Republican colleague--a woman in the House--who looked \nat our checklist and said: We Republicans can support all those things.\n  In looking at that, I am scratching my head and going: We have had 6 \nyears with President Bush and an entire Republican Congress, and they \nhad control of every piece of the Government. They were not focusing on \njobs, energy alternatives, fiscal accountability--as the occupant of \nthe chair has talked about--or education or equal pay for equal work. \nThey didn't fix that. They didn't address these issues that American \nfamilies and businesses are asking us to do.\n  In the last 2 years, instead of working with us on the changes we \nhave initiated, we have been blocked over and over again on the floor \nof the Senate. All we get is filibuster, filibuster, filibuster. So we \ncome to the floor and to the American people as Democratic women who \nhave been fighting, along with our Democratic male colleagues, for real \nchange that will send gas prices down, not up, and that will send \nhealth care costs down, not up, and make it more available, to bring \nfood prices down and, most important, bring wages up.\n  In the greatest country in the world, we can do better than losing \n324,000 good-paying jobs just since this past January.\n  I am proud to join my wonderful colleagues in putting together a \nchecklist that speaks to the things we know American families want to \nsee happening. We are going to do everything possible, both this year, \nand as we go to the changes that we hope will happen next year, to \nembrace and actually get results on our checklist for change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I am proud to follow the Senator from \nMichigan, who has done so much to fight for jobs in her State, with its \ndifficult economic conditions, and speak from the heart not only as a \nSenator but as a mother when she talks about this checklist for change.\n  So many of us who have come to the floor today are not just Senators \nbut also mothers. I think about my family generations back and the \nwomen who have kept the checklist. My grandmother in Ely, Minnesota--I \nthink of her writing in her perfect handwriting the lists that she made \nthroughout the day. My grandpa, her husband, worked 1,500 feet \nunderground in the mines in Ely. Neither of them graduated from high \nschool. She had a checklist for her family. That list was making sure--\nat the top of that list--that my dad and his brother went to college. \nThey saved money in a coffee can in the basement of that little house. \nThey had that coffee can to save the money in to send my dad and his \nbrother to college. And I think of my own mother, who got divorced when \nI was about 16. My dad was always there for me, but my mother had to \ndecide she was going to try to stay in her house raising two kids in \nthe suburbs of Minneapolis. She decided she had to go back to work when \nthey got divorced. She would write on the calendar in blue ink, which I \nremember.\n  In her head I know she was thinking would she be able to raise her \nkids and stay in that house when she retired. She ended up having to \nteach. At age 70, she had 30 second-graders. At age 80, she is still in \nthat house. So she did it.\n  As for me, my husband and I have our own checklist on the \nrefrigerator, with the things on it that we have to buy from the \ngrocery store. Last week, my daughter who is 12, added to the checklist \nto get her a swimming suit for the seventh grade pool party.\n  So I think all the women in America understand what it is like to \nhave these lists. What we are talking about today is a checklist for \nthe entire country. For all of us, every American family, on the top of \nthat checklist is balancing the family checkbook, protecting the family \ncheckbook. As families sit down every day at the kitchen table to write \ntheir budgets and figure out if they have enough to make ends meet, \nthey find out that things on their list cost a lot more. They have to \nmanage to do a lot more with less.\n  In fact, as you can see on this chart, in the last 7 years since this \nadministration took office, the average family wages have gone down \n$1,175 for your average middle-class family making around $48,000 a \nyear. That is hard enough, but at the same time, as we all know, the \naverage family expenses have increased. I can tell you that these are \nlast year's figures, before we saw the huge increase in gas prices. But \nthe average family expenses have increased more than $4,500, and this \nis per year. We are talking about higher mortgage payments of $1,700; \nhigher gas bills of $2,000; high food costs of $230; higher phone bills \nof $112; higher appliance costs of $42; and higher health insurance, \nwhich is up $363.\n  When you look at the wages lost and expenses gained, that is $5,739 \nper year out of the average American families' checkbooks. So families \nare feeling the hurt. They are not doing anything wrong, but this is \nwhat we are seeing all over this country.\n  Why is this going on? In part, it is because everybody is nickel-and-\ndiming our families. The oil companies are taking a huge chunk out of \nthe family checkbook every week. In Minnesota, I saw family cars \nwrapped around the block at Costco, waiting in line for the discount \ngas pumps--just to save a few bucks.\n\n[[Page S5729]]\n\n  Energy costs are skyrocketing, grocery bills are climbing, and while \nfamilies are looking for ways to save every penny, big companies \ncontinue to nickel-and-dime them.\n  The drug companies are nickel-and-diming consumers by refusing to \nnegotiate drug prices under Medicare Part D. The predatory lenders and \nunscrupulous creditors are taking a chunk out of the family checkbook \nwith credit card scams and bad loan deals that are bringing down the \nvalues of homes.\n  Cell phone companies are nickel-and-diming families with early \ntermination fees and excessive charges. Middle-class families are being \nsqueezed from all sides, trying to keep up with the costs. You have \nheard about the ``sandwich generation''--middle-class families trying \nto take care of their kids, while at the same time taking care of their \naging parents.\n  Look at the cost of college and child care. Today, I am not sure my \ngrandparents could have ever fit the money for college in a coffee can. \nThe average student graduates with more than $25,000 of debt. We owe \nour students a better start in life. Meanwhile, while my mom scrimped \nand saved to keep her house into retirement, many families do not have \nthat same luxury and, instead, are putting every penny into nursing \nhome living facilities.\n\n  On top of these financial worries, parents who may want to get a toy \nfor their child's birthday are trying to save a few dollars, and they \nworry if they are going to get a toy that contains lead. They wonder \nabout the tomatoes they bought at the store, or whether the pool drain \nin the local public pool will hurt their child. They worry: Is my \nfamily safe?\n  This isn't the American dream, and it should not be in this day and \nage. American families deserve an advocate for them, and the Democratic \nwomen today in the Senate stand ready to be those advocates, ready to \nmake the change these families desperately need.\n  We not only need to change the agenda to help our middle-class \nfamilies, we need to put a little change back in their wallets.\n  This last year, we stood up for America's middle-class families and \ntheir checkbooks: making college more affordable, increasing the \nminimum wage for the first time in 10 years. We took on the special \ninterests from the oil companies to the toxic toy manufacturers.\n  So much more needs to be done to protect American families' \ncheckbooks. We need to give tax breaks to the middle class by closing \nthe loopholes that benefit only the wealthy.\n  We must put America's families first and find the relief they need \nfrom rising prices and falling wages and help them protect the family \ncheckbook.\n  We must put the people of the country first, not the special \ninterests, by enacting comprehensive, affordable health care reforms to \nmake health care more affordable and enact a comprehensive energy \npolicy so that instead of spending $600,000 a minute on foreign oil and \nsending that money to the sultans of Saudi Arabia, we are spending it \non the farmers and workers in this country.\n  We must be vigilant in protecting consumer rights, as we stand on the \nverge of passing the most sweeping consumer product reform in 16 years. \nWe must continue to keep toxic toys and products off of our shores and \nout of our stores.\n  This checklist for change is from a group of women who all know what \nit is like to balance the family checkbook, and we know it is time for \na change. The American people know it is time for a change.\n  As Senator Barbara Mikulski, the dean of our delegation of women \nSenators, said today as she called on women of the Senate to work on \nthis together: I call on the women in this country to put on your \nlipstick, square your shoulders, and suit up and take up this fight for \nchange.\n  We are here today, shoulders squared, and with a checklist to \naccomplish the change that American families so desperately need.\n  I see that my colleague from Arkansas, Blanche Lincoln, is here. She \nhas always been a strong advocate for America's families. We both have \nchildren in the same junior high school. Mine is in seventh grade, \nquickly going into eighth. Hers are in the sixth grade. We have been \ndealing with the half schooldays in the Virginia schools. So it is good \nto be here together to talk about that issue.\n  I turn it over to the great leader from Arkansas, Senator Lincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I thank all of my colleagues today. I \nam so pleased to come down to the floor and join my fellow Democratic \nwomen colleagues in the Senate to discuss our checklist for change.\n  Just so that people know, this checklist is not new. We started this \nseveral years ago. We got together and realized that all of us kept \nlists, like our mothers and grandmothers before us. Those checklists \nwere helpful in accomplishing things. If there is anything we recognize \nfrom our constituents, it is that they are desperately wanting their \nGovernment to provide results, to get the results that the American \npeople need, and they want to be able to move forward. And so we \ndecided at that point, several years ago, that a checklist for change \nwould be a good thing.\n\n  So here we come back to this body, come back to our colleagues \npresenting, yes, another checklist for change and to say it is time to \nchange the direction our country is going in, and here are some of the \nbiggest priorities we face. These are age-old problems that we need new \nand innovative solutions to, but they are not problems we can't solve. \nWhen we come together, when we work together, we can solve these \nproblems and bring forth for the American people what it is they are \nasking for, and that is results, there is no doubt.\n  We have heard our colleagues today touch on several issues of \nimportance to the American people that we have listed on our checklist. \nI know my checklist is full of a lot of different things, as Senator \nKlobuchar mentioned, with the end of school coming around, but I want \nto take a few minutes to discuss one of the most important priorities, \nand one of the most important things that appears on my personal \nchecklist most frequently, and that is health care needs. Whether it is \nthe health care forms for my boys to go to summer camp, or making sure \nthey get their dental checkup, or ensuring they have gotten their \nimmunizations to be able to start school, all those things are \ncritically important to me, and there are many health care needs our \nworking families out there are facing as well.\n  It is not a secret that a health care crisis is looming on the \nhorizon. Health care access and affordability is out of reach for way \ntoo many of our hard-working American families. When we go out to our \nStates, at least for me, anyway, and I talk with people, one of the \nissues that is paramount on their minds is health care, but it is \nsynonymous, when they speak about it, with the economy and whether they \ncan afford it with the economy of their family budget, and what it does \nto the economy of their small community if health care is not \navailable, and what it does to the economy of this country if we wait \nso long to provide the access to affordable health care so that people \nare in acute care because it is more costly. It is costing our economy \nmore and it is lessening the quality of life of Americans who so \ndesperately want to find that access to affordable and good health \ncare.\n  As many of my colleagues are very well aware, the number of uninsured \nin this country stands at about 47 million. You know, we see Americans \nare living longer. My husband's grandmother turns 111 this year, and \nshe still lives on her own and does amazing things. My husband and I \nfind that we are not just the sandwich generation, but we are the club \nsandwich generation.\n  As Americans live longer, we also know, because statistics tell us, \nthat a baby girl born in this country today has a 50-percent chance of \nbecoming a centenarian. Moreover, as the baby boom generation begins to \nretire, the current Medicare system is not equipped to effectively \nhandle the strains of such a major demographic shift. It is an issue \nthat constantly weighs on my mind, whether it is as a caregiver for my \nchildren or for aging parents or aging grandparents, and we know it is \non the minds of all working Americans out there, not just mine and not \njust my colleagues.\n  I am sure it is on the minds of many of my colleagues, because we \ntalk\n\n[[Page S5730]]\n\nabout it all the time. We talk about caring for our aging parents and \nthe needs of our kids, and it is not going away any time soon. And it \nis certainly not going away if we don't begin to make it a priority and \ndo something about access to health care.\n  As mothers and daughters, wives, sisters, and legislators, the \nDemocratic women of the Senate are committed to providing access to \nquality, affordable health care for all Americans. One way to address \nthis issue is to put the focus first on small business owners, their \nemployees, and self-employed individuals, who very often are those who \nare uninsured.\n  To give a snapshot, my small businesses are the No. 1 source of jobs \nin my home State of Arkansas. However, only 26 percent of businesses \nwith fewer than 50 employees actually offer health insurance. Small \nbusinesses need assistance. They need innovative ways to offer \naffordable, accessible health care to their employees.\n  There is a misnomer out there that small businesses don't want to \noffer health insurance. They do, desperately. They know it increases \ntheir productivity, it increases their competitiveness, and their \nability to attract good workers. But it has to be affordable. Small \nbusinesses have to maintain their competitive nature with big \nbusinesses and businesses all over the globe. That is why I have worked \nhard to design a comprehensive solution that will allow our small \nbusinesses to ban together and spread their risk, much like the \nprograms that we as Federal employees enjoy.\n  We also have to focus on critical reforms of Medicare if we have any \nhopes of ensuring our seniors, those who have built this great land we \nenjoy, continue to receive the essential care they need as they age. \nEfficiencies, quality measures, all of these issues we have talked \nabout recently in some of our Medicare efforts and what we are trying \nto do in our Medicare reform bill, will lower our costs and provide \ngreater quality, which is what we want to do. Modernizing Medicare to \ntake advantage of those efficiencies, those new technologies--health \nIT, e-prescription, and a whole host of different technologies--will \nhelp us, if we make that investment, by providing the quality as well \nas the efficiencies we need.\n  And we can't forget about the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, known as SCHIP. We must make it a priority to expand health \ncare coverage to the most vulnerable of our society--our children. I \nhope if my colleagues don't want to do it just because they love \nchildren, which most of us do--we understand they are our greatest \nblessing in this whole wide world--we should do it because it is an \ninvestment in our future.\n  We know children who are healthier are going to go to school, they \nare going to learn better, they are going to turn out to be better \nadults, they are going to get their education, get better jobs, and pay \nmore taxes. There will be a whole host of different things that will \nmean so much to this country if we provide that health care for our \nchildren.\n  The clock is ticking, and it is up to us in Washington to find a \nsolution so the hard-working families of this country can be assured of \na healthy tomorrow. Each year that passes without action places more \nand more Americans in a vulnerable position. I challenge our President \nand our colleagues in the Senate and on the other side of the aisle to \nstand with us, not against us, in providing quality and affordable \nhealth care for all Americans. Look at how much it means to this \ncountry, to those individuals, those working families who are the \nfabric of this country.\n  As the richest, most powerful country in the world, we owe it to our \nworking families who want to protect themselves and their families from \nan uncertain future to provide the health care coverage they so \ndesperately need. We owe it to the taxpayers of this country today and \nfor generations to come to provide a quality health care system that is \ncost effective and sustainable. That is why I believe that providing \naccess to good health care to America's working families is worth \nfighting for, and that is why it is primary on our checklist for \nchange.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the hour \nof morning business under the Republican control be divided equally \namong the following Senators: Senators Alexander, Kyl, Hatch, Cornyn, \nBond, and Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask that I be informed when I have \nconsumed 9 minutes and have 1 minute remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will inform the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5730-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5730-S5733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CHECKLIST FOR CHANGE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, Republican Senators--men and women--\nwelcome this opportunity to talk about the checklist for change offered \nby Democratic Senators. As Senator McCain has said: We all want change. \nBut there is a right change and a wrong change. So I wish, in my few \nminutes, to take a few of the items on the Democratic checklist for \nchange and talk about what I consider to be the right change and the \nwrong change.\n  Let's start with taking care of our military families and veterans. \nThat probably should go at the top of our list because of our respect \nnot only for the men and women who are fighting overseas but for those \nwho are at home, both families without children or families with \nchildren. Those who are here also served.\n  We all have been seeking to update the GI bill for veterans so we can \nprovide educational benefits to veterans today and to men and women who \nare on active duty that fit today's circumstances. Here is the major \ndifference between Republicans and Democrats, an example of what I \nwould consider to be the right change and the wrong change. Most \nRepublicans favor an updating of the GI bill for veterans, as \nrecommended by Senators McCain, Graham, and Burr, that would allow more \nservicemembers to transfer educational benefits to dependents. It would \nallow servicemembers to transfer educational benefits to their spouses \nor to their children. After serving at least 6 years, a member could \ntransfer up to half of his or her education benefits to a spouse or \nchildren, or both. After serving for 12 years or more, a servicemember \ncould transfer all of his or her education benefits to a spouse, \nchildren, or both.\n  In bottom-line terms, the Republican bill would do what the \nDemocratic checklist says--take care of our military families and \nveterans--but most Republicans support the idea of giving this \ntransferability of benefits, which could provide up to $72,000 for a \ndependent or a spouse's education. The bill sponsored by most Democrats \ndid not include that transferability of benefits. We believe we have \nthe right change and that they have the wrong change.\n  Let me take another item on the checklist--enforced fiscal \naccountability, or protect the family checkbook, both of those. Here is \nan example of what we believe would be the right change in fiscal \naccountability and helping balance the family budget.\n  The Democrats had an opportunity, because they have the majority in \nthis Chamber--remember, when we are talking about change, change in \nthis Chamber would mean we would go from a Democratic majority to a \nRepublican majority. The Democrats are in charge here. They set the \nagenda. What we talk about is what they bring up, the same as in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  The Democratic budget provided a tax plan which will cause most \nAmericans to be paying a lot more. Over the next 5 years, their tax \nplan provided for 84 million women to see a $1,970 increase, because \nthey would allow the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire. Also, 48 million \nmarried couples would see a $2,700 increase, and 12 million single \nwomen with children would see a $1,000 increase. And more than 6 \nmillion low-income individuals and couples will no longer be exempt \nfrom the individual income tax.\n  Again, the right change for women and men in America would be the \nRepublican version of lower taxes. The Democratic version is higher \ntaxes.\n  Let me go to a third item--making America energy independent. How \nwill we do that? The new economics professors on the other side of the \naisle have come up with a brand new economics theory which would repeal \nsupply from the law of supply and demand. They\n\n[[Page S5731]]\n\nare led by Senator Obama, who is the leading economics professor on \nthat side with this new theory. In the New York Times this morning he \nsaid he opposes drilling in Alaska for oil and gas. He is not, in his \nwords, a proponent of nuclear power, which provides 70 percent of our \ncarbon-free electricity. He would consider banning new coal plants--and \ncoal provides 45 percent of our electricity--and in 2006 he voted \nagainst expanding oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. That \nleaves him, it seems to me, with very little to supply electricity and \noil for a country that uses 25 percent of all the energy in the world. \nInstead of a national energy policy, that side has a national windmill \npolicy.\n  They still have demand, but we agree with demand; that is, using less \noil. Many of us on the Republican side voted for fuel efficiency \nstandards. We believe in green buildings. We are ready to move toward \nelectric plug-in cars and trucks to reduce our demand. But we are going \nto have to plug them into something. So we need five or six new nuclear \nplants a year, we need to explore offshore, we need to take the \nmoratorium off oil shale, and we need to go into the very narrow part \nof Alaska where we would propose to explore there, still leaving nearly \n17 million acres for wilderness.\n  We believe in the law of supply and demand. They do not believe in \nsupply. We have the right change, we believe. They have the wrong \nchange when it comes to energy independence.\n  In health care, the right change we believe would be a policy that \nwould merge the idea of giving every American an opportunity to afford \nhealth insurance by reforming the Tax Code but using at the same time \ntwo words, ``private sector,'' to make sure you can buy your own policy \nand choose your own doctor. They want the wrong change which would \ncreate a Government system where you could not do that.\n  Finally, I notice that education is not even on the Democratic \nchecklist. I am not so surprised. I wouldn't put it on either if I had \ntheir set of priorities because they are opposed to the one thing that \nmost women in America want more of, which is flexibility of time. They \nare opposed to giving parents more choices of schools. We have choices \nof colleges and universities and community colleges, but working moms \ncannot have a choice of the school or of an afterschool program. Some \nbureaucrat decides that. That is the wrong change. We would give them \nthe right change. The Democrats oppose a Pell grant for kids, which I \nproposed, which would give $500 to every low-income child for \nafterschool music lessons, programs, other afterschool education \nactivities. We support charter schools. Some of the other side do, but \nmostly they are opposed to that.\n  We would favor paying teachers more for teaching well. I did that in \nTennessee when I was Governor. That mainly benefited women because \nthere were more female teachers than men. We wanted them to have a \nbetter professional career and time in the classroom, but it was the \nDemocrats who said no to that. And it is better for the students, to \npay outstanding teachers more for teaching well because then the \nclassrooms keep better teachers which is good for students.\n  Finally, in No Child Left Behind there is something called the \nTeacher Incentive Fund. I thank Senator Durbin for joining me in trying \nto support that, but many of the Democrats on the other side have said \nno because that money is being used to find ways to pay principals more \nfor being better principals, and to pay teachers more for being better \nteachers. They want a flat pay for all of them because that is what the \nunions want. So we want the right kind of change on education, but it \nis not even on the Democratic checklist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I believe it is a good thing for us \nto talk about change. There is a right change and a wrong change. We \nbelieve in the law of supply and demand. They believe only in demand. \nWe believe in lower taxes; they in higher taxes. We believe in change \nthat allows you to buy your own policy and choose your own doctor. They \nwould have a Government program. We believe in giving moms and dads \nmore flexibility in choosing schools. They believe in letting the \nbureaucracy do it.\n  I welcome this debate. We look forward to change. We just want to \nmake sure it is the right change instead of the wrong change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, as we began this day, the Senate had \npending before it a very important piece of legislation addressing the \nnecessity of extending some provisions in our current Tax Code that \nenable our businesses to compete with others abroad. There were tax \nprovisions, for example, that provide tax credits for businesses that \ninvest in research and development. I think everyone in this Chamber \nsupports extending those important provisions of the Tax Code, yet we \ncannot consider the legislation and get it done.\n  In addition, we have soon-to-be-pending important legislation on \nhousing to deal with the crisis that has gripped this country in the \nlast year or so. But instead of taking those matters up and debating \nthem and getting the people's business done, we have taken some time \nout, pursuant to the Democratic leader's change in schedule here, to \ntalk about change the Democrats would bring.\n  It is important to note that Republicans are not in charge of the \nCongress. Democrats have a majority in both the House and Senate and \nhave had for the last year and a half. I submit if Republicans were in \ncharge today, we would be using this time on the Senate floor to be \nworking on the people's business--at least the two items I mentioned \nbefore--rather than taking time out to have a debate about partisan \npolitical matters.\n  But as long as we are talking about change that the Democrats would \nbring, I suggest we have no better place to turn to, to see exactly \nwhat that would be, than what the Democrats did do when they were in \ncharge this year. It is the one piece of legislation they have \nsucceeded in passing. It is a budget.\n  What does the Democratic budget show us about what they would do if \nthey were in charge for another 2 years? The first thing that is \nnotable about this budget is it calls for the largest tax increase in \nthe history of the world; in the entire history of this country. \nAmerican families and the economy cannot afford this kind of change. \nThe last thing you want to do in time of economic downturn is to raise \ntaxes. Yet that is exactly what the Democratic budget would do.\n  Every single taxpayer would face a tax increase in a little more than \n2 years, unless Congress acted to affirmatively stop it. It would hit \n116 million American households. This is not just a tax on the rich; \nevery single American household. The child tax credit would be cut from \n$1,000 to $500 per child. The marriage penalty would be reimposed, so \nthat many married couples would again pay higher taxes than they would \nhave they had remained single.\n  When Republicans were in charge, we created a 10-percent lower tax \nbracket to help those with lower incomes, reducing it from 15 percent \ndown to 10 percent. That would be repealed. The bottom rate would once \nagain go up to 15 percent, a 50-percent increase for our lowest income \ntaxpayers. Every tax bracket above the 15-percent bracket would also be \nraised.\n  A family of four with $50,000 in income would pay $2,300 more in \ntaxes, according to the Senate Budget Committee. That is a lot of money \nif you are trying to save for your family or if you are worried about \ngas prices.\n\n  The investment taxes we have in this country--it used to be, years \nago, that was mostly for people who made more money. Now we know that \nAmerican families saving for the future--seniors living on retirement \nincomes, people who have pension plans, the teachers' pension, whoever \nit might be--all would see dramatic tax hikes under the Democratic \nbudget because these proposals hit investors, and over half of \nAmericans are now investors. The capital gains rate would increase by a \nthird, a 33-percent increase in the rate, and the dividends rate would \njump an unbelievable 164 percent under the majority's plan.\n  Let's talk about seniors who report dividend income. That is where a \nlot of their income comes from. Nationwide,\n\n[[Page S5732]]\n\naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 67.6 percent of seniors \nreporting dividend income had adjusted gross incomes of less than \n$50,000. These are not rich people--people who make less than $50,000. \nThat is who gets hit. How about capital gains? Same source--40.5 \npercent of all seniors reporting capital gains had adjusted gross \nincomes of $50,000 or less. We are not hitting the rich. We are hitting \nfolks with incomes of less than $50,000 a year.\n  How about the engine of the economy, the small businesses, the \nentities that create almost all of the new jobs in our country, half of \nwhich are women owned? More than 75 percent of all filers in the top \ntax bracket report small business income. So you increase that tax \nbracket and you are increasing the taxes on small businesses. You are \nnot increasing the taxes on corporations. Small businesses would have a \nhigher tax rate than corporations. It would go from 35 percent to 39.6 \npercent. Is that change we want in America? I think not.\n  Raising taxes on small businesses will hurt their ability to grow and \ncreate good-paying jobs. They create 70 percent of all new jobs in \nAmerica and it would make it impossible for them to provide health \ninsurance and other benefits to their employees.\n  Let's look to Senator Obama's tax plan. A look at his Web site \nreveals some interesting things. First, he has no plans to prevent \nthese tax increases I talked about from going into effect. His proposal \nis to give a $500 tax credit per worker. So rather than preventing \nthese increases in taxes I talked about, he would promise a $500 tax \ncredit--up to $1,000 per family--only if you had an income of less than \n$75,000.\n  We believe the first order of business ought to be to prevent this \nmassive tax increase called for in the Democratic budget. Senator Obama \nwould allow this $2,000 per family tax hike to go into place and in \nexchange would give each worker $500. Obviously, the Government picks \nup the other $1,500 and the reason is because of the spending that \nSenator Obama and the Democratic majority would engage in. The budget I \ntalked about before, interestingly enough, has almost to the dollar an \nincrease in spending equaling the increase in taxes, so you know \nprecisely what the plans are here if Democrats have another 2 years in \npower. I think most Americans would prefer the $2,000 in tax savings \nunder the Republican proposal to the $500 tax credit under Senator \nObama's proposal. Again, change that I do not think the American public \nwould benefit from.\n  How about the capital gains tax increase that Senator Obama proposes? \nI talked about capital gains before. It affects seniors. It affects \npeople with incomes of less than $50,000 a year. He says he might allow \nthat rate to go back up to 28 percent and--increasingly he said this--\neven if it were proven that it would not collect $1 more in revenue for \nthe Federal Government. He said, instead, he would do it--this was \nduring the April ABC debate--for fairness. But I am asking here, is it \nfair to punish investment? Our tax system treats capital gains at a \nlower rate because they have already been taxed once before. They have \nbeen taxed when the business earned the money and they are taxed again \nwhen the investor in that business has an asset and has to pay the \ntaxes on it. This lower rate mitigates that taxation. That is fair. \nWhat is not fair would be to take that rate up to 28 percent. That is \nnot change that would help the American people.\n  I think most Americans understand that to help business we need to \nhelp those who invest in business. That is what helps the economy grow. \nThat is what creates jobs. It is what increases our standard of living.\n  Then there is one other proposal that Senator Obama proposes, perhaps \nas a result of the negative reaction to the increase in capital gains \neven if it produces less revenue. He says he ``would propose to \neliminate all capital gains taxes on startup businesses to encourage \ninnovation and job creation,'' according to his Web site. That I can \nagree with. But if the policy is good for startup businesses to \nencourage innovation and job creation, why wouldn't it be good for all \nof the other small businesses too? My wife had a small business. She is \nnot just starting one up; she used to have one. She wouldn't be able to \ntake advantage of that, but somebody just starting one would? What is \nthe fairness in that? If it is good enough for those who are starting \nup, it ought to be good enough for those who can create more jobs and \nimprove our economy.\n  Finally, he has a proposal on the payroll tax to increase taxes, \nwhich money would presumably go into the Social Security trust fund to \nbe spent by the Congress, since there is no way to protect the money in \na lockbox. We tried that before. So since Social Security taxes are not \nneeded today, not all of them, to pay for Social Security benefits, the \ndifference between what we collect and what we have to pay out to \nseniors is simply spent by Congress. This would be another tax \nincrease, not for seniors in retirement, but for Congress to spend. It \nwould increase on all incomes above $250,000. It is capped right now at \n$102,000 in income. The reason is because Social Security taxes are \ncapped relative to the level of benefits. Benefits are also capped. If \nyou ever break that tie, then you are going to have a welfare program \nrather than the Social Security program. That would not be change that \nis good for America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I too want to talk about change, as have \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle, in presenting their \nchecklist for change. I do not think there is anybody--certainly not \nmyself included--who believes that what is happening here in \nWashington, DC, inside these hallowed chambers is something we want to \ncontinue in terms of the status quo. We do need change. But as others \nhave said before me, we need the right kind of change. That is what I \nwish to address here briefly.\n  First, let me remind my colleagues and those who may be watching \nabout where we are in terms of being stuck on important issues that are \nimportant to the people of this country; where Congress, under the \ncurrent leadership, has simply squandered the opportunities we have, on \na bipartisan basis, to work together to try to address these pressing \nissues.\n  First, it has now been 124 days since the terrorist surveillance \nsystem, known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, has \nbasically been unable to track and listen in on foreign terrorists \nbecause Congress has failed to pass reauthorization of the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act.\n  It has been 575 days since our manufacturers and small businesses and \nour farmers have been disadvantaged by the failure to take up and pass \na free trade agreement with Colombia.\n  My State of Texas sells about $2.3 billion worth of goods and produce \nto Colombia each year, but because Congress refuses to act on this \nfree-trade agreement, my farmers and manufacturers and small businesses \nhave to pay a tariff. That is an added penalty, basically, on their \nproducts in Colombia that is not imposed on Colombian goods when they \nare sold here in the United States.\n  This free-trade agreement is good for my State and for the United \nStates because it creates markets for our goods and our produce, which \ncreates jobs here at home. But for 575 days now, we have seen no action \non that important agreement.\n  There have been 720 days that some judicial nominations have been \nwaiting for a vote. I want to come back to that--720 days since some of \nthese nominations have been pending. As astonishing as it may sound, \nnow when gasoline prices are well over $4 a gallon, when the price of \noil is up around $135 a barrel, it has been 786 days since Speaker \nPelosi--when she was running for the House of Representatives and \nrunning basically for Speaker, she promised a commonsense plan to bring \ndown the price of gasoline at the pump. We are still waiting for that \nplan. We have not seen it yet. I believe this is the kind of change \npeople across this country would love to see. They would love to see us \ncome together to try to solve these problems. But instead of that, they \nsee us stuck in a rut, engaging in political posturing rather than \nsolving the problems that confront our Nation.\n  I wish to talk briefly about the third item on my list, and that is \nabout judges.\n  For some reason, the Democratic majority has refused to follow \nthrough on\n\n[[Page S5733]]\n\na promise made to our side to set hearings and confirm judges to the \nFederal bench. The fact is, there does appear to be a distinct \ndifference in the philosophy of the people nominated to serve on the \nFederal bench between the two political parties. I believe our side \nbelieves judges should not be roving activists imposing or substituting \ntheir views for what is good for us but, rather, judges should have the \nvery important role, the unique role of interpreting what the law is \nand enforcing and applying the law as written.\n  Judges, of course, are not elected, by and large, certainly not to \nthe Federal bench. They are not representatives of the people, they are \nrepresentatives of the law, and they serve a very important function. \nBut when judges decide to take the law onto themselves and impose their \nown will rather than to enforce the will of the elected representatives \nof the people, they become lawless as a result.\n  Of course, we have seen recent examples of this, whether it be in \nCalifornia, where the California Supreme Court after some 200 years has \ndecided now that the Constitution enshrines a right to same sex \nmarriage, against the overwhelming views of the people of that State--I \nguess they will have another chance to vote on that in a proposition \nthat will come before the people of that State.\n  We have seen it most recently by the U.S. Supreme Court in a decision \nwhere they afforded foreign terrorists precisely the same rights as an \nAmerican citizen would have even though we are at war with a determined \nenemy that celebrates the murder of innocent civilians, as they did on \nSeptember 11, to pursue their own goals. And to have judges, including \nthe five Justices on the U.S. Supreme Court, say that for the first \ntime in the history of our Republic, foreign terrorists have the same \nconstitutional rights to the writ of habeas corpus in civilian courts \nis not only a dramatic change in the law--and it does represent change, \nbut it is not the right kind of change.\n  We need to make sure social policies are made by the elected \nrepresentatives of the people where we can debate these policies right \nhere in front of the people on TV and in front of those folks who come \nto the gallery, but then once we make those decisions, once we have \nthose votes, that they are honored and respected by the unelected \njudges.\n  The fact is, Senator Obama, the Senator from Illinois who is running \nfor President of the United States, says he want judges who would put \ntheir heart and convictions above the letter of the law. That sounds \npretty good at first blush, but the fact is, if each judge is going to \ndecide what their heart tells them or what their personal convictions \ntell them as opposed to what the law is, including what the \nConstitution of the United States says, that is not law at all. That is \nsort of an impressionistic way of deciding how to impose your views, \nbecause you happen to be a Federal judge, on the people of this great \ncountry.\n  We know there has been an effort to drag feet in terms of confirming \njudicial nominees, presuming, I guess, that the election will provide \nanother opportunity for our Democratic colleagues to then see a \nDemocratic President nominate judges to the Federal bench, at which \ntime they would expect us to forget the foot-dragging and obstruction \nwe have experienced when we have had a Republican in the White House, \nand somehow they believe that would not be reciprocated. I hope we will \nrise above the temptation to reciprocate the kind of treatment this \nPresident has received if a Democratic candidate was elected President \nof the United States. But it is the same sort of tit-for-tat \nretaliatory mindset that has gotten us into this quagmire we need to \nget out of, and my hope would be that our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle would rethink this issue and sort of get out of this rut.\n  My constituents back in the State of Texas tell me they are pretty \ndisgusted with what they see happening in the Congress. Thirteen \npercent, according to the latest Rasmussen poll I saw, said they gave \nCongress an ``excellent'' or ``good'' rating. The vast majority of the \nAmerican people look to Washington and they do not see a Congress that \nis being responsive to their needs and their wishes. They don't see us \ntrying to solve problems. They don't see us having hearings on judicial \nnominees, asking those nominees questions about the qualifications and \nexperience and then having a vote on the Senate floor. That is the kind \nof change we need as we address these issues that are important to the \nAmerican people. I would hope that if our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle are really desirous of change, they would work with us to \nhelp change this broken, dysfunctional Senate.\n  When the majority leader calls up a bill and he denies an opportunity \nfor the minority to offer amendments or to have full and fair debate, \nas he did last week on the climate change bill, what he called one of \nthe most important issues facing the planet today, it does not speak of \na seriousness of attitude in terms of trying to solve problems but, \nrather, speaks more to an attitude of gamesmanship and political point \nscoring that, frankly, is beneath the honor and dignity of this \ninstitution and of our responsibilities to our constituents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, on the campaign trail this election year \none hears a lot about change and helping the middle class. But what do \nthe professed ``change agents'' have in mind by change, and what would \nsuch changes mean for our economy and creating middle class jobs?\n  Pending legislation in Congress sponsored by the change agents would \nmore closely conform America's labor and employment laws to the failed \nEuropean model which has saddled the French and Germans with 30 years \nof higher unemployment, stagnant job growth, and lower productivity. \nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy has said workplace regulations in \nFrance are ``unjust, discourage work and job creation,'' and ``fail to \nbring equal opportunity'' to the middle class. German Chancellor Angela \nMerkel has called for reform of Germany's labor regulations for the \nsame reasons.\n  At a time when leaders in France and Germany are trying to reform \ntheir workplace laws and move closer to the U.S. system, do we really \nwant to infect our country with European-style workplace regulations \nthat could cost middle class jobs and curtail economic growth? Do we \nreally want to become another France?\n  For more than 70 years, union representation elections in the \nworkplace have been supervised by career employees at the National \nLabor Relations Board to ensure the elections are conducted fairly and \nprivately. The deceptively misnamed Employee Free Choice Act pending in \nCongress would deny employers the ability to petition for private \nballot elections among their employees to determine whether or not the \nemployees, voting by secret ballot just as in political elections, \ndesire to be represented by a labor union.\n  The bill would scrap our current system of private voting in secret \nballot elections and replace it with a forced card check certification \nin which employees can be pressured by union organizers into signing \nunion petitions, or union authorization cards at work, at home, in a \nbar or on the streets. Union leaders boast that this change would lead \nto millions of new union members, but at what cost to workplace \ndemocracy?\n  Even worse, the bill would turn over a business's financial \ncompetitiveness to federal Government-appointed arbitrators to set \nwages, pension and health care benefits, work hours and other terms and \nconditions of employment. If, after only 90 days of bargaining, the \nparties themselves have not agreed on the terms of an initial union \ncontract, the bill would mandate interest arbitration through which a \nfederally-appointed outside arbitrator would be vested with virtually \nunchecked authority to impose a contract binding for 2 years on the \nparties, without even a ratification vote among the employees to \napprove its terms. Such determinations imposed on the parties will be \naffected by the arbitrator's own economic or social theories, often \nwithout the benefit or understanding of practical, competitive economic \nforces.\n  Is that the change we need to help the middle class?\n  Consider further the misnamed RESPECT Act, sponsored by the same\n\n[[Page S5734]]\n\nprofessed change agents, which would impede private sector employers' \nability to manage their operations through first-line supervisors. The \nbill would reclassify supervisors who assign or direct the work of \nothers, and expose them to the same union contracts and work rules, \nunion discipline, strikes and other work stoppages, as the employees \nthey supervise, thereby creating the types of conflicts of interest \nthat the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act wisely sought to avoid. The legislation \nshould be renamed NO RESPECT, since it would deny supervisors the \nstatus and supervisory authority they worked hard to attain, as well as \neliminating employers' right to expect the undivided loyalty of these \nsupervisors as their agents in labor-management relations.\n  Other bills pending in Congress, all cosponsored by change agents on \nthe campaign trail, would radicalize U.S. employment law, resulting in \nthe type of European paralysis that has impeded middle class job \ncreation and economic growth in France and other countries. These bills \nwould, however, expand one industry where unfortunately the U.S. \ngreatly outpaces Europe: the plaintiff trial bar, which has an \nunsurpassed world record of bringing lawsuits, many frivolous, against \nemployers.\n  One bill would remove any time limits on the filing of pay \ndiscrimination claims against an employer, thus creating open-ended \nliability years. Another would provide unlimited employer liability for \npunitive damages by removing the caps on damage awards which were \nwisely set by the 1991 Civil Rights Act at $300,000 in exchange for \namendments allowing jury trials for employment discrimination claims. \nOpen-ended liability and unlimited damages: a plaintiff trial lawyer's \ndream.\n  A third bill would undermine congressional intent with regard to the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act by classifying virtually any physical \nimpairment as a disability for purposes of bringing claims and lawsuits \nagainst employers. I helped lead the fight for the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. The courageous pioneering members of the disability \ncommunity responsible for passage of the legislation were not \ninterested in protecting temporary illnesses such as the flu, or minor \nimpairments which could be corrected by prescription eyeglasses or \nmedication. Now, however, by preventing consideration of mitigating \nfactors as an affirmative legal defense, and no longer requiring that \nthe disability affect a major life activity such as working, the new \nlegislation would treat such minor impairments as disabilities. The \neffect is to trivialize the law and promote frivolous lawsuits against \nemployers. The problem with the bill's sophistry is that if everyone is \nconsidered legally disabled, even those with easily correctable \nimpairments, then no one is truly protected.\n  Another pending bill is an unprecedented Federal mandate regulating \nan employer's decision-making. It is the closest thing to the type of \nworkplace regulatory paralysis that has stymied the Europeans. In fact, \nit reportedly was modeled directly from European laws.\n  Any time an individual employee requests a change in work schedules, \nincluding when, how long, and where the employee is scheduled to work, \nthe so-called Working Families Flexibility Act would require employers \nto meet with the employee within 14 days, and thereafter, within 14 \ndays, to provide a detailed written decision with company information. \nThe employer's written decision would have to include, among other \nthings the identifiable cost of the change in a term or condition of \nemployment requested in the application, including the costs of loss of \nproductivity, of retraining or hiring employees, or of transferring \nemployees from one facility to another facility, and the overall \nfinancial resources involved.\n  If the employee is dissatisfied with the employer's decision, the \nemployee may request reconsideration and the employer must schedule \nanother meeting, again within 14 days, with the employee accompanied by \nany designated representative. If the representative is unavailable, \nthe meeting must be postponed. Thereafter, the employer must respond to \nthe request for reconsideration in writing, stating sufficient grounds \nto justify the decision.\n  But that's not all. The employee may trigger a Federal investigation, \nwhich must be undertaken by the U.S. Department of Labor and a \nsubsequent Federal administrative hearing to review the employer's \ndecision. This could lead to Federal enforcement actions, monetary \nfines against the employer, Federal court injunctions and other legal \norders for employment, reinstatement, promotion, back pay, and other \nchanges in terms and conditions of employment.\n  How many times in a workweek does an employee ask a supervisor for a \nchange in working hours or work schedule? For example, ``Hey, boss, I \nwant to only work a 35 hour week'' or ``I want Fridays off in hunting \nseason'' or ``I would prefer to work closer to home.'' If this European \nstyle, so-called right to request law were to be adopted in the United \nStates, it would bog down the workplace with mandatory negotiation of \npotentially any decision affecting working hours, work schedules, or \nlocation of work with every individual employee--a union of one--and \nwith the threat of federal investigations and legal actions.\n  Is that the type of change we want?\n  Labor leaders and their allies frequently point to Europe when they \nlobby for changes in U.S. labor and employment laws. But even a cursory \nlook at comparative economic indicators shows that the adoption of a \nFrench or German-style labor regime actually reduces workers' job \noptions and diminishes wages while bogging down economies and \ndiscouraging enterprise.\n  Flexibility is a key factor in the economic dynamism of the U.S. \nlabor market. The ease with which employers can build and rebuild their \nworkforces provides great flexibility in innovation and response to \nmarket changes. The United States is the easiest country in the entire \nworld in which to employ labor, according to The World Bank, and the \nthird best country in which to do business overall.\n  Meanwhile, U.S. labor productivity far outpaces that of France and \nGermany, and also Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom. The United \nStates has not only been the most productive country in the world but \nhas also grown in productivity at a greater rate than other developed \nnations. In 2006, U.S. productivity per employed person was nearly \n$65,000 compared to $49,000 for France and $43,000 in Germany.\n  The U.S. has been an engine of job creation for the past 35 years \ndespite temporary recessions, gas shortages and even terrorist attacks. \nCompared to workers in most of Europe, U.S. workers have more job and \ncareer options, greater upward mobility, and employment growth.\n  Consider unemployment rates. France's jobless rate is Europe's \nhighest. This chart shows unemployment rates for the past 15 years or \nso. Notice that the United State's highest unemployment rate--6.1 \npercent in 1994--doesn't come close to the lowest unemployment rates \nfor France, which was 8.4 percent in 2001. For the past 15 years, the \nU.S. average unemployment rate was 5.1 percent, while France's was \ndouble that at 10 percent.\n  Looking at the past few years in France, nearly 70 percent of those \nunemployed have been looking for work for more than six months and \nnearly 45 percent of them were still looking for work after a year. In \nGermany, about 55 percent of the unemployed is out of work for at least \nthat long.\n  In the United States, workers stand a better chance of getting \nanother job and sooner. Less than 20 percent of those unemployed have \nbeen looking for a job for 6 months or longer, and only about 10 \npercent were looking for more than a year.\n  For centuries, people from all over the world have been drawn to the \nUnited States for economic opportunity. While the unions and some in \nCongress believe that European-style labor law is what is best for \nworkers, leaders in France and Germany know better. They understand \nthat regulatory economic rigidities that hold out the false hope of job \nsecurity often limits workers' options for finding better \nopportunities, makes it harder for the unemployed to find work, and \ndiscourages entrepreneurs from creating new middle class jobs. Congress \ncannot mandate that employers create jobs, stay in business, or even \nthat they do not conduct business elsewhere. But in the name of change, \nostensibly to help the middle class, Congress can mandate\n\n[[Page S5735]]\n\nthe types of harmful employment regulations that will reduce or even \neliminate middle class jobs in the United States.\n  ``Europeanization'' of U.S. labor and employment laws is not the type \nof change the middle class really needs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, there is no doubt that right now American \nfamilies are being squeezed on all sides. Gas prices are sky high and \nclimbing. The cost of food is going up. So is the cost of college \ntuition and health care. So it is no surprise that ``change'' is the \nword everyone is talking about.\n  My colleagues on this side of the aisle and I want change, too, but \nwe want commonsense solutions. We are the party of economic security. \nWe think we should keep more of the money we earn. We favor more \nprivate sector solutions to health care. We want America's energy \nfuture to be here in America, not the Middle East. We want to change \nthe disastrous policy that has been implemented and kept by our fellow \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle for the last 30 years, a \nnonenergy policy, no production. As a Washington Post editorial pointed \nout today, Congress cannot repeal the laws of supply and demand. Demand \nworldwide has gone up but supply has not.\n  We have the answer to that problem right here in America. We want to \nchange it and use the resources we have. We also want a strong \ncommitment in the war on terror. Changing back to the policies of the \n1990s is not the way to win the war on terror. Senator Obama has said \nwe should go back to the 9/11 days, when terrorism was treated as just \nanother law enforcement matter. He pointed to the prosecution of the \nWorld Trade Center bombers as the example to follow. That is precisely \nthe type of policy that led to attacks on American embassies and the \nUSS Cole. That is the kind of change that will make the Nation less \nsafe again.\n  If the Democrats wish to talk about change, let's talk about change, \nchange that matters and change that they have been unwilling to \nacknowledge, a change when we started executing the war on terror by \ngoing after the terrorists in the safe havens. We have kept our country \nsafe from attack since 9/11. Under the leadership of GEN David \nPetraeus, Iraq has changed and changed dramatically. So why can't my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle change with it. Why can't \nthey change their stance and get behind our service men and women who \nwant to succeed and have had tremendous successes?\n  President Bush announced the surge and the new counterinsurgency in \n2007. Iraq was a violent place at the time. Al-Qaida in Iraq held large \nswaths of territory. Shiite death squads roamed much of Baghdad, and \nthe Iraqi political leadership appeared helpless. So President Bush, \nunderstanding the consequences of failure and withdrawal, changed. He \nchanged military leadership. General Petraeus changed to a new \nstrategy, a strategy for victory, of counterinsurgency or COIN that \ninvolves getting out among the Iraqi people, working directly with \nIraqis committed to a peaceful, stable Iraq. That is a change my son \nsaw in Al Anbar, when his Marine scout sniper platoon helped clear Al \nAnbar and turn it over to Sunni citizens and police. We still face big \nchallenges in Iraq but with a far more optimistic picture emerging. Al-\nQaida has been almost, if not completely, routed in Al Anbar, once \ndeclared the center and base of operations for al-Qaida in Iraq.\n  On May 12 of this year, a prolific terrorist sympathizer by the name \nof Dir'a Limen Wehhed posted a study on the Internet in which he \nlaments ``the dire situation that the mujaheddin find themselves in in \nIraq.'' He is talking about his guys, the bad guys. He cites the steep \ndrop in the number of insurgent operations conducted by various \nterrorist groups, most notably al-Qaida's 94 percent decline in \noperational ability over the last 12 months. In Sadr City, Iraqi \nforces, the forces of the Iraqi Shiite leader al-Maliki, have rolled \nthrough huge Shiite enclaves relatively unopposed. Iraqi forces did the \nsame in April in the southern city of Basra, where the Iraqi Government \nadvanced its goal of establishing sovereignty and curtailing the powers \nof the militias.\n  When General Petraeus returned to Washington in September of last \nyear, even at that time he reported that the number of violent \nincidents, civilian deaths, ethnosectarian killings and car and suicide \nbombings had declined dramatically from the previous December. But \ndespite all this positive change, many on the other side of the aisle \nare too vested in political defeat to see it. In fact, most Democrats \nopposed the surge, claiming it is more of the same and would neither \nmake a dent in the violence nor change the dynamics in Iraq. The \nDemocratic leader proclaimed ``This war is lost'' and that U.S. troops \nshould pack up and come home, a disastrous change that even many \nthoughtful scholars and commentators who opposed going into Iraq \ninitially say now is not the way to go. It would be a disaster. General \nPetraeus returned again to Washington in April this year, and violence \nhas been reduced further. American casualties have declined \nsignificantly. Al-Qaida was virtually eliminated in the northern city \nof Mosul, as verified by the terrorists themselves. There are more \nIraqi security forces. The Iraqi Government has passed a variety of \nlaws promoting reconciliation. Prime Minister al-Maliki continues to \ndemonstrate he can stand up to fellow Shiites supporting violence and \nIranian-backed special groups. There is every reason to embrace the \npositive change we have seen and not abandon it and not force a \nwithdrawal. For that is not change but, rather, a policy that would put \nIraq back on the path toward violence, terrorism, and chaos.\n  The change we have made has made our country safer, going after \nterrorists, helping Iraq stabilize their country, turning control over \nto them, and moving our forces back from the front lines of offense to \na support role. That is the change we need to keep our country safe for \nthe future from terrorist attacks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5735-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5735-S5736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, so much discussion has taken place of \nlate about the high price of energy and what it is doing to family \nbudgets. We don't need to tell the American consumer what is going on \nwith high prices. They are living it directly in each and every one of \nour States.\n  At today's prices, Americans are paying $1.6 billion daily to buy \nfuel. This is about twice what they paid 2 years ago. The national \naverage price of gasoline passed the $4.08-per-gallon mark, and fuel is \nconsuming about 6 percent of the typical household budget. This eats up \nthe money families need for food, clothing, medicine, education, 6 \npercent of the average U.S. household budget.\n  In my State of Alaska--you hear me say this all the time--our \nstatistics are a little bit different. I need to let you know what kind \nof a hit Alaska's families are taking when it comes to high energy \nprices.\n  Right now, in Anchorage, the State's largest community, it is about \n10 percent of the typical household budget that is directed toward \nenergy costs. In the southeastern part of the State, where I was born \nand spent my early years, they are seeing about 14 percent of their \nfamily budget going toward energy costs. In the community of Fairbanks, \nup in the interior, where I spent my growing-up years in high school \nand years as a young adult, 22 percent of the household budget is going \ntoward their energy costs. Nearly a quarter of the family budget is \ngoing into home heating fuel, into gas at the pump, into keeping their \nhome warm during the long winter months--22 percent of the family \nbudget.\n  As I have said before, people in Alaska are no longer angry about \ntheir energy prices. They are very afraid. You cannot continue on a \ntrend such as this with this much of the family budget being dedicated \nto your energy prices and still survive.\n  There has been great debate on this floor about, How do we fix it? \nHow do we reduce the price of energy for the American family? There are \nsome who\n\n[[Page S5736]]\n\nimply the way to reduce energy prices is to perhaps punish the oil \ncompanies with tax hikes for the current high prices. The second option \nfor some is to punish OPEC for their energy production levels by \nsomehow dragging foreign nations into U.S. courts.\n  I would like to suggest that while maybe it might make some people \nfeel good if they know we are imposing higher taxes on the energy \nindustry, it is probably not a good idea for the 23 percent of \nindividual Americans who own energy stocks or those who have pension \nfunds, 27 percent of which are invested in energy stocks, or those who \nown mutual funds who have 29.5 percent of their funds invested in \nenergy companies.\n  The problem we really have with additional taxation of the energy \ncompanies is, while it is going to funnel more revenue to the Federal \nGovernment--we have demonstrated this in the past--it is going to give \nus in Congress more money to spend on bureaucracy, but it is not \nnecessarily going to do anything to increase our energy supplies, and \nit will not do anything to lower our energy prices. In fact, by taking \nmoney away from the energy companies, they are going to have less money \nto invest in searching for and producing more energy. Those are the \nthings that will ultimately reduce energy prices into the future.\n  As far as this ``NOPEC'' concept of hauling OPEC nations into U.S. \ncourts, no one has really explained just how this is all really going \nto work, how we would collect a judgment and still maintain access to \nworld supplies of energy, and more importantly, how that would actually \nget money back into the pockets of American consumers or how that would \nkeep American companies from being dragged constantly into foreign \ncourts. Asking OPEC to produce more of their energy and then \nthreatening to drag them into American courts if their production \nlevels fall--which is what we have seen in this country--does not make \nsense to me. Instead, it seems to me the best way we can drive down \nfuel prices is for us to produce more in America, giving the jobs to \nAmericans, and keep the royalties and tax revenues in U.S. hands.\n  I have said many times on this floor that it is not just all about \nincreased production. We have to do more to encourage energy \nconservation, to encourage fuel efficiency. We have to do more to \npromote and develop the renewable energy technologies.\n  Just last week in the Energy Committee, we had a fascinating \ndiscussion about a process for using algae to produce hydrocarbons from \nwhich gasoline can then be made. It is a ``green crude'' type concept. \nIt is wonderful to be exploring opportunities such as this. Hopefully, \nwe are going to reach an agreement on a compromise to continue the tax \naid to encourage wind, solar, biomass, geothermal, ocean energy, and \nnuclear development.\n  The fact is, we need to do more of everything to promote lower energy \nprices. We have to do more to promote efficiency, more to promote \nalternatives, and more to produce traditional fuels in America.\n  One of my colleagues, the fine Senator from Tennessee, has summed it \nup in four simple words: We have to find more, use less--pretty simple. \nWhat a philosophy. What an energy policy. But on the ``finding more'' \naspect, we need to produce more from the Outer Continental Shelf. We \nneed to produce more onshore from the Arctic Coastal Plain up in \nAlaska. We need to do more in the oil shales in the West. We need to \nproduce more natural gas from the OCS but also from the formations in \nTexas and the Appalachians. We have to protect, but streamline \npermitting rules so new refineries can be built. We need to be working \nharder so we can tap America's energy--really our ace in the hole--\nwhich is our vast coal reserves and our vast hydrate resources, and do \nthis in a way that can be done without increasing carbon emissions into \nthe atmosphere. We also need to make sure there is sufficient \ntransmission capacity to move the power to where we need it once it has \nbeen produced.\n  Some act as if we in this country cannot produce more energy. They \nimply that either we do not have anything left to produce or we cannot \ndo it without harming the environment. I think both of those views are \njust plain wrong.\n  Look at the mean estimates of the undiscovered resources. This is \nwhat the USGS and the MMS have on line. We have an even chance of being \nable to produce 85.8 billion barrels of oil and 419.8 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas. That is 10 times our remaining proven reserves of \noil and nearly 15 times our proven reserves of gas. This is a decade's \nsupply of oil for this Nation.\n  America still has a third of all the oil Saudi Arabia has, and it is \njust waiting to be discovered. That does not include the 1.8 trillion \nbarrels of oil shale or the 1,000-year supply of methane hydrates we \npossess in this country. In Alaska alone, when we are talking about \ncoal reserves--we say we are the Saudi Arabia of coal--we need to \nrecognize the resource is there.\n  On the floor earlier, there have been claims that I would like to \nrespond to that we do not need to lease more acreage onshore or \noffshore because oil companies have millions of acres under lease from \nwhich they are not producing energy. That claim in part is true, but \nthe part that is left out is exactly why we need to make better lands \navailable for oil development in the country.\n\n  Clearly, oil companies are not going to spend billions of dollars a \nyear up front to lease lands, for the opportunity to explore and pay \nyearly fees to keep the leases in place, just to let them sit idle. In \nmost cases, companies are not producing because they are still \nevaluating the potential of the leases. In other cases, you have oil \nfinds that are so small that they are just not yet commercial to \ndevelop without additional oil being found nearby.\n  Up in Alaska, in the National Petroleum Reserve, it may take as many \nas 14 years for the leases to be developed, while dealing with the \nenvironmental permitting and logistics issues you face in an area that \nis as geographically remote as NPRA is, in order to bring these leases \ninto production. In addition, we have extremely short windows in terms \nof the exploration and construction season, which we have in place to \navoid the impacts on wildlife.\n  But the primary reason is that the companies spend millions of \ndollars on seismic and exploratory wells but still find very little. \nEven with the technology, with the 3-D seismic, companies gamble when \nthey bid for leases, and they oftentimes find nothing.\n  So if we made more prospective areas open to exploration, then more \noil would likely be found. So this is not necessarily the result of \nsome conspiracy, but the fact is that oil is hard to find.\n  To wrap up, can we be energy independent immediately? No, we cannot. \nBut can we help ourselves produce enough oil to help meet global \ndemand, lowering prices, and keep our families from going broke? Yes, I \nbelieve we can. We know how to protect the environment in the process \nof development. We can protect wilderness. We already have in the State \nof Alaska. We have set aside an area that is nearly as large as all of \nOregon, and this is in wilderness forever, never to be touched. But \nlet's allow some of the land that is likely to contain oil and gas--not \njust places that don't--let's allow them to be open for exploration and \nproduction.\n  So let's put aside some of these preconceived biases that I think \nboth parties and both of our constituencies hold. Let's shelve the \ncampaign rhetoric and actually do something that is good for the short-\nterm and long-term good of the Nation. I believe we can do it. I \nbelieve this is change in which we all can believe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5736-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5736-S5739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ENERGY PRODUCTION\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wish to talk some about energy. I know \nthe President, this morning, my colleague, Senator McCain, and others \nhave talked a lot today about additional production.\n  I am one of the four Senators who initiated in this body several \nyears ago, along with Senator Bingaman, Senator Domenici, and Senator \nTalent, the legislation that is now law that opened lease 181 in the \nGulf of Mexico, where there are substantial oil and gas reserves. We \nopened that up on a bipartisan basis. In addition to cosponsoring that \nlegislation, I have also introduced\n\n[[Page S5737]]\n\nlegislation that would open more of the eastern Gulf of Mexico. I think \nit is a smart thing to do.\n  Let me say that the refrain today coming from the President and some \nothers is: Just drill, drill, drill--believing the only way to produce \nmore energy is to sink a hole someplace. There are a lot of ways to \nproduce energy in addition to drilling.\n  We do need more production. We need more conservation. We need \nefficiency. We need renewable forms of energy. We need all of those \nthings. But the discussion today is: Well, if we could just drill in \nANWR--one of the pristine areas of our country that was set aside in \nlegislation signed by Dwight D. Eisenhower as President of the United \nStates--that 10 years from now we may have some oil, I guess.\n  Let me make another suggestion. How about allowing U.S. companies \naccess for drilling off the coast of Cuba? India is interested in doing \nthat. Canada is there. Spain is there. But U.S. companies are banned \nfrom there. There's potentially more than 500,000 barrels of oil that \ncould be produced in these Cuban waters, available for leasing by oil \ncompanies. Our oil companies cannot do it because this administration \nis obsessed with the embargo against Cuba.\n  So I say to the President: You want to drill, drill, drill, and \ndrill? How about drill down in this blue area, as shown on this map? \nSpain is there. Canada is there. China is looking at it. India is \nthere. But, no, you have decided we are embargoed from having our oil \ncompanies look where there is potentially more than half a million \nbarrels of oil a day.\n  Or how about the eastern gulf? I have legislation in on this. But it \nis interesting--the minority side, when they introduced their proposal \nto produce more energy by drilling more, they left this out of their \nproposal. Why? Because a member of their caucus does not want this to \nhappen. So, therefore, it is not a part of their proposal.\n  So in my judgment, enough about drilling and drilling and drilling. \nIf our solution to the energy issue is to drill and to dig, that is \njust yesterday forever. That is not a policy.\n  Now, here is what has happened to oil prices. Oil prices have doubled \nin a year. Now, I do not have to tell anybody that. If you drive your \ncar to the gas pump, you figure that out. If you are a farmer ordering \na load of fuel, you understand that. If you are a trucker trying to \nfigure out whether you are going to be able to run your trucking \nbusiness next week because you cannot afford the fuel, you know this \nproblem. If you are one of nine airlines that have gone bankrupt in \nrecent times, you know this issue.\n  Here is what has happened to the price of oil. Here is what has \nhappened to speculation in the oil markets. It looks a lot like the \nprice of oil, doesn't it? Speculation. This has nothing to do with \npeople who want to buy oil. They want to buy paper back and forth and \nspeculate. Look at what has happened to speculation. It looks like the \nsame line with oil production. Will Rogers talked about speculators \nsome nine decades ago. He talked about people who buy things they never \nget from people who never had it, trying to make money on both sides of \nthe transaction. We have a futures market in energy because you must \nhave a futures market. There are legitimate commercial reasons to hedge \nfuel prices, but when that market is broken and taken over by \nspeculators, then it seems to me the Congress has a responsibility to \ndeal with the broken market.\n\n  I am going to talk about what we should do about this speculation in \na moment, but first I wish to talk about this response to drill as the \nonly response to produce additional energy. It is interesting that in \n1916 this country decided to encourage people to drill for oil and gas. \nIf you could find oil and gas, we wanted to give you a big fat tax \nbreak in 1916. We made it permanent. I wasn't here at the time. We made \nit permanent and said, if you go looking for oil and gas and find it, \nGod bless you. We are going to give you a large tax break.\n  Compare that with what America has done with renewable energy; wind, \nfor example, and solar energy. We put in place a tax incentive for \npeople to produce electricity from wind energy--a production tax \ncredit, it is called. It was put in place in 1992, a short term, kind \nof a shallow tax incentive. It was extended five times, all short term. \nIt was allowed to expire three times. So it has been stutter, step, \nstart, stop. It is a pathetic, anemic, and thoughtless approach for a \ncountry to say to those who are producing renewable energy: We are \nbehind you. We ought not do that. We did almost a century's worth of \npermanent tax incentives for people looking for oil and gas. To those \nwho are trying to do wind and biomass and solar and all of the \nrenewable forms of energy, we said: Well, we are not going to tell you \nwhether we are going to keep providing these incentives.\n  I have a piece of legislation on energy production incentives that \nsays let's decide to tell people that for the next decade, here is \nwhere America is going. Here is America's policy. We believe in wind \nenergy. We believe in renewable energy. Count on it, because this is \nAmerica's policy. That is what we ought to do.\n  We have people who stand up here in the Senate all day today--and the \nPresident at the White House--who say, the only production that matters \nis production by drilling a hole. Well, I am all for drilling holes \nwhere there is oil and raising some oil. But what about being less \ndependent on oil and especially less dependent on imported oil? Seventy \npercent of our oil now comes from off our shores. What about being less \ndependent on that? How about deciding there are other ways to produce?\n  Yesterday we had a cloture vote and that cloture vote would have \nextended--not by enough, in my judgment, but nonetheless would have \nextended--the tax incentives for renewable energy. Almost every Member \nof the minority voted against it. Why? Because it would have raised \nfunds to pay for it by plugging a loophole that allows big hedge fund \noperators who get a billion dollars or a half a billion dollars a year \nin compensation to park that money overseas in a deferred account and \navoid paying taxes to our country. So we were going to plug that \nloophole and the other side has an apoplectic seizure. It is \nunbelievable to me.\n  We are about production. We are trying to say here are the tax \nincentives necessary to produce more energy. Yes, it is renewable \nenergy. It is an important part of our production need. And the other \nside says no, we don't support that because you are trying to make \nhedge fund managers pay their taxes as everybody else does. Well, not \nquite pay their taxes as everybody else. We were trying to plug the \nloophole that allows them to defer paying their taxes. But even if they \nhad to pay them on time, many are paying a 15-percent tax rate on their \nearnings called carried interest. That is another story. They are \npaying less than the receptionist in their office, which is pretty \nunbelievable.\n  But my point is simple. We fought out here yesterday on the floor of \nthe Senate to provide the tax incentives that will produce more energy, \nand all the way along, the minority is objecting. It is like a bicycle \nbuilt for two. We are pedaling uphill and they are sitting on the \nbackseat with their foot on the brake. Then they come out the next day \ncomplaining that somehow not enough is being produced and they get the \nPresident to say the same thing out of the White House. They try to get \npeople to think that somehow by waving a wand and drilling a hole some \nplace they are going to solve the problem of $4 a gallon gasoline or \n$140 for a barrel of oil. It is not going to happen.\n  Production is not just drilling. I support drilling. In fact, the \nU.S. Geological Survey just issued a recoverable oil assessment in my \nstate--because I had requested that 2 years ago they do a survey. They \ncompleted their work and announced the largest survey or assessment of \nrecoverable oil they have ever found in the lower 48 States: 3.6 \nbillion barrels of recoverable sweet light crude. It is not as if we \nare not producing. We are. This is a new field called the Bakken shale \nfield. But we are not doing enough with respect to renewables because \nof the attitude of the President and others in this Chamber who think \nthe only way you produce energy is to try to sink a drill bit some \nplace. There are a lot of ways to produce energy and we ought to be \ndoing all of them. Instead we have dramatically shortchanged renewable \nenergy.\n\n[[Page S5738]]\n\n  I wish to turn for a moment to a solution of this issue of what is \nhappening in the market that has caused the runup in price. There is \nnothing in the fundamentals of supply and demand of oil that justifies \nwhat has happened to double the price of oil--nothing. Oh, I suppose \nyou could make the case that we have a perverted market someplace where \npeople talk about free market. There is no free market. What an \nabsurdity. In oil? Are you kidding me? First you have the OPEC \ncountries sitting around a table in a closed room with their ministers \nmaking decisions about production and price. Then you have the oil \ncompanies with two names because they romanced and got married: Exxon \nromanced Mobil and now it is ExxonMobil; Phillips liked Conoco, so they \ngot married and now they have two names. Bigger, stronger, more muscle \nin the marketplace. Then there is the futures market which has become \nan unbelievable amount of speculation. So there is no free market.\n\n  Let me quote some folks who have come to the Congress. This is Fidel \nGheit, a 30-year veteran of the Oppenheimer Company. He is the top \nenergy trader at Oppenheimer, a very respected organization. Here is \nwhat he says: There is no shortage of oil. I am absolutely convinced \nthat oil prices shouldn't be a dime above $55 a barrel. I call it the \nworld's largest gambling hall. It is open 24/7. Unfortunately it's \ntotally unregulated. This is like a highway with no cops and no speed \nlimit, everybody's going 120 miles an hour.\n  If you don't believe Mr. Gheit, how about Mr. Clarence Cazalot, CEO \nof Marathon Oil: $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand on the \nmarket. Steven Simon, senior vice president of Exxon: The price of oil \nshould be about $50-$55 per barrel.\n  So what has gone haywire here? What is the problem? Well, we have a \nregulatory agency called the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They \nare supposed to be the regulators. We have a lot of people in \nregulatory bodies these days who think regulation is a four-letter \nword. They came to their jobs with an Administration that said, ease \nup. Soften up. We don't want you to regulate very much.\n  So we have the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Acting \nChairman of Commodity Futures Trading Commission testified yesterday. \nHe doesn't have the foggiest idea of what percentage of the contracts \nbeing traded in these energy markets are contracts he can't see or can \nsee, but he has already made a conclusion that excessive speculation is \nnot the problem. Surprise, surprise.\n  Well, here is what Mr. Lukken has said, the acting head of the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission. This is the guy who is supposed \nto wear the striped shirts and call the fouls and be the referee: Based \non our surveillance efforts to date, we believe energy futures markets \nhave been reflecting the underlying fundamentals of these markets.\n  July of last year. What is going on with the price of oil? ``Oh, it \nis just the fundamentals.'' That is what the head of the regulatory \nbody says.\n  In January, 6 months later, one word difference. He said: Based on \nour surveillance efforts to date, we believe that energy futures \nmarkets have been largely reflecting the underlying fundamentals.\n  Nothing there, I guess, not from the acting head of the regulatory \nagency.\n  In February: We are confident that the futures exchanges and \nclearinghouses are functioning well, especially during these turbulent \ntimes.\n  No problem there. Be happy. Everything is working fine. Oh, the price \nof oil is doubling. We have an unbelievable amount of speculation going \non, but don't worry, sleep well.\n  On May 7 he says: We can say with a high degree of confidence that \npeople are not manipulating the energy markets.\n  Then at the end of May, this man had an epiphany. I don't know \nwhether it was during his sleep or perhaps a staff meeting. He decided \nthere might be something wrong: I am not willing to say there is \nspeculation, but there might be something haywire here and oh, by the \nway, we have been investigating it for 7 months.\n  I don't know. It is kind of hard if someone has been saying for 7 \nmonths nothing is wrong and then says oh, by the way, we have been \ninvestigating it for 7 months. A curious way, for someone who is paid \nto be a regulator, to describe to the American people their regulatory \nresponsibilities.\n  I think the evidence is pretty substantial that there is something \ngoing wrong in this marketplace, and when markets don't work--and \nsometimes they don't--there is a responsibility to take some action.\n  I used to teach a bit of economics. I think the market system is the \nbest allocator of goods and services I know of. There are times, \nhowever, the market system breaks. It doesn't work. That is what has \nhappened here. There is a bubble that has occurred with a wave and a \nrash of speculation into these markets that has driven up the price \nwell beyond that which can be justified by the quantity of oil or the \ndemand for oil. The fact is this: In 4 of the first 5 months of the \nyear, crude oil stocks in this country--the inventory of crude oil \nstocks increased. In 4 to 5 months, we actually had more inventory of \ncrude oil stocks. At the same time, demand was beginning to dampen. \nThere was less demand, more supply, so one would think prices would \ncome down. It didn't happen. Prices continued to skyrocket. Something \nis broken in this marketplace.\n  I am going to introduce legislation, I hope early tomorrow--and I \nhope with bipartisan support. My legislation is called the ``End Oil \nSpeculation Act of 2008.'' It is a rather simple piece of legislation \nthat deals with a complicated area. It would be designed, as we have \nwritten it, to eliminate manipulation and excess speculation of the \nfutures petroleum market. By the way, existing law already has a \nprovision with respect to excess speculation. But one would not expect, \nin my judgment, the current Commodity Futures Trading Commission's \nchairman to take action to address that, at least based on what he has \nbeen saying, that there is nothing at all wrong.\n\n  This proposal would restore the petroleum futures market to its \noriginal purpose and intent as a place for hedge transactions by \ncommercial producers and purchasers involving actual, physical \npetroleum products for future delivery and their direct counterparts. \nThat is legitimate hedge trading. I support it. That is as \ndistinguished from trading that goes well beyond that; that is, people \nwho are not interested in taking physical possession, people who are \nnot in the oil industry but they are interested in trading paper based \non a speculative interest in making money.\n  I suggest we revoke or modify all prior actions that fail to \neliminate or discourage all non-legitimate hedge trading by, for \nexample, applying position limits to all non-legitimate hedge trading. \nThis legislation will require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nto segregate the kind of trading that exists, the kind of trading for \nwhich the market was established--typical commercial hedging--and the \ntrading that has nothing to do with that at all but is simply and \npurely speculative trading. To distinguish between legitimate hedge \ntrading and all other trading is necessary for a piece of legislation \nsuch as this to work. It will require that the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission do so and do so by a time certain.\n  It would also provide that there would be regulation of all persons--\nto the extent possible--who are engaged in trading in petroleum futures \nwherever the market is located unless and until there are regulations \nthat are substantially identical to the Commission's regulations and \nthat are fully and effectively enforced.\n  The proposal would provide an increased margin requirement that I \nspell out in the bill for the non-legitimate hedge trading, and that \nincreased margin requirement would be designed to try to soak out the \nspeculation in these markets and make it more difficult for the \nspeculators.\n  The American people need some help here. They are the victims of a \nmarket that has the American consumer bobbing around at the bottom, \nwatching these prices they can't afford go right to the top, day after \nday after day. How many more people are going to go to the gas pump and \ntry to figure out how much can I put in and still buy the groceries I \nneed? We had a man come to a meeting I held today who talked about the \nfact that a mother brought her\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\ndaughter to his office because she was talking about committing \nsuicide. She brought her daughter in to get some medical help, but she \ndidn't have enough gas to get back home. The mother had enough gas to \nget in with her daughter to see a doctor, but didn't have enough gas to \nget home. The mother stopped in the office of Ron His Horse is Thunder \nwho is the tribal chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to ask for \nsome gas to be able to drive back home. The story is much sadder \nbecause the young lady then committed suicide some weeks later.\n  But think of the people around this country who are wondering, how \ncan I afford the gas to go see the doctor, or to get to my job? Think \nof the owners of the trucking company that is trying to get by, which \nhas been around for 30 years, but is thinking now that they can't \ncontinue. How about an airline that is struggling to make it and can't \npossibly afford to pay these jet fuel costs?\n  Does any of this matter to anybody? It does to me. If a significant \npart of the problem results from speculation, it seems to me we have a \nresponsibility to deal with it. When markets are broken, we have a \nresponsibility to address it.\n  My legislation will do just that. I don't claim that it is perfect or \nthat it will be easy, but I do claim that it is not enough to come to \nthe Chamber and talk about what we need to do is open ANWR. Ten years \nfrom now, good for us, we will have opened something that was one of \nthe most pristine areas that we have set aside.\n  Do you want to drill? There is a lot more oil in the Gulf of Mexico \nthan in ANWR. So let's not use a hood ornament called ANWR to describe \nAmerica's current problems with respect to oil development. It is not \naccurate, and it is not, in my judgment, thoughtful. There are other \nways for us to address this issue.\n  Mr. President, I am going to speak tomorrow, as well, as I introduce \nthe legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Under the previous order, the veto message is \nconsidered read and spread in full upon the Journal and will be printed \nin the Record. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Veto message to accompany H.R. 6124, to provide for the \n     continuation of agricultural and other programs of the \n     Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2012, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The veto message ordered to be printed in the Record is as follows:\n\nTo the House of Representatives:\n  I am returning herewith without my approval H.R. 6124, the ``Food, \nConservation, and Energy Act of 2008.''\n  The bill that I vetoed on May 21, 2008, H.R. 2419, which became \nPublic Law 110-234, did not include the title III provisions that are \nin this bill. In passing H.R. 6124, the Congress had an opportunity to \nimprove on H.R. 2419 by modifying certain objectionable, onerous, and \nfiscally imprudent provisions. Unfortunately, the Congress chose to \nsend me the same unacceptable farm bill provisions in H.R. 6124, merely \nadding title III, I am returning this bill for the same reasons as \nstated in my veto message of May 21, 2008, on H.R. 2419.\n  For a year and a half, I have consistently asked that the Congress \npass a good farm bill that I can sign. Regrettably, the Congress has \nfailed to do so. At a time of high food prices and record farm income, \nthis bill lacks program reform and fiscal discipline. It continues \nsubsidies for the wealthy and increases farm bill spending by more than \n$20 billion, while using budget gimmicks to hide much of the increase. \nIt is inconsistent with our objectives in international trade \nnegotiations, which include securing greater market access for American \nfarmers and ranchers. It would needlessly expand the size and scope of \ngovernment. Americans sent us to Washington to achieve results and be \ngood stewards of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars. This bill violates \nthat fundamental commitment.\n  In January 2007, my Administration put forward a fiscally responsible \nfarm bill proposal that would improve the safety net for farmers and \nmove current programs toward more market-oriented policies. The bill \nbefore me today fails to achieve these important goals.\n  At a time when net farm income is projected to increase by more than \n$28 billion in 1 year, the American taxpayer should not be forced to \nsubsidize that group of farmers who have adjusted gross incomes of up \nto $1.5 million. When commodity prices are at record highs, it is \nirresponsible to increase government subsidy rates for 15 crops, \nsubsidize additional crops, and provide payments that further distort \nmarkets. Instead of better targeting farm programs, this bill \neliminates the existing payment limit on marketing loan subsidies.\n  Now is also not the time to create a new uncapped revenue guarantee \nthat could cost billions of dollars more than advertised. This is on \ntop of a farm bill that is anticipated to cost more than $600 billion, \nover 10 years. In addition, this bill would force many businesses to \nprepay their taxes in order to finance the additional spending.\n  This legislation is also filled with earmarks and other ill-\nconsidered provisions. Most notably, H.R. 6124 provides; $175 million \nto address water issues for desert lakes; $250 million for a 400,000-\nacre land purchase from a private owner; funding and authority for the \nnoncompetitive sale of National Forest land to a ski resort; and $382 \nmillion earmarked for a specific watershed. These earmarks, and the \nexpansion of Davis-Bacon Act prevailing wage requirements, have no \nplace in the farm bill. Rural and urban Americans alike are frustrated \nwith excessive government spending and the funneling of taxpayer funds \nfor pet projects. This bill will only add to that frustration.\n  The bill also contains a wide range of other objectionable \nprovisions, including one that restricts our ability to redirect food \naid dollars for emergency use at a time of great need globally. The \nbill does not include the requested authority to buy food in the \ndeveloping world to save lives. Additionally, provisions in the bill \nraise serious constitutional concerns. For all the reasons outlined \nabove, I must veto H.R. 6124.\n  I veto this bill fully aware that it is rare for a stand-alone farm \nbill not to receive the President's signature, but my action today is \nnot without precedent. In 1956, President Eisenhower stood firmly on \nprinciple, citing high crop subsidies and too much government control \nof farm programs among the reasons for his veto. President Eisenhower \nwrote in his veto message, ``Bad as some provisions of this bill are, I \nwould have signed it if in total it could be interpreted as sound and \ngood for farmers and the nation.'' For similar reasons, I am vetoing \nthe bill before me today.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \n                                        The White House, June 18, 2008.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. is equally divided.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will not take much time. We are here \nagain for another vote on whether to override the President's veto of \nthe Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008, which we otherwise know \nas the farm bill. The veto message before the Senate is to accompany \nH.R. 6124, which is\n\n[[Page S5740]]\n\nthe bill passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives to \nenact the full conference report on the new farm bill in the exact form \nit was agreed to and intended by the conferees and approved by both \nbodies overwhelmingly last month.\n  That conference report, on the bill H.R. 2419, was approved by the \nHouse on May 14 by a vote of 318 to 106, and by the Senate on May 15 by \na vote of 81 to 15. That measure was vetoed by the President, but after \nthe veto it was discovered that one title of the bill--Title III, \ncovering food aid and agricultural trade--had been inadvertently \nomitted during the enrollment process. At the time of that discovery \nthe Memorial Day recess was imminent, as was the expiration of the \nextension of the previous farm bill enacted in 2002. Both bodies then \nvoted to enact H.R. 2419, as it was enrolled, notwithstanding the \nPresident's veto. The House vote was 316 to 108 and the Senate vote was \n82 to 13. Thus, 14 of the 15 titles of the farm bill, H.R. 2419, were \nfully enacted into law as agreed to and included in the conference \nreport.\n  On May 22, the House with a vote of 306 to 110 passed the measure now \nbefore the Senate, H.R. 6124, which includes the entire farm bill \nconference report, in order to enact the Title III and, in effect, \nreenact the other titles that were enacted when the Senate overrode the \nPresident's veto of H.R. 2419. The Senate passed H.R. 6124 on June 5 by \na vote of 77 to 15. The President vetoed the bill today, and earlier \nthis afternoon the House voted 317 to 109 to enact the legislation \nnotwithstanding the veto.\n  Since this legislation has been thoroughly debated previously, I \ndon't need to take much time now. I will just sum it up by saying this \nis a very good bill. It continues, reforms and strengthens income \nprotection for the benefit of farm and ranch families and the rural \neconomy. The bill will move our Nation ahead in maintaining our \npreeminent position in the world in agriculture production. The \nnutrition title very significantly improves and strengthens food \nassistance. As we have pointed out, nearly 70 percent of the funding \nprovided in this bill goes for nutrition and food assistance for \nAmericans. The energy provisions will help unleash the potential of \nagriculture and rural communities to supply energy to our nation. And \nfarmers and ranchers will receive significantly more help through funds \nand technical assistance to conserve and protect soil, improve water \nquality, and boost wildlife on their land.\n  Regarding Title III of this legislation, the majority of it involves \nthe operation of our international food aid programs, in particular, \nthe Title II Food for Peace program run by the Agency for International \nDevelopment; the Food for Progress and McGovern-Dole Food for Education \nprograms, both run by the Department of Agriculture; and the program \nfor holding food stocks for emergency purposes under the Bill Emerson \nHumanitarian Trust.\n  These authorities are vital to our Nation's efforts to alleviate \nhunger and poverty, and to foster development around the globe. So it \nis essential that we reinstate these authorities by enacting the \nlegislation before us. We have included in this bill important reforms \nof the food aid programs, aimed at improving their operations and \nmaking them more responsive to humanitarian needs. All in all, the \nprovisions of Title III of this bill are non-controversial and are \ndefinitely needed to ensure the continuity of U.S. food aid, as well as \nour very important agricultural trade promotion programs at the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend, the ranking member, who started \nthis farm bill process when he was chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, Senator Chambliss of Georgia, and so many others who helped.\n  I see my good friend, Senator Kent Conrad, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, who kept us on track through all these many days and nights \nof getting this bill put together. I want to thank them both for all \ntheir help in finally getting us to this point.\n  Let me also thank my colleagues for their patience and understanding \nin dealing with the unusual procedural history we have experienced in \nthe course of enacting this bill. I am grateful for the overwhelming \nsupport for the legislation and for our work in completing it.\n  Because of the unusual procedural history of the Food, Conservation, \nand Energy Act of 2008, I want to note that the full legislative \nhistory for H.R. 2419, including the conference report statement of \nmanagers, committee reports, and statements in the Congressional Record \nare to be considered as legislative history for the provisions of H.R. \n6124.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I think Senator Harkin has said it all. \nIt seems like we vote on the farm bill once a week as of late, and this \nis our weekly vote on the farm bill again. I do hope this is our last \nvote because this is such a serious piece of legislation.\n  I did a talk radio show a little earlier today, and we were talking \nabout gas prices, and I talked about what we did in the farm bill \nrelative to energy. The talk show host said: Wait a minute. All you are \ndoing is getting criticized in the press over this farm bill. He said: \nThis has some good stuff in it relative to gas prices.\n  I said: Yes, it really does.\n  So we did an awful lot in this bill relative to energy. We did an \nawful lot relative to nutrition, as the chairman said. And, finally, I \nthink, hopefully, that message is going to get out across America.\n  The Chairman did a magnificent job leading us down this road, and I \ncommend him and thank him for his great work. And to my good friend, \nSenator Conrad, without him this would not have gotten done. I \nappreciate his great leadership and great support.\n  I want to tell particularly the chairman, as we had our meeting today \nwith the Secretary, we were talking about implementing, Mr. President, \nthis farm bill, and we were reminded in that meeting about what is \ngoing on in Iowa today, as we speak. The banks of the Mississippi and a \ncouple of other rivers out there are overflowing onto farmland and \ndestroying crops and creating havoc. In this farm bill we have a \ndisaster package that is not going to require emergency spending for \nthe 2008 crop. And it was criticized very much as we went through the \nprocess, yet folks in Iowa are going to be hurting, and folks in \nMissouri, as that water comes downstream, are going to be hurting, and \nI think this farm bill is going to turn out to be the best product we \nhave put out, from a farm bill perspective.\n  It will continue to be criticized, and it is not perfect by any \nmeans, but under the leadership of the chairman, I think it has been a \ngreat product, and I thank him and I thank Senator Conrad for his great \nleadership and friendship that we have as a result of this farm bill.\n  To our staffs, thanks for great work. I look forward to this 5:30 \nvote, and I certainly hope this is the last one on the farm bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, perhaps I could say the farm bill is so \ngood we would like to have senators put their stamp of approval on it \nrepeatedly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota \nwhatever time he requires.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember. I thank them for their leadership and their partnership and \ntheir vision. This is a bill that is good for consumers, good for \ntaxpayers, and good for farmers. This is the same song, second verse. \nWe have been through this whole rotation once already, but we have to \ndo it again.\n  I think it is very important to remind people this is much more than \na farm bill. This is a food bill with important nutritional components. \nIn fact, 66 percent of the spending in this bill goes for nutrition. It \nis an important conservation bill to conserve our national resources. \nIt is an important energy bill, as was referenced by the chairman and \nthe ranking member. This bill is going to turn the page on developing \nour long-range renewable energy potential, and it contains very \nsignificant farm program reform.\n  In addition, it provides a disaster title so the people who are being \nso devastated in Iowa, in other States, are not going to have to come \nto the Federal Government and ask for disaster aid. It will be there \nfor them.\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\n  The bottom line is this bill does not add to the deficit or debt \nbecause this bill is paid for. That is not my claim; that is the \nfinding of the Congressional Budget Office, which says over the first 5 \nyears this bill has a modest surplus of $67 million. And over the life \nof the bill, the 10-year projections that we are required to comply \nwith, this bill saves $110 million.\n  I conclude by again thanking the chairman for his vision, thanking \nhis staff for their incredible dedication, and thanking the ranking \nmember, Senator Chambliss, whom I call Cool Hand Luke. You couldn't \nhave a better guy in the pit, and it is a pit at times when you are \nwriting a bill of this magnitude and this complexity and this \nimportance. But he always kept his calm, and that helped enormously in \nthese negotiations. And to his outstanding staff, we thank you. Thank \nyou for being willing to serve in public life. We know you could make \nmuch more money some other place, but you have made an enormous \ncontribution to this country.\n  Finally, to Jim Miller, who is my lead negotiator, my very special, \npersonal thanks for extraordinary dedication, for doing something good \nfor the country and my State.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote to override the President's ill-\nconsidered veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I see the hour is just about upon us to \nstart our vote. Again, I also want to thank our staffs, our great \nstaffs who have worked so hard on this legislation for so many months: \nMartha Scott Poindexter and Vernie Hubert, I see over here, and Mark \nHalverson, and all the rest of the staff who are here in the chamber. I \nmentioned them by name before, and I can't thank them enough for all \ntheir hard work. It has been a long endeavor, and they have worked so \nhard, I hope they will be able to take a vacation.\n  Again, to Senator Chambliss, I cannot thank him enough for a great \nworking relationship and helping to pull this bill through. Now we look \nahead to next year and the child nutrition bill, as well as to other \nmatters before us. I also thank Senator Chambliss for his care and his \nconcern, discussing with me--not only today but other times--the \nserious situation in the State of Iowa.\n\n  We are hurting bad. It is hard to describe it, what is happening in \nIowa. This farm bill will put some new policies in place, including the \nnew permanent disaster program we have included, and others in \nagriculture, such as for conservation of our soil and water, so we will \nbe able to get through this terrible crisis we are facing in the State \nof Iowa right now, to recover, to rebuild, and to come back even \nstronger and prepared for the future.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is, Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President \nof the United States to the contrary notwithstanding? The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from New York (Mrs. Clinton), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Obama) \nare necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Madam President, this has been a difficult week. We have \nspent a lot of time in quorum calls. There has been a tremendous number \nof speeches. All have been good. I have enjoyed every one of them. But \nwe have been working very hard to move to something on which we can \nwork together. The housing bill has been brought to us by two of our \nmost experienced legislators--Senators Dodd and Shelby. They both \nserved in the House of Representatives. They are experienced. They \nunderstand how Capitol Hill works. Senator McConnell and I have met \nwith them, and we are now at a point, after a long discussion with \nthem--they have had conversations with the administration; I have not \nhad any, but they have--where Members should be advised that tomorrow \nmorning at 9:30, as soon as the admiral completes his prayer and \nSenator McConnell and I have anything to say, we are going to move \nimmediately to the housing bill. There has been agreement with the \nmanagers, with Senator McConnell and with me, that we are going to \nlegislate on this bill. There will be amendments offered, and we will \nhave amendments debated. We hope we can have some votes scheduled \ntomorrow. We are going to work, everybody should be advised, on Friday. \nMonday is a nonvote day. We have a lot of work we need to do on Monday.\n  I advise everyone, the break before the Fourth of July starts a week \nfrom the day after tomorrow. In that short week, we have 4 days. We \nhave to make sure we complete this housing bill. We will have to take a \nrun at seeing if FISA can be completed. Either the House is going to \nsend us a bill or we have a message here from them and we will work on \nthat. We also have the little piece of legislation, the supplemental \nappropriations bill. The House is going to have a rule on that \ntomorrow. We have permission, as I understand it, from the Republican \nleadership in the House that they can do a same-day rule. That matter \nwill come to us sometime tomorrow night or Friday.\n  We have a lot to do. We all want to go home for the Fourth of July, \nand we all need to go home. We have parades and constituents to see. It \nis an important time. We spend a lot of time here, and it is important \nwe get back to the States during the week rather than only on weekends. \nI think the Republican leader and I have an agreement on how we will \nproceed on the housing bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, let me echo the remarks of the \nmajority leader. We are going to have an opportunity tomorrow to \nlegislate like the Senate has long been accustomed to legislating. We \nare actually going to offer amendments. They are going to be related to \nthe bill, and we are going to get started. The majority leader and I \nand Senator Dodd and Shelby all agree on how we ought to go forward. I \nhope Members on both sides who have amendments that are related to the \nsubject matter will get them out early. Let's process them. Let's have \nthe votes, and let's let the Senate work its will.\n  We also have the other items the majority leader has indicated we \nneed to address before the recess. We will work\n\n[[Page S5742]]\n\ndiligently to get passage on all those matters. There will be a lot of \ncooperation on this side of the aisle, and I am confident there will be \non the other side of the aisle so we can have a productive workweek \nbefore the Fourth of July break.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say one or two additional things, I received a \nletter from, I think, nine Republican Senators and their request was \ntotally valid. They said this is a big piece of legislation. Don't rush \ninto it. I advise all Senators who sent me that letter, the legislation \nhas been available all day. I hope they and their staffs looked through \nit. If there are provisions in it they think should be changed, that is \nwhat tomorrow and the next day and Monday will be all about.\n  While we have a good attendance in the Chamber, during July, there \nare no Monday no-vote days. In July, we are going to work all the work \nperiod. We also have a weekend that we have scheduled that we are going \nto be in session, July 25 we are going to be in session. Everyone has a \nlot of notice now to not plan anything for that weekend. We have work \nwe need to do. I will be in close touch with the Republican leader \ntomorrow and on Monday, before we start our last rush, but everyone \nwill have a good idea of what we are going to do in the next work \nperiod. Right now it is a little bit in flux, but we know there are \nthings we have to complete.\n  This, of course, is the last vote for today. We will start tomorrow \nmorning. Hopefully, we will have some votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5742-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5742-S5743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STRATEGIC ECONOMIC DIALOG WITH CHINA\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, today the administration is concluding \nits much-heralded fourth session of the strategic economic dialog with \nofficials from the Chinese Government. Obviously, there have been three \nof these previous to this, when Secretary Paulson, Secretary of the \nTreasury, the brain of the Bush administration's economic policy, a \nvery successful Wall Street banker who came to Washington amid all \nkinds of plaudits from at least Wall Street and many of the newspaper \npublishers and editors who side with Wall Street on most issues--\nSecretary Paulson is an honorable, decent man. He went to China again \nto engage in these strategic economic dialogs.\n  The big announcement today from these strategic economic dialogs, \nSEDs, is an agreement to begin negotiations for a bilateral investment \ntreaty. That is all he has agreed to do with the Chinese, is to talk \nabout how we can help American investors in China get a fair shake from \nthe Chinese Government. Of all the pressing issues we are currently \nfacing in our bilateral relationship with China, Secretary Paulson \nchose to emphasize issues, frankly, that only stand to benefit the \nlargest investors, the largest mutual funds, the largest hedge funds, \nthe people on Wall Street who have benefitted the most from this global \neconomy, the largest corporations that are outsourcing jobs to China. \nThat is who benefits from these four strategic economic dialogs.\n  The focus on improving the Chinese stock market and increasing \nopportunities for foreign investors in China only stands to benefit \nmajor U.S. investors and large American companies that are considering \nmoving offshore to China.\n  Secretary Paulson should have focused on issues that hurt American \nworkers, the impact of the undervalued Chinese currency--part of the \nwork of the junior Senator from Michigan in the Finance Committee--and \nSecretary Paulson should have been working to fix the lack of effective \nintellectual property rights enforcement in China, should have worked \nto correct the soaring bilateral trade deficit of $57 billion--$57 \nbillion just for the first quarter of this year, up 20 percent over \nlast year and on pace to set another record high, $57 billion. That \nmeans--doing the math quickly--$600 million or $700 million. Every \nsingle day, we buy $600 million or $700 million of imports from China \nmore than we sell to China--every single day. You do not think that is \na big reason plants close in Tiffin and Fostoria and Zanesville and \nCleveland, and in Lansing, Kalamazoo, and Detroit, MI?\n\n  Instead, Secretary Paulson is looking out for investors rather than \nworkers, rather than communities--communities such as Mansfield and \nPortsmouth and Chillicothe. When a plant closes, firefighters are laid \noff, police officers are laid off, teachers are laid off. Quality of \nlife diminishes every time we lose these jobs to China.\n  I would hope Secretary Paulson would consider the needs of the vast \nmajority of Americans who would be better served by a different set of \npriorities, a different trade relation with China, not trying to fix \nthe Chinese stock market and help U.S. investors and large corporations \nin the United States that are only looking for more offshoring \nopportunities. Yet, as the administration concludes its fourth \nStrategic Economic Dialogue, it has become clear that the SED has been \nan exercise in talking with no action.\n  Since the first SED in December 2006--he has done a couple of these \nevery year--the U.S. trade deficit with China has grown $25 billion per \nyear. We have lost 581,000 manufacturing jobs. There have been at least \n457--think about this--457 ``Made in China'' recalls by the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission. That is not counting what happened with \nheparin, the contaminated ingredients that went into a drug that killed \nseveral people in Toledo, OH. It is not even counting that. That is 457 \n``Made in China'' products recalled by the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission.\n  New Government reports, from various agencies, have given us new \ninformation that poses challenges to our relationship with China. The \nEPA--get this--it does not affect my part of the country quite as \nmuch--estimates that 25 percent of California's air pollution comes \ndirectly from China.\n  The State Department, meanwhile, released its annual ``Trafficking in \nPersons Report,'' which found significant problems with forced labor, \nincluding forced child labor, in the People's Republic of China. This \nis the fourth year in a row that China was put on a ``watch list'' of \ncountries that could face sanctions if they do not improve their record \non trafficking in persons. So where does it talk about this in the \nStrategic Economic Dialogue? Secretary Paulson wants to help American \ninvestors, wants to help U.S. companies that are going to go offshore, \nwants to help strengthen and repair the Chinese stock market. There is \nnothing about consumer product safety recalls, nothing about currency \ndevaluation costing us jobs, nothing about trafficking in people and \nwhat that means to children and what that means to families.\n  In December 2006, when the Bush administration announced the \nStrategic Economic Dialogue with China, nearly 2 years ago, Treasury \nSecretary Paulson said the SED would focus on five specific areas. \nThese were his own promises. These are not my opinions. These are not \nmy advice or my counsel or my suggestions. These are what Secretary \nPaulson said he would focus on:\n  No. 1, the first was ``Managing financial and macroeconomic cycles.''\n  China utilizes numerous questionable subsidies to artificially boost \nproduction, including $27 billion in energy subsidies since 2000 for \nsteel producers. Think about how uncompetitive that is and what it does \nto our steel industry and what it does to global warming because they \ndo not have the same environmental rules and regulations on their steel \nindustry as we rightly--rightly--have on our steel industry. Chinese \nsteel production has increased more than 50 percent in the last 4 \nyears. Steel exports to the United States are 129 percent higher than \nthey were 3 years ago. That is more than twice as much steel imports \nfrom China to the United States.\n  The second was ``Developing human capital.''\n  As I just mentioned, China's human rights abuses are notorious, as \nare their woefully inadequate labor conditions in many factories--not \nto mention child labor and all they do that way.\n  Third--one of Secretary Paulson's focuses of his five specific \nareas--``the benefits of trade and open markets.''\n\n[[Page S5743]]\n\n  Beijing continues to undervalue its currency--as the Presiding \nOfficer has said in the Finance Committee--by as much as 40 percent. \nYet just last week, China's Ambassador to the World Trade Organization \nchastised the United States--chastised us, with whom they have a $200 \nbillion-plus trade surplus on their end--a deficit on ours--chastised \nthe United States for the dollar's depreciation. In some ways, it is \nhard to argue with that, that our economic policies have caused this \nweaker dollar because of the Bush administration's wrong actions in \nsome cases and inaction in others.\n  USTR has called China's counterfeit and piracy problems rampant, yet \nhas done little to ensure compliance for American companies.\n  The fourth promise Secretary Paulson made in December 2006 about its \nfocus on the Strategic Economic Dialogue was--his term--``Enhancing \ninvestment.''\n  This is one area the administration perhaps is addressing with the \nBilateral Investment Treaty. I will give him one out of the first four.\n  Fifth, and finally, Secretary Paulson said, ``Advancing joint \nopportunities for cooperation in energy and the environment.''\n  This Congress is weighing the merits of different climate change \nproposals, but one thing is certain: This Congress will pass \nlegislation curbing carbon emissions. We need to do it in a way that \nensures we do not just rely on Chinese imports that arrive in the \nUnited States without a carbon cost.\n  So, in other words, on four of the five, Secretary Paulson fell far \nshort or simply did not even address it. Think what happens with our \npassing climate change if the Chinese do not pass any climate change \nand the Chinese do not strengthen their regulations on carbon emissions \nand other pollutants.\n  That means our factories--which have difficulty competing because of \nthe cost of labor and all of that--our factories will have even more \ndifficulty competing in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and California \nand in all of the country because we will strengthen our environmental \nrules, as we should, we will reduce carbon emissions, as we should. The \nChinese will benefit from that because they do not absorb the cost, \nthey do not bear the cost of these kinds of environmental rules and \nregulations. So they get even more of a competitive advantage. What \nhappens if a plant shuts down in Youngstown or shuts down in \nSteubenville or shuts down in Dayton and moves to China? Plants that \nwere following decent emission standards move to China, and their \ncarbon emissions are hardly regulated. So it means lost jobs for us. It \nmeans more pollution, more carbon emissions for the world from the \nPeople's Republic of China. It is another example of Secretary Paulson \nsimply not addressing the issues that matter to our families, to our \ncommunities, to our workers, and to our country.\n  It is clear the Strategic Economic Dialogue has been lots of talk and \nno action. It is time for actions from the administration that benefit \nAmerican workers, benefit American manufacturers, benefit American \nbusinesses, and protect consumers. It is time for a new direction in \nour trade policy with the People's Republic of China.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I come to the floor this evening to \nspeak a few minutes about the issue of oil shale and gas prices.\n  Earlier today, the President of the United States, George W. Bush, \nspoke to the Nation at a press conference in which he said there were \nsome things we could do immediately to try to address the energy crisis \nwe are facing in America. One of the things he said could be done \nimmediately was to begin the development of oil shale in the West, \nspecifically the oil shale which now exists and is found in my State of \nColorado. With all due respect to the President of the United States, \nhe is wrong. There is nothing about the oil locked up in these shales, \nin these rocks of western Colorado that will bring about the kind of \nrelief we somehow hope to be able to bring about to the consumers of \noil in our country.\n  The fact is, we are a long ways from knowing whether oil shale can be \na part of the portfolio of fulfilling the energy needs of the United \nStates of America. To be frank about this, oil shale has been looked at \nas a possible source for oil for now nearly 100 years. There have been \nmany booms and many busts with respect to oil shale development in the \nWest and in my State of Colorado. I feel particular ownership of this \nissue because of the fact that 80 percent of the oil shale reserves we \nknow of in the United States of America are located in my State.\n  Oftentimes, what will happen is people will make a comparison to the \ntar sands of Alberta in Canada, and they will say: You have the same \nkinds of possibilities within the State of Colorado. Nothing is further \nfrom the truth. The tar sands, the oil sands in Canada, essentially, \nare developed simply by putting water and mixing it with the sands, \nwith the temperature being 200 to 300 degrees, and the oil is then \nseparated from the sands. That is because of the way the hydrocarbons \nexist in those sands. They could be easily separated from those sands. \nToday, millions of barrels are flowing into the United States from that \ndevelopment in Alberta, led by companies such as Suncor.\n  In contrast, what we are talking about in my State of Colorado, \nacross the great and most beautiful part of our Nation, the Western \nSlope of Colorado, is oil that is locked in shale. Notwithstanding the \nbillions of dollars that have been spent on research, no one has yet \nfound the key to unlock the oil from that shale. So to say somehow \ngiving away hundreds of thousands of acres of land for this, where this \noil shale is contained, and allowing that land to be leased for oil \nshale development and saying that is a panacea for the gas price \nproblem we are facing today is simply wrong. It is not true. It is not \ndoable.\n  In 2005, I worked very closely with my Republican chairman, whom I \ncall a great friend. The two Senators from the land of enchantment, \nSenator Domenici and Senator Bingaman, have now changed places. One is \nchairman and one is ranking member. But in 2005, Senator Domenici was \nthe chairman of the Senate Energy Committee. We worked very closely to \ncome up in our committee with legislation on oil shale development that \nallowed us to move forward to examine the possibility of oil shale as \none of the items in our portfolio for our energy future. We came up \nwith an approach that said we would go ahead and provide research and \ndevelopment leases to oil companies so they could go out and do the \nkind of research and development that is needed to take place in order \nto determine whether oil shale can be developed. So there are now some \nleases that have been issued for research and development in the State \nof Colorado. For each of those companies that has been given these 160 \nacres of leased land for research and development, they also are given \na right under the law to get an additional 5,000 acres of land they can \nlease. So that is over 25,000 acres that can be developed into oil \nshale if, in fact, we can discover the technology that will let us do \nthat.\n\n  But let us not fool the world. Let's not fool the world in the way \nthe world has been fooled since the 1920s about the possibility of oil \nshale. Let's not let oil shale be allowed to be used as a political \ntool, as the President and others try to address the gas crisis our \ncountry is in. The fact of the matter is we are a long way from being \nable to say oil shale can be developed in a commercial way for the \nUnited States of America, and the approach we developed out of our \nSenate Energy Committee and passed out of this Chamber in the 2005 \nEnergy Policy Act is the\n\n[[Page S5744]]\n\nright way to go. It embraces a thoughtful and constructive way forward \nto determining whether we can, in fact, develop the oil that is \ncurrently locked up in the rock.\n  I am not the only one who is saying these things. Chevron, one of the \nmajor oil companies of the world, in its own statement to the \nprogrammatic environmental impact statement comments submitted to the \nBLM, said the following:\n\n       Chevron believes that a full scale commercial leasing \n     program should not proceed at this time without clear \n     demonstration of commercial technologies.\n\n  That is an oil company that obviously has the capacity and the \nexpertise to know the reality of oil shale and is, frankly, being \ncandid and honest and straightforward with the American people about \nthe possibility of oil shale.\n  Next, I would also point to the statements we have heard from the \nDepartment of the Interior. A few months ago, we had a hearing in front \nof the Energy Committee where the Assistant Secretary of the Interior, \nAssistant Secretary Allred, appeared before the committee. I asked the \nAssistant Secretary a number of questions. I will quote, again, as I \ndid last week, what I asked and what his answers were.\n  I asked Assistant Secretary Allred the following:\n\n       When I look at your chart on oil shale development on \n     public lands, you have at some point on that chart this \n     little brown dot that says ``project completion: phase 3--\n     commercial.'' When do you think that will happen? What year?\n\n  The Assistant Secretary Allred responds:\n\n       Senator, it is hard to predict that because . . .\n\n  And then there was silence. So I then asked:\n\n       2011?\n\n  He responded:\n\n       Oh, no, I think, I think . . .\n\n  Silence.\n  I asked again:\n\n       2016?\n\n  He says in response to that:\n\n       Probably in the latter half.\n\n  I say:\n\n       2015 and beyond? 2015 and beyond.\n\n  So I continued to question him along these lines.\n  The bottom line is that even within the Department of the Interior, \nat the highest levels, they are saying that if we ever get to \ncommercial production of oil shale, it is probably out until 2015. That \nis 7 years from now. Don't tell me that is going to have any effect \ntoday on gas prices, and yet, it is one of the cornerstones of what the \nPresident of the United States proposed to be the solution to the \nenergy crisis we face in America today.\n  I beg to differ with the President of the United States, and I will \nnot let the President of the United States or the Department of the \nInterior run roughshod over the State of Colorado. Not today, not next \nmonth, not next year, not in 10 years. It is not going to happen. We \ncan develop oil shale in the State of Colorado, but if we are going to \ndo it, we are going to do it in a thoughtful and deliberate way.\n  I am proud of the fact that the leading newspapers of the western \npart of Colorado, including the Denver Post and the papers in Utah, \nhave essentially said the same thing. These papers have lived with the \nhistory of the booms and the busts, including the big bust of the \n1980s, with respect to oil shale. The Denver Post in its editorial \nsays:\n\n       Developing oil shale has been a dream since the early 20th \n     century, but careful planning is needed to make sure the \n     dream doesn't turn into a nightmare.\n\n  It goes on to say some other things that are very supportive of a \nthoughtful and deliberative approach that I have tried to bring to oil \nshale development.\n  The Grand Junction Sentinel, which essentially is the newspaper that \ncovers all the Western Slope of Colorado, some 20 counties, a paper \nwhose editorial board knows good economics can come from thoughtful \ndevelopment of our natural resources but also a newspaper that has \nstood tall in terms of making sure we are protecting the long-term \nsustainability of the Western Slope. Here is what the Grand Junction \nSentinel says in its editorial page. The Grand Junction Sentinel \nprobably knows as much about water and public lands and natural \nresources as much as any other newspaper around the West. They know it \nbecause they live it. They know because they know that across the \nwestern part of Colorado, most of the land is owned by the Federal \nGovernment. The Federal Government owns 33 percent of the State of \nColorado and most of that is located on the Western Slope.\n\n  Here is what the Grand Junction Sentinel, a conservative editorial \nboard, had to say about this oil shale development. It says:\n\n       The notion that the one-year moratorium on commercial \n     leasing approved by Congress last year is somehow a barrier \n     to commercial development is nonsense. If anything, that \n     moratorium should be extended.\n\n  It continues. The editorial was titled: ``Congress is Pushing Another \nShale Sham.''\n  Continuing, it says:\n\n       Whatever technology is used to recover oil from shale, the \n     impacts will include massive surface disturbance, huge \n     demands for additional electric generation, and reservoirs \n     full of Colorado's limited water, not to mention the hordes \n     of additional workers who will descend on this area.\n\n  The Grand Junction Sentinel says in its editorial, joining the Denver \nPost, that as we move forward to look at oil shale as a possible energy \nsource for our country, then we need to be thoughtful in terms of how \nwe move forward.\n  The Salt Lake Tribune. There are some--a much smaller percentage of \nthe shale we are talking about is actually located in Utah, but the \nSalt Lake Tribune essentially has said the same thing. It says:\n\n       The development of oil shale deposits in eastern Utah, \n     Wyoming, and Colorado would be an expensive undertaking, \n     risky for the environment, and a drain on dwindling water \n     resources, with no quick return in additional oil supplies to \n     reduce America's dependence on foreign oil.\n\n  `` . . . with no quick return in additional oil supplies to reduce \nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil.''\n  So when the President of the United States stands and he says to the \nAmerican people that here is the answer to your high cost of gas and \ndiesel and jet fuel today, and he says we are going to go to oil shale, \nthere is a misrepresentation on what the contribution is going to be \nfrom oil shale development and a misstatement and a misapprehension, \nfrankly, of what the facts and reality are with respect to oil shale \ndevelopment in the Western Slope of Colorado.\n  I wish to focus on a couple of those issues in a little more specific \nway. One of the realities we all know in the West--those of us who \nshare the water of the Colorado River Basin--is that we live in a place \nthat has a very limited water supply. The Colorado River supplies water \nto seven States: Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, and \nCalifornia. For 100 years, we have figured out a way of living together \nand sharing the supplies of water within the river. It is said today \nthat there are some 500,000 to 1 million acre feet of water that can \nstill be developed and then used within my State of Colorado under the \ncompacts that govern the sharing of water on the Colorado River. Those \ncompacts are very important. There is also a truth about oil shale and \nhow it will use the water that is allocated to Colorado under those \ncompacts.\n  But we don't know how much water is going to be required for oil \nshale development. We don't know whether it is 500,000 or 1 million or \n2 million acre feet, and we don't know what the consequences, \ntherefore, would be on agriculture within Colorado or on the \nmunicipalities that so depend on that water. So it is no surprise that \nmost of the water entities involved in protecting Colorado's water \ncompacts have come out against a head-long rush into oil shale \ndevelopment because they are concerned about what will happen with \nrespect to the water supplies of the Colorado River if, in fact, we \nmove forward at the full-scale commercial oil shale leasing program in \na premature way.\n  So it would be my hope that as we look at the possibilities for \ndealing with the current energy prices, that we try to focus on real \nsolutions. The real solutions, first and foremost, are for us to look \nlong term and to avoid the failed policies of the past 30 years under, \nfrankly, both Republican and Democratic administrations that have\n\n[[Page S5745]]\n\ngotten us to the point today where we are so overdependent on foreign \noil that not only our national policy but our economic reality is being \ndriven by that massive overdependence. So embracing the new world of \nenergy, where we are looking at greater efficiencies, where we are \nlooking at alternative fuels, where we are looking at advanced \ntechnologies such as those of the hybrid plug-in vehicle, and where we \nare looking at the development of our conventional resources in a \nthoughtful, honest, and balanced way is a way forward. It has to be the \nkind of energy policy we can sustain, not over a week or a political \nseason or even the term of one President, but over a longer period of \ntime. It is the kind of challenge for America that should summon the \nkind of political courage among all those who are involved in this \ndebate, in the same way we were able to take on the Manhattan Project \nand build the atomic bomb in less than 4 years, where we were able to \nmove forward and put a man on the Moon in less than 10 years from the \ntime President Kennedy announced that vision and that goal for America. \nThat is important, and that is long term.\n  It is also important that we do what we can in the short term to \naddress this issue. We have had conversations about speculation of the \nmarkets and how speculation might be accounting for somewhere between \n25 and 40 percent of the high price of oil we see today. We need to \nlook into that question and see whether we can bring the rapid \nspeculation under control. Those are undertakings we can take on and \ntake on in the very near term.\n  In addition, I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle say what we need to do is to open up all the lands in ANWR and \nother lands within the interior and offshore in order for us to be able \nto bring in additional supply into our energy stream for America. There \nis a possibility for us to open additional lands. There are lands, for \nexample, within the gulf coast of Mexico, which we opened in the 2006 \nEnergy bill, where we added some 8 million acres of additional land in \nthe gulf that we said is now open for exploration. We have done a lot \nto try, in my view, to bring in additional supply in terms of our \nenergy pipelines.\n  But we should not kid ourselves because we know today there are more \nthan 60 million acres of public lands, both onshore and offshore, which \nhave already been leased to the oil companies--60 million acres, far \nsurpassing the acreage of ANWR, far surpassing any of the acreages \nbeing talked about now even on the gulf coast of Mexico that might be \nopened. So what is happening with all these public lands, resources of \nthe United States of America under which lie significant reserves of \noil? I would say there are huge opportunities there for oil and gas \ncompanies to go out and to develop the resources that are underneath \nthose lands.\n  I conclude by saying, first, let us be honest about oil shale and its \npossibilities. Let's not oversell to the American public that this is \nsomehow a panacea for America's energy needs.\n  Secondly, let's look long term, knowing there is going to be some \npain but that we need to look long term at a new energy policy for the \nUnited States of America. As a parenthetical, I would say that is why \nthese energy tax incentives we have been working on are so important \nfor us to try and harness the energy of the Sun, the energy of the \nwind, the energy of biofuels, the energy of cellulosic and ethanol as \nwe move forward on that frontier.\n  Thirdly, as we look at short-term solutions to help, in some way, \nalleviate the pain all Americans are feeling today with respect to high \ngas prices, that we be realistic with respect to the solutions to that \nparticular challenge we face.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues an op-ed piece by Bob Herbert that appeared in The New \nYork Times on Saturday, June 14.\n  The editorial, entitled ``Letters From Vermont,'' uses excerpts from \npowerful letters that Vermonters sent to my colleague and friend, \nSenator Bernie Sanders. In inviting these personal testimonials from \nVermonters, Senator Sanders has illuminated the debate--and, I hope, \nhastened action--on the struggles that millions of American families \nare facing in our current economy. Mr. Herbert's column has brought \nthese letters to the attention of many, many more Americans.\n  So that all Members may review this illustrative and telling column, \nI ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 14, 2008]\n\n                          Letters From Vermont\n\n                            (By Bob Herbert)\n\n       Despite the focus on the housing crisis, gasoline prices \n     and the economy in general, the press has not done a good job \n     capturing the intense economic anxiety--and even dread, in \n     some cases--that has gripped tens of millions of working \n     Americans, including many who consider themselves solidly \n     middle class.\n       Working families are not just changing their travel plans \n     and tightening up on purchases at the mall. There is real \n     fear and a great deal of suffering out there.\n        A man who described himself as a conscientious worker who \n     has always pinched his pennies wrote the following to Senator \n     Bernie Sanders of Vermont:\n       ``This winter, after keeping the heat just high enough to \n     keep my pipes from bursting (the bedrooms are not heated and \n     never got above 30 degrees) I began selling off my \n     woodworking tools, snowblower, (pennies on the dollar) and \n     furniture that had been handed down in my family from the \n     early 1800s, just to keep the heat on.\n       ``Today I am sad, broken, and very discouraged. I am \n     thankful that the winter cold is behind us for a while, but \n     now gas prices are rising yet again. I just can't keep up.''\n       The people we have heard the least from in this epic \n     campaign season have been the voters--ordinary Americans. We \n     get plenty of polling data and alleged trends, but we don't \n     hear the voices of real people.\n       Senator Sanders asked his constituents to write to him \n     about their experiences in a difficult economy. He was blown \n     away by both the volume of responses and ``the depth of the \n     pain'' of many of those who wrote.\n       A 55-year-old man who said his economic condition was \n     ``very scary,'' wrote: ``I don't live from paycheck to \n     paycheck. I live day to day.'' He has no savings, he said. \n     His gas tank is never more than a quarter full, and he can't \n     afford to buy the ``food items'' he would like.\n       His sense of his own mortality was evident in every \n     sentence, and he wondered how long he could continue. ``I am \n     concerned as gas prices climb daily,'' he said. ``I am just \n     tired. The harder that I work, the harder it gets. I work 12 \n     to 14 hours daily, and it just doesn't help.''\n       A working mother with two young children wrote: ``Some \n     nights we eat cereal and toast for dinner because that's all \n     I have.''\n       Another woman said she and her husband, both 65, ``only eat \n     two meals a day to conserve.''\n       A woman who has been trying to sell her house for two years \n     and described herself as ``stretched to the breaking point,'' \n     told the senator, ``I don't go to church many Sundays because \n     the gasoline is too expensive to drive there.''\n       Many of the letters touched on the extremely harsh winter \n     that pounded Vermont and exacerbated the economic distress. \n     With fuel prices skyhigh, many residents turned to wood to \n     heat their homes. A woman with a 9-year-old son wrote: ``By \n     February, we ran out of wood and I burned my mother's dining \n     room furniture. . . . I'd like to order one of your flags and \n     hang it upside down at the Capitol building. . . . We are \n     certainly a country in distress.''\n       Senator Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the \n     Democrats, remarked on the disconnect between the harsh \n     economic reality facing so many Americans and the Pollyanna \n     claims of the Bush administration and others over the past \n     several years.\n       The assertion that the economy was strong and getting \n     stronger, repeated with the frequency of a mantra, hid the \n     reality that working Americans have been taking a real \n     beating, said Senator Sanders.\n       He pointed out that over the past seven or eight years, \n     millions of Americans have lost health insurance coverage, \n     lost pensions, and become deeply mired in debt. During that \n     period, the median annual household income\n\n[[Page S5746]]\n\n     for working-age Americans fell by about $2,400.\n       ``Americans work the longest hours of any people in the \n     industrialized world,'' the senator said. ``We even surpassed \n     Japan.''\n       But despite all that hard work--despite explosive \n     improvements in technology and increased worker \n     productivity--the middle class is struggling, losing ground \n     and there's a very real possibility that the next generation \n     of workers will have a lower standard of living than today's.\n       The letters to Senator Sanders offer a glimpse into the \n     real lives of ordinary people in an economic environment that \n     was sculpted to favor the very rich. One of the letters was \n     from a woman in central Vermont who said she and her husband \n     are in their mid-30s, are college-educated and have two young \n     children.\n       ``We are feeling distraught,'' she said, ``that we may \n     never `get ahead' but will always be pedaling to just keep \n     up.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5746-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5746-S5747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, a day or so ago, I asked Idahoans to \nshare with me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and \nthey responded by the hundreds. The stories, now numbering close to \n800, are heartbreaking and touching. It is not just filling the tank; \nthese high energy prices touch every aspect of our lives--family time, \nfood prices, work commutes, the list goes on and on. Many Idahoans have \ntaken efforts to cut back on the niceties to accommodate the \nnecessities, but now far too many face the choice of which necessity to \nignore--gas or food, job or family. For years, Congress has \nunsuccessfully grappled with a national energy policy; now we are at a \npoint where decisions must be made, compromises must be negotiated if \nwe are to finally be forward-thinking. This isn't only a question of \nwhat we are handing future generations; it's affecting families right \nhere, right now. It is not just Idahoans. It is an issue that touches \nthe live of every single American, no matter their socioeconomic \nstatus.\n  In an effort to seek solutions rather than focus only on the trouble, \nI have also asked Idahoans to share how they want Congress to resolve \nit, and the suggestions are voluminous and wide-ranging. Some start \nsimply with conservation efforts, something that I have long supported, \nwhile others encourage increased offshore oil drilling and increased \ndomestic production, more sustainable alternative and renewable energy \nsources, stronger support for nuclear energy options and more efficient \ntransportation options. Nearly all have expressed concerns for not just \ntheir future, but for the future of their children and grandchildren. \nAnd they are adamant about Congress moving beyond half-truths and \npartisan politics to find solutions. While I may differ in my opinions \non some suggestions, I am thrilled that so many have taken time to \nshare their thoughts with me. Some have shared research, videos and \nbook recommendations. To respect that effort, I plan on submitting \nevery e-mail sent to me through energy prices@crapo.senate.gov to the \nCongressional Record. And to keep attention on this matter, I will be \nsubmitting them a few at a time every day until every one has been \nsubmitted. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention. I plan to continue \nworking to find other ways to bring these stories to the attention of \nmy colleagues in Congress. Today, I am starting this process with the \nfollowing comments from Idahoans.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record comments from \nIdahoans.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo, I am very interested in the debate \n     concerning rude oil and energy prices. I am a wheat farmer by \n     profession and have been excited about the increased wheat \n     prices, however, all of the input costs have significantly \n     increased due to the fact that all inputs have either direct \n     or indirect links to the price of crude oil. Freight costs \n     have significantly increased across the board. Manufacturing \n     costs for steel have soared, partly due to the energy costs. \n     Pivot prices have increased by 20% this year and are expected \n     to significantly increase next year also. Fertilizer prices, \n     which were already unrealistically high last year have \n     tripled from last year's prices. Although the price of wheat \n     will likely be more than commensurate with the input costs \n     this year, if commodity prices fall before the decline of \n     input prices, (including and especially energy prices) \n     farmers throughout the country will be in serious trouble.\n       In addition to the difficulties associated with farm input \n     prices, my family's household income has not increased in \n     proportion to the costs of household goods such as food, \n     clothing, and family items. The relief check from the \n     government will not come close to compensating for increased \n     pricing, and will also decrease the value of the dollar and \n     hence cause more inflated pricing, as well as increase our \n     national debt.\n       Most Americans would agree that caring for our environment \n     is important, however, a relatively small group of radical \n     environmentalists have been using their screaming lobby to \n     set policies which are extremely detrimental to the economy \n     as well as the environment. How is it that oil drilled from \n     the Middle East and freighted across the ocean is less \n     harmful to ``mother earth'' than drilling in a single square \n     mile in Alaska? I am adamantly opposed to the idea that we \n     should be dependant upon the Middle East for oil when we have \n     enough to last for at least one hundred years in reserve here \n     in the United States. We are likely to have alternative \n     technology to decrease our demand upon oil and most likely \n     oil will be obsolete as an energy source within less than 50 \n     years. Please listen to the less vocal majority who are \n     pleading for drastically decreasing the restrictions and \n     regulations on drilling and refining our domestic oil.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lloyd Ward.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Mike Crapo, We live on Robie Creek out side of Boise. \n     My husband commutes to Nampa 2 days a week to work. We are \n     also Ushers for Boise State University and have to commute to \n     Boise for work. With the increase in Gas Price, our fuel \n     costs have risen 148.00 in the past three months. It was \n     already way to expensive. We are in our 70's so this is a \n     hardship for us.\n       John McCain stating he will not drill in Alaska makes me so \n     mad. I live next door to a lady who spent years in Barrow and \n     the North Slope of Alaska. She said drilling would not hurt \n     anything because there is nothing there. I have suggested Mr. \n     McCain make a trip and check this out personally instead of \n     listening to the environmentalist who has put us in this \n     position in the first place along with the Socialist who want \n     this country destroyed. I also think it is a shame to listen \n     to the Stupid people who are costing us Billions to prevent \n     global warming. The last I knew, God was in-charge and has \n     been thru thousands of years of climate change. Who is going \n     to pay back the tax payers when this is proven to be a \n     political sham?\n       It would be so refreshing if we the people could ever get \n     the truth about anything and have all of the agenda bleeped \n     out.\n     Bess, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: We have noticed a big difference in \n     prices in the past year. Instead of taking two vehicles to \n     work five days a week, my husband and I have traveled \n     together this past year to save on the gas. We leave our home \n     in Firth, (our work hours are different), and he drops me off \n     at work and travels to the other side of Idaho Falls to get \n     to his job. I stay at work during the lunch hour and an extra \n     hour after work until he comes to pick me up at night.\n       It used to cost us $320.00 a month one year ago taking two \n     vehicles to work. Now with one vehicle we are spending a \n     minimum of $340.00 just to get to work.\n       We also have the added concern of my husband's elderly \n     parents. They will need our help more and we try to go see \n     them once a month. We are spending $100.00 per trip to get \n     from Firth to Wendell and back.\n       1. Why isn't anyone concerned about the high oil \n     consumption of container ships that bring goods from other \n     countries?\n       2. Why are we allowing China and other countries to drill \n     off of our shores when we can't drill off Florida?\n       3. What about all the wells that were drilled and capped in \n     the Western Wyoming area and other areas of the U.S.?\n       4. Why are we not pushing harder for nuclear energy and \n     other options and also expanding refinery capacity that could \n     free us from dependence on other nations? They have us under \n     their thumbs.\n       5. Why are the minority environmentalists controlling so \n     much of our lives? We believe they are not being realistic \n     and subjecting us to other nations' whims. Global warming, it \n     snowed here last week, second week of June. Where is the \n     global warming? There is more global warming controlled by \n     the sun and not man. The earth has always had ups and downs \n     in its weather patterns. Why doesn't anybody ask an \n     environmentalist what they live in, what they wear and how \n     they get to their protests? It seems they are protesting \n     everything they use.\n       Thank you for work you are doing and asking for our \n     opinions.\n     Michael and Susan, Firth.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo, thank your for giving me the \n     opportunity to write to you on this issue and also for your \n     efforts on our behalf.\n       I have a PhD in Aerospace Engineering and more than thirty \n     years experience.\n       I can only address the engineering aspects of this \n     question, not the political aspects, though I am afraid that \n     the problem is largely a political and psychological one, not \n     a technical one.\n       The technological facts are these: We can have energy \n     independence and a 75% reduction in air pollution at the same \n     time and it\n\n[[Page S5747]]\n\n     wouldn't cost the taxpayers a dime. In order to achieve this \n     we would have to convert our power generation from fossil \n     fuel to nuclear and hydroelectric, and switch to electric \n     cars, trucks and trains. The technology for this exists now, \n     although some of it is still in the laboratory. What is \n     preventing its implementation is government regulation.\n       After World War II, the utilities put forward a plan to \n     convert all of this country's power generation to nuclear and \n     hydroelectric. The plan was eminently feasible, but was \n     blocked by government regulation. During the 1970s, congress \n     passed what was popularly know as the ``small hydro bill''.\n       This excellent piece of legislation sought to encourage \n     cities and towns to take advantage of their local rivers and \n     streams to generate power. This would have given local \n     communities a reliable source of clean, low cost power, and \n     reduced the need for long distance transmission lines and \n     dependence on the grid. Implementation of this plan was \n     blocked by the environmentalists.\n       Solar energy and wind power are not practical alternatives.\n       Nuclear power is safe. In more than fifty years of \n     generating power in this country, not a single person has \n     ever been killed or injured by a nuclear accident. So far as \n     I am aware, not a single person has ever been killed or \n     injured by a nuclear power plant with its reactor in a \n     containment building. The accident at Chernobyl was possible \n     only because the reactors there were not housed in a \n     containement building.\n       Nuclear power is inexpensive. What is making nuclear power \n     plants expensive is excessive and irrational government \n     regulation, based not on sound science and engineering, but \n     on a desire to appease the environmentalists. This was true \n     as far back as 1967. The effect of this government regulation \n     is not to make nuclear power plants safer, but to make them \n     impossible.\n       Government regulation, especially NHTSA, is preventing \n     entrepreneurs from making electric cars. There is not a \n     single company manufacturing electric cars in this country \n     for sale to the public. That is a disgrace. The FMVSS \n     (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards) are nonsensical \n     gibberish. NHTSA needs to be abolished and the politicians \n     and the bureaucrats need to stop interfering in car design.\n       In summary, the whole huge body of excessive, irrational \n     government regulation which has piled up over that last 60 \n     years needs to be repealed.\n       Government is the problem. The solution is for government \n     to get out of the way.\n           Most respectfully yours,\n     Stefan, PhD (aerospace engineering).\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo, I couldn't possibly disagree w/you more with \n     respect to the current energy situation. I think that the \n     high prices for gas/diesel that we're experiencing are a \n     necessary evil. It is time for this entire country, but our \n     politicians in Washington (yes, this means you!) especially, \n     to wake up & realize that the amount of petroleum on this \n     planet based is finite. The current problem with prices \n     should not be dealt w/by some half-assed politically \n     motivated Band-Aid.\n       The United States has a chance to be at the forefront of \n     research into whatever technology will ultimately replace \n     petroleum-based energy. Rather than subsidizing ethanol \n     production from corn (absolutely no advantage in terms of use \n     of petroleum--it's merely at a different phase of \n     production), why not step up to the plate & provide \n     incentives for research into alternative energy. Instead of \n     the U.S. depending on foreign oil, why not make the rest of \n     the world dependent on U.S. company patents for whatever \n     ultimately replaces petroleum as the leading energy \n     technology?\n           Thanks for listening,\n     Todd, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Mike, We appreciate this opportunity to share with you \n     how energy prices are affecting us and hope this will help \n     you convince your colleagues that something needs to be done \n     NOW!!\n       We are farmers in southern Idaho. We are helping to keep \n     this country fed. It is 40 miles to our nearest town where we \n     shop for all our needs--from groceries to supplies to run the \n     farm. Our fuel is delivered from 40 miles away as well. We \n     have no public transportation to rely on so we have no choice \n     but to keep driving our vehicles to supply our needs and to \n     try to conserve where we can. Just today, we had to drive 90 \n     miles one way to obtain a repair part for our hay harvesting \n     equipment. That trip cost us nearly twice what it would have \n     cost this time last year. Diesel for our tractors is nearly \n     $5.00/gallon. If Congress doesn't act now, this country is \n     going to wake up to food shortages because we won't be able \n     to afford to keep filling our fuel tanks to keep the food \n     pipeline full. Trucks won't be able to afford to keep \n     transporting food to the stores and one day in the not too \n     distant future, the store shelves will be empty. What will \n     Congress do then about the riots and other violence that will \n     result? We want our energy companies to drill for oil NOW, \n     both on and off shore! We want our energy companies to drill \n     in ANWR, NOW!!! We want our energy companies to be able to \n     utilize Coal-to-Oil technologies NOW!!! We want to be free of \n     our dependence on the Middle East for our energy needs. If \n     nuclear energy can be utilized safely, let's use it.\n       Let's use wind turbines. Let's utilize solar farms on our \n     vast acreages of public lands here in Idaho. We must act \n     before our economy is destroyed. It will take decades to \n     repair the damage if Congress doesn't act NOW!!!!!\n       Feel free to share our story.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kirt and Janet, Malta.\n                                  ____\n\n       You've got this one about right.\n       Our problems as usual are the result of allowing political \n     expediency to make bad policy.\n       We can no longer afford to genuflect at the green altar. By \n     all means let's streamline the approval process for new \n     nuclear plants and begin drilling ASAP in ANWR and off both \n     coasts. THE STATES DO NOT HAVE SOVEREIGNTY OVER THEIR COASTAL \n     WATERS. If the federal government can tie up half of Idaho, \n     it should also be able to approve drilling off the coasts of \n     FL, CA et al.\n       In your letter, you skip over another aggravating factor \n     inflicted on our economy by Congress. I refer of course to \n     the ethanol mandate. The primaries are over. Iowa has once \n     again been shamelessly pandered to. Repeal the ethanol \n     mandate, eliminate tariffs on imported (Brazilian sugar \n     based) ethanol. Watch fuel and food cost drop simultaneously. \n     This should be a no brainer even for Congress.\n     Stu, Donnelly.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo: I first want to thank you for even being \n     considerate enough to ask my opinion. Not asking constituents \n     is a major problem with our politics these days but that \n     issue is for another email.\n       My family is fortunate enough that the rising energy costs \n     are, at this point, a frustrating inconvenience and not a \n     major issue as it is with many. What is of concern to me is \n     our country's willingness to be held hostage by others in the \n     world. We have vast reserves of our own fossil fuel that we \n     refuse to develop in addition to our refusal to develop \n     nuclear energy, wind and solar sources. As I understand it, \n     we do not want to ``damage'' the environment. I don't want to \n     ``damage'' our environment either but GOD has blessed this \n     country with resources and the technology for developing \n     those resources has changed for the better in the last 50 \n     years.\n       I am also tired of the rhetoric that `in Europe energy \n     costs have been much higher than here for decades'. Well, the \n     plain truth is I don't live in Europe. The USA has been, \n     until outsourcing became our corporate goal, the most \n     advanced, the most productive, the most ingenious, the most \n     prosperous, the most giving nation in ALL of history. \n     Besides, why don't I hear the cost comparison with Venezuela? \n     Gasoline there is $0.25 per gallon.

Madam President, I rise today to congratulate a college \nbaseball team that won a national title last month.\n  I am speaking of Mount Olive College in Mount Olive, NC. They beat \nOuachita Baptist in a 6-2 victory to win the NCAA Division II National \nBaseball Championship--the first national championship title of any \nkind in Mount Olive College history.\n  The Mount Olive Trojans finished the season with a 58-6 overall \nrecord. The Trojans ended their season strong winning 24 out of their \nfinal 26 games.\n  This win marks an especially extraordinary one for Mount Olive \nCollege Trojans. This is the Trojans first-ever national championship \nwin in any sport. In a town made famous for their\n\n[[Page S5748]]\n\npickles, baseball can now be added as a point of interest.\n  Led by head coach Carl Lancaster, the Trojans were up by a five-run \nlead at the end of the first inning. Thanks in part to Josh Harrison's \nat-bat that resulted in a single and Dylan Holton's three-run double, \nMount Olive mounted an early 5-0 advantage over Ouachita Baptist.\n  Mount Olive College was featured on national television in the May \nedition of ``NCAA On Campus.'' This gave the players a chance to brag a \nlittle about their accomplishments, as all nine players in the Trojans' \nstarting lineup were nationally ranked in at least one statistical \ncategory at the time of taping.\n  The Trojans' efforts have not gone unnoticed by Major League \nBaseball. Five of the players from Mount Olive's 2008 National \nChampionship team will all be playing professionally in the coming \nyear. Additionally, four players have been named All American. This is \nwonderful news for these deserving young men.\n  Also due recognition is the Trojans' academic performance. Their \nemphasis on academic success earned them a team grade point average of \n3.13 on a 4 point scale.\n  The baseball team's success can be attributed to their well-rounded \n2008 roster that included: Jackson Massey, Jesse Lancaster, Anthony \nHernandez, Anthony Williams, Weston Curles, Todd Jeffreys, David \nCooper, Mike Kicia, Paul Novicki, Tyler Smith, Pat Ball, Alex Vertcnik, \nDylan Holton, Rich Racobaldo, Joseph Westbrook, Andy Hilliard, Kyle \nJones, Jason Sherrer, Josh Harrison, Casey Hodges, Erik Lovett, Michael \nWilliams, Ryan Schlecht, Craig Beasley, Thomas Newsome, and Airlon \nVinson. The team was coached by: Carl Lancaster, Aaron Akin, and Rob \nWatt.\n  Again, I commend the Mount Olive Trojans, the 2008 NCAA Division II \nBaseball National Championship team and coach Carl Lancaster on an \nincredible season. Also, I would like to wish those players drafted \ninto the Major Leagues the best of luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5748-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    RECOGNIZING MAURICE A.

COLLINGS\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I pay tribute to an \nexceptional officer in the U.S. Air Force, MG Michael A. Collings upon \nhis retirement after more than 33 years of distinguished service. \nThroughout his career, General Collings has personified the Air Force \ncore values of integrity, selfless service, and excellence in the many \nmissions the Air Force provides in defense of our nation. It is my \nprivilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for \nthe superb service he has provided the Air Force and our Nation.\n  General Collings entered the U.S. Air Force as a graduate of Southern \nIllinois University's Reserve Officer Training Corps program in 1974. \nHis career has spanned a variety of operational assignments and major \ncommand staff functions. A command pilot with more than 2600 hours in \nthe T-37, T-38 and F-16, General Collings spent more than 10 years in \nthe cockpit, instructing in the T-37, F-16 and at the U.S. Air Force \nFighter Weapons School. Moving to the logistics field in 1987, General \nCollings has served on the staff at Headquarters, U.S. Air Force, \nWashington DC, Headquarters Pacific Air Forces, Hickam Air Force Base, \nHI, and Headquarters Air Combat Command, Langley Air Force Base, VA. He \nhas commanded two squadrons, two groups, and two wings including the \n82nd Training Wing at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas and the Warner \nRobins Air Logistics Center, Air Force Materiel Command, Robins Air \nForce Base, GA.\n  His assignments have increased in scope and responsibility, \nculminating in his current assignment as Chief, Office of Military \nCooperation, Egypt. As the Senior U.S. Defense Representative to Egypt, \nGeneral Collings leads six divisions responsible for all aspects of the \nsecurity assistance mission in Egypt. In addition to providing advice \nand assistance to the Government of Egypt on a wide range of military \nprocurement and training issues, the Office of Military Cooperation \nserves as a liaison between the Egyptian Ministry of Defense and United \nStates Central Command, coordinating the planning of joint military \nexercises throughout the region.\n  During his career, General Collings has served the U.S. Air Force and \nour Nation with excellence, distinction, and unwavering integrity. His \nexceptional leadership skills have been evident throughout his career \nas he repeatedly demonstrated superb command and operational \nleadership, a brilliant and innovative vision for his unit's future, \nand an unmatched loyalty to his faith, people and country.\n  General Collings will retire from the U.S. Air Force on August 1, \n2008 after 33 years and 1 month of dedicated commissioned service. On \nbehalf of Congress, the country, and the State of Georgia, I thank \nGeneral Collings, his wife Jan, and their entire family for the \ncommitment and sacrifices they have made throughout his honorable \nservice.

Madam President, today I wish to commemorate the \n100th anniversary of the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps.\n  As a proud supporter of the Navy Nurse Corps, both the officers and \nthe many enlisted and civilian personnel who work alongside them, I am \npleased that we are recognizing their contributions to our navy and our \ngreat nation.\n  On May 13, 1908, President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Naval \nAppropriations bill that authorized the establishment of the Nurse \nCorps as a unique staff corps of the Navy. A small group of trained \nnurses were carefully chosen to establish an ``orderly, disciplined \ncorps with a respectable reputation and excellent benefits, if somewhat \nlimited pay.'' Leaving societal norms behind, the Sacred Twenty, led by \nMs. Esther\n\n[[Page S5749]]\n\nVoorhees Hasson, introduced safe hygiene practices in the care of \npatients and trained enlisted medical personnel.\n  By 1918, the Nurse Corps grew to over 1,030. During World War I, Navy \nnurses served on ships and deployed to Europe to serve at base \nhospitals in France, Scotland and Ireland. Superintendent Lenah \nSutcliffe Higbee was recognized with the Navy Cross for her success in \ndeveloping an innovative training camp which quickly prepared nurses to \nmeet the growing war requirement. Many years later, Superintendent \nHibgee would receive a most auspicious honor when she became the first \nliving woman and only Navy nurse to have a ship named after her. The \ndestroyer, USS Higbee was commissioned in 1944.\n  World War II became the defining moment in the lives of an entire \ngeneration of Americans. Amidst the startling images of the horrors \nassociated with war, came heroic accounts of the tenacity and faith \ndemonstrated by American servicemen and women on a daily basis. On \nbattlefronts from North Africa to Italy to Normandy to Corregidor and \nBataan, the nurses of World War II contributed greatly to the care of \nthe wounded, the morale of the fighting men, and the development of \nnursing as a profession. It was during this war, that 11 Navy Nurses \nwere taken prisoner by the Imperial Japanese in the Philippines. \nSpending thirty seven months in an internment camp where starvation and \npsychological warfare were commonplace, these nurses continued to care \nfor patients without regard to self.\n  Throughout the war, Navy nurses served at 40 naval hospitals, 176 \ndispensaries, on board 12 hospital ships and as flight nurses on air \nevacuation missions. Admiral Halsey said of Navy nurses: ``They \nmagnificently upheld the highest traditions of U.S. Naval Service.'' \nNavy nurses earned over 300 military awards for their exceptional duty \nduring the war.\n  From the humble beginnings of the pioneering ``Sacred Twenty'' to \ntoday's Nurse Corps force of 4,100 strong, Navy nurses continue to \nanswer the call of duty whether it is at the bedside of a patient in a \nstateside military hospital, in a joint humanitarian mission aboard a \nhospital ship transiting the Pacific or in the throes of conflict in \nIraq.\n  Today we recognize the men and women of the Navy Nurse Corps for \ntheir selfless service and dedication to our nation and our military. I \ncommend the Navy Nurse Corps for its commitment to excellence and for a \ncentury of leadership and caring for America's Navy and Marine Corps \nfrom 1908 to 2008.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5749-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING DR.

Brown, Ph.D., as he retires from a \nlong and successful career as a leader in education. This month, Dr. \nBrown will retire as assistant superintendent of instructional services \nwith Rialto Unified School District in southern California, and can \nlook back on a proud career of service and distinction in education and \ncommunity leadership.\n  Dr. Brown will retire after almost four decades of leadership in \nRialto Unified School District. Dr. Brown's service in education began \nin 1971 when he began as a teacher in Rialto teaching fifth and sixth \ngrade. In 1976 Dr. Brown was awarded his Ph.D. in education from the \nUniversity of California, Riverside. Dr. Brown would then serve the \ndistrict as a program specialist, as a principal, as director of \ncurriculum, and as assistant superintendent.\n  Numerous schools under his leadership have received California \nDistinguished Schools Awards, and all elementary schools in the \ndistrict have seen increased API scores. Middle schools and high \nschools have similarly seen growth in their AVID programs both in \nstudent participation and success.\n  Dr. Brown has also worked tirelessly in his community. He served in \nthe California National Guard from 1969 through 1975, and has served in \nvarious community organizations such as Kiwanis International, Phi \nDelta Kappa International, the Boy Scouts of America, and as an active \nmember in his church congregation.\n  As he retires from almost four decades in education, I am pleased to \nask my colleagues to join me in recognizing his many \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5749-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE RETIREMENT OF DAN MAYER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Spending the past 47 years in Sturgis, SD, Dan has \nhelped guide peers and new generations alike toward success in the \nbeautiful Black Hills.\n  Dan began his career and community service in Sturgis in 1959. After \nbeing elected to the Sturgis city council in 1968, he served for 22 \nyears, presiding as president for several terms. In 1973, Dan was part \nof the group that started the Sturgis Industrial Economic Expansion \nCorporation, which developed the first Sturgis Industrial Park.\n  I remember when Dan and other city leaders met with me to discuss \nexpanding their industrial park, intent on making Sturgis an attractive \nand effective place to start a business. I was pleased to work with the \ngroup to obtain funds for the expansion, which eventually attracted gun \nand ammunition manufacturers to the industrial park.\n  With nearly five decades of personal and professional ties to the \nSturgis area, Dan is still an active force in the community. He \ncurrently serves on the Heritage Acres Board, the Sturgis Industrial \nBoard, the Sturgis Hospital Advisory Board, and the Sturgis Water \nBoard. One Sturgis resident is quoted as having said, ``Our business \nwouldn't be here without this man. He believed in our community and, at \nthe most vital of times, he believed in us.''\n  Dan will be retiring on June 19, 2008 and intends to stay in the \nSturgis area, retaining his positions on the local boards. I want to \ncommend Dan for his longstanding and steadfast commitment to the \nbetterment of his community. Being in the banking business for so many \nyears, Dan has been a major influence in the lives of Sturgis area \nresidents. He has seen countless families through home and ranch \npurchases, home improvements and business start-ups and expansions. \nAlong with his wife Donna, children Jamie and Mark, and nine \ngrandchildren, Dan has strived to fulfill his commitment of making \nSturgis and the surrounding area a greater place to live, work, and \nraise a family. I am most deeply grateful for the opportunity to thank \nDan for his efforts, and eagerly look forward to his continued \ninvolvement in the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5749-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5749-S5750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE VERMONT ALL STARS\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, today, I recognize the Vermont \nAll Stars, the Vermont math team that won first place in Division B of \nthe American Mathematics League's Regional Competition, held this year \nat Pennsylvania State University. The team was comprised of 15 Vermont \nstudents, ranging from grades 8 through 12, and seven alternates. The \ncountrywide event, of which this was a part, is the Nation's highest \nprecollegiate math competition.\n  In the individual competition, two Vermonters placed in the top 10. \nBoth students achieved perfect scores, which qualified them to advance \nto a final round, which ultimately determined the ranking of the 10 \nstudents who received perfect scores. Following up perfection with an \neven tougher competition, Colin Sandon placed fifth overall, and David \nRolnick placed tenth. Both Colin and David are high school seniors who \nwill attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the fall.\n  Deserving of special mention--and special honor--is Mr. Anthony \nTrono, both founder and coach of the team. Tony Trono is a retired math \nteacher who had a long career teaching mathematics at Burlington High \nSchool.\n  Many years ago he began a program entitled the Vermont Talent Search, \nin which a math test is distributed to middle school and high school \nstudents. This was to be the first step in bringing Vermont students to \nthe American Math League competition. The top achievers on the Vermont \nTalent Search tests are chosen for the team that competes in the \nAmerican Mathematics League's competition.\n  Not content with working on this, and desiring to share his love of \nmathematics with students all over our\n\n[[Page S5750]]\n\nState, Tony Trono also runs a week-long summer math camp at the \nUniversity of Vermont.\n  Because family reasons precluded him from accompanying the team this \nyear, as he has done so often before, Barbara Unger chaperoned the team \nto Penn State. Like Tony a retired math teacher, from Middlebury Union \nHigh School, she said of Tony Trono, ``He has given his life to upper \nlevel math.'' How true that is!\n  Our Nation has excelled in the areas of math, engineering and science \nin large measure because of dedicated teachers such as Tony Trono--and \nBarbara Unger. They serve as role models to future generations of \nteachers, in addition to so ably training generation after generation \nof capable--and as the recent success of the Vermont All Stars \nindicates--superior mathematicians. Our State and our Nation owe a deep \ndebt of gratitude to Tony Trono and to the many thousands of dedicated \nmath teachers who follow along similar paths by sharing their love of \nmathematics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5750-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF ARTESIAN, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, today I recognize the community \nof Artesian, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its founding. \nArtesian is a rural community infused with hospitality, beauty, and an \nexceptional quality of life.\n  The city of Artesian was founded in 1883 and named after the \nabundance of flowing wells, known as artesian wells, in its part of \nSouth Dakota. As over a third of its citizens are of German decent, the \nArtesian community of Sanborn County still appreciates and exemplifies \nits rich heritage.\n  Today, Artesian has come a long way from its days as a railroad \nsupply center. The town now boasts a variety of businesses, including \nthose in both the service and manufacturing sectors. A community \ncenter, multiple churches, a post office, veterinarian, and 4-H club \ncontinuously bring the community closer.\n  The people of Artesian celebrate this momentous occasion on the \nweekend of July 4-6, 2008 with a street dance, fireworks, and a parade. \nSouth Dakota's small communities are the bedrock of our economy and \nvital to the future of our State. It is especially because of our small \ncommunities, and the feelings of loyalty and familiarity that they \nengender, that I am proud to call South Dakota home. Towns like \nArtesian and its citizens are no different and truly know what it means \nto be South Dakotan. One hundred twenty-five years after its founding, \nArtesian remains a vital community and a great asset to the wonderful \nstate of South Dakota.

Madam President, as this Saturday marks the \nofficial beginning of summer, I rise to recognize a small nonprofit \nfrom my home State of Maine that has championed the activities that \nhave made the State a long-time destination for seasonal travel and \nexploration. Since 2005, the Greenland Point Center, Inc., on Long Lake \nin Princeton, has served to educate both youth and adults on issues of \nconservation and leadership while promoting outdoor activities and \nlearning.\n  Originally founded in 1978, the Greenland Point Center previously \noperated under the auspices of the University of Maine at Machias. \nFacing closure in 2004, community members and conservation groups from \naround the state rallied behind it, purchasing the land that housed the \ncamp from the University and revitalizing the program.\n  Today the Greenland Point Center, which has become a perennial \nfavorite for Mainers and their families, hosts a series of camps \ndesigned to allow children and families to explore the natural world \nand grow as individuals. At the same time, the center works to empower \ncampers by teaching them many of the vital safety skills that are \nimperative to the successful enjoyment of this Nation's natural \nresources. The center's exciting camp programs range from the more \ntraditional Wet 'N' Wild Camp, where campers learn to canoe and sail, \nto the Downeast Teen Leadership Camp, where middle-school students from \nMaine's Washington County have an opportunity to learn the skills \nnecessary to help them lead healthy lifestyles as they progress through \nthe often challenging adolescent years. Thousands of young men and \nwomen who have attended the Greenland Point Center's camps have come to \nappreciate the solemn responsibilities of environmental stewardship \nwhile being encouraged to enjoy the boundless energies of youth.\n  The firm has a deep commitment to making the opportunities that it \noffers available to all youth, regardless of their financial situation. \nTo promote that goal, the Greenland Point Center works tirelessly to \nprovide scholarships for financially disadvantaged individuals who wish \nto experience the natural wonders of the State of Maine. Of particular \nnote, each year's Maine Moose Permit Auction raises scholarship money \nfor the Center, affording numerous youngsters from across the State the \nchance to take part in discovering Maine's beautiful surroundings.\n  Additionally, the Greenland Point Center is an active participant in \nthe nationwide ``Hooked on Fishing--Not On Drugs'' program. Founded by \nthe Future Fisherman Foundation and funded through the Maine Department \nof Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, ``Hooked on Fishing--Not On Drugs'' \nseeks to keep Maine's youth off drugs by teaching angling skills, \nconservation efforts, and social skills, preserving proud traditions \nwhile promoting a healthy way of life.\n  The State of Maine has long been a proud bastion of outdoor adventure \nand protecting the environment. The Greenland Point Center has served \nto help maintain the appreciation of nature and all of its wonder. \nCoupled with lessons in healthy physical, mental, and emotional \nlifestyles, the Greenland Point Center has served the youth of Maine \nand the Nation while shaping a new generation of leaders and \nentrepreneurs. I congratulate the Greenland Point Center on its past \nachievements and wish everyone involved success as the Center continues \nto nurture America's youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5750-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING DR.

His teaching methods were \ngroundbreaking as they focused on the empirical ends of Government \nrather than their theoretical origins. In particular, Dr. Renwick \nfocused on the way in which political theory works in practice, how it \nactually affects the daily decisions of elected officials and political \ncandidates.\n  In addition to his service as director, he also served as a respected \nmember of the political science faculty, which he will continue to \nserve following his retirement. As both an administrator and an \neducator, Dr. Renwick was well known for his insights that jumpstarted \nthe political careers of many Louisianans. In choosing his fellows, he \ntargeted individuals from diverse political, economic and social \ngroups, in order to force bipartisan efforts to work through complex \nissues important to Louisiana. Thus, he taught them the importance of \nfinding common ground rather than letting them crumble under their \ndifferences.\n  I was fortunate enough to be a fellow under Renwick, and I can \nconfidently say that I am still benefitting from the knowledge and \nexperience I gained during the program. Dr. Renwick's innovative \nmethods helped reveal the idiosyncrasies of Louisiana politics to his \nstudents.\n  Thus, today, I am proud to honor a fellow Louisianan, Dr. Ed Renwick, \nfor his distinguished service to the Loyola University community and \nthe State of Louisiana.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5751-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5751]]\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5751-2", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Finance.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5751-3", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \nIN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13159 OF JUNE 21, 2000, WITH RESPECT TO THE RISK OF \n  NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION CREATED BY THE ACCUMULATION OF WEAPONS-USABLE \n   FISSILE MATERIAL IN THE TERRITORY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION--PM 53\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the \nFederal Register for publication the enclosed notice stating that the \nemergency declared in Executive Order 13159 of June 21, 2000, with \nrespect to the risk of nuclear proliferation created by the \naccumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in \nthe territory of the Russian Federation is to continue beyond June 21, \n2008.\n  It remains a major national security goal of the United States to \nensure that fissile material removed from Russian nuclear weapons \npursuant to various arms control and disarmament agreements is \ndedicated to peaceful uses, subject to transparency measures, and \nprotected from diversion to activities of proliferation concern. The \naccumulation of a large volume of weapons-usable fissile material in \nthe territory of the Russian Federation continues to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of \nthe United States. For this reason, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency declared with respect to \nthe risk of nuclear proliferation created by the accumulation of a \nlarge volume of weapons-usable fissile material in the territory of the \nRussian Federation and maintain in force these emergency authorities to \nrespond to this threat.\n                                                      George W.

Res. 577\n\n       Whereas each day, as Americans contend with rising gasoline \n     prices, personal stories reflect the ways in which--\n       (1) family budgets are suffering; and\n       (2) the cost of gasoline is impacting the way Americans \n     cope with that serious problem in family and work \n     environments;\n       Whereas, as a consequence of economic pressures, Americans \n     are finding ways to reduce consumption of gasoline, such as--\n       (1) driving less frequently;\n       (2) altering daily routines; and\n       (3) even changing family vacation plans;\n       Whereas those conservation efforts bring hardships but save \n     funds that can be redirected to meet essential family needs;\n       Whereas, just as individuals are reducing energy \n     consumption, the Federal Government, including Congress, \n     should take steps to conserve energy;\n       Whereas a Government-wide initiative to conserve energy \n     would send a signal to Americans that the Federal \n     Government--\n       (1) recognizes the burdens imposed by unprecedented energy \n     costs; and\n       (2) will participate in activities to reduce energy \n     consumption; and\n       Whereas an overall reduction of gasoline consumption by the \n     Federal Government by even a few percentage points would send \n     a strong signal that, as a nation, the United States is \n     joining to conserve energy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should require all Federal departments and agencies \n     to take initiatives to reduce daily consumption of gasoline \n     and other fuels by the departments and agencies.\n\n  That is the end of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks a letter that I wrote to the President a few \ndays earlier, on May 16, addressing this very issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a short step. But I do wish to refer to the \nfuture.\n  As noted earlier, the President has made his announcement this \nmorning. But I would like to welcome him to this decisionmaking now to \ngo to offshore drilling. With due respect to the Presiding Officer, we \nhave different views expressed here a few moments ago. I want to go \nback over the history of this Senator, working with many others, on \nthis issue of drilling offshore.\n  First, during the debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005, H.R. 6, I \nattempted to offer an amendment that sought to allow States to opt out \nof the Federal moratorium on offshore drilling. I was joined by \nSenators Alexander and Voinovich in that effort. Unfortunately, due to \nopposition to my proposal and the threat that my amendment would or \ncould doom the whole bill, I withdrew the amendment, out of recognition \nof the hard work done by the managers.\n  But at that time, I warned my colleagues, and I said, standing at \nthis very seat: I regret to predict this, but I see nothing but danger \nsigns with regard to worldwide energy consumption and the predicament \nfacing the United States of America.\n  That was over 2\\1/2\\ years ago that I so stated my concerns and also \nindicated that I wanted to support the move toward offshore drilling. \nSo I regret that prediction of some years ago is now coming true.\n  Later, in 2005, I came to the floor for a second time in an attempt \nto push forward legislation that would allow States to opt out of the \nFederal moratorium. This legislation, known as the Outer Continental \nShelf Revenue Sharing Act of 2005, S. 1810, was introduced 6 weeks \nafter the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina.\n  I remind my colleagues that at the time, it was shockingly clear how \nvulnerable and how fragile our Nation's energy infrastructure, \nespecially our oil and gas infrastructure, was to such a terrible \ndisaster. Every American felt the effects of this terrible hurricane at \nthe gas pump.\n  Again, however, no action was taken on my bill. But I did not give \nup. Less than 6 months later I came to the floor again, this time with \nmy colleagues, Senators Allen, Talent, and Santorum, all three no \nlonger Members of our Senate, and also Senator Mark Pryor, who very \nmuch is a Member of our Senate today, to address this issue.\n  We introduced the Reliable and Affordable Natural Gas Energy Reform \nAct of 2006, S. 2290. The bill sought to amend the Outer Continental \nShelf Lands Act to allow coastal States to share in qualified OCS \nrevenues should they choose, as States, to allow the exploration for \nnatural gas only.\n  S. 2290 would have allowed a State to lift the moratorium and share \nin OCS revenues should their Governor successfully petition to allow \ndrilling for natural gas off their coasts.\n  Again, no action was taken on this bill.\n  Finally, I came to the Senate floor last June, a year ago this month, \nwhen gas prices were almost $1 lower than they are today, to offer, \nonce again, an amendment on this subject. Specifically, my amendment \nwould have allowed the Commonwealth of Virginia to explore for natural \ngas off its shores, a step already approved by the Governor of Virginia \nand our State legislature. If a natural gas reserve was found, the \nGovernor, with the support of the State legislature, could have \npetitioned the Secretary of Interior to allow for the extraction of \nnatural gas off the shores of Virginia. Furthermore, my amendment gave \na voice in the process to the Secretary of Defense and to Virginia's \nneighboring States. I even set up a fund that would have provided money \nfor environmental damage mitigation. Again, due to the opposition from \nsome of my fellow Senators, my amendment was unsuccessful, failing 43-\n44, and today we continue to suffer from soaring energy prices. But I \nwill never give up; never, never, never will I give up.\n  It is my firm belief that America must take a balanced approach \ntoward its energy policy. That is why, for the Memorial Day recess, I \njoined the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in \nsubmitting and adopting the sense-of-the-Senate resolution I just read.\n  And that is why today I send to the desk and file a bill in keeping \nwith\n\n[[Page S5756]]\n\nthose who want to do offshore drilling. It is virtually identical to \nones I have been submitting for nearly 3 years.\n  Mr. President, I am very privileged to be joined in this effort to \nhave offshore drilling off the State of Virginia by my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Webb, who wishes to be a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the senior Senator's \namendment last year when he offered it. I would like to join him as a \ncosponsor today on the legislation he has just introduced which is a \nmodification of the amendment that was introduced last year.\n  I know there are justifiable concerns about the issue of offshore \ndrilling. I know the Chair has spoken eloquently about those concerns \non many occasions. Also, I would like to say that the senior Senator \nfrom Virginia has been one of the great voices in favor of moving \ncautiously with respect to issues concerning our environment. He was \none of the principal cosponsors on the climate change bill we just \nrecently debated. He has proceeded carefully with respect to this \nlegislation. There are appropriate safeguards in the legislation.\n  I express my strong concern that we as a body must proceed carefully \nforward over the next year or so to renew our efforts to address the \nissue of global warming and climate change on the one hand and a \nsensible policy that allows us to bring forward all of the aspects of \nenergy production and technology that will allow us to take advantage \nof the assets our country has. A part of that would be a renewal in the \nproper form of nuclear power production, such as we have seen in \ncountries such as France and Japan. Part of it would be a sensible \npolicy with respect to coal production, the assets of which are so vast \nin this country. We can move forward in that area with the right sort \nof technology in place, but also in the areas the senior Senator is \naddressing in his legislation today. He is proposing to move forward \ncarefully with respect to offshore drilling. There are safeguards with \nrespect to State involvement that are a good counterbalance to concerns \npeople would have. He has built in a reserve to mitigate potential \nenvironmental damages, if they were to occur. Most importantly, he is \nrealistic at looking at where we have to move as a country. We need \naffirmative leadership. We can't simply step away and not address \nsolutions with respect to different energy alternatives.\n  This legislation allows for revenue flow that we need to address \nother issues such as rebuilding our infrastructure. Part of this \nrevenue flow would go to the Federal Government; part of it also would \ngo to the State government.\n  As the Senator and I are so well aware, because of a lot of different \nissues, we are having difficulty in the State of Virginia addressing \ninfrastructure issues, transportation issues, the types of things we \nmust get on top of if we are going to remain the preeminent Nation in \nthe world in terms of being able to compete in a global economy. This \nprocess, once approved--actually, a two-step procedure by State \ngovernment--would allow for income flow through royalties into the \nState government so that we can address these issues, one of which is \nso glaring in Virginia right now: our inability to see transportation \nprojects funded at a time when the population of Virginia has so \ndramatically increased. In my view, the senior Senator has put forward \nlegislation that is responsible. He is a friend of the environment. He \nis careful in terms of the different aspects of government involvement. \nI am pleased to support it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. We have, in a very short time \ntogether, although we have known each other many years, formed a strong \nworking partnership, not only on behalf of Virginia but on behalf of \nthis great Nation in many ways. I thank him for joining me today. I \nknow he looks to the future. I also look to the future but only 6 more \nmonths or a little less in the Senate. I will pass the baton to him. \nBut each day that passes, he grows in strength of voice and stature in \nthe Senate. I wish him well.\n  Mr. WEBB. I thank the Senator.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2008.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Each day, as America contends with \n     rising gasoline prices, we see and hear stories of how \n     individual Americans are coping with this serious problem as \n     they conduct their daily lives with their families and in \n     their work environments.\n       They are finding ways to reduce their consumption of \n     gasoline by driving less, altering daily routines, and even \n     changing family vacation plans. These efforts bring \n     hardships, but save dollars that are necessary to meet \n     essential family needs. And while small in comparison to the \n     overall problem of supply and demand of gasoline, these \n     efforts do add up. I never dismiss the American ``can do'' \n     spirit.\n       In one word, it is individual conservation. And in cases \n     such as this, when individuals are leading the way, the \n     government should join.\n       The purpose of this letter is to urge you to lead the vast \n     federal government to likewise take initiatives to cut back--\n     even in a small measure--its daily consumption of gasoline \n     and other fuels.\n       I believe such a move would signal to Americans that their \n     government is sharing the daily hardships occasioned by this \n     turbulent, uncertain energy crisis.\n       Having worked in and with the Department of Defense for \n     many decades, and recognizing that this government department \n     is the largest user of petroleum products, I believe that the \n     men and women of the armed services would pitch in to share \n     the hardships on the home front and lead the effort. Their \n     families are experiencing many of the same hardships as other \n     families across America.\n       Recognizing that our nation must maintain its defense \n     posture, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan, where our forces \n     are courageously carrying out their missions, the \n     department's initiative to further conserve on fuels must be \n     done without any harmful diminution in readiness or training.\n       By cutting back the number of flying or steaming hours in \n     our military ships and planes, by even a percentage point or \n     two, the armed forces could point with pride to their efforts \n     in our nation's conservation movement.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Warner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 3148. A bill to modify the boundary of the Oregon Caves National \nMonument, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, there is a celebration today of the 40th \nanniversary of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. I want to acknowledge \nthat important occasion by announcing two bills I am proposing today \nthat will expand protection for some of Oregon's most special places \nand will lock in their preservation for generations to come.\n  The first bill is the Oregon Caves National Monument Boundary \nAdjustment Act, which will secure protection for a stunning piece of \nOregon that includes natural treasures both above and below the ground \nat the Oregon Caves. The Oregon Caves has a unique geologic history and \nis particularly known as the longest marble cave open to the public \nwest of the Continental Divide. With the bill I am introducing today, \nwe will be creating the first subterranean wild and scenic river, a \nperennial stream at the monument known as the River Styx. This river is \nan underground portion of Cave Creek that flows through part of the \ncave and is one of the dynamic natural forces at work in the national \nmonument.\n  The National Park Service has formally proposed a boundary \nmodification for the Oregon Caves National Monument many times. They \ndid it first in 1939. They did it again in 1949 and most recently in \n2000. Today, I am happy to propose legislation to enact that boundary \nadjustment into law. I was born in 1949. It seems to me that after this \neffort has gone on literally for decades, it is time to secure this \nprotection for generations to come. I want to make sure the new Wyden \ntwins, William Peter and Ava Rose, are going to enjoy it with millions \nof Oregonians. That is why it is important that this action be taken \nand taken quickly.\n  Expanding this boundary will allow us to further protect the stunning \nmajesty of both the underground and the above-ground treasures found at \nthis national monument.\n  Established by a Presidential proclamation in 1909, the Oregon Caves \nNational Monument is a 480-acre natural wonder located in the \nbotanically-rich Siskiyou Mountains. It was originally set aside \nbecause of its unusual scientific interest and importance. Oregon Caves \nhas a unique geologic history\n\n[[Page S5757]]\n\nand is particularly known as the longest marble cave open to the public \nwest of the Continental Divide.\n  A perennial stream, the ``River Styx''--an underground portion of \nCave Creek--flows through part of the cave and is one of the dynamic \nnatural forces at work in the national monument. The cave ecosystem \nprovides habitat for numerous plants and animals, including some state-\nsensitive species such as Townsend's big-eared bats and several cave-\nadapted species of arthropods, insects, spiders, etc., found only in \nthe Oregon Caves and nowhere else. The caves possess a significant \ncollection of Pleistocene-aged fossils, including jaguar and grizzly \nbear. Grizzly bones that were found in the cave in 1995 were estimated \nto be at least 50,000 years old, the oldest known from either North or \nSouth America.\n  Today, I am proposing legislation that will enhance the protection of \nthe resources associated with Oregon Caves National Monument and \nincrease public recreation opportunities by adding surrounding lands to \nthe monument. My bill would expand the monument boundary by 4,084 acres \nto include the entire Cave Creek Watershed, management of which would \nbe transferred from the United States Forest Service to the National \nPark Service. In addition, my legislation would designate at least 9.6 \nmiles of rivers and tributaries as wild, scenic, or recreational, under \nthe federal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, including the first \nsubterranean wild and scenic river, the River Styx. This bill would \nalso provide authorization for retirement of existing grazing \nallotments.\n  When the Oregon Caves National Monument was established in 1909, the \nfocus was on the unique subsurface resources, and the small rectangular \nboundary was thought to be adequate to protect the cave. Through the \nyears, however, scientific research and technology have provided new \ninformation about the cave's ecology, and the impacts from the surface \nenvironment and the related hydrological processes. The current 480-\nacre boundary is insufficient to adequately protect this cave system. \nThe National Park Service has formally proposed a boundary modification \nnumerous times, first in 1939, again in 1949, and most recently in \n2000. Today, I am happy to propose legislation to enact that boundary \nadjustment into law.\n  The Oregon Caves National Monument makes a unique contribution to \nSouthern Oregon's economy and to the national heritage. The monument \nreceives over 80,000 visitors annually, and is the second smallest unit \nof the National Park System. A larger monument boundary will help \nshowcase more fully the recreational opportunities on the above-ground \nlands within the proposed monument boundary. In addition to the \nnumerous subsurface resources, the monument's above-ground lands in the \nSiskiyou Mountains possess a beauty and diversity that is unique in \nAmerica, and indeed the world. The extensive biological diversity stems \nfrom the unique geology of the region and the range of temperatures, \nfire regimes, and climates found in the area that create a region rich \nin endemic plants, fish-bearing streams, and the most varied conifer \nforest on the planet. The Oregon Caves National Monument's \napproximately 500 plants, 5,000 animals, 2,000 fungi, and over a \nmillion bacteria per acre that make the spot have one of the highest \nconcentrations of biological diversity anywhere.\n  Expanding the monument's boundary will also preserve the caves' \nresources by protecting the water that enters the cave. Water quality \nhas been a major concern and the activities on the adjacent lands can \naffect the water quality and the caves' precious resources. By granting \nthe National Park Service the ability to safeguard these resources, and \nby providing for a voluntary donation of grazing permits, my \nlegislation will be able to better protect these resources. The current \ngrazing permitee, Phil Krouse's family, has had the Big Grayback \nGrazing Allotment, 19,703 acres, since 1937. Over the decades, the \nnumber of allowed livestock has diminished, but the livestock still has \nan impact on the drinking water supply and the water quality of this \nnatural gem. Mr. Krouse has publicly stated that he would look \nfavorably upon retirement with private compensation for his allotment, \nsuch as my legislation will allow to proceed.\n  I want to express my thanks to all the volunteers and supporters in \nthe local business and conservation community in Southern Oregon, to \nPhil Krouse for his commitment to Oregon's natural resources, and to \nCraig Ackerman, the former Superintendent of the Oregon Caves National \nMonument. My colleagues in the House of Representatives, \nRepresentatives DeFazio, Hooley, Blumenauer and Wu will be introducing \ncompanion legislation in the House today and I look forward to working \nwith them to advance this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                                S. 3148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 3149. A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to add \ncertain segments to the Rogue River designation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the second piece of legislation I introduce \ntoday is the Lower Rogue Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The Rogue River is \na much beloved piece of Oregon's beautiful landscape. This bill will \nprotect the waters that feed it.\n  Protecting the wild and scenic tributaries to the Rogue River is a \ncritical step in protecting the backbone of one of Oregon's most \nimportant sport and commercial fisheries. In 2008, the American Rivers \nOrganization named the Rogue and its tributaries as the second most \nendangered river in our country. I am hoping to change that today by \nintroducing this legislation which would protect 143 miles of wild and \nscenic tributaries that feed the Rogue River with cold, clean water.\n  The Rogue River is one of our Nation's premier recreation \ndestinations, famous for its free flowing waters which provide numerous \nrafting and fishing opportunities. The headwaters of this great river \nstart in one of Oregon's other great gems--Crater Lake National Park--\nand ultimately empty into the Pacific Ocean near Gold Beach on the \nSouthwest Oregon coast. Along that stretch, the Rogue River flows \nthrough one of the most spectacular canyons and diverse natural areas \nin the United States. The Rogue River is home to runs of coho, spring \nand fall chinook, winter and summer steelhead--and it has the special \ndistinction of being one of only several rivers in the country with \nruns of green sturgeon.\n  The Rogue River received its first protections in the original Wild \nand Scenic Rivers Act, in 1968. A narrow stretch of land was protected \nalong the river banks. Since that time, a great deal has been learned \nabout the importance of protecting the tributaries that feed into the \nmain stem of the Rogue. Protecting the wild and scenic tributaries to \nthe Rogue River is a critical step in protecting the backbone of one of \nOregon's most important sport and commercial fisheries.\n  In 2008, American Rivers named the Rogue and its tributaries as the \nsecond most endangered river in the U.S. I'm hoping to change that \ntoday by introducing legislation to protect this river and its \ntributaries. My proposal would protect 143 miles of wild and scenic \ntributaries that feed the Rogue River with cold clean water. The \nprotected tributaries would include Galice Creek, Little Windy Creek, \nJenny Creek, Long Gulch--and 36 other tributaries of the Rogue.\n  By protecting the tributaries that feed this mighty river, I will \nseek to protect the Rogue River for future generations so they can \nenjoy the Rogue River as we do today. My colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, Representatives DeFazio, Hooley, Blumenauer and Wu \nwill be introducing companion legislation in the House today. I want to \nexpress my thanks to the conservation and business communities of \nSouthern Oregon, who have worked diligently to protect these waters and \nenable the outdoor recreationists to use and enjoy these rivers. I look \nforward to working with my House colleagues and the bill's other \nsupporters to advance our legislation to the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3149\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

                                \n      By Mr. BROWN (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 3151. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to priority review vouchers; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to engage my distinguished \ncolleague from Ohio in a colloquy.\n  Mr. BROWN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK: I want to express my support for our provision \nincluded in the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, \nFDAAA, signed into law this Congress, to award an FDA priority review \nvoucher to encourage the development of treatments for tropical \ndiseases. According to the World Health Organization, roughly one \nbillion people, or nearly one of every six people worldwide, are \naffected by at least one tropical disease. However, less than 1% of the \nroughly 1,400 drugs registered between 1975 and 1999 treated such \ndiseases. These diseases are often referred to as the ``neglected \ndiseases'' because of the lack of modern treatments available to \naddress them and their disproportionate impact on very low income \npopulations.\n  Since the purpose of the priority review voucher is to encourage \nresearch and development for diseases for which there is currently \nlittle or no market, our intent is that the priority review voucher \ncreates a strong incentive for investment in the often financially \nrisky business of drug and biologic procurement for neglected diseases. \nBasic economics dictate that the voucher will create the strongest \nincentive by being freely transferable among private businesses, with \neach voucher having the capacity for transfer multiple times, without \nrestriction. This interpretation is the intent of Congress. Any \nimposition of restriction by the Food and Drug Administration on the \nnumber of times and manner of transfer of the voucher will have the \neffect of negating its value, which is contrary to Congressional \nintent. I yield to my distinguished colleague to elaborate on this \npoint.\n  Mr. BROWN. I concur with my colleague on the importance of creating a \nstrong incentive for development of treatments for neglected, tropical \ndiseases through a freely transferable priority review voucher. \nAccordingly, I rise today to introduce, along with my colleague from \nthe State of Kansas, a bill that would codify the authors' intent of \ntwo parts of the priority review voucher law. First, any priority \nreview voucher awarded under the provision is freely transferable \nwithout restriction on the number of times it can be transferred. \nSecond, the priority review voucher can be redeemed only for a human \ndrug application that is not already pending with the Food and Drug \nAdministration. I encourage my colleagues in Congress to join us in \nensuring that this legislation moves quickly through the legislative \nprocess.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank my friend, the Senator from Ohio, for \nintroducing this important measure and for his remarks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida (for himself and Mr. Martinez):\n  S. 3152. A bill to provide for a comprehensive study by the National \nResearch Council of the National Academies to assess the water \nmanagement, needs, and conservation of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-\nFlint River System; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to help preserve a vital ecosystem and protect a way of \nlife for many citizens in my home State of Florida.\n  I am introducing a bill that would require the U.S. Army Corps of the \nEngineers to commission the National Research Council of the National \nAcademies to conduct a comprehensive study of water management and \nconservation of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint, ACF, River \nSystem. My colleague in the Florida Congressional Delegation, \nCongressman Allen Boyd, is offering similar legislation today in the \nU.S. House of Representatives.\n  At the confluence of the Flint and Chattahoochee Rivers, the \nApalachicola River begins its winding journey to the Gulf of Mexico. \nNearly 112 miles later, the river flows into Apalachicola Bay, bringing \nfresh water and vital nutrients to the famed oyster beds and fisheries \nof the bay.\n  I visited the Apalachicola last month, rode down the river, and met \nwith many who are concerned about its fate. When people think of \nFlorida, they may envision palm trees or white sand. That is not what \nthe Apalachicola has to offer, but it is unique and spectacular in its \nown right. The water is dark from tannic acid leached from trees in the \nriver's swamps. At nearly 140 feet tall, majestic bluffs line the banks \nof the northern section of the river and form the largest exposed \ngeological outcropping in Florida. In this reach of the river, the Alum \nBluff is a significant historic site. Andrew Jackson paused here in \n1818, and Confederate troops fortified the area with earthworks and \ncannon during the Civil War.\n  As you traverse into the southern reaches of the Apalachicola and get \ncloser to the bay, the vegetation changes and the land is flat. The \nbrackish area of the Apalachicola, where the river's freshwater mixes \nwith saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico, is home to one of the Nation's \nmost productive oyster-harvesting areas.\n  I work a great deal on another ecosystem that is much more familiar \nin Florida and across the Nation, the Everglades. I can tell you that \ncomparing an impaired ecosystem like the River of Grass to the \nApalachicola demonstrates a powerful lesson: we must manage our natural \nresources wisely, or face serious consequences.\n  Chronic drought conditions in the southeastern U.S. have led to \ndramatic decreases in the quantity of water entering the ACF River \nSystem. Both these natural fluctuations in water supply and human-\nrelated uses have led to unprecedented reductions in freshwater inflow \nentering Apalachicola Bay. The water and nutrients delivered to the bay \nare critical to the health and productivity of the estuary and adjacent \ncoastal waters of the Gulf. This area supports significant recreational \nand commercial fisheries, including 90 percent of Florida's oyster \nfishery, as well as shrimp, grouper, and other high-value species.\n  We cannot sit back and watch as the Apalachicola River and Bay \ndecline as a result of this historically low freshwater inflow. Under \nthe current way of doing business, the ecosystems of the river and bay \nare suffering, as are the citizens who rely upon them for their \nlivelihood. We need a solution that takes into account the \nenvironmental sensitivities and real water needs of all citizens in \nFlorida, Alabama, and Georgia who live and work within the ACF River \nSystem. This study is a first step toward reaching that goal.\n  As an independent and trusted source of scientific analysis and \nadvice, the National Research Council is uniquely qualified to \nundertake such a comprehensive study. In the legislation, I ask that \nthe NRC examine a number of critical issues. These include examining \nthe state of the science on the Apalachicola River and Bay, including \nthe impact of reduced freshwater flow on the area's ecology, and \nassessing water availability, supply options, demand-management \nalternatives, and socioeconomic factors that influence uses in the ACF \nRiver System. There is also a tremendous need for the NRC to provide \nall concerned with water management in the ACF River System with \nrecommendations on how to determine water limits that adequately \nrecognize and balance the needs of all users.\n   We have responsibility to be good stewards of our environment. This \nresponsibility requires us to ensure that our management decisions are \nbased on the best, peer- reviewed science that is available. The NRC \nstudy commissioned in the legislation that I am offering today would go \na long way in helping us to fulfill that responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\n                                S. 3152\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize and improve the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Act of 1974, and for other puropses; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Specter and \nSenator Kohl in introducing important legislation designed to protect \nour communities and particularly our most precious asset, our children, \nnot only by keeping them safe and out of trouble, but also by helping \nto ensure they have the opportunity to become productive adult members \nof society. Senator Specter and Senator Kohl have been leaders in this \narea of the law for decades, and I am honored to work with them once \nagain on such an important initiative. I thank Senator Kohl for sharing \nwith me the responsibilities of chairing the Committee's hearing on \nthis bill in December, and for working so hard to draft this \nlegislation.\n  The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, JJDPA, sets out \nFederal policy and standards for the administration of juvenile justice \nin the states. It authorizes key Federal resources for states to \nimprove their juvenile justice systems and for communities to develop \nprograms to prevent young people from getting into trouble. With the \nreauthorization of this important legislation, we recommit to these \nimportant goals but also push the law forward in key ways to better \nserve our communities and our children.\n  The basic goals of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nAct remain the same: keeping our communities safe by reducing juvenile \ncrime, promoting programs and policies that keep children out of the \ncriminal justice system, and encouraging states to implement policies \ndesigned to steer those children who do enter the juvenile justice \nsystem back onto a track to become contributing members of society.\n  The reauthorization of the JJDPA that we introduce today augments \nthese goals in several ways. First, this bill encourages states to move \naway from keeping young people in adult jails. The Center for Disease \nControl and Prevention concluded late last year that children who are \nheld in adult prisons commit more crimes, and more serious crimes, when \nthey are released, than children with similar histories who are kept in \njuvenile facilities. After years of pressure to try more and more young \npeople as adults and to send them to adult prisons, it is time to \nseriously consider the strong evidence that this policy is not working.\n  We must do this with ample consideration for the fiscal constraints \non states, particularly in these lean budget times, and with ample \ndeference to the traditional role of states in setting their own \ncriminal justice policy. We have done so here. But we also must work to \nensure that unless strong and considered reasons dictate otherwise, the \npresumption must be that children will be kept with other children, \nparticularly before they have been convicted of any wrongdoing.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know well the importance of holding \ncriminals accountable for their crimes with strong sentences. But when \nwe are talking about children, we must also think about how best to \nhelp them become responsible, contributing members of society as \nadults. That keeps us all safer.\n  I am disturbed that children from minority communities continue to be \noverrepresented in the juvenile justice system. This bill encourages \nstates to take new steps to identify the reasons for this serious and \ncontinuing problem and to work together with the Federal government and \nwith local communities to find ways to start solving it.\n  I am also concerned that too many runaway and homeless young people \nare locked up for so-called status offenses, like truancy, without \nhaving committed any crime. In a Judiciary Committee hearing earlier \nthis year on the reauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, \nI was amazed by the plight of this vulnerable population, even in the \nwealthiest country in the world, and inspired by their ability to rise \nabove that adversity. The Runaway and Homeless Youth Act seeks to \nprovide necessary services to vulnerable young people.\n  Complementing that effort, this reauthorization of the JJDPA takes \nstrong and significant steps to move states away from detaining \nchildren from at-risk populations for status offenses. This bill \nrequires rigorous new procedures before a state can detain a status \noffender, and strictly limits the time they may be detained. This \nprovision was drafted with the limited resources of states in mind, \ndeference to judicial discretion, and the need to keep children safe \nwhen no other appropriate placement is available, but it aims to move \nstates decisively in the direction of ending the practice of detaining \nstatus offenders, as some states already have.\n  As I have worked with experts on this legislation, it has become \nabundantly clear that mental health and drug treatment are fundamental \nto making real progress toward keeping juvenile offenders from \nrecidivism. Mental disorders are two to three times more common among \nchildren in the juvenile justice system than in the general population, \nand fully eighty percent of young people in the juvenile justice system \nhave been found by some studies to have a connection to substance \nabuse. Often these young people face coexisting mental health and drug \nproblems. This bill takes new and important steps to prioritize and \nfund mental health and drug treatment.\n  The bill tackles several other key facets of juvenile justice reform. \nIt emphasizes effective training of personnel who work with young \npeople in the juvenile justice system, both to encourage the use of \napproaches that have been proven effective and to eliminate cruel and \nunnecessary treatment of juveniles. It also creates incentives for the \nuse of programs that research and testing have shown to work best.\n  Finally, the bill refocuses attention on prevention programs intended \nto keep children from ever entering the criminal justice system. I was \nstruck when Chief Richard Miranda of Tucson,\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\nArizona, said at our December hearing on this bill that we cannot \narrest our way out of the problem. I heard the same sentiment from \nChief Anthony Bossi and others at the Judiciary Committee's field \nhearing on young people and violent crime in Rutland, Vermont, earlier \nthis year. When seasoned police officers from Rutland, Vermont, to \nTucson, Arizona, tell me that prevention programs are pivotal, I pay \nattention.\n  Just as this administration and recent Republican Congresses have \ngutted programs that support state and local law enforcement, so they \nhave consistently cut and narrowed effective prevention programs, \ncreating a dangerous vacuum. We need to reverse this trend and help our \ncommunities implement programs proven to help kids turn their lives \naround.\n  I have long supported a strong Federal commitment to preventing youth \nviolence, and I have worked hard on past reauthorizations of this \nlegislation, as have Senators Specter and Kohl and others on the \nJudiciary Committee. We have learned the importance of balancing strong \nlaw enforcement with effective prevention programs. This \nreauthorization pushes forward new ways to help children move out of \nthe criminal justice system, return to school, and become responsible, \nhard-working members of our communities.\n  I thank the many prominent Vermont representatives of law \nenforcement, the juvenile justice system, and prevention-oriented non-\nprofits who have spoken to me in support of reauthorizing this \nimportant Act and who have helped inform my understanding of these \nissues. They include Ken Schatz of the Burlington City Attorney's \nOffice, Vermont Juvenile Justice Specialist Theresa Lay-Sleeper, and \nChief Steve McQueen of the Winooski Police Department. I know that many \nof my colleagues on the Committee have heard from passionate leaders on \nthis issue in their own states.\n  These are difficult issues. We all care deeply about the well-being \nof our children and our communities, but we will not always agree \ncompletely on the best way to address the problems that keep too many \nof our young people ensnared in the justice system. After months of \nresearch and discussions, Senator Kohl, Senator Specter, and I believe \nwe have found a way forward toward creating a system that will work \nmore effectively to protect our young people. I hope all Senators will \nsupport this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3155\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENT.\n\n       The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 \n     is amended by striking title V, as added by the Juvenile \n     Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (Public Law \n     93-415; 88 Stat. 1133) (relating to miscellaneous and \n     conforming amendments).\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Leahy and Senator \nSpecter to introduce the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nReauthorization Act. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nAct, JJDPA, has played a key role in successful state and local efforts \nto reduce juvenile crime and get kids back on track after they have had \nrun-ins with the law. This legislation will reauthorize and make \nsignificant improvements to these important programs.\n  A successful strategy to combat juvenile crime consists of a large \ndose of prevention and intervention programs. Juvenile justice programs \nhave proven time and time again that they help prevent crime, \nstrengthen communities, and rehabilitate juvenile offenders. The JJDPA \nhas always had a dual focus: prevention and rehabilitation.\n  The JJDPA has successfully focused on intervening in a positive \nmanner to work with those teens that have fallen through the cracks and \nhave had a few scrapes with the law. Many of the juveniles who come \ninto contact with the justice system are not violent offenders or gang \nmembers. Rather, they are young people who have made mistakes and \ndeserve a second chance to succeed and lead healthy lives. In fact, \nseventy percent of youth in detention are held for nonviolent charges. \nResearch has shown that youth who come into contact with the justice \nsystem can be rehabilitated, and we have an obligation to support \nsuccessful programs that do just that.\n  While putting young people on the right path after they have had run-\nins with the law is tremendously important, we would all prefer to keep \nthem from getting into trouble in the first place. Title V, of course, \nis the only federal program that is dedicated exclusively to juvenile \ncrime prevention. Evidence-based prevention programs are proven to \nreduce crime. Because each child prevented from engaging in repeat \ncriminal offenses can save the community $1.7 to $3.4 million, reducing \ncrime actually saves money. Research has shown that every dollar spent \non effective, evidence based programs can yield up to $13 in cost \nsavings.\n  Since the last reauthorization in 2002, research and experience have \nrevealed that there is still room for improvement. That is why we are \nproposing a number of changes to the Act.\n  Under Title II, the existing JJDPA requires states to comply with \ncertain core requirements that are designed to protect and assist in \nthe rehabilitation of juvenile offenders. This legislation makes \nimprovements to four of the core requirements--removal of juveniles \nfrom adult jails, preventing contact between juvenile offenders and \nadult inmates, the deinstitutionalization of status offenders, and \ndisproportionate minority contact, DMC.\n  The legislation would amend the jail removal and sight and sound \nrequirements to ensure that juveniles charged as adults are not placed \nin an adult facility or allowed to have contact with adult inmates \nunless a court finds that it is in the interest of justice to do so. \nResearch has shown that juveniles who spend time in adult jails am more \nlikely to reoffend. Therefore, it is critical that we get judges more \ninvolved in this process to ensure that it is in everyone's best \ninterest, but particularly the juvenile's best interest, to place that \nyoung person in an adult facility.\n  This measure would also place important limitations on the valid \ncourt order exception to the deinstitutionalization of status \noffenders. Under the current JJDPA, courts can order status offenders \nto be placed in secure detention with minimal process and no limit on \nduration. We seek to change both of these. This bill would place a 7 \nday limit on the amount of time a status offender can spend in a secure \nfacility, and ensure that juvenile status offenders have significant \nprocedural protections.\n  In addition, the legislation will push states to take concrete steps \nto identify the causes of disproportionate minority contact and take \nmeaningful steps to achieve concrete reductions.\n  The bill also focuses a great deal of attention on improving \ncooperation between the states and the Federal Government in the area \nof juvenile justice.\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\nIt directs the administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice to \nconduct additional research. It seeks to strengthen the amount of \ntraining and technical assistance provided by the Federal Government, \nparticularly workforce training for those people who work directly with \njuveniles at every stage of the juvenile justice system.\n  The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act \nwould improve treatment of juveniles in two important respects. It \nseeks to end the use of improper isolation and dangerous practices, and \nit encourages the use of best practices and alternatives to detention.\n  This measure also places a greater focus on mental health and \nsubstance abuse treatment for juveniles who come into contact, or are \nat risk of coming into contact, with the juvenile justice system. \nResearch has shown that the prevalence of mental disorders among youth \nin juvenile justice systems is two to three times higher than among \nyouth who have not had run-ins with the law. Taking meaningful steps to \nprovide adequate mental health screening and treatment for these \njuveniles is a critical part of getting them on the right track, and \nneeds to be a part of Federal, State and local efforts to rehabilitate \njuvenile offenders.\n  Finally, and possibly most importantly, the key to success is \nadequate support. Funding for juvenile justice programs has been on a \ndownward spiral for the last seven years. Just five years ago, these \nprograms received approximately $556 million, with more than $94 \nmillion for the Title V Local Delinquency Prevention Program and nearly \n$250 million for the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program. This \nyear, the Administration requested just $250 million for all juvenile \njustice programs, which represents more than a 50 percent cut from \nFiscal Year 2002. Local communities do a great job of leveraging this \nfunding to accomplish great things, but we cannot say with a straight \nface that this level is sufficient.\n  Therefore, we are seeking to authorize increased funding for the \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The bill will \nauthorize more than $272 million for Title V and nearly $200 million \nfor Title II in Fiscal Year 2009. Then, funding for each title will \nincrease by $50 million each subsequent fiscal year. These programs are \nin desperate need of adequate funding. It is money well spent, and this \nincrease in authorized funding will demonstrate Congressional support \nfor these critical programs.\n  In addition to increased funding for traditional JJDPA programs, we \nhave created a new incentive grant program under the Act. This program \nauthorizes another $60 million per year to help local communities to \nsupplement efforts under the Act, and in some cases go above and beyond \nwhat is required of them. Specifically, this funding will support \nevidence based and promising prevention and intervention programs. It \nwill enhance workforce training, which will improve the treatment and \nrehabilitation of juveniles who come into contact with the system. \nLastly, a significant portion of this funding will be dedicated to \nmental health screening and treatment of juveniles who have come into \ncontact, or are at risk of coming into contact, with the justice \nsystem.\n  The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act is an incredibly \nsuccessful program. The fact that it is cost efficient is important. \nBut the most important thing is that it is effective. It is effective \nin reaching the kids it is designed to help. The evidence based \nprevention programs it funds are able to touch the lives of at-risk \nyouth and steer them away from a life of crime. And for those who have \nunfortunately already had run-ins with law enforcement, its \nintervention and treatment programs have successfully helped countless \nkids get their lives back on the right track and become productive \nmembers of society.\n  It is beyond dispute that these proven programs improve and \nstrengthen young people, as well as their families and their \ncommunities. For that reason, we urge our colleagues to support this \nimportant measure to reauthorize and improve these programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/06/18/senate-section/article/S5768-1", "month": "06", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 91--HONORING ARMY SPECIALIST MONICA L. \n   BROWN, OF LAKE JACKSON, TEXAS, EXTENDING GRATITUDE TO HER AND HER \n FAMILY, AND PLEDGING CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE \n                       UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Cornyn) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.
