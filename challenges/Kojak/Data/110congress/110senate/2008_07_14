Mr. President, on this day, in 1965, former Governor and \nDemocratic Presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson died. Governor \nStevenson was the last Presidential nominee from the State of Illinois \nuntil this year. We have every hope and confidence that Senator Obama \nwill be the next President of the United States.\n  Governor Stevenson once said:\n\n       Public confidence in the integrity of the government is \n     indispensable to faith in democracy; and when we lose faith \n     in the system, we have lost faith in everything we fight . . \n     . for.\n\n  With our economy slumping deeper into recession, our financial \ninstitutions facing ever-greater challenges, and two wars overseas with \nlittle progress or end in sight, the American people are rightly \nfrustrated with their Government. But the progress we made in Congress \nlast week should give the American people a renewed faith that when \nRepublicans abandon their favored path of obstruction to embrace \ncompromise and common ground, we can make progress.\n  We passed a housing bill that will help 8,500 American families who \nlose their homes to foreclosure every day and help eliminate the \nirresponsible practices that created the housing crisis to prevent it \nfrom happening again. Sadly, it took us about 130,000 foreclosures to \nfinally get this bill passed. The obstructionism of the Republicans led \nto 130,000 other homes being foreclosed upon.\n  With Senator Kennedy leading the way, we passed the Medicare doctors \nfix by a veto-proof majority that included all Democrats and 18 \nRepublicans.\n  We completed work on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a \nbill I opposed but the majority of Senators supported.\n  After weeks of delay, Republicans surprised us by allowing us to \nproceed to PEPFAR, a bill to increase our investment in the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS in Africa. I appreciate very much the decision by the \nRepublican leaders to abandon their stalling of PEPFAR, which had been \ngoing on for months. This legislation is supported by President Bush \nand virtually every Senator. Just a handful of Republicans have blocked \nits passage. We should have passed PEPFAR by unanimous consent weeks \nago, but now we have a chance to move forward on this legislation.\n  For the small handful of Republicans who still object to PEPFAR, rest \nassured that we have done everything reasonable to assuage your \nconcerns. The current version of the bill took many of those concerns \ninto account, and we will allow up to 10 additional amendments. We make \na lot out of the 10 amendments, but prior to that agreement being made \nFriday night, Senators Biden and Lugar changed the bill many times, \ntrying to pacify those who objected to the bill. I am confident that \nwith this agreement in place, we can have a productive debate and send \nthis legislation to the President so that we can reestablish our \ncommitment to the world that America will join and lead this global \nfight.\n  The housing stimulus legislation we passed last week is now back in \nthe House of Representatives. The White House plans to send us \nlegislation to include in that bill that will support the success of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac so that American families will continue to \nhave access to home financing. We certainly wish the President had \nbecome engaged in working with us to address this growing crisis long \nago, but we are eager to receive and review this legislation. Once we \nreceive the President's proposal, we are determined to review it and \nact as quickly as possible. Just before coming in here, I spoke with \nSecretary Paulson. He explained, in some detail, the importance of \nmoving this legislation very quickly.\n  We are committed to passing legislation that will guarantee a steady \nflow of funds into the market if conditions require it so that home \nownership continues to be accessible to American families. But we have \nto work to ensure that American taxpayers are not unfairly burdened if \nGovernment action becomes necessary.\n  We also await President Bush's action on the Medicare doctors fix. \nWhen a veto-proof majority of 69 Senators joined with 355 Members of \nthe House of Representatives to pass this legislation, we sent a clear \nand unmistakable message to the President: Sign this bill. Every day \nthat goes by, the integrity of Medicare and TRICARE is threatened. \nEvery day the President delays, senior citizens, the disabled, and our \nveterans are put at risk.\n  There is a reason that all major organizations representing doctors \nand patients are desperate for this legislation to pass. Already, two \nStates--Alabama and South Carolina--have told Medicare patients that \nthey must resubmit their eligibility for assistance programs. The \nPresident vetoing this is going to slow things down even more, and \nother States will be forced to do this. If the President signs this \nlegislation into law today, as he has the power to do, any further \nchaos or interruption of care can be avoided.\n  If the President chooses to veto our bill, I am confident we will \nhave the votes to override it. We have checked with all 9 of the \nRepublicans who voted to allow us to get the 69 that--in effect, voted \nthe first time this way. We checked with the 9 Republicans who voted \nearlier, and we have heard from 1 additional Republican who said he \nwill vote to override the veto.\n  I don't know why the President is doing this. All he is doing is \ncreating chaos with senior citizens, with patients who are veterans or \non Active Duty, and the disabled. That is a bad choice for the \nPresident to make--to protect HMOs and insurance companies. But the \nlonger we go without this bill as law, the longer millions of \nAmericans, including many of our country's most vulnerable, are faced \nwith uncertainty and risk that their health and well-being will be \njeopardized.\n  Finally, we will continue to address the energy crisis this week. \nThis past Thursday, I had a long and productive meeting with former \nSenator Jim Sasser, who was the moderator, and experts from the oil \nindustry, the airlines, and the financial sector of this country. The \ngroup agreed that tapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as \nPresident Bush's father did, would help lower oil prices. The group \nalso agreed that Congress should enact tough legislation to curb energy \nspeculation, with speculators driving up oil prices for their own gain \nwhile the American people are left paying the bill. Is that the only \nproblem? Of course not. But is it a problem? Yes.\n  We continue to work toward bipartisan legislation on speculation.\n  Will stemming speculation solve the energy crisis? Not totally, but \nit will lower prices in the near term and bring stability to the \nmarket. That is why legislation on speculation is the first part of our \nplan. I would hope the Republicans would join with us. Part of their \nplan that is pending--has been rule XIV'd and is here at the desk--has \na provision that deals with speculation. I hope they would allow us to \nmove forward on a bipartisan speculation bill and pass it. Then we can \nmove to other issues relating to energy. But we can't have a free-for-\nall with everyone having their own pet way of solving the energy \ncrisis.\n\n[[Page S6615]]\n\n  I would hope that we could move toward a bipartisan bill on \nspeculation. As I said, speculation is only the first part of our plan.\n  For months we have urged Republicans to join us in passing tax \nextenders that will cut taxes to give American companies reliable \nincentives for investing in alternative energy sources. The tax \nextenders bill would speed our move away from oil and toward a cleaner, \nmore efficient energy future using wind, solar, geothermal, and other \nrenewables. It would create hundreds of thousands of good, high-paying, \npermanent American jobs.\n  Just as Democrats are keeping an open mind about the need for \nincreased domestic production by insisting that oil companies start \ndrilling on the 68 million acres of American land they lease but are \nnot using, we hope Republicans will join us in finally passing the tax \nextenders bill. We must stem energy speculation. We must responsibly \ntap into emergency domestic oil reserves. We must increase domestic \nproduction, and we must give American companies tax cuts to develop \nclean, alternative, renewable energy right here at home.\n  With less market manipulation, more domestic supply, and incentives \nto move away from oil toward renewable energy, we can overcome this \ncrisis and set our country on the path toward a cleaner, safer, more \naffordable energy future. That is the Democratic plan. We hope Senate \nRepublicans will work with us to pass it into law.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, my colleague, the Senator from Nevada, \njust described a series of challenges we face. I don't know that I have \nseen a more daunting time in this country in some long while than the \ntime before us. The issues today of the credit crisis--the subprime \nloan scandal, bank failures, the threat of bank failures--these are \nserious issues. I am convinced the quick action by the Federal Reserve \nBoard and the Secretary of the Treasury this weekend was necessary. But \non top of that, there is a fiscal policy that is way off track. We are \nengaged in a war in which none of the cost of the war is paid for. We \nhave a President who insists the entire cost of the war be added to the \ndebt, and an attempt by Congress to change that would result in a \nPresidential veto. It is a fiscal policy that is way out of balance.\n  The President requests a budget to the Congress of roughly $420 \nbillion in yearly deficits, but that, of course, is not the deficit. \nThe deficit is how much we have to borrow. This President's fiscal \npolicy is off track by the tune of $600 billion to $700 billion a year \nbecause that is, in fact, what has to be borrowed. He doesn't include \nin his budget request the cost of the Iraq war, which is very \nexpensive.\n  We have the subprime loan scandal, the problems in the credit market, \nthe fiscal policy that is off track, a trade policy that means we are \nrunning a deficit of over $2 billion a day every single day by \nimporting more than we are able to export. Then, add to those issues \nwhat is happening to energy, particularly the price of oil running up \nlike a Roman candle, $140 to $145 a barrel, and suggestions by some big \ninvestment banking firms that it may reach $200 a barrel. What does all \nof this mean? What do we do about it?\n  I have mentioned before a trip late one evening over the Pacific \nOcean in what was the previous Air Force One, that big, old airplane. I \nbelieve it now sits at the Reagan Library in California, a 707. It was \nthe Air Force One that brought John F. Kennedy's body back to Andrews \nAir Force Base in 1963. It was the Air Force One used by Presidents up \nuntil George Bush, the senior, and then it was replaced.\n  One of the last flights of that airplane was one I was on to Asia, to \nChina, Japan, and Vietnam. A number of my colleagues were on that \nflight--the majority leader, Senator Daschle. My colleague from Ohio, \nJohn Glenn, was also on the flight. It was late at night flying over \nthe Pacific that I had a chance, for the first time, to ask Senator \nGlenn a lot of questions about the time he rode around this planet in a \nlittle space capsule called Friendship 7 by himself orbiting the Earth. \nI was a very young person at the time of the flight, but I remember \nvividly the reports on the radio and television about John Glenn \nlifting off as the first American to orbit the Earth and how excited I \nwas. So that evening, as a U.S. Senator, with my colleague, John Glenn, \nsitting there, I began peppering him with questions about that \nspaceflight.\n  One of the questions I asked was, I had remembered that the city of \nPerth, Australia, decided to welcome this astronaut flying alone by, \nwhen he came to the dark side of the Earth, turning on all the lights. \nEvery light in Perth was on that night. They lit up this city called \nPerth, Australia, and I asked John Glenn that evening: Did you see the \nlights of Perth as you reached the dark side of the Earth up there in \nspace alone? Did you see that shining light of Perth?\n  He said: I did.\n  The only evidence of human life that existed on the planet below were \nthe lights shining up, a product of energy. It was perhaps not a \nsurprise to him to understand that product of energy affects our lives \nevery day in every way. Energy is critical to our lives. We get up in \nthe morning, virtually every one of us who is within listening \ndistance, and we flick a switch. That means a light goes on, the \nproduct of energy. It means perhaps you brush your teeth with an \nelectric toothbrush, and thus battery energy. It means you shave with \nan electric razor, perhaps, and use electric energy. You heat up some \ncoffee, electric energy. You take a shower and a hot water heater that \nruns on either gas or electric energy produces hot water. Then you get \nin the car to go to work, and you put a key in the ignition and turn \nit. You use energy, in most cases from gasoline.\n\n  Energy affects almost everything we do, and we don't give it a second \nthought until one day when the lights go out and electricity is gone \nfor 4 days and an entire neighborhood is up in arms. How on Earth can \nwe live without electricity? Or until at some point when gasoline is \nnot available and, therefore, your car is of little value. It happens \nfrom time to time.\n  Now what has happened to our country and to the world with respect to \nenergy policy is, we have a big appetite for energy. We are seeing the \nprice of oil, which is a very important part of our energy appetite, go \nup, up, up, like a Roman candle, $140 to $145 a barrel, and gasoline \nprices follow suit. A whole lot of folks at this point aren't able to \nafford to fill the tank with gas. A whole lot of trucking companies \ncan't afford to buy the gas or diesel for their saddle tanks on those \nbig trucks. A lot of airlines can't afford to put jet fuel in the wings \nthese days. So we have a good many airlines going into bankruptcy, and \nmore out of business.\n  The question is, Why is the price of oil where it is? What has \nhappened? Let me describe a couple things that have happened that lead \nme to believe we have to take action now, and very aggressive action as \nwell. In the last 12 to 14 months, the price of oil has doubled. Has \nanything happened in the last year with respect to supply and demand \nthat would justify the price of oil doubling? I can't think of \nanything, except perhaps there is less demand for gasoline at the \nmoment. Our country is driving less. We have driven something close to \n5 or 6 billion fewer miles in this 6-month period than the previous 6-\nmonth period. So demand for gasoline is actually down. One would think \nif that is the case, prices should abate or come down. But they didn't. \nThey went straight up.\n  Here is what is happening: Explosive growth of speculation in the oil \nfutures market. Speculators in the year 2000 were 37 percent of that \nmarket. In 2008, 71 percent of the people in this market are \nspeculators. That is, they are not interested in owning oil. They are \ninterested in contracts for oil with which they can buy and sell and \ntrade and make a profit.\n\n[[Page S6616]]\n\n  Will Rogers described it decades ago: People buying things they will \nnever get from people who never had it, making money on both sides of \nthe trade. So what about speculators? Are they causing price increases?\n  Let me share some comments from some people who might know. The \nsenior vice president of ExxonMobil, in April of this year:\n\n       The price of oil should be about $50 or $55 per barrel.\n\n  Another comment:\n\n       Experts, including the former head of ExxonMobil, say \n     financial speculation in the energy markets has grown so much \n     over the last 30 years that it now adds up to 30 percent or \n     more to the price of a barrel of oil.\n\n  Energy Secretary Bodman takes a different view. He says:\n\n       There's no evidence we can find that speculators are \n     driving futures prices [for oil].\n\n  Let me give you a couple different views. The CEO of Marathon Oil:\n\n       $100 oil isn't justified by the physical demand in the \n     marketplace.\n\n  This is from Clarence Cazelot, CEO of Marathon Oil.\n  From a chart I have used previously, Mr. Fadel Gheit, who was for 30 \nor 35 years the top analyst for Oppenheimer & Co., he said:\n\n       There's no shortage of oil. I'm convinced that oil prices \n     should not be a dime above $55 barrel. I call it the world's \n     largest gambling hall. It's open 24/7. Unfortunately, it is \n     totally unregulated. This is like a highway with no cops and \n     no speed limit, and everybody is going 120 miles an hour.\n\n  I want to go back to the Energy Secretary's notion that there is \nreally no speculative role. Here is the Washington Post, July 7, a week \nor so ago:\n\n       The wave of investment dollars has flooded commodity \n     markets in recent years and critics say contributed to the \n     runup in prices.\n\n  Here is the point:\n\n       Investors, including pension funds and Wall Street \n     speculators, have sharply increased their commodity \n     allocations since 2003, from $13 billion to $260 billion. \n     This has made financial actors an even larger force on these \n     markets than farmers, airlines, trucking firms, and companies \n     that buy and sell the physical goods to run their businesses.\n       For decades, trading commodity contracts were considered \n     taboo by most pension funds because the market is so volatile \n     and risky.\n\n  That has all changed. Now we have the California pension fund, \nCalPERS, and other pension programs that are shoving money into the \ncommodities futures. It doesn't mean they want to own oil. They want to \nspeculate.\n  Walter Lukken is the Acting Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission. This is the Commission that is supposed to be the referee, \nthe Federal regulator wearing a striped shirt and blowing a whistle \nwhen they call the fouls. Markets work, in most cases, but when markets \ndon't work, you have to have a referee. Walter Lukken, the referee for \nus, says the price of oil is going up because demand is outstripping \nsupply, strong fundamentals are at play. Apparently, he misses the fact \nfrom 2003 until now, $13 billion to $260 billion, that is an additional \n$247 billion have gone into this market driving up the price of oil, \nhaving almost nothing at all to do with supply and demand.\n  There is a need, it seems to me, for the Congress to address this \nissue of excess speculation. Those that need a commodities market are \nthe airlines, trucking companies, farmers, and others so they can hedge \nrisks. There is a legitimate function of hedging risks, and that is \nwhat the market was created for. A consumer and producer hedges risk \nwith respect to a physical product, a perfectly legitimate function. \nBut the fact is, those interests that are most concerned about the \nCongress taking action to address a market that is broken are those who \nneed the markets to hedge risks--airlines, trucking companies, farmers \nand others--because they know this market is broken. They know this is \na market that is supposed to work for them to hedge risk, but now it is \ncompletely broken, taken over by speculators.\n  There is a columnist in the Washington Post this morning who does his \nusual--he does about two pages of research and then he skips the next \nfive pages, so he never quite gets to the truth. He says this \nspeculation stuff, that is made up. He doesn't use the word \n``populace.'' He says they are a bunch of ne'er-do-wells who don't have \nthe foggiest idea what they are talking about. It is not a surprise to \nme that there are those who believe the current system is working. It \ncertainly works for some, doesn't it?\n  The OPEC countries must love walking to the bank with our money and \nmaking a deposit in their account. The oil companies must love making \ndeposits of our money into their accounts. I understand why some of the \ninvestment banks and other market players who are engaged in neck-deep \nspeculation and have been making a lot of money love the status quo. \nThey love what has happened here. It doesn't bother them a bit where \nthe price of oil is, as long as they make money over all this \nspeculation.\n  What I think we should do is pass legislation similar to that which I \nhave introduced. It is called the End Oil Speculation Act. End oil \nspeculation--how do you do that? You do it through a couple of \napproaches. No. 1, you take the oil futures market and you require the \nreferee, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), to \ndistinguish between legitimate hedging--that is, those who want to, \nbetween a consumer and a producer, hedge their risk with a physical \nproduct. You must distinguish between those interests and all other \ninterests who are just in this market to speculate.\n  With respect to those who are in this market just for pure \nspeculation, establish significant position limits. We can wring the \nspeculation out of this system and should. I am talking about the \nexcess speculation. This oil commodity futures market was created in \n1936, and when President Roosevelt signed the bill, he warned about \nexcess speculation. In fact, the bill itself had a provision dealing \nwith excess speculation. Now we find ourselves, all these decades \nlater, with a dramatic amount of speculation that is wrecking this \nmarket. Should we do something? The answer is we must. We don't have a \nchoice. Of course, we should.\n  My hope is--as the majority leader indicated, we are going to be able \nto address this issue later this week. My hope is we will be able to \ntake legislation to the floor of the Senate, and if a regulator cannot \nregulate effectively--and this CFTC apparently cannot--and the head of \nthe regulators has already made a judgment, a judgment he has stated \nfour or five times since January: This market is working fine. This is \nnot about speculation. This is about the fundamentals of supply and \ndemand. What, me worry? Things are fine. Don't worry. Then, at the end \nof last month, the Chairman apparently had some sort of epiphany, a \ndream and woke up the next day and said: We have actually been \ninvestigating this for 7 months.\n  One of those statements is not true: Supply and demand at work; don't \nworry, be happy; or we have been worried for 7 months. It is not clear \nwhat position represents the position of the Chairman of the CFTC, but \nthey are positions at dramatic odds with one another.\n  Let me say in addition, we hope this week we can address some \nlegislation that will bring down the price of gasoline and put downward \npressure on oil prices. Even doing that doesn't address, in the \nlong term, what we need to address. All of us understand that. But it \ndoes address, in the short term, what we have to do to put some \ndownward pressure on these prices.\n\n  I don't think there is any question that the price of oil and gas and \nthe runup is hurting the economy of this country, hurting key \nindustries in this country, certainly hurting American families, and we \ncan do something about it, I believe, in the short term.\n  In the longer term, some of our colleagues will say: We have to \ndrill. I support that. I don't support drilling everywhere. But it is \ninteresting, the minority party put together a proposal that talks \nabout drilling. But they forgot to include all this area off the coast \nof Florida. Isn't it interesting, I know why they didn't include it. \nBecause one of their caucus does not want to drill off the coast of \nFlorida, does not want to drill in these eastern waters off the Gulf of \nMexico. They also know President Bush does not want to allow U.S. \ncompanies to drill off the coast of Cuba, so these were included in \ntheir proposals. They are all big drilling advocates, except they don't \nwant to drill where most of the oil exists.\n  This is a chart of the technically recoverable oil. Let me show where \nit is. This is the Outer Continental Shelf of the Pacific, this is \nAlaska, this is the Outer Continental Shelf of the Atlantic, and this \nis the Gulf of Mexico. We\n\n[[Page S6617]]\n\ncan see where the bulk of the technically recoverable oil is. I was one \nof four Senators--Senators Bingaman, Domenici, and then-Senator \nTalent--who offered the legislation to open lease 181. Lease 181, which \nis now 8.3 million acres in the gulf, was opened in 2006. That is an \nadditional 8.3 million additional acres opened for oil and gas leasing.\n  I have also introduced legislation that opens all this additional \narea in the eastern Gulf of Mexico and off Cuban waters. So do I \nsupport drilling? I do. It is just that the minority side does not \nsupport it quite as much as they pretend to support it.\n  Let me describe this chart. These are the waters off Cuba open for \nleasing. There is half a million barrels of oil a day that could come \ninto production, and our U.S. companies cannot go in there to compete \nagainst other nations to drill for it. Spain is there. Canada is there. \nIndia is there. China is there. They all have a desire to drill in that \nwater. We cannot go there because our companies are told by President \nBush: No, we have an embargo against Cuba; you can't go after this \n500,000 barrels of oil a day in these waters because of our embargo \nagainst Cuba. That is absurd, absolutely absurd.\n  I have said often on the floor of the Senate, we stick little straws \nin this planet as we circle the Sun and we suck out about 86 million \nbarrels of oil a day. We use one-fourth right here on this little place \non the planet called the United States. We have a prodigious appetite \nfor oil. That reflects in many ways the economy we built. We have built \na wonderful economy. This is a great place to live. There is no place \nlike it on Earth. But divine providence did some strange things. Most \nof the oil is under the sands halfway around the world in the Persian \nGulf, and most of the demand is in the United States. There is more and \nmore demand ahead of us with respect to China and India. We understand \nthat. We knew that 12 to 14 months ago. So that is not what is causing \nthe runup in prices today.\n  But we all know, if we look ahead, we need to leapfrog to other \ntechnologies, even as we search for additional oil. We will drill for \nmore oil in the right places. Obviously, the chart I showed for the \nGulf of Mexico has far more than my friends in the minority would \naspire to achieve in other regions.\n  In addition to drilling in an appropriate way, we need much more \nconservation. Conservation is the easiest and by far the least \nexpensive way to produce energy because we are such unbelievable \nwasters of energy. So conservation is, first and foremost, the best \nplace to get additional energy.\n  Second is efficiency. It doesn't matter what you use--a hot water \nheater, a furnace, an air-conditioner--it doesn't matter what you use. \nThe dramatic increase in efficiency of every appliance everybody uses, \nincluding these light bulbs, can substantially reduce our need for \nenergy. The incandescent light bulb is on its way out. It will not be \ntoo many years when we will not find one in this country because we can \nlight America's houses and commercial facilities with about 80 percent \nsavings of what we have been using in the past.\n  Finally, and most importantly, in my judgment, as we look forward \nsome years, we have to, as a country, decide to get dramatically \ninvolved in renewable energy. We are not nearly there yet. We have some \nmovement toward renewable, but we are not doing what we should do. The \ndebate in the Congress has been about whether we should increase the \nproduction tax credits, tax incentives by 1 year. That is pathetic. We \nought to say we are going to do this for a decade. America, you can \ncount on where we are headed.\n  In the next decade, we are going to build substantial capability for \nwind, solar, biomass, and more. We ought to say here is where America \nis headed for 10 years. We are nibbling around the edges talking about \na 1-year extension of this and that. It is not that we have not tried.\n  We had a longer extension on the floor of the Senate, but \nregrettably, the minority side largely blocked it. In fact, they have \nblocked these extensions three times. Our hope is that we as a country \nwill be able to say our policy is conservation, efficiency, yes, \ndrilling in the right places, but our policy is especially to move \nforward with substantial and dramatic amounts of new renewable energy.\n  I know the American people look at the Congress from time to time and \nwonder if anything can get done. There certainly is an urgency with \nrespect to the policies I described--the fiscal policy that is way off \ntrack, a trade policy that is producing $800 billion a year in trade \ndeficits, a policy that has allowed the subprime loan scam to exist and \ndevelop right under the nose of regulators who apparently were dead \nfrom the neck up. All these things are urgent needs for this country to \naddress. But none is more urgent at the moment than trying to find a \nway to put some downward pressure on gas and oil prices that have risen \nout of sight, in my judgment, disconnected to the supply-and-demand \nfundamentals of where a market ought to be.\n  Every American is affected by this runup in prices, and our country \nis being irreparably damaged by what it costs for us to send all this \nmassive money every single day overseas in search of oil that is \nproduced outside our country's borders.\n  We need a short-term urgent plan and a long-term thoughtful plan to \nfind our way through this situation and put America on a better course \nfor energy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this summer is turning out to be one of \ngreat anxiety and uncertainty for literally thousands of families in \nsouthwest Ohio. At this moment, the economic future of more than 8,000 \npeople--8,000 workers and their families--in the Wilmington and \nsurrounding communities hangs in the balance.\n  DHL, the cargo carrier service, has threatened to shut down its \nWilmington hub, a decision that, if successful, threatens both families \nand surrounding communities. In May, DHL's parent company, the German \ncompany Deutsche Post World Net, announced a proposed deal with UPS \nthat would close the Ohio operation.\n  In 2004, the State of Ohio and the city of Wilmington, a community of \n13,000 people, and surrounding counties--Highland County, Greene \nCounty, Clark County, and the area around it--proudly laid out the \nwelcome mat for DHL, providing more than $400 million in incentives \nonly 4 years ago. It was, we thought then, the beginning of a long \nfriendship.\n  The Wilmington Air Park is the largest employer in a six-county area \nof Ohio. Literally, in each of the six counties in the region, DHL is \nthe single largest employer. Air Park employees were drawn from 45 \ncounties, more than half of Ohio's 88 counties.\n  Tomorrow, Americans from across the country will gather around their \ntelevision sets to enjoy baseball's All Star game in Yankee Stadium. \nThe first pitch will be thrown by Cleveland's All Star pitcher Cliff \nLee. During this midsummer classic, fans may notice emblazoned on the \nwalls of Yankee Stadium and on game memorabilia the DHL logo, because \nDHL is the official carrier of major league baseball. More than 8,000 \nOhio workers and their families have helped make DHL a major league \nplayer in the North American express delivery business. Their families \nin the community have supported DHL, worked for DHL, helped build DHL, \nand State and local governments pitched in, as I said, with $400 \nmillion to build this company and help it thrive in southwest Ohio.\n  Thankfully, the agreement with UPS and the agreement to shut down is \nnot yet final, and so we fight. This morning, earlier today, Mayor \nDavid Raizk, Clinton County Commissioner Randy Riley, and I joined \nhundreds of DHL, ABX, and Air Star workers to fight for these jobs and \nthis community. Together, I delivered to DHL's headquarters in \nWilmington--at their headquarters just outside Wilmington, on the \noutskirts of Wilmington--I delivered more than 9,000 signatures on \npetitions to DHL headquarters, petitions\n\n[[Page S6618]]\n\nthat were denied by DHL management 2 weeks ago when employees and \ncommunity members tried to deliver them.\n  DHL needs to hear from these families and they need to understand \nthat good corporate citizenship means more than baseball advertisements \nand company sponsorships. DHL workers and their families rightfully \nfeel betrayed by the callous decision made by Deutsche Post.\n\n  This kind of betrayal does not just eliminate jobs. The community \nloses revenue, public schools take a hit, the police force, fire \ndepartment--all take major hits. It is estimated that 10 percent of the \nWilmington City school budget is derived from DHL's operations in \nWilmington. Hospitals suffer. Clinton Memorial Hospital is a not-for-\nprofit, and people connected with DHL account for a huge percent of \ntheir overall operations. They get $7 million in revenue just from DHL, \nABX, and ASTAR, and their overall budget is $100 million. They don't \nknow how they will be able to continue operations if DHL closes its \noperations in Wilmington.\n  There are some 15,000 children of those DHL workers at the Wilmington \nairpark--DHL, ASTAR, and ABX--who will lose their jobs.\n  Today I stood with the real All Stars, a couple of hundred workers \nand their families from southwest Ohio at DHL and at their union hall \nright across the street. In the last few months they have been sending \nme their stories. I would like to share some of them.\n  Tara Pratz of Lebanon, a community a few miles from there in Warren \nCounty, told me she and her husband relocated to Ohio because they \ntrusted DHL and the promises made to her and workers like her. Reading \nfrom her note, she said:\n\n       Deustch-Post is nothing more than a corporate terrorist \n     destroying the very lives that built the company.\n\n  Kelly Morse of Blanchester also wrote me about moving to Ohio because \nof the loyalty she felt for DHL. She wrote:\n\n       At first we did not want to move, but as a loyal employee I \n     wanted to live close to my employer. DHL needs to be held \n     accountable for the commitments they made to the people, \n     workers, and community of southwest Ohio.\n\n  New Vienna resident Beth Carpenter wrote:\n\n       My husband is one of the many employees being laid off . . \n     . with the economy the way it is, it is hard enough trying to \n     keep food on the table, let alone to try to do it without a \n     job.\n\n  Sherry Barrett, also of New Vienna, wrote, simply:\n\n       We are all extremely terrified of what our future holds. . \n     . .We need all of you in our government to fight hard for us \n     and Ohio.\n\n  Again, it doesn't need to be this way. DHL has been a good corporate \ncitizen. It can remain a good friend to the people of Ohio. Workers and \nfamily members and the community are ready to do whatever it takes--\nwhatever it takes. This morning in Wilmington it was clear that this \ncommunity sticks together when times are tough.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/14/senate-section/article/S6618-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6618-S6619]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HIV/AIDS, TB, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria \nReauthorization Act. Although we have made significant headway over the \nlast 5 years, the HIV/AIDS pandemic remains one of the world's worst \npublic health crises, with millions of people infected around the globe \nand millions more who have already perished. As chairman of the Senate \nForeign Relations subcommittee on Africa, and because of the disease's \ndisproportionate impact on sub-Saharan Africa, I would like to focus my \nremarks today on that region to illustrate just how critical--and \nurgent--it is that we pass this bill.\n  Despite some progress, AIDS remains a severe public health concern in \nAfrica. Indeed, HIV continues to spread, with many countries on the \ncontinent experiencing unprecedented drops in population, economic \ndecline, decimation of militaries, and the creation of an entire \ngeneration of orphans who know no other life but that of the streets. \nThese societal disruptions have profound consequences for the \ncontinent's future and security; already, they are impeding development \nin the part of the world least able to contain the epidemic or treat \nits victims.\n  In December 2007, the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS--\nUNAIDS--reported that worldwide, approximately 35 million people live \nwith HIV/AIDS. Similar organizations report that at the current rate, \nby 2015 more than 62 million people could become newly infected. \nCurrently, over two-thirds of HIV cases are in Africa, which means \nthere are somewhere between 20 million and 24 million adults and \nchildren in that continent who are HIV-positive. And these are just the \ncases we know of--these are just the reported and documented cases. As \na point of comparison, the region with the next highest infection rate \nis Southeast Asia--with some 4 million individuals living with HIV.\n  Since 2003 there has been a significant bipartisan effort to address \nthis crisis with the creation of the President's Emergency Plan for \nAIDS--or PEPFAR as it is more commonly known. PEPFAR authorized some \n$19 billion over 5 years for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria and yet \nin 2007 alone, 2.5 million people around the globe were infected with \nHIV--or the equivalent of some 6,800 per day, 4,600 of whom live in \nAfrica. And while 4,600 Africans are being infected every day, some \n6,000 Africans are dying from AIDS-related illness--many without ever \nrealizing they were HIV-positive or, if they did know, without ever \nhaving access to any treatment for their illness. In other words, \ndespite a ground-breaking initiative to raise the profile of the \ndisease, to work with local communities and national health systems, \nand to coordinate among the international community, Africa's future \nremains in peril.\n\n  HIV/AIDS is spreading in African countries that are already hard hit \nby a range of other problems including rampant poverty, political \ninstability and a lack of basic services and education. The result is \ndecreased state capacity and an undermining of the development of civil \nsociety. HIV does not discriminate, and it is hitting members of \nAfrica's political leadership, its college-trained professionals, and \nits skilled labor forces. And as it takes its toll on these groups, it \nis having a devastating effect on entire generations. I saw this \nfirsthand just under a decade ago when I traveled to Zimbabwe, and I \nhave seen it since in other trips to Africa.\n  At that time, reports were noting that life expectancy had dropped \nfrom 65 to 39 because of the epidemic. As I walked past the parliament \nbuilding in Harare, I asked how old one had to be to become a \nlegislator. The answer? Forty. And now, even as it copes with a new, \ndevastating political and humanitarian crisis, Zimbabwe is experiencing \neven lower life expectancy rates--37 for men and just 34 for women--\neven lower than the minimum age to be elected a member of Parliament in \nthat country.\n  Despite the critical assistance of the United States, the cold hard \nfacts--the numbers of those infected and dying--show that even more \nhelp is needed from the international community. Last August, on a trip \nto Uganda, I met with a number of health experts--from government \nhealth workers to civil society representatives--to discuss how the \nUnited States can build on the good work that began with PEFPAR, and \nprovide a more vigorous response to the disease.\n\n  We discussed what had worked and what had not, and they told me very \nclearly that in order to put a dent in the devastating impact of this \npandemic, we need to focus not only on treatment but equally, if not \nmore, on prevention. They shared examples of why, in order to help \nthose most vulnerable, HIV/AIDS efforts need to include programs that \naddress gender inequity, family planning, food and nutrition, and \nsocial stigma. And they were unequivocally clear that we need to work \nclosely with national governments and local communities to help\n\n[[Page S6619]]\n\nbuild strong, sustainable health infrastructures that can provide \nassistance to their own citizens.\n  I mention Uganda because it has been a rare example of success on the \ncontinent. The government's early recognition of the crisis and its \ninitial comprehensive policies--including a well-organized public \neducation campaign--are credited with helping to bring adult HIV \nprevalence down from around 15 percent in the early 1990s to just over \n5 percent in 2001. Unfortunately by 2006, scientists were suggesting \nthat Uganda's HIV prevalence rates were once again rising. Indeed, I \nheard that same concern from most, if not all, of the people I met \nthere, as well as from the President of Uganda himself.\n  The underlying message was that focusing on treatment is not enough. \nIn the case of Uganda, given the rising infection rates--as with many \nother parts of the world--the emphasis on treatment fails to address \nthe factors driving the epidemic. Don't get me wrong--Ugandans are \ngrateful for U.S. HIV/AIDS funding--but they made it clear that future \nsupport would be more effective if it were more comprehensive, and \ncorresponded more closely to national needs, conditions, and \ninitiatives.\n  It has become a common refrain that we cannot treat our way out of \nthis global pandemic and I continue to believe that is the case. As \nlong as infection rates are rising, treatment and care costs will \nincrease, as will the disease's burden on key vulnerable populations as \nwell as their families, communities, and countries.\n\n  Scientific evidence supports the anecdotal evidence I heard from many \nin Uganda. It confirms there is much to be gained by integrating the \ntreatment and care of other diseases--particularly tuberculosis but \nalso more common, preventable ailments--with HIV programs and expanded \ninformational awareness campaigns that encourage health knowledge and \ncapacities. Part of the challenge of addressing HIV/AIDS is that the \ndisease does not sit easily within any particular policy area and \nalthough there are important domestic components related to health and \nhuman services, these are also clearly questions of foreign policy and \ninternational assistance. All of these need to be integrated into a \nharmonious whole.\n  And that is why today I encourage my colleagues to support The Tom \nLantos and Henry J. Hyde HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria Reauthorization Act \nand to reject any amendments that would undermine this bipartisan \nlegislation. This bill is not perfect but, if passed, it will put \nglobal AIDS programs on the road to greater sustainability and will \nsignificantly increase our commitment to reversing the crisis.\n  We all know there can be no quick fix or shortcut to success, but we \nhave before us now legislation that maintains and expands the United \nStates' response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Passing this bill will \nensure the continuation of U.S. leadership to prevent, contain, and \ncombat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in a way that advances a \nbroader range of global health and development objectives. To do \nanything less would not only be bad policy, it would be short-sighted \nand counter-productive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are going to be talking this week quite a \nbit about the situation with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. We had news \nthis weekend that the Federal Reserve and Treasury are intending to \nintervene to shore up Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.\n  This situation underscores the depth and the persistence of our \nNation's housing crisis. Last week, I joined a bipartisan majority of \nSenators in voting to approve a housing bill that is intended to \nstrengthen oversight in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to allow the FHA to \nguarantee up to $300 billion in new loans for at-risk subprime \nborrowers. But I think it would be useful at this time to review a few \nrecent data points in other areas because they should cause all of us \nsome concern about where we are heading and the decisions we are making \nas fiduciaries of the public trust.\n  In March of this year, Bear Stearns, the Nation's fifth largest \ninvestment banking firm, was battered by what its officials termed a \nsudden liquidity crisis regarding or related to its large exposure to \ndevalued mortgage-backed securities.\n  At that time, Bear Stearns, JPMorgan, and the Federal Reserve reached \na negotiated deal. JPMorgan purchased 95 million newly issued shares of \nBear's common stock, and the Fed, which in reality means the people who \npay the taxes in our country, became responsible for up to $29 billion \nin losses if the collateral provided by Bear Stearns for the loan \nproves to be worth less than their original claims. That is $29 billion \nguaranteed by American taxpayers in the private market.\n  This decision was unprecedented. Never before had the Fed bailed out \na financial entity that was not a commercial bank. The Fed's \nunprecedented role has generated a widespread debate on the \nimplications of these types of interventions. Many have had concerns \nthat the Government's action tells the market that the Fed is willing \nto help a large and failing financial enterprise, which, in many \npeople's view, sets a bad precedent in terms of corporate \nresponsibility.\n  And by way of information, Bear Stearns' CEO earned $38.4 million in \n2006. They did not file a proxy statement in 2008; his compensation was \nnot available for 2007. But I will say that again. In 2006, previous to \nthis crisis, the CEO made $38.4 million.\n  Last week, IndyMac Bank of Pasadena, CA was closed by the Federal \nOffice of Thrift Supervision, and the FDIC, the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, was named conservator and therefore took over \nthis bank's operations. According to the FDIC, the bank's board of \ndirectors was dissolved, the CEO was fired, and upper management may \nremain, although this has not yet been determined. But the new CEO in \nthis situation is now an FDIC employee and is therefore compensated per \na Government payscale. As conservators, the FDIC will operate the bank \nto maximize the value of the institution for further sale and to \nmaintain banking services.\n  So when we look at the situation we are now facing with Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, I think it is important to lay down three guiding \nprinciples. The first is, we do need to ensure that the measures we are \ntaking protect these Americans who remain at risk of foreclosure. We \nhave to take some proper action now so that this crisis does not grow \ndeeper. But we also need to be very sensitive to the thousands of \nworkers, many of whom live in this area, who have built careers at \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Many of those workers have their retirement \nsavings tied up in the plummeting stock of these formerly robust \ncompanies. But as we focus rightly on those two concerns, on the \nhomeowners and on the workers, we also need to be equally clear that \nany solution to this crisis has to be fair to the American taxpayers \nwho ultimately are going to foot the bill. When times go bad like this, \nquite often the people who are paying the taxes are people who do not \neven own stock, or maybe it is somebody who makes $40,000 a year \ndriving a truck who now is being asked to put money up to preserve an \nentity where, again, we see executive compensation and stock values \nover the years have increased.\n  Paul Krugman wrote a piece in the New York Times today addressing \nelements of this issue. I want to read a portion of it.\n\n       The case against Fannie and Freddie begins with their \n     peculiar status: although they're private companies with \n     stockholders and profits, they're ``government-sponsored \n     enterprises'' established by Federal law, which means that \n     they receive special privileges. The most important of these \n     privileges is implicit: it's the belief of investors that if \n     Fannie and Freddie are threatened with failure, the Federal \n     Government will come to their rescue.\n\n[[Page S6620]]\n\n       This implicit guarantee means that profits are privatized \n     but losses are socialized. If Fannie and Freddie do well, \n     their stockholders [and the corporate executives] reap the \n     benefits, but if things go badly, Washington picks up the \n     tab. Heads they win, tails we lose. Such one-way bets can \n     encourage the taking of bad risks, because the down side is \n     someone else's problem.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the entire New York \nTimes article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 14, 2008]\n\n                        Fannie, Freddie and You\n\n                           (By Paul Krugman)\n\n       And now we've reached the next stage of our seemingly \n     never-ending financial crisis. This time Fannie Mae and \n     Freddie Mac are in the headlines, with dire warnings of \n     imminent collapse. How worried should we be?\n       Well, I'm going to take a contrarian position: the storm \n     over these particular lenders is overblown. Fannie and \n     Freddie probably will need a government rescue. But since \n     it's already clear that that rescue will take place, their \n     problems won't take down the economy.\n       Furthermore, while Fannie and Freddie are problematic \n     institutions, they aren't responsible for the mess we're in.\n       Here's the background: Fannie Mae--the Federal National \n     Mortgage Association--was created in the 1930s to facilitate \n     homeownership by buying mortgages from banks, freeing up cash \n     that could be used to make new loans. Fannie and Freddie Mac, \n     which does pretty much the same thing, now finance most of \n     the home loans being made in America.\n       The case against Fannie and Freddie begins with their \n     peculiar status: although they're private companies with \n     stockholders and profits, they're ``government-sponsored \n     enterprises'' established by federal law, which means that \n     they receive special privileges.\n       The most important of these privileges is implicit: it's \n     the belief of investors that if Fannie and Freddie are \n     threatened with failure, the federal government will come to \n     their rescue.\n       This implicit guarantee means that profits are privatized \n     but losses are socialized. If Fannie and Freddie do well, \n     their stockholders reap the benefits, but if things go badly, \n     Washington picks up the tab. Heads they win, tails we lose.\n       Such one-way bets can encourage the taking of bad risks, \n     because the downside is someone else's problem. The classic \n     example of how this can happen is the savings-and-loan crisis \n     of the 1980s: S. owners offered high interest rates to \n     attract lots of federally insured deposits, then essentially \n     gambled with the money. When many of their bets went bad, the \n     feds ended up holding the bag. The eventual cleanup cost \n     taxpayers more than $100 billion.\n       But here's the thing: Fannie and Freddie had nothing to do \n     with the explosion of high-risk lending a few years ago, an \n     explosion that dwarfed the S. fiasco. In fact, Fannie and \n     Freddie, after growing rapidly in the 1990s, largely faded \n     from the scene during the height of the housing bubble.\n       Partly that's because regulators, responding to accounting \n     scandals at the companies, placed temporary restraints on \n     both Fannie and Freddie that curtailed their lending just as \n     housing prices were really taking off. Also, they didn't do \n     any subprime lending, because they can't: the definition of a \n     subprime loan is precisely a loan that doesn't meet the \n     requirement, imposed by law, that Fannie and Freddie buy only \n     mortgages issued to borrowers who made substantial down \n     payments and carefully documented their income.\n       So whatever bad incentives the implicit federal guarantee \n     creates have been offset by the fact that Fannie and Freddie \n     were and are tightly regulated with regard to the risks they \n     can take. You could say that the Fannie-Freddie experience \n     shows that regulation works.\n       In that case, however, how did they end up in trouble?\n       Part of the answer is the sheer scale of the housing \n     bubble, and the size of the price declines taking place now \n     that the bubble has burst. In Los Angeles, Miami and other \n     places, anyone who borrowed to buy a house at the peak of the \n     market probably has negative equity at this point, even if he \n     or she originally put 20 percent down. The result is a rising \n     rate of delinquency even on loans that meet Fannie-Freddie \n     guidelines.\n       Also, Fannie and Freddie, while tightly regulated in terms \n     of their lending, haven't been required to put up enough \n     capital--that is, money raised by selling stock rather than \n     borrowing. This means that even a small decline in the value \n     of their assets can leave them underwater, owing more than \n     they own.\n       And yes, there is a real political scandal here: there have \n     been repeated warnings that Fannie's and Freddie's thin \n     capitalization posed risks to taxpayers, but the companies' \n     management bought off the political process, systematically \n     hiring influential figures from both parties. While they were \n     ugly, however, Fannie's and Freddie's political machinations \n     didn't play a significant role in causing our current \n     problems.\n       Still, isn't it shocking that taxpayers may end up having \n     to rescue these institutions? Not really. We're going through \n     a major financial crisis--and such crises almost always end \n     with some kind of taxpayer bailout for the banking system.\n       And let's be clear: Fannie and Freddie can't be allowed to \n     fail. With the collapse of subprime lending, they're now more \n     central than ever to the housing market, and the economy as a \n     whole.\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Looking at or thinking about Mr. Krugman's piece, we should \nalso recall that the chief executives of those two companies last year \nearned multimillion-dollar compensation packages. We respect the \nguidance and the leadership that allows corporate CEOs to make these \nkinds of compensation, but at the same time, we should not be asking \nthe taxpayers of this country, many of whom do not even own stocks, if \nwe are buttressing the activities of these companies, to continue to \nassist financially this type of corporate compensation.\n  We have seen one example with the recent IndyMac Bank failure where \nthe FDIC came in and the acting CEO gets a regular Federal salary. I \nurge all of my colleagues to think about this this week, that, as Mr. \nKrugman says, ``the profits are privatized,'' meaning the small group \nof people who own stocks take advantage when things go well, and \nsometimes we talk about economic Darwinism and how the fact that they \nmake that sort of compensation relates to their talent, ``but losses \nare socialized'' meaning that everyone in the country ends up having to \npay when things go wrong in order to protect the system from falling \napart.\n  Well, the bottom line of that is, if our taxpayers are going to be \nrequired to chip in to solve the problem, they should not be alone. The \nexecutives who are involved in the operations of these institutions \nshould also be willing to do the same.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have talked to the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee and explained to him where we \nare. I am very happy we have an agreement to move forward on PEPFAR. \nThat agreement is that we have 10 amendments. They are amendments we \nworked on hard. We did it all day Thursday and Thursday night, and then \nFriday, of course, perfecting the agreement, and we now have consent to \nmove to the bill.\n  Here is the problem that faces the majority: By our moving to PEPFAR, \nit opens a spot where somebody can move to proceed to something else, \nanything that is on the calendar. Anyone can come in and move to that \npiece of legislation, and file a cloture motion with it, which would \nforce us to be on that matter. I cannot allow that to happen.\n  I say this with the deepest respect for all my Republican colleagues, \nbut we have had a little bit of mischievous legislation being thrown \nabout here, and so if I move to something else to fill that spot to \nkeep someone else from moving to something else, we on this side would \nbe very happy to leave that dormant, do nothing with it, and move \nforward and complete PEPFAR. There would be no harm to anyone in doing \nthis. But it would seem to me there would be a lot of harm if--I will \nnot mention any names--the two or three likely suspects walked over \nhere and moved to proceed to something else. I think it would create a \nlot of problems.\n  This PEPFAR legislation dealing with global AIDS is extremely \nimportant. The President wants it. I do not know of a single Democrat \nwho does not want it. I think most Republicans--I think the vast \nmajority of Republicans--want this. So I would hope we are not going to \nget off track because of some folks over here who have tended to make \nme kind of look for a sucker punch to be thrown at any time. I think we \nwould all be ill-advised to not finish PEPFAR at this time.\n  Mr. President, I would ask that morning business be closed. That \nbeing\n\n[[Page S6621]]\n\nthe case, I think the order is now in effect that once it is closed, we \nwould be on PEPFAR.\n  Is that right; I ask the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ask that morning business be closed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have asked the leader for clarification \nof the situation. My understanding is that, as things stood, we would \nbe automatically moving on to discussion of PEPFAR. I appreciate the \nanxiety of the leader with regard to the situation, but, at the same \ntime, from our standpoint on this side of the aisle, I have been \nadvised we would need to object to that simply because the agreement \nour Members feel they have realized would be that we would move to \nPEPFAR today and have the debates on PEPFAR, as opposed to additional \nmaterial.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say to my friend that is absolutely \nwhat we are going to do. The only way we would not do that is if you \nobject to it. I have explained in more detail than probably everyone \nwants to hear, but we have a situation now, procedurally in the Senate, \nwhere there is a spot open. It has nothing to do with PEPFAR. It is \nseparate and apart from PEPFAR. There is an empty spot there that \nanyone can walk in here--any Senator can walk in here--and move to \nanything we have on the calendar. By doing that, of course, they could \nalso accompany that with a cloture motion, and that is what we would be \non. That would take away from what the President wants and, I would \nsay, 90 Senators want. So I am not trying to take advantage of anyone. \nNo one loses anything, nothing, other than the ability to sucker punch \nthe entire Senate.\n  So I would say to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Indiana, \nif we are on this matter here, I would be happy to--and no harm can be \ndone. If people do not want us to move to that, I could not do it. I \ncould not do it anyway. I would have to have 60 Senators to agree to \nthat. This is simply an effort to allow us to complete PEPFAR--without \nusing the term too many times; this is the third time I have used it--\nwithout the entire Senate being sucker punched.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the leader.\n  I rise today in support of S. 2731, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde \nUnited States Global Leadership Act Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and \nMalaria. I thank Chairman Joe Biden for working with me and other \nRepublicans to achieve a bipartisan approach for the reauthorization of \nour Nation's program to combat these diseases. I believe we will have \nan excellent bill before us that will preserve the best aspects of the \nPresident's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief--PEPFAR--and expand the \nefforts of the United States to stem the tide of AIDS, tuberculosis, \nand malaria worldwide.\n  The HIV/AIDS pandemic, coupled with the impact of tuberculosis and \nmalaria, is rending the socioeconomic fabric of communities, nations, \nand an entire continent. The U.S. National Intelligence Council and \ninnumerable top officials, including President Bush, have stated the \nHIV/AIDS pandemic is a threat to national and international security.\n  Communities are being hobbled by the disability and the loss of \nconsumers and workers at the peak of their productive, reproductive, \nand care-giving years. In the most heavily affected areas, communities \nare losing a whole generation of parents, teachers, laborers, health \ncare workers, peacekeepers, and police.\n  United Nations projections indicate that by 2020, HIV/AIDS will have \ndepressed GDP by more than 20 percent in the hardest hit countries. The \nWorld Bank recently warned that while the global economy is expected to \nmore than double over the next 25 years, Africa is at risk of being \nleft behind.\n  Many children who have lost parents to HIV/AIDS are left entirely on \ntheir own, leading to an epidemic of orphan-headed households. When \nthey drop out of school to fend for themselves and their siblings, they \nlose the potential for economic empowerment that an education can \nprovide. Alone and desperate, they sometimes resort to transactional \nsex or prostitution to survive and risk becoming infected with HIV \nthemselves.\n  I believe that in addition to our own national security concerns, we \nhave a humanitarian duty to take action. Five years ago, HIV was a \ndeath sentence\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\nfor most individuals in the developing world who contracted that \ndisease. Now there is hope. We should never forget that behind each \nnumber is a person--a human being--a life the United States can touch \nor even save.\n  PEPFAR has provided treatment to an estimated 1.4 million men, women, \nand children infected with HIV/AIDS in Africa and elsewhere. Before the \nprogram began, only 50,000 people in all of sub-Saharan Africa were \nreceiving lifesaving antiretroviral drugs. Today, three times that many \nare being treated in Kenya alone. PEPFAR also has focused on prevention \nprograms, with the target of preventing 7 million new HIV infections. \nAs Americans, we should take pride in our Nation's efforts to combat \nthese diseases overseas.\n  We should understand that our investments in disease prevention \nprograms have yielded enormous foreign policy benefits during the last \n5 years. PEPFAR has helped to prevent instability and societal collapse \nin a number of at-risk countries; it has stimulated contributions from \nother wealthy nations to fight AIDS; it has facilitated deep \npartnerships with a generation of African leaders; and it has improved \nattitudes toward the United States and Africa and other regions of the \nworld. In my judgment, the dollars spent on this program can be \njustified purely on the basis of the humanitarian results we have \nachieved, but the value of this investment clearly extends to our \nnational security and to our national reputation.\n  I wish to emphasize three points that should guide our deliberations. \nFirst, it is important that Congress move now to reauthorize the \nprogram. The authorization expires in 2\\1/2\\ months. Partner \ngovernments and implementing organizations in the field have indicated \nthat without certainty of reauthorization of this bill, they may delay \nexpanding their programs to meet PEPFAR goals. Certainty of U.S. action \nis an important matter of perception, delivering something similar to \nconsumer confidence to these nations. It may be intangible, but it will \nprofoundly affect the behavior of individuals, groups, and governments \nengaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The continuity of our efforts to \ncombat aids, malaria, and tuberculosis, and the impact of our resources \non the commitments of the rest of the world will be maximized if we act \nnow.\n  Underscoring this point, last fall the Ministers of Health of the 12 \nAfrican focus countries receiving PEPFAR assistance wrote to us saying:\n\n       Without an early and clear signal of the continuity of \n     PEPFAR's support, we are concerned that partners might not \n     move as quickly as possible to fill the resource gap that \n     might be created. Therefore, services will not reach all who \n     need them. . . . The momentum will be much greater in 2008 if \n     we know what to expect after 2008.\n\n  Secondly, our bill expands the flexibility of current law so that \nU.S. efforts in each country can be tailored to its unique situation. I \nhave consulted extensively with American officials who are implementing \nPEPFAR. Most believe that adding new restrictions to the law can limit \nthe flexibility of those charged with implementation in 2009 and \nbeyond. We don't know who that will be and, more importantly, we don't \nknow what the challenges of 2013 will be, although we can probably say \nwith confidence the landscape will be very different than it is today. \nAs the Institute of Medicine said, the Global Leadership Act is a \n``learning organization.'' We should pass a bill that allows PEPFAR to \nexpand and evolve its program implementation, utilizing the experience \nit has gained in its initial years of operation.\n  I understand some Members identify concerns or areas that they \nbelieve deserve specific emphasis. As Senators study the record of \nPEPFAR to date, I believe they will find that the vast majority of the \nauthorities needed for the next phase of our efforts already are in \nexisting legislation. This flexibility is preserved in the House bill \nand in the bill before us today.\n  The one directive in the Leadership Act that I believe must be \nmaintained holds that 10 percent of funding be devoted to programs for \norphans and vulnerable children. There were few programs focused on the \nneeds of these children before the Leadership Act, and we remain in the \nearly stages of the effort to serve them. Before the advent of PEPFAR, \nneither the United States nor anyone else had much experience in \nprograms that support children infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS. \nAfter several years of effort, we have made some progress, but our \nprograms are not yet as firmly established as they can be.\n  The AIDS orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for \npolitical stability, development, and human welfare that extend far \nbeyond that region. The American people strongly back this effort, and \nthe maintenance of this directive will help to ensure that we remain \nattentive to those who need our support the most. The directive will \nalso help ensure the success of the Assistance for Orphans and Other \nVulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of 2005, a bill I \ndrafted and which was cosponsored by 11 Senators. That bill was signed \ninto law on November 8, 2005.\n  The third point I would underscore is this is an authorization bill \nsubject to the annual budget and appropriations process. It is meant to \nestablish policy and the overall parameters of spending on the PEPFAR \nprogram. The $50 billion figure is based on what we believe can be \nspent efficiently and effectively in the years ahead. It presumes that \nfunding will gradually increase over the coming 5-year period. Of the \n$50 billion authorized, $5 billion has been reserved for malaria and $4 \nbillion has been reserved for tuberculosis.\n  I understand some Members would spend less than $50 billion, while \nothers would choose to spend more.\n  But this is a reasonable target that has emerged from good-faith \nnegotiations between Congress and the White House. I believe it will \nmaximize the humanitarian and foreign policy benefits of the PEPFAR \nProgram.\n  We have an opportunity this week to establish policy on a bipartisan \nbasis that will be a triumph for the United States of America. We have \nthe opportunity to save lives on a massive scale and preserve the \nfabric of numerous fragile societies. I ask my colleagues to continue \nto work together for this very important result.\n  I look forward to the passage of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe allowed to speak for the remainder of the time on this side in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nIndiana for his and Senator Biden's leadership in getting this \nlegislation to the floor.\n  This Senator has just returned from Africa over the July 4th recess. \nFour countries in southeastern Africa--Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and \nRwanda--is where PEPFAR has been concentrated. Out of the $3 billion \nthat is being spent per year in Africa, for example, $500 million of \nthat goes just to the country of Kenya.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Indiana has said, it is very true \nthat the attitudes about the United States--as a result of us being out \nthere with this very effective program that is turning people's lives \naround, which, in fact, is taking people who were nothing but skin and \nbones and now being able to live a somewhat normal life, it has \nincreased the favorability toward the United States enormously all over \nthe continent. It has had a tremendous effect. For example, in Kampala, \nUganda, I visited a PEPFAR program. It was not only giving the \nantiviral drugs--and these were to a lot of the children of the \nrefugees who live in this squalor you could not believe, but, in \naddition, if their bodies won't take the drugs because they are \nmalnourished, there is a food program that goes along with it through \nUSAID. The combination of the two--a year ago in Ethiopia, the same \nthing--by getting their little bodies up to where, nutritionally, they \ncan accept the HIV antiviral drugs, it has had a tremendous effect.\n  On this particular PEPFAR Program, there was much more--a school for \nthe children. The children wore uniforms. The children were learning \nscience, math, English, and all the studies that will give them some \nopportunity for a fruitful and productive life. So now, as the \nleadership of our Senate Foreign\n\n[[Page S6634]]\n\nRelations Committee has come forth with an extension and expansion of \nthis program, it is absolutely necessary that we pass it.\n  You cannot do any better than the good will--just think about the \nglobe and about where America may not be held in the highest of esteem. \nBut it is held in the highest esteem in Africa. It is in large part as \na result--\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friend to yield for a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield to the majority leader for that \npurpose.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we had a half \nhour under morning business. I told Senator Nelson he could use the \nremaining approximately 10 minutes of that time and I would be \nrecognized thereafter. Is there any concern about that? Is that still \nin effect?\n  Mr. President, it is no big deal. It might make it easier for \neverybody. I will ask unanimous consent that I be recognized when \nSenator Nelson finishes his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader, I \nwould have asked that, but this Senator thought that was locked in with \nthe previous unanimous consent. I thank the majority leader for the \nopportunity.\n  Mr. President, the United States has benefited enormously because of \nthe good will. That is one thing. But when you see these folks who have \nbeen bedeviled with this terrible, terrible infliction suddenly have a \nchance for a normal life as a result of these lifegiving drugs, when \nproperly administered, along with the food programs as well, indeed it \nis one of the least things we can do.\n  Is it not in the capacity of the United States to help the rest of \nthe world? Of course it is. Is it not within our ethos to want to help \nthe rest of the world? It certainly is. Just as a byproduct of that, \nthe people of Africa are recognizing the leadership that the United \nStates has taken. They are appreciative.\n  I must say that there was a part of this African trip that was very \ndisturbing to me, and that was the grave situation in Zimbabwe. That is \nas a result of the disastrous regime of Robert Mugabe.\n  Last Friday, a bunch of us Senators had joined Senators Feingold and \nIsakson, who are leaders on the African Affairs Subcommittee of the \nForeign Relations Committee, in introducing a resolution to rebuke \nRobert Mugabe and support U.S. efforts at the United Nations to impose \ntougher sanctions on the Mugabe regime. Although the U.S.-sponsored \nresolution failed to overcome the vetoes of China and Russia--listen to \nthat: the vetoes of China and Russia--in the Security Council on \nFriday--we kind of get an indication of where their attitude is about a \ndemocratically elected government in Zimbabwe--it is critical for us to \ncontinue to work with the U.N. and our African Union partners to help \nbring about a political solution for the desperate people in Zimbabwe.\n  On this most recent trip, I didn't go to Zimbabwe. I wasn't welcome. \nIt was a striking survey of the governments that I saw in those four \ncountries, a new African leadership, strong economic growth, the rule \nof law, political stability--what a contrast with the old ways of \ndealing with people such as Mugabe, in a government that is marked with \nautocracy, corruption, and the rule of law through the barrel of a gun. \nWell, what is clearly in the interest of the people of Zimbabwe and the \nrest of the world is stability in Zimbabwe. And it is important that we \ncontinue to press forward.\n  In east Africa, the rule of law does have some new applications--for \nexample, the Government of Kenya. There, the whole place was being torn \napart because of a dispute in the December election. Finally, after \nmuch violence and with as many as 5,000 deaths--if you can believe it--\nbecause of the violence following the election, the business community, \nthe government community, and the two opposition parties came together \nand said: We have to have a better way. They formed this unity \ngovernment. Thus far, it has worked. Let's see how it continues.\n  But in the aftermath of September 11, we know all too well how \ninstability and weak governance and corruption can sow the seeds of \nradicalization and terrorism. Now, however destitute and downtrodden \nthe heroic people of Zimbabwe, however, those heroic people have risen \nup against Mugabe's machine at the ballot box on March 29 and they cast \ntheir votes overwhelmingly for Morgan Tsvangirai and his Movement for \nDemocratic Change. That opposition party won 48 percent of the vote \nagainst 43 percent for Mugabe.\n  But then, of course, Mugabe initiated a reign of terror and \nintimidation in the lead-up to this farce of a runoff election. His \nstate-sponsored violence against opposition members, against \nsupporters, against civilians, in an attempt to consolidate his power, \nultimately caused the opposition candidates to withdraw from the \nelection. He had to take refuge in the Dutch Embassy. This recent \nrunoff was declared neither credible nor fair by independent election \nmonitors. Mugabe was the only candidate left. He was declared the \nwinner.\n  Since the initial election back in March, the opposition party said \nthat 86 of its supporters have been killed and 200,000 of its \nsupporters forced from their homes by militias loyal to Mugabe's party.\n  If you will go back decades, Mugabe took over in a new country of \nZimbabwe when he had thrown off the colonial rule under the old \nRhodesia. Mugabe was looked upon as a freedom fighter and someone who \nwas going to bring a fresh break, a fresh government that was going to \nbe a democratic government. He has long been celebrated by his fellow \nAfrican leaders for his role as a liberation leader for Zimbabwe. In \nrecent years, Mugabe has too often been coddled as his failings have \ncome to light. Two weeks ago, unfortunately, the African Union allowed \nhim to take his seat as the head of state among the leaders in their \nannual meeting that was in Sharm el-Sheikh.\n\n  Those African Union leaders were split over how to deal with Mugabe, \nbut they allowed him to be seated. Many leaders, including South \nAfrican President Mbeki, who serves as the South African Development \nCommunity's designated mediator, have stood by as Mugabe has trampled \nhuman rights, as he has silenced the press, as he has undermined the \nrule of law, and he has run the once-thriving Zimbabwean economy into \nthe ground.\n  South Africa worked behind the scenes to sink the U.S.-sponsored \nresolution on Zimbabwe at the U.N. last week. This is quite \ndistressing, given that South Africa is where it is today because of \nthe international sanctions to end apartheid.\n  So now because of these ruinous economic policies, Zimbabwe is the \nworld's fastest shrinking economy. It has a negative GDP of minus 6 \npercent. It has skyrocketing inflation. Zimbabwe's central bank stopped \nposting inflation figures in January when inflation stood at, \nunbelievably, over 100,000 percent. A loaf of bread cost 30 billion \nZimbabwean dollars--a loaf of bread.\n  The sinking economy and the government-orchestrated political \nintimidation and murder has caused a massive refugee flight into the \nneighboring countries. According to a recent report by Human Rights \nWatch, there is now estimated to be 1.5 million Zimbabweans who have \nfled across the border into South Africa.\n  The international community must honor the courage of the Zimbabwean \npeople and help them take back their country from the brink of ruin.\n  Recent reports show that a Chinese ship loaded with more than 1 \nmillion pounds of arms bound for Zimbabwe was eventually turned away by \nthe dock workers in Durban, South Africa, a reminder of the support \nMugabe continues to receive from around the world.\n  The United States is going to have to continue to work in the U.N. \nand with the African Union to immediately call for Robert Mugabe to \nstep down and to push for a number of practical solutions for the \ncrisis in Zimbabwe.\n  First is an international arms embargo and stricter sanctions. \nAlthough our backed resolution in the United Nations last Friday \nfailed, we must continue to work on an international framework to \nimpose sanctions on international arms, travel, and an asset embargo. \nWe have to get Mugabe\n\n[[Page S6635]]\n\nto understand that his totalitarian, dictatorial ways have to change.\n  Then we need to press for any new power sharing arrangement. Any new \nmediation must secure agreement with the opposition, with Tsvangirai in \nthe lead, and provide support in setting up new institutions. We can \nassist the transitional government by helping to provide a framework \nfor future elections and reforms.\n  We need to help them economically. The African Union, led by \nZimbabwe's largest trading partners, including South Africa, Zambia, \nCongo, and Botswana, should put together a package of aid and \nreconstruction funding to help the ravaged people of Zimbabwe stand on \ntheir feet. The United States and Europe can play a leading role in \nbacking that effort with the support that we are so generously quick to \noffer.\n  The situation in Zimbabwe is dire, and the United States must take \nthe lead in rebuking Robert Mugabe in calling for a new dawn for \nZimbabwe.\n  It is a time in which when you see the success, the beginnings of \npolitical stability, the beginnings of economic blossoming in countries \nsuch as Kenya and Tanzania and Uganda and Rwanda, we know the same \nthing can be done in a place such as Zimbabwe.\n  Just think, in those last two countries I mentioned, Uganda and \nRwanda, look from where they have come. It was not too many years ago \nthat there was a brutal dictator named Idi Amin. A lot of people have \nseen the movie ``The Last King of Scotland,'' which tells about the \nbrutality of that regime. But as soon as Idi Amin was gone, the former \nPresident came in again and became almost as bad, Obote. It wasn't \nuntil another strong man, a general named Museveni, came on that he has \nbrought stability for the last couple of decades.\n  Look at the country immediately to the south of Uganda. Look at \nRwanda. Look at what has happened to Rwanda, a country, just 14 years \nago, in 1994, because there was the hatred between the two tribes, the \nHutus and the Tutsis--the Hutus were in charge of the government. They \nallowed the militias, the gangs, the thugs to reign and use as an \nexcuse the downing of the President's airplane, and they unleashed a \nreign of terror that was nothing short of mass slaughter, genocide, of \nwhich, unbelievably, within 100 days, 1 million people were slaughtered \nand hacked to death by machetes. That was 14 years ago.\n  The general who took over and is now the President of Rwanda, the \nopposite tribe, a Tutsi, said: We are not going the same way. We are \nnot going to take revenge.\n  You can imagine when his army came in and invaded the capital city of \nRwanda and they saw bodies strewn all over the streets rotting, corpses \nthat dogs were eating the flesh, and when his soldiers found out that \ntheir entire families had been wiped out, hacked to death with \nmachetes, you can imagine the problem of discipline that general, now \nthe new President of Rwanda, had in trying to exert discipline.\n  The President told me in our meeting that was a very difficult time \nbecause a soldier would go to his home and find his entire family \nslaughtered, and he felt that he would have to take the revenge into \nhis own hands, despite the order that the general had given him. The \ngeneral, the new President, then would have that soldier arrested, even \nthough you can understand the feeling of outrage of seeing 50 members \nof his family slaughtered.\n  The President told me also the story about the notes that he would \nget from members of his army that said: Mr. President, it is not going \nto please you because you have given orders to the contrary, but I \ncould not stand by and see these people who have slaughtered my family \nget away with it. And then that soldier would take the revenge and that \nsoldier would then turn the gun on his own self and commit suicide.\n  But the general's orders took hold. He established a government. It \nwas a government where they would go through under Rwandan law and try \nthose people. They would try to bring about reconciliation. And 14 \nyears later, after 1 million people were slaughtered in a 100-day \nperiod, Rwanda is on its way back with some stability, some economic \npromise, and some economic progress.\n  This is what can happen in Africa, and this is what needs to happen \nin Zimbabwe. Soon there are going to be elections in South Africa \nbringing in a new President. If present President Mbeki will not move, \nsince they are the biggest influence on Zimbabwe because of their trade \nrelationship, if he will not move, then there is another election in \nSouth Africa that will elect a new leader, and maybe that new leader \nwill move to bring sanctions on Zimbabwe so that, once again, the \npromise of Africa will become realized, as so many countries in Africa \ntoday are realizing.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask I be allowed to speak in morning business for 30 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to speak about the bill which we had \nhoped to have taken up by now, the PEPFAR Reauthorization Act. Because \nof some procedural questions, we are not on the bill right now, but I \nthought I would utilize this time to make some remarks about the bill \nwhich I hope we will be able to begin dealing with in the not too \ndistant future.\n  This bill is called PEPFAR, as I said, but that stands for the \nPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. It is a program that \nPresident Bush brought to the Congress in 2003 and was enacted. It \nauthorized $15 billion over a 5-year period for the purpose primarily \nof supporting the treatment of AIDS in Africa and elsewhere.\n  Between 2004 and 2008, according to the Bush administration, PEPFAR \nhas supported a cure for about 10 million people infected by HIV/AIDS, \nincluding children orphaned by AIDS. It prevented 7 million new HIV \ninfections. It supported efforts to provide support to another 2 \nmillion HIV-infected people.\n  As a result, I think when the President indicated in his State of the \nUnion speech that he wanted to reauthorize the program, most of us in \nthe Congress, in the House and in the Senate, were supportive of that. \nI supported the initial legislation and fully intended to support the \nreauthorization.\n  There is one little catch. When the President made his announcement, \nhe offered to double the amount of the authorization from $15 billion \nto $30 billion. I swallowed rather hard because doubling the amount is \na big change in the amount of money available, but I assumed I would be \nable to support the reauthorization of the bill. However, when the bill \nwas written in the House of Representatives and then sent over to the \nSenate, two things happened. First, one of the things that made the \nlegislation effective in the first place was that we had several \nconditions attached to it as to how the money would be spent. We were \nvery careful to ensure that the money was spent appropriately. That is \none of the reasons it has been effective.\n  And, secondly, when the bill was written in the House of \nRepresentatives, lo and behold, it was not doubled from $15 to $30 \nbillion, it was more than tripled to $50 billion.\n  Now, there was not anything magical about $50 billion; it seemed like \na nice, round, symbolic number. As a result, several of us at that \npoint said: Wait a minute. That is a lot of money. In Washington when a \nprogram doubles, that is something. When it more than triples, it bears \nsome looking into.\n  Because of many of the problems with the substance of the bill, as \nwell as this tripling of the amount from $15 to $50 billion, several of \nus began to take a harder look at it. Then, as the gas crisis hit, the \nhousing crisis hit, and we find that more and more Americans are \nfeeling the real pinch of a downturn in our economy, the question began \nto solidify: Should America be committing to spend $50 billion on this \nprogram, which at $15 billion was quite successful, without at least \nconsidering whether we can reduce the amount and certainly taking a \nlook at the substantive provisions of it to see if it can get back to \nthe original purpose rather\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\nthan some of the expanded purposes under the House bill.\n  That is why several of us said, when the bill came through the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee: We object to simply passing the bill out \nof the Senate without any opportunity to amend it, certainly without \nany opportunity to reduce the amount of it and without an opportunity \nto fix it. I know some of us were criticized. But I would hope that \nwhen we talk about some of the changes that have already been agreed \nto, those who were critical of us who said: No, we are not going to \nautomatically pass it, would at least acknowledge there have been \nnumerous improvements in the bill because of the negotiation process \nwhich ensued.\n  I wish to particularly thank Senators Coburn, Burr, and Enzi for \nworking on several provisions of the bill and, frankly, restoring the \noriginal purpose of PEPFAR in the process. They did a good job. Let me \nnote two or three of the areas with which I think they did a good job. \nOne key to PEPFAR working in the first place was that at least 55 \npercent of the funding had to go directly to the treatment of AIDS \npatients. That was a good thing. Once the House said: No, we can spend \nthis money on other things, too, you could see the same kind of \nproblems with some other foreign aid bills, where money is going to \ngovernments or NGOs and you never see it again.\n  As a result, what Senators Coburn, Burr, and Enzi did was say: Look, \nwe need to get back to the proposition that at least half the bilateral \nAIDS funding is spent on treatment, for treatment for HIV/AIDS. That, \nin fact, was agreed to. But I would note, again, that the original \nHouse and Senate bills proposed simply eliminating that treatment \nfloor.\n  Another thing they negotiated was to strengthen the protection of \nfunding for abstinence and fidelity programs, clarifying that 50 \npercent of any funding had to go to those kinds of programs. I would \nnote, again, that the original House and Senate bills eliminated the \nrequirement in the previous law that a third of the prevention funds \nwould go to abstinence education.\n  Another thing that they did to make the bill better was to protect \nfaith-based groups and others from discrimination in all funding. \nAgain, the House and Senate bills had very weak conscience clauses, so-\ncalled conscience clause provisions. This was, again, an improvement of \nthe bill which would not have occurred if we had simply agreed to the \nunanimous consent that we pass the bill that had been posed earlier and \nthat some of us had objected to.\n  To some extent, it strengthens the Global Fund transparency and \naccountability. This is an area that needs additional strengthening. \nBut there is a part of this bill that is not the bilateral U.S. money, \nit goes into this big Global Fund. And the Global Fund is not well \nmonitored. It is very possible for our funding to be wasted as a part \nof that.\n  Again, there was nothing in the original House and Senate bills on \nthis and they at least got some strengthening of the Global Fund \ntransparency and accountability provisions.\n  Another provision was to protect AIDS patients from substandard \nmedicine, which again was not in the original language. There were \nother things. My point is that when those of us objected originally to \npassing the bill as it came out of the House, we were criticized: Well, \nthis is a perfect bill, we were told. It turns out it was not so \nperfect after all.\n  That is point No. 1. Point No. 2, there are some additional things \nwhich should be done to the substance of the bill. Point No. 3 deals \nwith the amount of money that is being spent.\n  Here are some of the remaining areas that are problematic: The bill \nwould not prohibit funding for countries such as China, Russia, and \nIndia, countries that are quite wealthy, that have their own nuclear \nweapons and space exploration programs. Russia is awash in \npetrodollars. China has hundreds of billions of dollars in its foreign \ncurrency reserve, has an exploding military budget, and so on. So, \ncertainly, we ought to limit the funding of the bill to countries that \nactually need the money.\n  Secondly, it adds a variety of lower priority programs to spend the \nextra money above the $15 billion, including--well, I am not going to \nmention all of these, but educating males about the dangers of visiting \nprostitutes. That is a fine thing, but is that a priority that we need \nto spend this money on? Addressing the inheritance rights of women and \norphans. There is money in here for legal aid and the like, legal aid \nservices.\n  There is mission creep in the new legislation. It calls for PEPFAR \ndollars to support nutrition programs, drinking water and sanitation \nand income-generation activities and livelihood activities--legal \nservices, as I said.\n  All of these might be fine, but this is not the PEPFAR program, this \nis foreign aid. There are not any kind of constraints on this mission \ncreep that ought to be in existence if we are going to authorize this \nkind of money for it.\n  The bill diverts funding from AIDS treatment for other purposes. I \nmentioned legal services and substance abuse and so on. It doubles the \nfunding for the U.N.-affiliated Global Fund, which disregards U.S. \npolicies on positions such as abortion and needle exchange and has been \nlinked to funding for corrupt and criminal regimes.\n  It strikes current law regarding the inadmissibility into the United \nStates of HIV-positive aliens. It calls for a strategy and objective \nover the next 5 years with these funds to train and hire 140,000 new \nnurses and other health care professionals in these countries.\n  This at a time when the United States is drastically in need of \nhealth care professionals and nurses. We are wealthy and can afford to \nbe a very generous country, but we also have needs in this country. I \nmentioned the water development projects and so on. I happen to be \nfamiliar, and Senator Thune has offered an amendment on this, with the \nneeds in the United States of America for water development in our \nNative American communities, on Indian reservations.\n  There is a study out right now that demonstrates the need that many, \nthousands of our Native Americans have to rely on water being hauled to \ntheir communities, which they then take to their individual hogans or \nresidences. We need water development right here in the United States \nfor American citizens, and I might add to whom we have a trust \nresponsibility, at least as a priority before we send money abroad for \nfolks who do not fall into that same category.\n  The final point I wished to make is that this legislation, at $50 \nbillion of authorization, is more than we can afford. The Congressional \nBudget Office, in fact, says that if it is authorized at $50 billion, \nwe cannot efficaciously spend more than about $34 billion. In other \nwords, it is very hard to spend that much money, at least to do so \nwithout a lot of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  As a result, even the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan \nentity that we ask for advice on such things, said we could not spend \nmore than $34 billion in that event. As I said, $50 billion is the \namount of the authorization here.\n\n  To put it in perspective, what is $50 billion? What could we spend \n$50 billion on? We passed a new GI bill. It could pay for the GI bill \ntwice. It could pay for the Apollo Program to land a man on the Moon \ntwice. It could pay for about half the entire interstate defense \nhighway system. It could pay the pensions of our military veterans for \nover a year. Now, $50 billion is a lot of money. As I said, I do not \nknow of anybody who would not be willing, especially if we are able to \nclean up some of the other language in the bill, to authorize it at $15 \nbillion, maybe to even double it to $30 billion, but $50 billion?\n  I note President Bush has, at least in more recent months, begun to \nfocus on the wasteful Washington spending, the programs he believes \nspend too much money, and to put some fiscal discipline on the \nCongress. In fact, since the Democratic Party takeover of the Congress, \nthe President has threatened to veto more than 25 authorization and \nappropriations bills. This amounts to about $188 billion in spending \nbecause of his view that this is excessive beyond what the American \ntaxpayer can be burdened with.\n  I will note a couple of those. But it illustrates where the President \nhas been willing to say: I am going to veto a bill. That is his \nultimate authority here. In the case of the Labor-HHS 2008 \nAppropriations Act, the President\n\n[[Page S6637]]\n\nwould have vetoed the bill by exceeding his request by $9 billion. Now, \nthis is $35 billion more than the previous funding, $20 billion more \nthan the President announced in his State of the Union speech that he \nwould be willing to reauthorize the bill at.\n  He would have vetoed $2.3 billion beyond the budget in the Commerce \nState and Justice Appropriations Act in 2008; $2.2 billion in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Appropriations Act.\n  Then, for some authorizations--because this is an authorization, not \nan appropriation--the Water Quality Financing Act, H.R. 720, which \nauthorizes Federal spending for State clean water revolving funds, that \nbill would have been vetoed for providing $14 billion in excess above \nthe current $5.6 billion authorization.\n  I know many of my colleagues have said a $50 billion authorization \nfor PEPFAR is not a big deal because it is only an authorization, not \nan appropriation. But that certainly was not the position of the \nadministration when it threatened to veto this bill that was over $14 \nbillion more than what the President wanted, or H.R. 1495, the Water \nResources Development Act, which authorized water infrastructure \nprojects. That bill was vetoed for going about $7 billion over what the \nPresident had authorized or had budgeted.\n  So it is kind of difficult to understand how the administration or my \ncolleagues can support more than tripling a foreign aid program by \nspending $50 billion on PEPFAR when the administration was so keen, and \nI believe correctly so, to finally put the stake down in the ground and \nsay: I am going to veto legislation that is $2 billion or $3 billion or \n$7 billion over what it should be, including authorizations.\n  As I said before, we are very wealthy and therefore should be and can \nbe a very generous country. But we also have to establish our \npriorities. Changing this legislation and tripling the money is not \nnecessarily going to make it triply effective. In fact, if anything, as \nI said, I think it is going to make it less effective.\n  I make this point: We have now an American economy which is \nstruggling and American families who are struggling with their budgets. \nThey do not need additional liabilities, either in terms of taxes or \nmore debt, which they and their children and grandchildren are going to \nhave to pay. Someone has to pay for the $50 billion. I do not know \nwhere the money is going to come from. Are we going to take it from \nother spending? Not likely. Are we going to increase taxes to pay for \nit? Quite conceivably. Or are we going to add it to the deficit? That \nis the only other choice.\n  So $50 billion does not grow on trees. It is very easy to be generous \nwith other people's money. But we are talking about the taxpayers' \nmoney. I think, when we are taking about taxpayer money, we need to be \ngood stewards of it. More than tripling a program to get it up to $50 \nbillion in foreign aid is more than I think most Americans--if you put \nthe question to them and said: Is this what you want to do with $50 \nbillion of your money, I would bet you the vast majority of Americans \nwould say: Look, we are willing to be generous, provide something for \nthat program but not $50 billion.\n  That brings me to my final point. In prioritizing, and that is what \nCongress needs to do, prioritizing what we spend our money on, we have \nto look at our domestic needs as well. I have supported some increases \nin funding for years on programs that I think are very important. The \nanswer has always been: Well, there is not enough money. We would love \nto help you out, Senator Kyl, but there is not enough money. OK. Now we \nhave gone from $15 billion to $50 billion that we are ready to spend on \nPEPFAR.\n  So, clearly, the majority around here has decided, along with the \nadministration, that we can afford to spend $50 billion on something. \nMy approach would be to say: OK, if we have decided we can afford to \nspend $50 billion, why don't we only spend part of that on PEPFAR, and \nwhy don't we spend part of it on America for what we know are top \npriorities?\n  We have already decided we can afford to spend $50 billion. How about \nsome priority for American spending as well? I can think of a lot of \nthings that almost all of us would agree upon as good projects for \nspending some of this money.\n  I mentioned before the fact that the U.S. Government has a trust \nresponsibility to Native Americans in this country. We have an \nobligation to help them pay for what is important to them. Health care. \nWe passed an Indian health care bill. So I asked: Are there additional \nhealth care needs? Well, mostly they were taken care of thanks to \nSenators Murkowski and Dorgan in the Indian health bill, which I was \nhappy to support.\n  There are two other needs on Indian reservations that are drastic, \nemergencies, and an embarrassment in that we in the Congress are not \nable to meet these requirements for the Native American population. Yet \nwe are willing to spend $50 billion on this foreign aid program. This \ntrust responsibility includes public safety and drinking water. There \nare Federal Government reports that identify needs in both of these \nareas. As a result, Senator Thune and I have an amendment which would \ndesignate $2 billion--$1 billion for public safety, $1 billion for \ndrinking water--for Indians on reservations. Is that too much to ask, \nout of $50 billion, that we take $2 billion and authorize programs for \npublic safety and water development on Indian reservations? To me, this \nwould be a better prioritization of funding.\n  I mentioned reports. There is a 2004 report by the Department of \nInterior inspector general. Here is what it says in part: That some \nIndian detention facilities were egregiously unsafe, unsanitary, and a \nhazard to both inmates and staff. BIA's detention program is riddled \nwith problems and is a national disgrace. A recent 2008 Department of \nInterior study, called the Shubnum report, confirms that tribal jails \nare still grossly inefficient and says:\n\n       [O]nly half of the offenders are being incarcerated who \n     should be incarcerated, the remaining are released through a \n     variety of informal practices due to severe overcrowding in \n     existing detention facilities.\n       Life and safety of officers and inmates are at risk for \n     lack of adequate Justice Facilities and programs in Indian \n     Country.\n\n  It goes on to recommend that we construct or rehabilitate 263 \ndetention facilities at a cost of about $8.4 billion over the next 10 \nyears. So there is a need identified for American citizens.\n  What the Thune-Kyl amendment asks is that we take a billion out of \nPEPFAR and apply it to this $8.4 billion need. I have personally \nvisited detention facilities in Arizona. I have witnessed firsthand \ntheir deplorable conditions. The Navajo Nation, to mention one, in New \nMexico, Utah, and Arizona is about the size of the State of West \nVirginia. It has a population of more than 180,000 people. In fact, it \nis over 200,000, if you count all of them. Yet a number of its \ndetention facilities have been closed for health and safety reasons. It \nhas bed space--this place, the size of West Virginia--for 59 inmates. \nThat is to serve a total of over 50,000 inmates booked in its \nfacilities in 2007. I think everyone would agree this is a deplorable \nstate of affairs. This represents only a fraction of its needs.\n  There is much more we can discuss. When people are released, it is \nimpossible to protect the people of the community.\n  Let me briefly turn to water. The managers' amendment to S. 2731 \nincludes assistance to foreign countries for safe drinking water and \nadequate sanitation. This is supposed to be an AIDS bill. Why are we \nproviding drinking water facilities abroad? I concede that they are a \ngood thing to do, and there is a need for them, but when there is a \nvery big crisis in our country, primarily involving people to whom we \nhave a trust responsibility, why aren't we prioritizing funding for \nthose projects?\n  According to the Indian Health Service, safe and adequate water \nsupplies and waste disposal facilities are lacking in approximately 11 \npercent of American Indian and Alaska Native homes compared to 1 \npercent for the U.S. general population. In some areas of Indian \ncountry the figure is as high as 35 percent. In Arizona, the Navajo \nNation estimates that approximately 30 percent of the households on the \nreservation do not have direct access to a public water system and are \nforced to haul water long distances to provide drinking water. I have \nseen it. They\n\n[[Page S6638]]\n\nhave water trucks, and they fill them at some central location. They \ncome to another central location. People drive up in their pickup \ntrucks and fill their gallon jugs and barrels, take them back to their \nhogans, and so on. That is in the United States today. If we have \ndecided that we can afford to spend $50 billion on something, starting \nwith a $15 billion AIDS program, then why not double that to $30 \nbillion, as the President originally proposed, and spend some of the \nrest of the money on American requirements?\n  This lack of a reliable potable water supply in Indian country \nresults in a high incidence of disease and infection as a result of \nwaterborne contaminants. IHS estimates that for every dollar it spends \non safe drinking water and sewage systems, it achieves a twentyfold \nreturn in terms of health benefits. The cost to provide American \nIndians and Alaska Natives with safe drinking water and adequate sewage \nis estimated to be over $2.3 billion. Delivering water to the people \nwithin the tribe would be several billion on top of that.\n  These are priorities in the United States. I wouldn't be raising it \nexcept for the fact that there seems to be an assumption that we can \nafford to spend $50 billion. My point is, if we can afford to spend $50 \nbillion, let's at least take a little bit of that money and spend it on \nAmericans.\n  In conclusion, I supported PEPFAR when it was authorized 5 years ago. \nBecause of its success, I would vote to extend the original funding \npolicy for another 5 years. I would even consider the doubling which \nthe President had asked for in his State of the Union speech. For the \nUnited States to have the resources to continue funding U.S. Government \nresponsibilities both to our citizens and to be generous with others \naround the globe, we need a strong economy that creates wealth. I can \nthink of a lot of things we could do with part of this $50 billion to \nimprove our economy so that we will be better able to help others in \nthe future. I have discussed some of them. I will continue to work to \nimprove this bill. It will take some time in this body, but I think it \nis worth moving forward.\n  I hope we will be able to move forward on the 10 amendments we have \nagreed to. I won't describe all of the amendments. They have been \ndescribed. One of them I have mentioned Senator Thune and I will offer. \nI hope we will have a process by which we consider these things; that \nmy colleagues will be open to their adoption, and at the end of the \nday, when we do pass a PEPFAR bill, it will be a bill we can all be \nproud of that will meet the purposes of the original legislation, that \nwill not waste American taxpayer dollars, and that will prioritize \nAmerican needs as well as those with respect to foreign aid programs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the Senator \nfrom Arizona. I don't quarrel with his premise that we need to spend a \nlot more money when it comes to Native Americans. Senator Byron Dorgan \ntried valiantly for months to bring Indian health care to the floor. He \nran into a lot of obstacles. I think all of us believe when it comes to \nNative Americans, there is a lot more we need to do. But it strikes me \nas fundamentally unfair to argue that money should be taken from \nfighting a global epidemic of HIV/AIDS, the problem of tuberculosis and \nmalaria, and divert that money and put it into help for Native \nAmericans.\n  Has America reached that point? Is that what the choices have come \nto, that we cannot join the world in trying to stop this global AIDS \nepidemic to the extent we know is necessary?\n  If there is anyone who believes that the $50 billion over 5 years \nsuggested in this bill is adequate to the challenge, they haven't sat \ndown to take an honest look. This is indeed a global epidemic. There \nare parts of this bill that have been criticized by some. I would like \nto address one of them. It is the argument that somehow we have gone \nadrift. We are no longer talking about prevention and medication, but \nwe are talking about unrelated elements. One criticism is that this \nbill addresses the global AIDS epidemic in terms of food and water. I \ncan tell you point blank that the best medicine in the world is no help \nto a person who is suffering from malnutrition or a person whose water \nsupply is contaminated, making them sick when they take the expensive \ndrugs.\n  I have seen it in Africa, where people receiving the antiretroviral \nmedications are wasting away because of malnutrition. We can't save \ntheir lives from starvation simply by stopping the onset of HIV \ninfection. So we need, if we are going to do this honestly, to take a \nserious and comprehensive look at the challenge.\n  This is a rarity in a way, that the Members on the Democratic side \nand the overwhelming majority on the Republican side are of one mind. \nWe support the President. The President was right when he initiated the \nPEPFAR Program to deal with global AIDS and the global fight to address \nthose countries that are not part of PEPFAR. But we need to come \ntogether now and try to pass this bill for the President and, more \nimportantly, for those who are the victims of this global epidemic.\n  I will be the first in line when Senator Kyl offers his amendment to \nhelp those Native Americans who are being shortchanged and deprived \nbecause of our inadequate funding. But at the risk of being slightly \npolitical for a moment, were we not fighting a war in Iraq that costs \n$10 billion to $15 billion a month, there would be a lot more to spend \nin America. That war, which is now in its sixth year, with no end in \nsight, has drained our Treasury of over $700 billion that could have \nbeen spent for curing diseases, dealing with Native Americans in the \nUnited States, expanding education, expanding health care and clinics \nin our own country, more medical research. Instead, we have been \nshoveling this money as fast as we can out of our Treasury into Iraq \nand making it part of our permanent national deficit. That is the \nreality of what we face.\n  It is hard to imagine that Iraq, an oil-rich country, one of the \nrichest in the world with oil, is still waiting on U.S. taxpayers to \nspend more money to help them out of the current problems they face. It \nis time for the Iraqis to step up and defend their own country, govern \ntheir own country, and spend their own money on their own problems.\n  After almost 6 years, it is overdue. If they do that, there would be \na lot more money in the United States for our priorities. A strong \nAmerica begins at home. It begins by bringing this war to an end, \nbringing our combat troops home.\n  When we have suggestions from the Iraqis that it is time for America \nto leave, I think we ought to take them. We ought to start bringing our \nbrave men and women, who have risked their lives, home to the hero's \nwelcome they deserve. Waiting for another 10, 20, 50, or 100 years, as \nsome have suggested, is ludicrous. The United States cannot afford it, \nand it is no favor to Iraq to create that kind of long-term dependency.\n  I sincerely hope we can resolve this. I hope we can pass the \nPresident's bill. I support it. I hope there is adequate bipartisan \nsupport. Then when Senator Kyl and others come forward and ask us to \nfind money to help Native Americans, they can count on many of us on \nthe Democratic side.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the assistant minority leader yield for one quick \npoint?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of course.\n  Mr. KYL. Having mentioned my name and alluded to the fact that we had \na hard time getting the Indian health bill to the floor, I hope my \ncolleague would acknowledge the fact that one of the people central in \ngetting that bill to the floor and getting it passed was the Senator \nfrom Arizona. It was because of my strong commitment to get that done. \nI will work with anybody, not only to deal with the Indian health \nmatter but also local law enforcement and the water development \nproblems that we talked about with Native Americans. I know my \ncolleague understands that is my position.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There is no question of the Senator's sincerity. Senator \nDorgan tried to lead the fight on this side, and Senator Kyl was a \ngreat help in that regard. Let the record be clear. If there is to be \nfuture help for Indian Health Services and other Native American needs, \nI am certain the Senator from Arizona will be part of that effort.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S6639]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak in morning business for approximately 10 to 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have supporting material related to \nPEPFAR that I will ask to be printed in the Record, which I will \ndeliver to the desk.\n  PEPFAR's unique contribution has been treatment. By any measure, \nPEPFAR has been a success. We have helped almost 2 million people with \nAIDS live longer. We have prevented millions of new infections. We have \ncared for millions of people more. And we have prevented hundreds of \nthousands of babies--newborn children--who were born to infected moms \nfrom being infected with the HIV virus.\n  PEPFAR was different from all our previous efforts precisely because \nwe treated it like a disease rather than a development problem. We ran \nit like a medical program and not a foreign aid poverty program. Rather \nthan funding the usual beltway contractors who like to write reports, \ngive advice, and convene meetings, we put pills in the hands of \ndoctors, nurses, and a legion of community-based health care workers \nriding out to the bush on mopeds with medicine in their backpacks. We \ntreated people with HIV like patients we can save instead of victims. \nAnd we told them the truth about where HIV comes from.\n  If you go to Nairobi or Soweto or Kampala and ask people what PEPFAR \nis about, they will tell you it is about treatment. Have we spent \nbillions on prevention? Yes. But ask anyone in Africa what PEPFAR is, \nand they will say: It is about HIV and AIDS treatment. It was AIDS \ntreatment that was the innovation of PEPFAR. We had been funding \nprevention messages long before we had PEPFAR, although certainly not \nto the extent as we did after PEPFAR started. But what was new, what \nwas miraculous, what rocked Africa, was the medical treatment.\n  And it has worked. It was not easy. With a tiny staff, the AIDS \ncoordinator achieved the impossible--what many had said could not be \ndone--bringing high-tech medical innovation to the lowest tech settings \non Earth. It is still just as hard today as it was then, especially as \nwe start in new countries.\n  The path of least resistance is always the status quo: contractors \nand ``social marketing'' and reports and ``technical assistance'' and \n``capacity building'' and meetings. Without statutory mandates, that \npath will always look more appealing to people who have been asked to \ndo the impossible. That is why PEPFAR reauthorization could not retreat \non its mandated treatment priority.\n  Take it out of the law, and despite all the rhetoric and good \nintentions, it will always be easier to fund something else. Maybe \ntreatment would not have been eliminated, but it would have taken a \nback street, maybe by small cuts, by not building new clinics in the \nharder places, by letting the shortage of doctors become an excuse to \nnot get creative. The commitment to treatment would have eroded over \ntime, and before we knew it, PEPFAR would have become just another \nfailing foreign aid program like so many others.\n  It does not matter what people say their intentions are, because \npeople come and go and promises are hard to keep. What matters is what \nthe law requires, and so it is encouraging to be able to assure the \nAmerican people today that PEPFAR's unique innovation--cutting-edge \nHIV/AIDS medical care--has been preserved in this bill.\n  For that, there are a lot of people to thank, starting first with the \nPresident and his staff, who first reached out to try to broker this \ncritical compromise. Of course, the bill managers, Chairman Biden and \nSenator Lugar, and their staff were patient, constructive, and deserve \nall the thanks in the world. They were quick, thorough, honest, and at \nall times operated in good faith. Senators Enzi and Burr and their \nstaff were incredible to work with, and their commitment to this cause \nis commendable.\n  The compromise language has a number of critical features that make \nit worthy of passage.\n  First and most important, the compromise restores the critical focus \nof PEPFAR on medical treatment. The House bill eliminated the provision \nin current law that required that 55 percent of all funding go to \n``therapeutic medical care'' of people with HIV. The managers' \nsubstitute preserves this focus by requiring that ``more than half'' of \nthe money goes to that medical care. This time, the law will also \nclarify what was meant by ``therapeutic medical care,'' so that there \nis no longer any confusion that this treatment money can be spent on \nARV--antiretroviral--treatment, care for opportunistic infections, and \nmedical monitoring of folks who do not yet need antiretroviral therapy.\n  Prioritizing treatment is not a radical policy. It is the same policy \nwe have right here in the United States. In this country, this year, we \nare spending 63 percent of all domestic AIDS funding on treatment and \n14 percent on prevention. Prevention is cheap, so you can still make \nprevention a big priority without spending nearly the money necessary \nfor treatment.\n  The substitute also restores an ambitious target linked to funding. \nThe original law had the 55-percent allocation, but it also had an \nambitious target of treating 2 million people with antiretroviral \ndrugs. The House-passed reauthorization only targeted 3 million people \non treatment--a pretty underwhelming figure that meant adding only 1 \nmillion people on PEPFAR treatment rolls. That 1 million would have \nbeen a 50-percent increase in results, while funding was more than \ntripling in the bill.\n  Some have argued that this funding includes a lot of other things \nbesides AIDS and so you cannot make that comparison. That is just not \ntrue. The original bill included malaria, it included TB, and it \nincluded the Global Fund. So it is an apples-to-apples comparison to \nsay that the funding for AIDS, TB, malaria, and the Global Fund was $15 \nbillion the first time this bill was authorized and that then, in this \nbill, $50 billion is authorized for those same things at this time.\n  That is a tremendous amount of money, and the targets for what we \nexpect to achieve with that money must go up at the same rate the \nfunding goes up. The compromise language appropriately links the target \nnumber to appropriations. As the funding goes up from the current \nfunding level, the treatment target has to go up by the same percentage \nabove the current goal of 2 million people. That means that if all the \nmoney authorized in this bill is appropriated, the number of people \ntreated will exceed more than 5 million. Those extra millions of lives \nsaved are a major accomplishment of the Senate bill. Those are lives. \nThose are individuals who would otherwise succumb to HIV.\n  However, the formula does not end there. Treatment costs per patient \nright now are fairly high--anywhere from $800 to $1,000 per patient. \nSome drugs are as low as $80 or at most around $200 per person, so we \nare talking 80 percent of the treatment costs that are not being spent \non direct medical care now. That 80 percent represents overhead and \ninfrastructure which should be reduced over time as the efficiencies \nare built in and clinics are expanded.\n  To account for that, the compromise language also requires that the \ntarget number for treatment increases by the same percent that cost-\nper-patient decreases over time. This ensures that the cost savings are \nreinvested right back into treatment rather than diverted to other \nactivities.\n  Another key element of the compromise is the protection of PEPFAR \npatients from substandard medicines. From the earliest days of PEPFAR, \nthere were some calling for the United States to buy cheap, copycat \ndrugs for PEPFAR patients, including drugs that were not approved by \nthe FDA or any other rigorous regulatory body of any country. These are \ndrugs we would never treat our domestic patients with here in the \nUnited States. This is no abstract threat. Today, under the Orwellian \nnamed ``quality assurance'' process at the Global Fund, American \ndollars may be used to purchase drugs that have met no standard except \nthat they have been put on an application for a WHO prequalification.\n\n[[Page S6640]]\n\n  When this conflict arose shortly after PEPFAR was first authorized, \nthe President rightly insisted that we would not treat the African AIDS \npatients like lab rats or guinea pigs. We would treat them with the \nsame standards we treat American patients: They would only receive \ndrugs with FDA approval or equivalent. To help expedite the approval of \nsome international products that were likely safe and effective but had \nnot been through the FDA process, the President established an \nemergency review process to speed up approval while still ensuring that \nPEPFAR patients get the same standard of care we expect for our \ndomestic patients. Since then, others have generally agreed that all \nappropriate safe and effective drugs make it through this new process \nwith proper and direct speed.\n  In direct contradiction of this more moral approach, the House bill \ntook bilateral PEPFAR programs down the same scary path that the Global \nFund has gone. It required that PEPFAR purchase the cheapest drugs \navailable on the world market, without requiring any standard of safety \nand efficacy. Under such a provision, African patients would have been \ntreated worse than lab rats--receiving drugs that the United States \nwould never use for its patients, never purchase through Medicaid, \nMedicare, or the Ryan White Care Act.\n  The bill managers are to be commended for modifying this provision in \ntheir substitute to require that drugs purchased by PEPFAR have FDA \napproval or its equivalent in other developed countries. We can all \nbreathe a little easier as we seek to put 5 million people on ARVs. We \nwant those 5 million people to thrive as long as possible on first-line \ndrugs before they experience a treatment failure. You should not be \nrelegated to unsafe drugs just because you are poor and living in \nAfrica.\n  There are quite a few other improvements in this substitute bill that \nthe managers and the President helped to broker, but I will not take \nany more time. Suffice it to say that most of my outstanding concerns \nhave been met through our negotiations, and I am confident that \nPEPFAR's success in the future is no longer in jeopardy.\n  PEPFAR was not broken. It did not need fixing. It just needed \nreauthorization. The managers' substitute does that. I am confident \nthat lives are going to be saved because of the good faith in the bill \nand of the bill managers and the President and my other colleagues who \nare associated with it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the supplementary \nmaterial I referred to printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From Good Intentions to Bad AIDS Policy: The Moral Hazards of \n                           Redesigning PEPFAR\n\n                      (By Daniel Patrick Moloney)\n\n       The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has \n     received praise from across the political spectrum, both for \n     its principles and for its successes in fighting HIV/AIDS in \n     some of the world's poorest countries. Announced by President \n     George W. Bush in the 2003 State of the Union Address, PEPFAR \n     fights HIV/AIDS primarily in countries with generalized \n     epidemics. These countries are mostly, though not \n     exclusively, in Africa.\n       PEPFAR's successful track record is a result of its focus \n     on three points:\n       Treating those infected with HIV,\n       Preventing new HIV infections, and\n       Ensuring, through bilateral programs, that assistance is in \n     accord with U.S. policy.\n       Bills under consideration in the U.S. House and Senate \n     (H.R. 5501 and S. 2731) represent significant departures from \n     the current law. These bills are hugely expensive, and would \n     take existing U.S. policy off its present, successful course.\n       Rather than simply reauthorizing PEPFAR, Congress seeks to \n     rewrite it, vastly expanding funding while removing \n     structural guidance that stipulates how it is apportioned. \n     The structure of the original PEPFAR law was essential for \n     keeping it focused on its prevention and treatment \n     objectives. The congressional bills fail to do this. Both \n     more than triple the $15 billion cost of the original \n     program, yet neither adjusts the targets of the program to \n     reflect this increase. Instead, both propose to spend tens of \n     billions of dollars on projects not directly related to the \n     fight against HIV/AIDS. This proposed spending duplicates \n     existing programs, and diverts resources into social \n     engineering projects at odds with the values of many \n     Americans.\n       To achieve PEPFAR's goal, policy must continue to be guided \n     by strong requirements that will direct funding toward \n     effective prevention and treatment strategies, rather than a \n     diffuse set of general development goals.\n       From Good Intentions to Good Policy: The Original Design of \n     PEPFAR. As proposed by President Bush in 2003, PEPFAR was \n     built around three priorities:\n       Providing medicine to treat those who have HIV/AIDS in \n     those countries where the disease affects the general \n     population,\n       Funding local programs that aim to prevent new HIV \n     infections, and\n       Providing palliative care to those suffering from HIV/AIDS, \n     including children orphaned as a result of HIV-infected \n     parents.\n       To justify its ambitious agenda and $15 billion price tag, \n     the original law used three structural features to keep the \n     program focused on its priorities: ambitious targets, \n     spending requirements, and an emphasis on bilateral \n     agreements.\n       The law set ambitious targets for the number of people in \n     its treatment, prevention, and care programs. These goals \n     were so ambitious that they could not be met were the money \n     lost to waste or corruption, or simply diverted to other \n     development activities not directly providing treatment, \n     care, or prevention of HIV/AIDS.\n       The law also provided strong guidance so that the money \n     would be spent in proportion to the law's priorities. It did \n     this in two distinct but related sections of the law. The \n     first, a ``Sense of Congress'' resolution, declared that 55 \n     percent of the funds should be spent on medicine and \n     treatment, 10 percent on orphans and children affected by \n     HIV, 20 percent on prevention programs, and 15 percent on \n     palliative care. This gave the Global AIDS Coordinator some \n     idea how to balance the competing ends of the bill. The next \n     section, which actually allocated the funds, made the first \n     two elements of this nonbinding resolution into binding \n     spending requirements. Though it did not make binding that 20 \n     percent be spent on prevention, it did require that one-third \n     of funds spent on prevention be spent on programs that \n     promote abstinence outside of marriage and fidelity within \n     it. By requiring that the money be spent according to these \n     specific percentages, rather than authorizing particular \n     dollar amounts, the law ensured that its priorities would \n     always be implemented in the same proportions, even were \n     Congress later to appropriate funds at amounts different than \n     the law had authorized.\n       The law required that PEPFAR deliver aid through bilateral \n     arrangements with each of the partner countries, rather than \n     through multilateral organizations. This procedural safeguard \n     gave the U.S. its best opportunity to make sure the funds \n     were spent on its priorities. It was consistent with the \n     President's belief that welfare and aid programs work best \n     when they support civil society, rather than supplant it with \n     an international bureaucracy.\n       The bills in the House and the Senate undermine these \n     principles. They set goals too low for their budgets, remove \n     most of the spending mandates under the guise of \n     ``flexibility,'' and add radical new agendas on which the \n     unstructured and abundant funds are to be spent.\n       Funding Should Fit Program Goals. In asking Congress to \n     reauthorize PEPFAR for the next five years, the Bush \n     Administration sought to increase the budget by 100 percent \n     to $30 billion over five years. However, the President sought \n     to increase its goals by a mere 20 percent to 70 percent \n     (depending on the criterion) over that period. Some Members \n     of Congress have complained that the Administration's goals \n     are too low to justify doubling the funding. They note that \n     the program is on track to meet its original goals of 2 \n     million treated, 7 million infections prevented, and 10 \n     million people in care, while staying close to its original \n     budget of $15 billion-$18 billion. Given such a history, the \n     Administration's moderately increased goals should require \n     only moderately increased funding, particularly now that so \n     much early infrastructure has been laid in the focus \n     countries and some efficiencies of scale may be expected.\n       The Administration defends its lower goals on the grounds \n     that they are realistic given local infrastructure. It also \n     notes that its proposed goals represent a U.S. commitment to \n     treat a number of people equal to the commitment of all other \n     aid-donor nations combined. For the U.S. to treat more would \n     not demand enough of the world community. It also \n     expresses doubts that in 2013 there will be as many people \n     to be treated in the focus countries as some of its \n     critics predict.\n       If the Administration's request is disproportionate to its \n     goals, the bills in the House and the Senate are even more \n     so. Both bills add an additional $20 billion to the \n     President's request--more than the entire first five years of \n     the program--while barely changing the Administration's \n     underwhelming new goals. The bills authorize up to $9 billion \n     to fight other diseases common in Africa (i.e., tuberculosis \n     and malaria), and they authorize billions more in \n     contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, \n     and Malaria. After taking all these into account and after \n     assuming full funding of the bills' priorities, the \n     Congressional Budget Office concluded that the bills would \n     still have at least $15 billion left over. To date, no one in \n     either chamber has adequately explained what will be done \n     with the ``extra'' billions.\n\n[[Page S6641]]\n\n       Congress could improve the fit between PEPFAR's funding and \n     its goals by making the latter more ambitious. For example, \n     Senators Tom Coburn (R-OK), Jon Kyl (R-AZ), Saxby Chambliss \n     (R-GA), and Richard Burr (R-NC) have introduced S. 2749, the \n     Save Lives First Act of 2008. This bill would set PEPFAR's \n     treatment goal at providing HIV/AIDS treatment and pre-\n     treatment medical monitoring to 7 million people, about one-\n     half of them in sub-Saharan Africa--an increase from 3 \n     million in the House and Senate bills. It would also \n     reinstitute the provision in current law allocating at least \n     55 percent of all PEPFAR funds to treatment. To treat that \n     many people is estimated to cost between $8.4 billion and \n     $11.5 billion.\n       Higher goals require more money, but the draft bills' \n     proposed goals for treatment, prevention, and care are not by \n     themselves high enough to justify even the Administration's \n     $30 billion price tag. Activities extraneous to the original \n     program are likely to make up the difference. Whether \n     Congress decides to increase PEPFAR's treatment goals along \n     the lines of the Save Lives First Act, or whether it sticks \n     with its current goals, a $50 billion budget would still \n     include extra billions likely to be spent on purposes \n     irrelevant to PEPFAR.\n       ``Flexibility'' Means Blank Check Worth Billions. The \n     original PEPFAR law contained binding requirements that 55 \n     percent of all funds be spent on medical treatment, and 10 \n     percent on orphans and vulnerable children. It further \n     required that 33 percent of the prevention funds be spent on \n     abstinence and fidelity programs. The spending restrictions \n     (except for that regarding orphans) have been criticized, \n     both by NGOs that disagree with U.S. priorities, and by \n     bureaucrats who implement the program.\n       Both the House and the Senate strip out these funding \n     requirements for prevention and treatment. (The Senate bill \n     even strips out most of the nonbinding ``Sense of Congress'' \n     resolutions of the original law.) The House bill gives the \n     Global AIDS Coordinator complete control over 55 percent of \n     the funding, and the Senate bill writes a blank check for 90 \n     percent of the funds. Beyond this, the bills provide some \n     vague guidance, but not hard requirements, on how money will \n     be spent. The Global AIDS Coordinator is left to prioritize \n     the multiple goals and agendas of the bills.\n       New Funds and Radical New Agendas. The proposed legislation \n     expands the activities eligible for PEPFAR funding well \n     beyond the scope of the original program, offering some clues \n     about how its ``extra billions'' could be spent. Some of \n     these new agendas are duplicative of other foreign aid \n     programs and are irrelevant to fighting HIV/AIDS. For \n     example, the legislation promotes micro-finance, education, \n     general health care, and food security, among other new \n     programs.\n       The bills also add a number of radical new agendas that \n     change the focus of PEPFAR, are at odds with the values of \n     many Americans, and trample on the cultural values of the \n     partner countries. For example, the bills before Congress \n     make it U.S. policy to teach safer drug-use techniques to \n     injection drug users, and safer sex techniques to \n     prostitutes, injection drug users, and men who have sex with \n     men (MSM). The original law made no special provisions for \n     outreach to these populations, reflecting the fact that \n     infections among these risk groups are marginal to the \n     generalized epidemic in subSaharan Africa, as opposed to the \n     epidemics concentrated among these groups in countries such \n     as Russia and Thailand. Where it did mention them, the \n     original law sought to eradicate prostitution and to \n     encourage injection drug users to stop, recognizing that \n     public health policy should not enable such high-risk \n     behavior but seek to end it. In a clear policy reversal, the \n     proposed legislation strips out the original commitment to \n     eradicate prostitution, and makes PEPFAR dollars available to \n     activities intended to make illicit drug use ``safer.'' Not \n     coincidentally, it also allows PEPFAR to expand to include \n     more focus countries in Europe and Asia where the epidemics \n     are concentrated among prostitutes and drug users.\n       The bills would also commit the U.S. to altering the \n     relations between men and women in developing countries to \n     reflect the values of Western gender activists. The bills \n     encourage U.S. intervention on sensitive cultural topics that \n     are not scientifically demonstrated to have direct impacts on \n     rates of HIV/AIDS morbidity or mortality, but very well might \n     offend those whom U.S. policy is designed to help. Whatever \n     merits these provisions might have as aspirations, they were \n     not in the original bill, they would do nothing to stop the \n     AIDS emergency in sub-Saharan Africa, and they would commit \n     the U.S. to agendas that are likely to be unpopular in \n     partner countries.\n       Conclusion: Compassionate Aid Is Effective Aid. The three \n     structural features of the original law--ambitious targets, \n     spending restraints, and an emphasis on bilateral \n     agreements--have helped PEPFAR stay on target. In the \n     process, the U.S. has created a strong precedent for \n     combating HIV/AIDS in poor countries with generalized \n     epidemics. PEPFAR's commitment to abstinence and fidelity \n     programs, which was and is still ridiculed by many activists \n     and others, is now recognized to have a measurable impact on \n     HIV infection rates.\n       Rather than write a blank check to an unelected \n     bureaucracy, Congress should retain firm control over PEPFAR, \n     which touches on such delicate issues as sex, marriage, and \n     the relations between men and women. Congress should insist \n     that PEP-FAR retain its focus on preventing new HIV \n     infections and treating those infected with HIV/AIDS. PEPFAR \n     should not duplicate the efforts of America's other aid \n     programs. Lawmakers should insist that the funds authorized \n     and appropriated for PEPFAR will not support activities \n     irrelevant to fighting HIV/AIDS in countries with generalized \n     epidemics. Congress should authorize funds for PEPFAR at a \n     level appropriate to its central goals. If Congress wishes to \n     fund other activities, it should do so by increasing the \n     budget for other assistance programs rather than diffusing \n     PEPFAR's focus.\n       America's PEPFAR partners are waiting on congressional \n     reauthorization before setting their own budgets, putting \n     pressure on Congress to move quickly. Hasty passage of the \n     existing House and Senate bills, however, would not allow \n     them to make their plans either, since so many funding \n     decisions would still be left to the discretion of the Global \n     AIDS Coordinator in the next administration, and subject to \n     the annual appropriations process and the lobbying of NGOs. \n     With lives at stake, strategic efficiency and effectiveness \n     are paramount. Ambitious goals, clear spending directives, \n     and a reassertion of successful U.S. policies will maintain \n     the structure and proportion that have leveraged Americas \n     generous intentions into a highly effective policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Myths v. Facts--Re: Global AIDS Legislation (PEPFAR)\n\n       Myth: ``We Can't Treat Our Way Out of This Epidemic.''\n       Fact:\n       We have to walk and chew gum--we must prevent future \n     infections but we must respond to the desperate and dying \n     TODAY.\n       Prevention efforts may prevent new infections, and \n     therefore prevent FUTURE treatment need, but prevention \n     efforts do nothing to abate the treatment need in the next 5 \n     years, which is the time period the reauthorization bills \n     address.\n       Treatment need is determined by numbers infected 5-10 years \n     ago.\n       This argument is like going into a post-Katrina New Orleans \n     and spending most of the relief funds on building better \n     levies to prevent a future disaster rather than rescuing the \n     people waving frantically on rooftops for help.\n       Obviously both need to be done, but no one would claim that \n     it was somehow more humane to focus more effort and funding \n     on the future prevention than the immediate humanitarian \n     disaster.\n       Treatment, is prevention. Treatment prevents new infections \n     several ways:\n       It requires dramatic scale-up of diagnostic screening--\n     meaning we will identify most infected people.\n       It will give us the opportunity to do education and \n     prevention messaging with the people who are transmitting HIV \n     rather than wasting money on mass media campaigns targeting \n     mostly uninfected people. Nobody ever got HIV from someone \n     who wasn't infected with HIV.\n       It identifies pregnant women with HIV so that their babies \n     can be saved from infection.\n       It lowers viral load. There are quite a few studies out now \n     showing that reduced viral load dramatically reduces the \n     transmission of the virus.\n       Myth: Flexibility--``Earmarks'' or ``Allocations'' \n     dictating how much money has to be spent on a certain \n     activity are too inflexible and don't allow countries to \n     respond to their needs appropriately.\n       Fact:\n       The allocations are not country-specific, they apply to the \n     whole pot of money. If one country needs to spend less money \n     on treatment, there are other countries where treatment is \n     particularly expensive and can use the extra.\n       Other donors such as the Global Fund can come in and fund \n     other priorities for the country--the American people are \n     committed to treatment being the priority for PEPFAR.\n       Public health has taught us how to control infectious \n     disease and it doesn't require flexibility. It requires a \n     formula--find every case, treat every case, work with every \n     case to find other cases and prevent transmission to new \n     cases. This doesn't change no matter what the circumstances \n     on the ground are.\n       This argument is disingenuous--the other side only wants to \n     eliminate the allocations that take money away from beltway \n     contractors--those for treatment and abstinence, because \n     those contractors don't do treatment or abstinence. The other \n     allocations have been left in the bill, and in fact, new ones \n     added in the House version. You can't simultaneously \n     criticize allocations but add in new ones.\n       Myth: Drug prices have gone down so we don't need to \n     reserve as much for treatment costs anymore to meet our \n     treatment targets.\n       Fact:\n       If it's now cheaper than expected to meet targets, then we \n     should raise our targets to save and treat more people. We \n     only are treating a small fraction of people in need of \n     treatment in the developing world.\n       Myth: Eliminating baby AIDS is unrealistic.\n       Fact:\n       Dramatic gains are seen when universal testing of pregnant \n     women and newborns is provided and appropriate prophylaxis of \n     infections that are identified through that testing.\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\n       In states in the U.S. that have adopted this standard of \n     care, new cases have been virtually eliminated.\n       In Botswana, a country that used to have HIV infection \n     rates as high as 50% of child-bearing-aged women, they \n     instituted these policies. Now 92% of pregnant women are \n     being tested, and the drop in HIV+ mothers delivering \n     infected babies dropped from 35% to 4% from 2004-2007, with \n     13,000 HIV-infected moms being identified annually.\n       A recent study, the largest to date, just came out with \n     findings that 99 percent of babies were born uninfected if an \n     infected mother was diagnosed and proper treatment was \n     administered.\n       However, a World Health Organization report found that \n     access to AIDS drugs is severely limited in developing \n     countries, with fewer than 10 percent of pregnant women with \n     HIV in those countries having access to medication.\n       As a result, about 1,800 babies become infected with HIV \n     each day. Prevention of mother-to-chi1d-transmission (PMTCT) \n     is cheap per life saved: Estimated cost of PMTCT drugs to \n     support treatment of (1) mother/child pair is US$167 \n     (generics) and US$318 (branded).\n       We haven't even come close to meeting the need in PEPFAR \n     focus countries.\n       Estimated 1.15 million pregnant women with HIV/AIDS living \n     in PEPFAR countries.\n       In 2006 PEPFAR proved ARV Prophylaxis to only 294,000 \n     (25.5%).\n       And now PEPFAR is expanding beyond the focus countries to \n     other countries--the need just will keep growing:\n       Estimated 2.1 million pregnant women estimated to be living \n     with HIV/AIDS in developing countries (1.7 million in sub-\n     Saharan Africa -85%).\n       Of the estimated 2.3 million (1.7-3.5 million) children \n     under the age of 15 years living with HIV, well over 90% are \n     thought to have become infected through mother-to-child \n     transmission.\n\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, in this body, both sides need to exercise \ngood faith. I appreciate very much what the distinguished Republican \nleader has been able to work out in the last couple hours. We are going \nto do our very best. This is a very difficult time we find ourselves in \nin our country. We have housing matters for which I have had three \ncalls today from the Secretary of the Treasury, and he does not call me \nvery often. It is a very serious situation we have with housing. We are \ntrying to get the House to do what we think is right for this country. \nWe know the energy issue is right for our trying to do something.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to do my very best. I have expressed to \nthe distinguished Republican leader, unless there is something I do not \nunderstand that comes up untoward, we are going to have all those 10 \namendments debated and voted upon. And I indicated to the Republican \nleader that there will be no cloture filed unless he thinks it is \nappropriate. And if he does not want his fingerprints on it, I will do \nit on my own, but he will be closely advised of anything we do in that \nregard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me just say to the majority leader, \nthis is a good way to go forward. This consent agreement was rather \npainfully achieved last week, and I am glad to hear his representation \nthat we will vote on the 10 amendments. I think all of our Members are \nmore than happy to have short time agreements, process the amendments, \nand move on.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Biden and Lugar, I \ncall up the managers' amendment, which Senator Lugar was on the floor \nwanting to do earlier today, but because of issues he was unable to do \nthat. So this is the substitute amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/14/senate-section/article/S6642-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak against this foreign \naid bill and in favor of a couple of amendments that will restore some \nintegrity to it.\n\n[[Page S6643]]\n\n  I wish to make it clear that I believe this legislation aims to do \nsomething very important. A lot of people are suffering in Africa with \nAIDS, and the President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief--or PEPFAR, as \nwe call it--is designed to provide treatment and prevention assistance \nto those in need. This is a program I voted for in 2003, and it is \nsomething I think every American would consider a worthy cause. But the \nsimple fact is, we cannot afford every worthy cause around the world. \nOur budget is broken and our Nation is headed toward financial \ncollapse. Yet this bill spends $50 billion, which is more than a 300-\npercent increase over the original $15 billion authorization. None of \nthis money is paid for. Instead, it is all borrowed money. It passes \nthe bill on to our children and grandchildren. This is not generosity; \nI am afraid it is thievery.\n  So we have conflicting goals. On one hand, we want to help people \nsuffering in Africa. On the other hand, we want to balance our budget \nand prevent people from suffering in America. As Ronald Reagan said, \n``America is a great Nation because America is a good Nation.'' \nAmericans have always prided themselves on reaching out to people in \nneed, and we should do so. However, if we bankrupt our own country, we \nwill no longer be able to extend a helping hand to others. That is why \nI am offering an amendment--this first amendment, No. 5077--to reduce \nthe spending in this bill from $50 billion to $35 billion. This would \nstill provide a more than 100 percent increase over the original \nprogram while maintaining some integrity to our budget process.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, has an amendment that would \nreauthorize the program at current levels with no increase in spending. \nThat is something I support because at a time when we need to be \ndramatically reducing the size and scope of government, just keeping \nthe program at its current spending levels is generous.\n  My amendment would allow for the program to actually grow from $15 \nbillion to $35 billion. This is still way too much money, in my \nopinion, but it would save American taxpayers $15 billion over the next \n5 years, which is no small amount of money. Besides saving Americans \nmoney, this amendment would not actually take a thing away from people \nin Africa who benefit from this program.\n  The fact is, this foreign aid program cannot spend $50 billion on its \nintended purposes. According to the Congressional Budget Office, PEPFAR \ncan only spend $35 billion over the next 5 years to meet the needs of \nthose who are suffering. Our aid workers in many African nations have \nsaid as much, and their statements are backed up by the Congressional \nBudget Office's own estimate of this budget.\n  In reality, the money that cannot be spent to directly treat and \nprevent the spread of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria will be siphoned \noff for other things authorized in this bill, none of which are \ndirectly related to the prevention or treatment of these three \ndiseases. For example, the bill authorizes the expenditure of funds to \nprovide legal services, empower women, ensure safe drinking water and \nsanitation, provide treatment for alcohol abuse, and address the \ninheritance rights of women and girls, and study transportation \npatterns, just to name a few. In addition, some of this $35 billion \nwould be siphoned off to build an even larger bureaucracy here in the \nUnited States.\n  One U.S. aid worker in Africa said:\n\n       We spend 4 months writing our Country Operation Plan only \n     to send it to Washington and have it rewritten without our \n     input.\n\n  Four months of effort for no reason certainly sounds like a waste of \neffort, and it diminishes our success.\n  Unfortunately, as we have all seen around here, the bigger the pot of \nmoney gets, the more waste and fraud we have, and accountability \ncompletely disappears. If we really care about those suffering from \nAIDS, we need to ensure that as many dollars as possible reach the \npeople who are truly in need. The measure of America's greatness is not \nfound in the amount of money we provide but in the effectiveness of our \nefforts.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment. It saves $15 \nbillion without taking anything away from people who are hurting in \nAfrica. Most importantly, it restores some honesty and integrity to \nthis bill.\n  Another problem with this bill is that it expands the scope of this \nprogram to new countries that were not part of the original program. \nThe bill explicitly adds central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin \nAmerica to the list of PEPFAR's focused countries. The bill also \ncontains vague language expanding the program to other nations.\n  This is yet another example of the dishonesty of Congress. We say \nthis bill is about addressing AIDS in Africa, but really it is about \nforeign aid all over the globe. The original program focused on \ncountries that had widespread, generalized epidemics, but this bill \nallows the program to expand to a number of new countries that have \nproblems only in limited areas. We can fix this problem with the bill \nby limiting the list of focused countries to those included in the \noriginal 2003 authorization.\n  That is what my amendment does, amendment No. 5078, and this is what \nit says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, funds \n     authorized under this Act shall be targeted only toward those \n     countries authorized for funding under the United States \n     Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of \n     2003.\n\n  So we keep the program focused on its original intent.\n  Last week, the majority leader pointed out that the purpose of this \nbill is to specifically help people in Africa. According to the \nWashington Times, he told reporters:\n\n       While we're fiddling around here on this in Washington, \n     people are dying. This is big-time stuff, this is very \n     important to one whole continent.\n\n  I agree with him, but the bill he has brought up spreads money to \nmore than three continents beyond Africa. If we are going to spend this \nkind of money, we need to be honest about what we are spending it on. \nThis bill is supposed to be about the treatment of AIDS, tuberculosis, \nand malaria in Africa. The cost of this program will only continue to \nincrease dramatically if we continue to allow funds to go to other \ncountries.\n  I have also offered a second-degree amendment to prevent American \ntaxpayers from having to support forced abortions around the world. My \namendment simply says that none of the funds in this bill may be \nawarded to any organization or program which supports or participates \nin the management of a program of coerced abortion or involuntary \nsterilization.\n  In addition to the things I described before that fall outside the \nstated purpose of the bill, the provision of funds to organizations \nthat perform and/or support coercive abortion in China is perhaps the \nworst. This not only kills innocent unborn children, it violates the \nhuman rights of women in China.\n  This bill authorizes $2 billion to the United Nations Global Fund in \n2009 and designates such funds in the following 4 years. This means \nthat over the 5-year life of the bill, the United States will likely \nprovide at least $10 billion to the United Nations Global Fund.\n  Restrictions against funding forced abortions are in the current \nPEPFAR bill, but they do not apply to the Global Fund. We know that the \nGlobal Fund has provided at least two large grants in 2004 and 2006 to \nthe various agencies within the Chinese Government, including the \nNational Population and Family Planning Commission, which runs China's \none-child-per-family program. In fact, we have here--and I wish to \nsubmit them for the record--the grants themselves which explicitly \nstate that they were made to the various agencies within the Chinese \nGovernment, including the National Population and Family Planning \nCommission. I have the number, which I would like to have printed in \nthe Record. One of these grants spent almost $59 million in 2004 and \nthe second was over $11 million in 2006.\n  It is quite clear that my concerns about how funds can be used in the \nGlobal Fund are real and serious. It is very obvious that unless we \npass this amendment to clearly prohibit funds, they can and likely will \nbe used by the Chinese agency that carries out coercive abortions.\n  Instead of working to ensure that the United Nations Global Fund does \nnot provide grants to Chinese Government agencies that force women to \nhave\n\n[[Page S6644]]\n\nabortions, the sponsors of the bill doubled the U.S. contributions to \nthe Global Fund to $2 billion.\n  The Bush administration has fought to prohibit funding to \norganizations that perform or support coercive abortions. In testimony \nbefore Congress on February 17, 2005, Secretary of State Condoleezza \nRice said:\n\n       We have been outspoken with the Chinese about this terrible \n     practice, and of course, as Secretary of State, I will \n     enforce Kemp-Kasten to make certain that we are not funding \n     anything that remotely as related to these policies.\n\n  I just do not believe that either the administration or any Member of \nthe Congress could ever argue that we should not do everything we can \nto ensure that American taxpayers' money does not go to the Chinese \nNational Population and Family Planning Commission.\n  Now, many of my colleagues may not believe this because it is so \noutrageous, but it is true. Many outside groups supporting this bill \ndon't want anyone to know about it because they don't believe we should \ndo anything that restricts abortions--even those performed against the \nwill of the mother. Even some people who oppose spending money on \ncoercive abortions have been convinced to look the other way because \nthey want this bill to pass. We cannot turn a blind eye to this problem \nwith the bill.\n  My amendment is germane, it is allowable under the unanimous consent \nagreement, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support it. We need \nto make absolutely certain that American families are not giving their \nhard-earned tax dollars to organizations that force women in China and \naround the world to have abortions.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support these amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I saw the majority leader. I wonder if \nhe needs time to speak or wrap up. I will be glad to forego if he wants \nto do that. I will speak for 10 or 15 minutes as in morning business, \nbut I will be glad to wait for the majority leader to see if he wishes \nto speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                             JOHN WHITEHEAD\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, sometimes American lives are lived so \neloquently that nothing needs to be written about them. Sometimes even \neloquent lives can be eloquently written about. Such was the case over \nthe Fourth of July weekend. When I had a little extra time, I came \nacross Peggy Noonan's article in the Wall Street Journal on July 5 \nabout John Whitehead of New York.\n  John Whitehead was on Normandy Beach. He chaired Goldman Saks. He was \nPresident Reagan's Deputy Secretary of State. He headed the \nInternational Rescue Commission. He has been in the middle of New \nYork's efforts after 9/11. As Peggy Noonan wrote, he is a model public \ncitizen.\n  For the eloquence of his life and the eloquence of her article, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           A Day at the Beach\n\n                           (By Peggy Noonan)\n\n       It was May 1944, and 22-year-old John Whitehead of \n     Montclair, N.J., an ensign on the USS Thomas Jefferson, was \n     placed in charge of five of the landing craft for the \n     invasion of Europe. Each would ferry 25 soldiers from the TJ, \n     as they called it, onto the shore of France. John's landing \n     site was to be a 50-yard stretch of shoreline dubbed Dog Red \n     Beach. It fell near the middle of the sector called Omaha \n     Beach which in turn fell in the middle of the entire assault.\n       The TJ sailed to Portsmouth Harbor, which was jam-packed \n     with ships. On June 1 the Army troops arrived, coming up the \n     gangway one by one. ``They were very quiet,'' John said this \n     week. Word came on June 4 that they'd leave that night, but \n     they were ordered back in a storm. The next morning June 5, \n     the rain was still coming down, but the seas were calmer. \n     Around 8 that night, they cast off to cross the channel. The \n     skies were dark, rain lashed the deck, and the TJ rolled in \n     the sea. At midnight they dropped anchor nine miles off the \n     French coast. They ate a big breakfast of eggs and bacon. At \n     2 a.m. the crew began lowering the Higgins boats--``a kind of \n     floating boxcar, rectangular, with high walls''--over the \n     side by crane. The soldiers had to climb down big nets to get \n     aboard. ``They had practiced, but as Eisenhower always said, \n     `In wartime, plans are only good until the moment you try to \n     execute them.' ''\n       The Higgins boats pitched in the choppy water. The \n     soldiers, loaded down ``like mountaineers'' with rifles, \n     flamethrowers, radio equipment, artillery parts, tarps, food, \n     water, ``70 pounds in all''--had trouble getting from the \n     nets to the boats. ``I saw a poor soul slip from the net into \n     the water. He sank like a stone. He just disappeared in the \n     depths of the sea. There was nothing we could do.'' So they \n     boarded the boats on the deck and hoisted them into the sea.\n       It took John's five little boats four hours to cover the \n     nine miles to the beach. ``They were the worst hours of our \n     lives. It was pitch black, cold, and the rain was coming down \n     in sheets, drenching us. The boats were being tossed in the \n     waves, making all of us violently sick. We'd all been given \n     the big breakfast. Hardly anyone could hold it down. Packed \n     in like that, with the boat's high walls. a cry went up: `For \n     Christ's sake, do it in your helmet!' ''\n       ``Around 4 a.m. the dawn broke and a pale light spread \n     across the sea, and now we could see that we were in the \n     middle of an armada--every kind of boat, destroyers, probably \n     the greatest array of sea power ever gathered.''\n       Now they heard the sound, the deep boom of the shells from \n     the battleships farther out at sea, shelling the beach to \n     clear a path. Above, barely visible through clouds, they saw \n     the transport planes pushing through to drop paratroopers \n     from the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions. ``Those were \n     brave men.''\n       At 5 a.m. they were close enough to shore to see \n     landmarks--a spit of land, a slight rise of a bluff. In front \n     of them they saw some faster, sleeker British boats trying \n     desperately to stay afloat in the choppy water. As the \n     Americans watched, three of the boats flipped over and \n     sank, drowning all the men. A British navigator went by in \n     a different kind of boat. ``He was standing up and he \n     called out to my friend in a very jaunty British accent, \n     `I say, fellows, which way is it to Pointe du Hoc?' That \n     was one of the landmarks, and the toughest beach of all. \n     My friend yelled out that it was up to our right. `Very \n     good!' he cried out, and then went on by with a little \n     wave of his hand.''\n       Closer to shore, a furious din--``It was like a Fourth of \n     July celebration multiplied by a thousand.'' By 6 a.m. they \n     were 800 yards from shore. All five boats of the squadron had \n     stayed together. The light had brightened enough that John \n     could see his wristwatch. ``At 6:20 I waved them in with a \n     hard chop of my arm: Go!''\n       They faced a barrier, made a sharp left, ran parallel to \n     the shore looking for an opening, got one, turned again \n     toward the beach. They hit it, were in a foot or two of \n     water. The impact jarred loose the landing ramps to release \n     the soldiers as planned. But on John's boat, it didn't work. \n     He scrambled to the bow, got a hammer, pounded the stuck \n     bolt. The ramp crashed down and the soldiers lunged forth. \n     Some were hit with shrapnel as they struggled through to the \n     beach. Others made it to land only to be hit as they crossed \n     it. The stuck ramp probably saved John's life. After he'd \n     rushed forward to grab the hammer, he turned and saw the \n     coxswain he'd been standing next to had been hit and killed \n     by an incoming shell.\n       The troops of Omaha Beach took terrible fire. Half the \n     soldiers from John's five boats were killed or wounded. ``It \n     was a horrible sight. But I had to concentrate on doing my \n     job.'' To make room for the next wave of landings, they \n     raised the ramp, backed out, turned around and sped back to \n     the TJ. ``I remember, waving hello to the soldiers in the in-\n     coming boats, as if we were all on launches for a pleasure \n     cruise. I remember thinking how odd that such, gestures of \n     civility would persist amid such horror.''\n       Back at the TJ, he was told to take a second breakfast in \n     the wardroom--white tablecloths, steward's mates asking if \n     he'd like more. He thought it unreal: ``from Dog Red Beach to \n     the Ritz.'' He heard in the background the quiet boom of the \n     liberation of Europe. Then back to a Higgins boat for another \n     run at the beach. This time the ramp lowered, and he got off. \n     Dog Red Beach was secure. The bodies of the dead and wounded \n     had been carried up onto a rise below a bluff. He felt \n     thankful he had survived. ``Then I took a few breaths and \n     felt elated, proud to have played a part in maybe the biggest \n     battle in history.''\n       John went on to landings in Marseilles, Iwo Jima and \n     Okinawa. After he came home, he went on to chair Goldman \n     Sachs, work in Ronald Reagan's State Department, and head \n     great organizations such as the International Rescue \n     Committee. He is, in that beautiful old phrase, a public \n     citizen.\n       But if you asked him today his greatest moment, he'd say \n     that day on the beach, when he was alive and grateful for it. \n     ``At that moment, dead tired, soaked to the skin, I would not \n     have wanted to be anywhere else in the world.''\n       It is silly to think one generation is ``better'' than \n     another. No one born in 1920 is, by virtue of that fact, \n     better than someone born in 1960. But it is true that each \n     era has a certain mood, certain assumptions--in John's era, \n     sacrifice--and each generation distinguishes itself in time, \n     or doesn't. John's did. He himself did. And what better day \n     than today to say: Thanks, John.\n\n[[Page S6645]]\n\n                                 energy\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the majority leader, Senator Reid, has \nspoken about an energy roadmap. He talked about it on Friday. He talked \nabout it again today. I am glad he is talking about it. I want to make \na suggestion to him, which I hope he can accept. I am sure that in his \nhome State, Nevada, as well as in my home State, Tennessee, the first \nthing out of anybody's mouth has to do with gasoline prices.\n  I try to read on the floor of the Senate regularly letters that have \nbeen e-mailed to me from Tennesseans whose lives are changed by the $4 \nand $4.25 gasoline. What Senator Reid said in his remarks was that he \nhas an energy roadmap. I say, with great respect, that I am afraid his \nroadmap is only half a roadmap because he is willing to use less energy \nbut not willing--as far as I can tell--to find more energy.\n  In 1961, President Kennedy said: Let's go to the Moon in 10 years. \nBut if the astronauts had a roadmap that took them only halfway there, \nthey would be floating in space. That is where I am afraid we would be \nas a country if we only do half our job as we address $4 gasoline.\n  The problem that we have is a very simple one, even though a \ndifficult one. It has to do with economics 101, the law of supply and \ndemand. We have low supplies and more demand because around the world, \nthe Chinese, the Indians, and others are growing wealthier and using \nmore oil, from which gasoline is made.\n  Mr. President, the only real solution to the $4, $4.25 gasoline \nprices is to find more and use less--find more, as well as use less.\n  Now, the majority leader's suggestions that he mentioned--and I don't \nthink they are part of the bill yet--include some very promising ideas. \nCurb speculation. We on the Republican side have introduced legislation \nthat would put 100 more cops on the beat to curb speculation. Say that \noil produced in America should be used here. That is what is happening \ntoday.\n  Increase our focus on renewable energy; renewable energy is \nimportant. It is only 3 percent of the total amount of electricity that \nwe use in the United States today. We have a long way to go before \nsolar, wind, and other energy of that kind can be a major part of what \nwe need to do. Most of that is devoted to electricity. Of course, that \nis important. On the Republican side, we have supported that.\n  But what we have done on our side is introduce legislation that would \ndo both: find more and use less. We don't do that with the hope that we \nwill have a Republican bill because we don't want to see a Democratic \nbill either. We want an American bill. We believe our legislation \ndeserves--and will earn--Democratic support. In fact, Democratic \nSenators have voted for some of the provisions in our legislation \nbefore.\n  In terms of finding more oil, we propose allowing deep sea \nexploration--give a State the option to drill for oil, if the State \nwishes to do that, and then take 37 percent of that money and put it \ninto the State treasury for universities, beach nourishment, lowering \ntaxes, or whatever. Put 12\\1/2\\ percent into the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and half to the Federal Treasury. We could unlock, \nconservatively, 1 million barrels of oil a day if we were to allow deep \nsea exploration.\n  Today the President has taken off the Presidential moratorium on deep \nsea exploration. So it is up to us in the Congress to say: Will we or \nwill we not find more oil by exploring in the deep seas off our coast?\n  Two, we have suggested in our legislation that we take the moratorium \noff oil shale development in four Western States. That could produce, \nover time, 2 million barrels a day. Just those two ideas--drilling \noffshore and oil shale--would increase by one-third the American \nproduction of oil, almost all of which we use here. So that is the \nsupply part.\n  We are also interested in using less. The most promising way to do \nthat, I believe--and 44 of us have agreed, and I will bet many do on \nthe other side--has to do with plug-in electric cars and trucks. When I \nfirst started talking about that, people thought I had been out in the \nsun too long. In fact, Nissan, General Motors, Toyota, and Ford are all \ngoing to be selling us cars that we can plug in at night--hybrid cars. \nThree quarters of us drive less than 40 miles a day, and I am one of \nthose. I can drive back and forth to the Senate using very little \ngasoline, if any. We could electrify half of our fleet of cars and \ntrucks in the United States. That would take time, but it would be a \nclear direction toward using less oil.\n  With just those provisions I have talked about--finding more and \nusing less--we could cut our oil imports in half. That would reduce \nyour gas prices.\n  If you are driving a plug-in electric vehicle, by the way, there is \nplenty of electricity. At night, while we are asleep, most utilities \nhave plenty of cheap electricity they would sell us. You plug your car \nor truck in at night for just about the same amount of charge that your \nwater heater would use, and you could fill up with 60 cents of \nelectricity instead of $100 worth of gasoline.\n  Just these three ideas--deep sea exploration, oil shale, and plug-in \nvehicles--would cut oil imports in half. We are ready to do that.\n  We would like for the majority leader to bring to the floor of the \nSenate an energy bill that is directed toward reducing the price of \ngasoline. Let each Democratic Senator put up their best idea, and let \nthe Republicans put up our best ideas. Let's have a debate and votes, \nand they would probably take 60 votes.\n  We cannot get everything done before we leave in August, or even \nbefore October, but we can begin. From the day the United States of \nAmerica--the third largest producer of oil and the user of a quarter of \nall of the oil in the world--finds more and uses less, the future \nexpected price of oil will go down, and today's price of oil will \nstabilize and begin to go down.\n\n  I say to my friend, the majority leader, as one Senator, I welcome \nhis interest and attention to energy, and specifically to gasoline \nprices. We Republicans have offered--44 of us--a slimmed-down bill, a \nmodest bill. We don't say drill everywhere offshore. We don't say drill \nin Alaska in this piece of legislation. We say give States the option, \nand lift the moratorium on oil shale. Make electric plug-in cars and \ntrucks commonplace and cut our oil imports in half over time. That is \nthe way to reduce gasoline prices.\n  We hope if we are able in this Senate to act like a Senate and spend \na week or two on this legislation and consider a number of amendments, \nwe can come up with a result and we can go home to our constituents in \nAugust and say: Yes, we got a result. And when we come back in \nSeptember, if we can do more, we will. When we come back in January, if \nwe can do more, we will.\n  Everybody in Tennessee is saying to me: Senator Alexander, why don't \nyou get together and work something out? I would like to do that, Mr. \nPresident. I didn't come here to play politics, talk trash, or stick my \nfingers in the eyes of the other side.\n  In my first speech on, for example, U.S. history, the majority \nleader, who was then the whip, was on the Senate floor, and he stood up \nand cosponsored my bill. Senator Kennedy got 20 cosponsors for it. It \nis now law today. Surely, if we can do that with U.S. history summer \nacademies, we can do it with gasoline prices when it is the No. 1 \nissue.\n  Last Tuesday we had a bipartisan breakfast that was attended by 14 \nSenators. We heard from Senators Conrad, Chambliss, Domenici, and \nBingaman. We talked about what we could agree on that had to do with \nboth finding more and using less.\n  We cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. We know that mostly on \nthe Republican side we talk about supply. Over on the Democratic side, \nthey talk about demand. We have to put it together if we want to bring \ngasoline prices down. That is what we should be doing. I think that \nopportunity exists today.\n  In that closed room last Tuesday--and there is another bipartisan \nbreakfast in the morning--I heard some Senators say things such as:\n\n       If we cannot deal with this across party lines, we don't \n     deserve to be here.\n\n  I think that is right, and most Americans feel that way.\n  The majority leader has many issues that have to be dealt with in the \nnext 2 or 3 weeks. I hope he can find a way to bring his best ideas to \nthe floor and allow us to do the same. Let's bring up\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\nthe debates and let's talk and let's vote and come to a result, and \nlet's begin to lower gasoline prices. From the day the United States of \nAmerica says to the world that we are going to find more American oil \nand we are going to use less oil, the expected price of oil and gas \nwill begin to go down, and so will today's price of gas and oil go \ndown.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has passed \nlegislation which will help our troubled housing market. This bill will \nreform the oversight of the government-sponsored enterprises--Fannie \nMae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks--and also provided \nmuch needed relief for communities and homeowners combating \nforeclosures.\n  The first piece of this large housing bill is the Federal Housing \nFinance Regulatory Reform Act. This legislation will modernize the \nregulation of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks \nand expands their housing mission. By creating one regulator for the \nGSEs, it will make it easier for them to respond to the housing market \nand continue to create affordable housing opportunities for Americans \nacross the country.\n  The bill also includes key provisions which will help homeowners and \ncommunities combat foreclosures. Foreclosed properties drive down the \nproperty value of surrounding homes, and communities are losing tax \nrevenue, which will impact public services. Communities need the \nability to take excess homes and make them livable again in order to \nrecover lost revenue. The $4 billion in CDBG funding included in this \nbill will allow for States and local municipalities to rehabilitate \nforeclosed properties and then get them back onto the market for \nhomeowners to purchase or to be made into affordable rental housing. \nThis money is vital to the economic recovery of communities that have \nbeen devastated by foreclosure.\n  Additionally, the bill has funding for housing counselors to help \nhomeowners avoid foreclosure. Housing counselors will be able to reach \ntroubled homeowners and find viable and affordable solutions in order \nto keep them in their homes. One of the most creative provisions to \nhelp at risk homeowners is the Hope for Homeownership Program in FHA. \nThis program will allow homeowners who are behind on their mortgage \npayments to refinance into a fixed-rate FHA insured mortgage and \nultimately stay in their homes. The quicker these provisions are signed \ninto law, the quicker families and communities can respond to their \nhousing needs.\n  I am very pleased that the amendment which myself, Senators Collins, \nLincoln, and Mikulski offered was agreed to and incorporated into the \nbill. There are many problems that are a result of the collapsing \nhousing market, and the emergence of financial scam artists is one of \nthem. The amendment will better protect homeowners from scam artists \ntrying to steal the equity out of their homes.\n  The passage of this housing bill is the first step to help our \ncountry from the collapse of the housing market. I hope that the House \nwill act quickly and Congress can produce a comprehensive piece of \nlegislation which the President will sign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/14/senate-section/article/S6646-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FISA ADMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Congressional Record for \nJuly 9, 2008, inadvertently omitted my written statement for the \nRecord. The text is as follows:\n  Mr. President, I believe that we must pass a new FISA bill that \nenables our intelligence community to get the information it needs to \nstop terrorist plots while also protecting our civil liberties, by \nrequiring a court order before any American is targeted for \neavesdropping.\n  But I don't believe in blanket immunity for the phone companies. \nThat's why, in the Intelligence Committee, I offered language to deny \nimmunity to the telecommunications companies for their alleged \nparticipation in the President's warrantless wiretapping program. But \nthat amendment failed--and failed miserably.\n  During floor consideration of the FISA bill, Senator Feinstein and I \noffered a compromise amendment that would have required the FISA court \nto review the actions of telecommunication companies who participated \nin the President's warrantless wiretapping program. But it failed too.\n  Now I am backing an amendment by Senator Bingaman that would at least \ndelay immunity until the inspectors general of the U.S. Government \ncomplete their investigation of the President's warrantless wiretapping \nprogram. Upon completion of the report, the Senate will have ninety \ndays to act before immunity is granted to the telecommunications \ncompanies. This will allow us time to change some minds if real \nwrongdoing is found.\n  Overall, I believe this legislation significantly improves civil \nliberties protections for Americans while enabling our intelligence \ncommunity to listen in on terrorists. This is an important step forward \nand I will support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/14/senate-section/article/S6646-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                   specialist estelle ``lee'' turner\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to SPC \nEstelle ``Lee'' Turner and his heroic service to our country. As a \nmember of the Army's Echo Company, 1st Battalion, 506th Infantry \nRegiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division based in \nFort Campbell, KY, SPC Turner was serving in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom. On July 2, 2008, he died in a hospital in Bethesda, \nMD after being mortally wounded by an IED in Afghanistan.\n  Lee had already served his country for 6 years in the Army two \ndecades earlier, having finished his military service in 1989. Yet this \nwasn't enough. Even though he had gone above and beyond, Lee still had \nthe drive to be a hero. After moving to Sioux Falls in 2004, he \nreenlisted in the Army at the age of 39, after the Army had raised its \nage limit. He looked forward to being deployed to Afghanistan, his \nfirst tour in the war on terror. His wife recalls, ``He never seemed \nworried about it, this is something he believed in. He thought it was \nright.''\n  Raised in a military family, patriotism was instilled in his heart \nfrom a young age. Lee's father served in the Navy for 18 years, and his \ngrandfather was an Army soldier who served in World War II. His younger \nbrother John is in the Army, and his wife is an Army reservist. Lee's \nawards and decorations include the Army Good Conduct Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the Army Combat Action Badge, and the \nPurple Heart. Lee enjoyed racing and fixing cars, and playing guitar. \nHe had a fierce devotion to his family, and he will be deeply missed by \nthose who survive him: his wife Leah, his daughter Lyda, his siblings, \nJohn and ``Gucci'', and his mother Gloria.\n  Specialist Turner gave his all for his soldiers and his country. Our \nNation owes him a debt of gratitude, and the best way to honor his life \nis to emulate his commitment to our country. Mr. President, I join with \nall South Dakotans in expressing my deepest sympathy to the family and \nfriends of Specialist Turner. He will be missed, but his service to our \nNation will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/14/senate-section/article/S6646-5", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6646-S6648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

To respect their efforts, I am submitting every e-mail sent \nto me through energy_prices@crapo.senate .gov to the Congressional \nRecord. This is not an issue that will be easily resolved, but it is \none that deserves immediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve \nto be heard. Their stories not only detail their struggles to meet \neveryday expenses but also have suggestions and recommendations as to \nwhat Congress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that \nlast beyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Like many other single parents out there, we have to \n     commute to work for better-paying jobs and cannot take public \n     transportation because they won't stop at daycare and the \n     store on the way home from work. So, yes, like every family, \n     whether single or not, you have to drive and cannot ride your \n     bike, but give me a break. And tell me why the airlines are \n     now charging a $75 escort fee for your child under 12 flying \n     alone (it was $30 last year), and this is to walk them from \n     the counter to the plane. Tell me how much gas does that use? \n     And their reason for increased cost is the fuel prices. So \n     that is $150 round trip to walk from the counter to the plane \n     on top of the airline charge. What is going to be the next \n     excuse--charging to use the restroom during the flight?\n       I seriously believe this is going to extremely out of hand \n     before it gets any better. And is anyone going to do anything \n     about all of this? I do not think so!!!\n           Thank you,\n     Tracy, Star.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo, When gas hit $2 a gallon, my husband \n     and I agreed that neither of us expected the price to ever go \n     below $2 and that the price would continue to increase \n     because of increased demand from China and India and the Iraq \n     war. In 2006, we traded in a mid-80s Saturn and bought a \n     Toyota Prius because of its gas mileage. As the price of gas \n     continued to increase, my husband bought a scooter to commute \n     to work whenever the weather is dry. The scooter gets 90+ \n     miles to the gallon. Being a stay-at-home mom for a while \n     with our daughter, I consolidate errands into a single trip \n     whenever I can and handle as many things as I can over the \n     telephone. Gas is now over $4 a gallon (. . . diesel is \n     almost $5!), but everyday I still see huge shiny pickup \n     trucks and SUVs driven by solo drivers commuting to work.\n       Would I like gas to be cheaper? Sure, but it is not \n     reasonable to expect that it is going to happen any time \n     soon. Domestic oil reserves cannot be developed quickly \n     enough for us to seriously depend on that strategy. We must \n     reduce demand and become more efficient.\n       Our grandparents and parents supported the war effort by \n     reducing their personal consumption of oil, metal, clothing \n     and food (among other items). Why do our leaders (you!) \n     insist that citizens are unable to rise to the occasion and \n     change our consumption?\n       Do I support destroying the Alaskan wilderness so my fellow \n     Idahoans can commute in SUV's? No!\n       Do I support fighting wars over oil so we can go water \n     skiing and speed boating at Lucky Peak? No!\n       Do I support subsidizing and coddling the American car \n     industry which has stubbornly refused to offer fuel efficient \n     cars? No!\n       If Boise had a light rail system, would we use it to visit \n     family and run errands in Meridian, Nampa and Caldwell? You \n     bet!\n       Senator Crapo, please be a leader who does not ask citizens \n     to wallow in anger and pity. Establish your leadership and \n     vision around responsible use and investment in the future!\n           Best regards,\n     Kimberly, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Mr. Crapo: Thank you so much for trying to fight this \n     battle for us. I do not think there is a family in the U.S. \n     that is not being affected by our high fuel costs. For many \n     of us, we have long considered our fuel as a necessity but \n     with the prices we now are paying, it is becoming a luxury!\n       My husband and I are getting close to retirement, so we \n     have been trying to plan and save for that time. With these \n     fuel charges, I will have to reduce my 401K payments because \n     I drive 25 miles to work each day. Sure, I could try and buy \n     a smaller car to reduce my fuel bill, but my car is fairly \n     new and paid for and it does not seem economically feasible \n     to trade it in and start making payments on a smaller car.\n       No, we won't go without food or shelter, but we will be \n     tightening our belts on other aspects of our lives. Our \n     Saturday drives, date nights, and trips to visit our \n     grandkids will be greatly reduced. These are the things that \n     we have worked hard to achieve and enjoy and now will not be \n     able to do so.\n       I greatly encourage our country to begin using our own \n     resources. Domestic drilling and refining is the answer. \n     Sure, I care about the environment and harming wildlife, but \n     I care more about the human aspect of this crisis. Our human \n     way life has become harmed. Why aren't the environmentalists \n     worrying about that? With technology what it is today, there \n     are fewer chances of oil spills or environmental issues. I \n     also know that, with our technology, it will not take eight \n     to ten years to get this oil into production. I think we need \n     to begin drilling in ANWR and off the coast of California \n     immediately.\n       As a citizen I will do my part to help with energy \n     conservation but I also expect our legislatures to step up \n     and do their part and stop being controlled by special \n     interest environmentalists.\n       Thank you once again for your efforts.\n     Jeannette, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       As seniors on a pension and Social Security, I think we are \n     among the hardest hit. I think it is criminal that neither \n     energy nor food is included in the COLA. It is going to be a \n     long time before these prices come down and I think it is \n     time the COLA is based on something a little more realistic. \n     We cannot live without either one of these items. Also living \n     in rural Idaho, we do not have any public transportation. I \n     truly think the government would just as soon that we would \n     all die off so they do not have to deal with us.\n     Donna.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Mike Crapo: If you really care about one of \n     the most crippling economic problems facing our nation, it is \n     the impact of the greed of the oil industry infrastructure.\n       The racketeering (oh, well, what else should I call it?) of \n     the oil industry is having massive inflationary impact on \n     this nation, severely damaging this nations transportation \n     system. The ripple effects will be far-reaching and crippling \n     over the long term. Damage to the transportation \n     infrastructure with loss of service through airline cutbacks, \n     will have long term impact on the entire travel industry, in \n     turn impacting the entire economy. Fewer flights and fewer \n     airline routes (and bankrupt carriers) require less \n     airplanes, impacting aircraft production (loss of airplane \n     orders and jobs at Boeing), resulting in fewer jobs, and \n     fewer hours worked. Resultant higher ticket prices make \n     discretionary travel (vacations) less affordable impacting \n     hotels, motels, theme parks, rental cars, etc. Look further \n     still and it not hard to visualize the massive ripple: less \n     hotel and motel supplies purchased, restaurant food, new \n     automobiles for the rental car industry, etc.\n       The airline industry, trucking, farming, plastics (and \n     other products reliant on petrochemicals) and food production \n     are all suffering from the unchecked corporate oil industry \n     greed. Greed that only promises to worsen, as the oil \n     industry blackmails us with obvious threat of higher prices \n     without access to protected areas for drilling. Yet they \n     actually do nothing too relieve the bottlenecks nor improve \n     their existing production infrastructure. Nor is it a short \n     term solution. They claim investment, in what, additional \n     tracts of land to grow their holdings, and exploration, to \n     lock in future production, but provide no meaningful major \n     expenditure that has improved current production that is of \n     benefit to the American consumer. When was the last new \n     refinery opened, or the old existing infrastructure \n     modernized, unless required by regulation, or replacement due \n     to industrial accident or breakdown? The number of \n     competitors has shrunk thru buyouts and mergers over the \n     years, serving to destroy the competitive market, and pricing \n     at the pump, is nothing short of collusion, thinly veiled as \n     competitive free market pricing. And the oil industry gets \n     wiser on how to game the congress and the people. And you sit \n     still for it!\n       We need very badly the long term solutions you speak of, \n     however, we need action now with a high priority placed on \n     bringing a cessation to the greed based damage to this \n     nations economy and the severe economic burden being endured \n     by the voters you elected officials collectively represent.\n       If it is bad now, think of the winter heating bill citizens \n     in the nation's cold climate will shortly face when winter is \n     once again upon us.\n       So vital is this industry to our nation's economy, it is \n     past time to regulate it! I repeat, it is past time to \n     regulate the oil industry!\n       Our government regulates electricity, natural gas, and \n     telephone infrastructure, and the FCC TV & radio. How is the \n     oil industry any different? How is the oil dependency/\n     infrastructure of this nation less vital? They are no longer \n     serving this nation's interest in a responsible manner, have \n     made a complete mockery of congressional investigations (with \n     the aid of some members of congress), and basically have the \n     United States of America over a barrel!\n       A good place to start would be to make speculation illegal \n     (dealing through third party brokers & traders illegal. If a \n     person/company does not actually physically handle the actual \n     product, it should be made illegal to profit from it by \n     brokering or speculation.).\n       How many airlines have to fold, how many truckers go under, \n     and how much unnecessary inflation must this nation endure \n     before our elected (for now) officials really do something \n     meaningful? It is said oil is higher due to the shrinking \n     dollar. Oil has driven the dollar down and is a major player \n     in our current inflation. It impacts the United States, it \n     ripples thru the world.\n       Have you asked yourselves why the voters think less of our \n     elected officials (per polls) than our President? Are you \n     really happy with that?\n       Your email implies you care. Then prove it to the voters \n     you represent. Start the Congress on a path to put control \n     and regulation\n\n[[Page S6648]]\n\n     on [the oil] industry so very vital to the nation's economy \n     and infrastructure.\n       How long must we wait for Congress to stop the ongoing \n     damage to our dollar, cost of living (including food), and \n     our transportation infrastructure? What could be more \n     important to both the short-term and long-term wellbeing of \n     this country and its citizens in your list of priorities?\n       On another but still related issue, where is this nation's \n     long range planning? If I might cite an example; Japan after \n     WWII as a nation set its sights on consumer electronics and \n     the automobile. Look where they are today with those \n     technologies and look at our once proud auto industry, now a \n     cripple. Kennedy pointed this nation toward the moon--within \n     ten years. It was a national plan and a priority. What are \n     this nation's long-term goals? Do you know? Why do not we the \n     people know?\n       These items should rise above petty politics. They should \n     be without party ownership and bickering. And a declaration \n     of persona non grata made toward the oil lobby and their \n     bought and paid for elected officials.\n       Thank you for asking for my story, but it is really a much \n     larger story than my story; it is our story.\n     John.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: It is good to hear from you and know \n     that at least one politician in Washington has their head on \n     straight. Thank you for representing those of us who do not \n     buy the ``man-caused global warming'' hoax. I believe it is a \n     natural cycle the earth has gone thru many times before and \n     will continue to undergo.\n       I believe all Americans want clean air, water and a healthy \n     environment which can all be accomplished while \n     simultaneously drilling in ANWAR, off coast regions and \n     exploring other natural resources available domestically.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mike, Emmett.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     provide input on what I think is the most important issue we \n     should have faced at least twenty years ago. Yet, I know that \n     mustering the political will to make the changes we needed to \n     make would have been very difficult then. Nonetheless, here \n     we are in 2008 and, being Americans, we will face this crisis \n     with intelligence and determination.\n       Frankly, I put the rising prices into this perspective. I \n     drive a Hyundai Accent and average about 34 mpg and drive \n     about 11,000 miles per year. So, I buy about 325 gallons \n     annually. Gasoline has increased $1.75 over the last short \n     while. So, on average I'm paying an additional $47 per month. \n     Sure, I'd rather spend that on something else, but that \n     really is not that bad. My wife drives our Toyota 4 Runner. \n     Her commute is short and other than that, we only use that \n     vehicle for recreation . . . about 4,000 to 5,000 miles per \n     year. Again, I can live with it.\n       To my way of thinking, the increased gas prices have been a \n     blessing. It has finally brought the discussion of energy \n     management to forefront where it has needed to be for some \n     time. Not only is our economic well being at stake, but the \n     security of America as well. Were it not for oil, would we \n     have ever even heard of Saddam Hussein? And, too, we are \n     finally coming to agreement that climate change is real and \n     are showing signs that we may actually address it. If higher \n     gas prices are the cost of getting to have this discussion, \n     so be it.\n       What should we do about gas prices, you ask? Nothing. \n     Market forces will bring down gas consumption which should \n     have a moderating effect on prices. People are opting for \n     more fuel efficient cars which may stimulate the auto \n     industry. And finally, I think the federal government should \n     take a more active role with our currency issues to keep the \n     dollar from falling much further. I know there is reluctance \n     to that idea, but the circumstances seem to warrant it.\n           Regards,\n     Pete, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: I do not agree with your assessment \n     regarding the high price of gas. We are being gouged by the \n     oil companies, and I will prove my point.\n       Oil is at about $130 a barrel. There are 42 gallons in a US \n     barrel, which equates to $3.09 a gallon for crude. Add to \n     this the price for refining say $0.40 distribution $0.25. \n     State and federal Taxes and about $0.25 a gallon a gas \n     station makes and you will see that we are already over $4 a \n     gallon.\n       How do the oil companies make these massive profits every \n     quarter? In the United States, we have to import 40% of our \n     oil the other 60% comes from Alaska, Texas, California, the \n     Gulf, etc. Are we paying $130 a barrel to the oil companies \n     for oil coming out of our own back yard? You people blame \n     China and India for the cost of fuel today. For your \n     information, I have been to both countries. They do not have \n     the amount of cars we Americans have. In fact, they are a \n     bicycle society.\n       I am fed up with Congress and the Senate for not taking any \n     action on this issue; in fact, President Bush is quiet on the \n     subject.\n       I have always been [conservative], but I fear that this \n     coming election [conservatives will not fare well], mainly \n     due oil prices which has a ripple effect and cause \n     unemployment, rise in food prices etc. The hardest hit people \n     in out society are the old people of which I am one.\n           Sincerely,\n     George.\n                                  ____\n\n       Our current monthly gas budget has almost tripled with the \n     increase during the past year. With my husband working out of \n     town (300+ miles weekly commute) and I'm working for a non-\n     profit that reimburses me @$.40/mile, we are going in the \n     hole. As our state representative, you and your family should \n     be feeling the same affects of the energy prices that we are, \n     and helping correct this problem. Are you?\n           Respectfully,\n     Marcia.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator: I am a hard-working Idahoan who has to change \n     my behavior because of high energy costs, but I also \n     understand that sometimes you have to pay the piper. Nobody \n     likes to go on a diet or take medicine. Yet in order to get \n     well, we have to do things we do not like. This is one of \n     those times. The answer to our energy problem is not to find \n     some way to ignore or go around what made us fat and sick. \n     And, I mean that quite literally. Furthermore, you know as \n     well as I do that local oil will be the same price as global \n     oil. The market price is the price regardless of where it \n     comes from. You do no favor to the public with this tactic. \n     Feel free to quote me.\n     Jim.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are unable to see our children who live 500 to 1000 \n     miles away due to gas prices. We are getting older and live \n     on retirement income, thus we are unable to help them out \n     with gas for making a trip to Idaho. I expect we will never \n     get to see them again.\n     Robert and Peggy, Emmett.\n                                  ____\n\n       Senator Crapo for the last three years, I have been \n     traveling to Missoula, Montana, for medical treatments for \n     cancer and I had a stint placed. I was traveling every three \n     weeks for treatments and I am happy to say that the cancer is \n     in remission as of now but Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma cannot be \n     cured, it can be treated usually but not cured, and it keeps \n     coming back. I am not only faced with expenses at the Cancer \n     Center and doctor, but I have a diseased liver and they have \n     no idea why the tests are showing such high levels in the \n     tests. It seems all of this has hit more or less all at once \n     in traveling and taking the tests. I have to stay overnight \n     at times, and this, of course, creates more expenses which \n     the government or the insurance and Medicare does not cover. \n     My nest egg for retirement is getting eaten up each month, \n     and it will run out. I worry about my wife if something \n     happens to me.\n       I hope that someone reads this that can help me and others \n     in the same boat.

Mr. President, I stand today to object to any unanimous \nconsent agreement in connection with the nomination of Mr. Husein \nCumber to be a member of the Surface Transportation Board, or STB. I \ndon't take this action lightly, and I would like to take a few moments \nto briefly describe why I am placing a hold on his nomination.\n  Railroads and transportation infrastructure are the lifeblood of our \neconomy. My home State of Oregon has recently been the victim of a \nshort line railroad that has subverted consumer protections established \nby Congress in an attempt to reduce service and raise rates. The STB is \nthe last line of defense against companies that are more interested in \nmaximizing profits than they are in their legal obligations as a common \ncarrier.\n  To be an effective safeguard against this activity, the STB needs \nboard members with in-depth experience and knowledge of a broad range \nof rate, service and railroad merger issues. The law says that members \nof the STB should possess professional standing and demonstrated \nknowledge in the fields of transportation or transportation regulation. \nI am very concerned that Mr. Cumber doesn't possess any of these \nqualities.\n  Mr. Cumber's nomination requires this body to seriously review his \nrecord of accomplishment in light of these requirements and \ndemonstrated abilities. I have compared Mr. Cumber's record with those \nof other current and former members of the STB, and I would like to \nshare some of my findings with you today.\n  First, Chairman Charles Nottingham, a licensed attorney. Chairman \nNottingham has 4 years of experience in the Federal Highway \nAdministration working on everything from funding analysis to policy \ndevelopment. He has an additional 4 years at the state level as the \nTransportation Commissioner and CEO of Virginia DOT. He was the counsel \nto the Committee on Government\n\n[[Page S6649]]\n\nReform in the U.S. House of Representatives. Chairman Nottingham is \nunquestionably qualified for the duties required of a board member and \na good example of what the STB needs in a nominee.\n  Vice Chairman Francis Mulvey, with a Ph.D. in Economics, is likewise \nqualified. He has legislative experience as the Staff Director for the \nRailroad Subcommittee in the House of Representatives. He was the \nDeputy Assistant Inspector General for Rail, Transit, and Special \nPrograms in the Department of Transportation. He was the Assistant \nDirector charged with analyzing transportation issues at the GAO. His \nexperiences outside government are equally valuable: He was the \nPrograms Manager for the National Academy of Sciences, Transportation \nResearch Board. He was also the Vice President for Research with the \nAmerican Bus Association. Again, Vice Chairman Mulvey is an exemplary \nmember and a model for future nominees.\n  Former Chairman Linda Morgan, an attorney with a Georgetown law \ndegree, was supremely qualified to work on the STB. For 15 years she \nheld various positions with the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation. While there, she was responsible for much of the \nlegislation that established the framework for today's surface \ntransportation system. She also served as the general counsel of the \ncommittee.\n  Former Chairman Roger Nober was the counselor to the Deputy Secretary \nof Transportation for a year before joining the STB. Before that he \nspent 4 years as the chief counsel for the Committee on Transportation \nand Infrastructure of the House of Representatives. For the 4 years \nbefore that, he held a variety of positions on that committee's staff. \nAnd for the 4 years before that, he put his Harvard law degree to use \nin New York City. His breadth of experience, most of it relating to \ntransportation issues, made him very well qualified to serve as a board \nmember and chairman.\n  Former Vice Chairman Wayne Burkes served in the Mississippi \nlegislature for 14 years; 4 years in the House of Representatives, and \n10 years in the Senate. He served on the Highways and Transportation \nCommittee all 14 years. After his time in the legislature, he then \nspent 10 years as the Mississippi Transportation Commissioner for the \nCentral District. His understanding of transportation issues was \ncertainly unquestioned.\n  Even a cursory review of current and former board member \nqualifications makes it clear what kind of nominee this important \nregulatory body requires. I would like to bring the Senate's attention \nnow to our current nominee, Mr. Husein Cumber. There are stark \ndifferences between what you have just heard and what I will present to \nyou now.\n  Mr. Cumber's regulatory experience in transportation is limited to \nhis short tenure as a political appointee at the Department of \nTransportation--1 year as the Deputy Chief of Staff, and some time as \nthe Assistant to the Secretary for Policy. For his private sector \nexpertise, he can point to his year as the spokesman for Florida East \nCoast Industries. And before that, he was a political fundraiser for \nPresident George W. Bush and Governor Jeb Bush. He was what some \nreferred to as a fundraising wunderkind. One story noted that he \n``devours business cards like most mortals do potato chips.'' \nDeveloping these political relationships, he said, allowed him to \n``meet some great people and there's going to be a payoff in the end.''\n  The President has nominated Mr. Cumber to work on a vital regulatory \nboard with the capacity to impact our economy, our infrastructure, and \nthe wages of hard-working Americans across the Nation. Reviewing the \nqualifications of other members, be they PH.D.s, attorneys, or career \nlegislators, I see that broad experience in regulatory, policy, and \neconomic matters surrounding rail transportation is essential. \nUnderstanding the common carrier obligation of the rail industry is \nessential. Advocacy for consumers in the face of enormous pressure from \npowerful industry representatives is essential.\n  Mr. Husein Cumber is, by all accounts, a hard-working man. But hard \nwork alone is not sufficient qualification for nomination to the board \nof an important consumer protection agency. It is also essential that a \nnominee have demonstrated experience and expertise in the issues that \ncome before the agency.\n  I recently met with Mr. Cumber to discuss his nomination. I found him \nto be polite, personable, and eager. I did not, however, find him to be \nknowledgeable of the critical issues that have come before the STB. His \nexperiences in lobbying and fundraising stand out and will no doubt \nhelp him in his future endeavors outside of government. But what is \nimportant here is what he has been nominated to do while serving in a \ngovernment position.\n  Members of the Surface Transportation Board have to make important \ndecisions affecting our Nation's transportation policy from the moment \nthey are sworn in. They do not have time for on-the-job training.\n  Mr. Cumber's nomination to the STB may in fact be ``the payoff in the \nend'' he has been working toward. But a seat on the Surface \nTransportation Board shouldn't be a payoff. It's not a prize to be \nwon--it is a job to be done. And it is a job to be done by someone \narmed with credentials and credibility, not by someone armed with only \ncash and connections.\n  I am compelled to object to this nomination for the reasons I have \nprovided. My hope is that the administration will acknowledge the \nimportance of the STB in their search for a qualified nominee and keep \nlooking for one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/14/senate-section/article/S6649-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6649-S6650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      RECOGNIZING MONFORTON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize the \nachievements of an outstanding teacher and her seventh grade students. \nThis is a story of community and folks coming together to make their \ntown a better place to live. The students at Monforton School in \nBozeman, MT, with their teacher, Sally Broughton, saw a playground at \nthe school that was outdated and unsafe. These ambitious young people \nthen sprung into action and set out to inform the principal, school \nboard, other students, and community members of the subpar condition of \nthe playground and gathered input and support for building a new \nplayground.\n  In the Montana spirit of folks working together to make their \ncommunity a better place to live, local businesses pitched in by \ndonating nearly $40,000 worth of supplies and labor toward completion \nof the playground. Monforton parent and carpenter, Alan Ripley, worked \nwith students to design the octagonal climbing structure for the \nplayground. The students spent countless hours with volunteers in \nbuilding the playground.\n  Thanks to the work of these students, their teacher, and the \ncommunity all Monforton students now have a safe playground at their \nschool. The efforts of these fine young people have not gone unnoticed. \nThe Corporation for National and Community Service honored the students \nand their teacher, Sally Broughton, with the 2008 Spirit of Service \nAward, and We the People: Project Citizen presented them with the \nMontana Project Citizen Award for their contributions to the community.\n  This spirit of service is prevalent at Monforton School as all \nstudents participate in service-learning projects. Classroom lessons \nare combined with meaningful service to their community. Through these \nefforts students have been responsible for improving the food service \nat the school, constructing a walking path, and informing the larger \ncommunity about the need for a new jail and a warning system for \nHyalite Dam among other projects.\n  I would like to join the chorus recognizing the seventh grade \nstudents of Monforton and their teacher, Sally Broughton. They are a \nperfect example of how Montana's world-class education system is \npreparing children across Big Sky country to meet the challenges they \nwill face. These outstanding young people are the future of\n\n[[Page S6650]]\n\nour Nation, and I am sure that they will continue to serve and make \nmany contributions to their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/14/senate-section/article/S6650-1", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARIAN ORFEO\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate Ms. Marian Orfeo, director of Planning and \nCoordination with the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, MWRA, on \nbeing named the new president of the National Association of Clean \nWater Agencies, NACWA.\n  Ms. Orfeo has been an environmental champion for the city of Boston, \nState of Massachusetts, and the Nation. She is an exceptional leader \nand public steward dedicated to the improvement of Boston's water \nquality and public health.\n  Ms. Orfeo has worked for with MWRA, a founding member of NACWA, for \nnearly 20 years. The Authority provides wholesale water and sewer \nservices to 2.5 million people in 61 communities across eastern and \ncentral Massachusetts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n  As the director of Planning and Coordination, her responsibilities \ninclude long-range planning to construct and renew MWRA's water and \nwastewater facilities, as well as infrastructure and short-term \nstrategic business planning for all agency functions. She also manages \nthe Authority's performance reporting system and is a member of the \nsteering committee for the MetroFuture initiative of the Boston \nMetropolitan Area Planning Council.\n  Before joining the Authority, Ms. Orfeo previously worked in Boston \ncity government for 16 years. She held a range of positions including \noperations, administration and finance, and planning.\n  She has been an active member of NACWA since 1994, was elected to its \nboard of directors in 2000, and has chaired the Association's \nLegislative Policy, Strategic Planning, Finance, and Awards Committees. \nMs. Orfeo is also a consistent champion for the need to develop a new, \nholistic approach to the nation's complex 21st century water \nchallenges.\n  Being elected NACWA president is not onlyan impressive personal \naccomplishment but will help secure NACWA's role as the leading \nadvocate for responsible national policies that advance clean water and \na healthy environment.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Marian Orfeo on becoming president of \nNACWA.

Mr. President, I would like to congratulate \nOldenburg Group on the 150th anniversary of the Oldenburg Lake Shore \nproduct line. The Oldenburg Group has a major presence in Milwaukee and \nRhinelander, WI. What began on the shores of Lake Superior as a line of \noutboard motors has grown into a significant contributor to our \nNation's defense.\n  As a qualified small business with both military and commercial \nproduct lines, Oldenburg Group has shown that they are a leader within \nthe Nation's defense industry. Their products support the U.S. Navy \nwith refueling systems to allow our ships to remain at sea and ready. \nThey support the U.S. Army with systems for offloading war-fighting \nequipment when no port facility is available, as well as supporting the \nU.S. Department of Defense in many other ways as well. Oldenburg \nGroup's history of customer satisfaction and excellence is immensely \nimportant as it contributes daily to the security of our Nation.\n  It is because of quality products and exceptional support service \nthat the U.S. Department of Defense trusts Oldenburg Group to provide \nvital equipment and services used by the military. Oldenburg's \ndedication to continually looking toward the future and considering how \nproducts can practically be applied to homeland security is one reason \nfor their considerable success, and I congratulate that spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/14/senate-section/article/S6650-3", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/14/senate-section/article/S6650-4", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/14/senate-section/article/S6650-5", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 6:43 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 2967.

Res. 611\n\n       Whereas, over the last eight years, the Zimbabwean African \n     National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), led by Robert \n     Mugabe, has increasingly turned to violence and intimidation \n     to maintain power amidst a deteriorating crisis;\n       Whereas the gross domestic product of Zimbabwe has \n     decreased over 40 percent in the last decade, inflation is \n     estimated by United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Asha-\n     Rose Migiro at over 10,500,000 percent, unemployment is now \n     over 80 percent, and more than 4,000,000 people have fled the \n     country;\n       Whereas presidential and parliamentary elections were held \n     on March 29, 2008, in Zimbabwe amidst widespread reports of \n     voting irregularities and intimidation in favor of the ruling \n     ZANU-PF party and Robert Mugabe;\n       Whereas the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission refused to \n     release results, despite calls to do so by the African Union \n     (AU), the European Union (EU), the Republic of South Africa, \n     the Southern African Development Community (SADC), United \n     Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, and the United States;\n       Whereas the official results of the election, announced \n     five weeks later, showed that Robert Mugabe won 43.2 percent \n     of the vote, while Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the \n     opposition party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), won \n     47.9 percent of the vote;\n       Whereas, in the wake of the elections, Robert Mugabe \n     launched a brutal campaign of state-sponsored violence \n     against opposition members, supporters, and other civilians \n     in an attempt to consolidate his power;\n       Whereas United States Ambassador to the United Nations \n     Zalmay Khalilzad stated on April 16, 2008, that he was \n     ``gravely concerned about the escalating politically \n     motivated violence perpetrated by security forces and ruling \n     party militias'';\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated on April \n     17, 2008, that Robert Mugabe has ``done more harm to his \n     country than would have been imaginable'' and that ``the last \n     years have been really an abomination'' and called for the AU \n     and SADC to strengthen efforts to achieve a political \n     resolution to the crisis;\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch reported on April 19, 2008, that \n     the Mugabe regime had developed a network of informal \n     detention centers to intimidate, torture, and detain \n     political opponents;\n       Whereas the Mugabe regime has, in violation of the Vienna \n     Convention on Diplomatic Relations, done at Vienna April 18, \n     1961 (23 U.S.T. 3229), harassed United States and other \n     diplomats in retaliation for their repeated protest of recent \n     violence, including by detaining the United States \n     ambassador's vehicle for several hours on May 13, 2008, and \n     detaining five United States embassy staff and two local \n     embassy workers on June 5, 1998, one of whom was physically \n     assaulted;\n       Whereas reports of killings, abductions, beatings, torture, \n     and sexual violence against civilians in Zimbabwe have \n     continued, resulting in some 10,000 people being assaulted \n     and at least 30,000 displaced;\n       Whereas the MDC and Presidential candidate Tsvangirai \n     withdrew from the June 27, 2008, runoff presidential \n     election, citing intensified political repression and \n     killings of their supporters;\n       Whereas the Mugabe regime persisted with the runoff \n     election, despite the protest of many leaders in Africa, the \n     EU, SADC, the United Nations Security Council, and the United \n     States Government;\n       Whereas results from the runoff election unsurprisingly \n     declared Robert Mugabe, the only standing candidate, as the \n     winner with 85 percent of the vote, and he was sworn into \n     office;\n       Whereas SADC, the Pan-African Parliament, and AU Observer \n     missions to Zimbabwe made statements on June 29 and 30, 2008, \n     finding that the elections fell short of accepted African \n     Union standards, did not give rise to free, fair, or credible \n     elections, and did not reflect the will of the people of \n     Zimbabwe;\n       Whereas, on June 4, 2008, the Mugabe regime banned the \n     operations of non-governmental organizations in Zimbabwe, \n     including those who provide food and aid to millions of \n     Zimbabweans suffering at the result of a ZANU-PF's policies, \n     exacerbating the humanitarian crisis and leaving newly \n     displaced victims of political violence without assistance;\n       Whereas Nelson Mandela has described the situation in \n     Zimbabwe as a ``tragic failure of leadership,'' while the \n     Government of Botswana has refused to recognize the election \n     outcome as legitimate and has said that representatives of \n     the administration should be excluded from SADC and African \n     Union meetings;\n       Whereas the African Union passed a resolution on July 1, \n     2008, expressing concern for the loss of life in Zimbabwe and \n     the need to initiate political dialogue to promote peace, \n     democracy, and reconciliation;\n       Whereas the MDC reported on July 9, 2008, that 129 of its \n     supporters have been killed since the first round of \n     elections, including 20 since the runoff election, 1,500 of \n     its activists and officials are in detention, and 5,000 are \n     missing or unaccounted for; and\n       Whereas the Group of Eight (G8) industrialized nations, at \n     their annual summit, issued a joint statement on July 8, \n     2008, rejecting the June 27, 2008, election and legitimacy of \n     the Mugabe regime, as well as committing to further measures \n     against those responsible for the violence: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to support the people of Zimbabwe, who continue to face \n     widespread violence, political repression, a humanitarian \n     emergency, and economic adversity;\n       (2) to condemn the Mugabe regime for its manipulation of \n     the country's electoral process, including the March 29, \n     2008, election and the June 27, 2008, runoff election and the \n     regime's continued attacks against, and intimidation of, \n     opposition members and supporters and civil society;\n       (3) to reject the results of the June 27, 2008, \n     presidential runoff election in Zimbabwe as illegitimate \n     because of widespread irregularities, systematic violence by \n     the Mugabe regime, and the boycott of the MDC;\n       (4) to encourage the President's continued efforts to \n     tighten and expand sanctions on\n\n[[Page S6653]]\n\n     those individuals responsible for violations of human and \n     political rights in Zimbabwe;\n       (5) to applaud the Governments of Benin, Botswana, Liberia, \n     Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Zambia for \n     condemning the violent derailment of the runoff election at \n     the African Union summit in Sharm El-Sheikh;\n       (6) to encourage all members of the United Nations Security \n     Council to vote in favor of the proposed resolution that \n     would authorize a United Nations Special Representative to \n     support the negotiations process, impose an international \n     arms embargo, and strengthen financial penalties on those \n     individuals most responsible for undermining democratic \n     processes;\n       (7) to encourage the African Union to initiate an inclusive \n     political dialogue between both parties and deploy a \n     protection force to prevent attacks, assist victims, and \n     prevent the security situation from further deteriorating;\n       (8) to urge leaders in Africa to engage directly in the \n     effort to achieve an expeditious political resolution to the \n     crisis;\n       (9) to urge the United States Government and the \n     international community to assemble a comprehensive economic \n     and political recovery package for Zimbabwe in the event that \n     a political resolution is reached and a truly democratic \n     government is formed; and\n       (10) to support a lasting democratic political solution \n     that reflects the will and respects the rights of the people \n     of Zimbabwe, including mechanisms to ensure that future \n     elections are free and fair, in accordance with regional and \n     international standards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url":

Res. 612\n\n       Whereas the leaders of 6 major industrialized democracies, \n     including France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the United \n     Kingdom, and the United States, gathered in 1975 for a summit \n     meeting in Rambouillet, France, and for annual meetings \n     thereafter under a rotating presidency known as the Group of \n     Six (G6);\n       Whereas the G6 was established based on the mutual interest \n     of its members in promoting economic stability, global \n     security, and democracy;\n       Whereas, in 1976, membership of the G6 was expanded to \n     include Canada;\n       Whereas the members of the G7 share a commitment to promote \n     security, economic stability, and democracy in their \n     respective nations and around the world;\n       Whereas Russia was integrated into the G7 in 1998 at the \n     behest of President William Jefferson Clinton following \n     Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decision to pursue reforms \n     and assume a neutral position on the acceptance of additional \n     members into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas the members of the G8 face common challenges, \n     including climate change, violent extremism, global economic \n     volatility, pandemic disease, nuclear proliferation, and \n     trafficking in narcotics, persons, and weapons of mass \n     destruction;\n       Whereas President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister Vladimir \n     Putin, and other leaders of the Russian Federation have \n     regularly expressed a desire for the Russian Federation to \n     play a leading role in international affairs;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation and other members of the \n     international community all stand to benefit if the Russian \n     Federation is an active, constructive partner in addressing \n     the broad range of challenges confronting the global \n     community;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation has evidenced the capacity \n     and willingness to cooperate with the United States and other \n     nations in the interest of global security in certain areas \n     pertaining to arms control and weapons proliferation, notably \n     through its participation in the Six-Party Talks regarding \n     North Korea and its support of the incentives package offered \n     by leading countries to Iran if that country would suspend \n     its uranium enrichment program;\n       Whereas the United States and Russia have safely \n     deactivated and destroyed thousands of nuclear, chemical, and \n     biological weapons and provided upgraded storage and \n     transportation of nuclear materials through the Nunn-Lugar \n     program;\n       Whereas the United States and other countries participating \n     in the June 2002 G8 Summit in Kananaskis, Canada agreed to \n     raise up to $20,000,000,000 over 10 years to support \n     nonproliferation projects in Russia and other nations through \n     the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and \n     Materials of Mass Destruction;\n       Whereas participants in the July 2006 G8 Summit in St. \n     Petersburg, Russia launched the Global Initiative to Combat \n     Nuclear Terrorism to improve the physical protection of \n     nuclear materials, suppress illicit trafficking of such \n     materials, and bolster the capacity of willing partner \n     nations to respond to acts of nuclear terrorism;\n       Whereas the United States and the Government of the Russian \n     Federation pledged in the April 2008 Sochi Strategic \n     Framework Declaration to negotiate a ``legally binding post-\n     START arrangement'' for the purposes of extending provisions \n     of the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty;\n       Whereas, notwithstanding these successes, the potential for \n     collaboration between the United States and the Government of \n     Russian Federation has been seriously undermined by the \n     manner in which the leaders of the Russian Federation have \n     conducted aspects of Russia's foreign policy;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     unilaterally suspended implementation of the 1991 Treaty on \n     Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty) and has yet \n     to fulfill its commitment to withdraw Russian forces from \n     Georgia and Moldova pursuant to the 1999 Istanbul Summit \n     Declaration of the Organization for Security and Cooperation \n     in Europe;\n       Whereas the CFE Treaty has played a key role in enhancing \n     the stability of the Euro-Atlantic region;\n       Whereas the Adapted CFE Treaty, which will not enter into \n     force until the Russian Federation fulfills commitments made \n     at the Istanbul Summit, will provide greater flexibility for \n     the Russian Federation in return for improved transparency \n     and verification;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     attempted to undermine the territorial integrity of the \n     Republic of Georgia through its support of the breakaway \n     provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia;\n       Whereas the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia has \n     concluded that a military aircraft belonging to the Russian \n     Federation shot down an unarmed Georgian drone on April 20, \n     2008, while flying over Abkhazia;\n       Whereas the conduct of Russian trade and energy policy has \n     created a widespread perception that the Government of the \n     Russian Federation is using oil and gas exports and economic \n     policy as a means of political pressure on countries that \n     seek closer ties with the United States and Euro-Atlantic \n     partners;\n       Whereas the behavior of the Russian Federation as it \n     relates to several neighboring countries has contributed to \n     the erosion of regional peace and security;\n       Whereas such actions are inconsistent with the G8's \n     objectives of protecting global security, economic stability, \n     and democracy, hinder cooperation with the Government of the \n     Russian Federation, and undermine the standing of the Russian \n     Federation as a respected member of the international \n     community;\n       Whereas there has been considerable disagreement between \n     the Government of the United States and the Government of the \n     Russian Federation regarding proposals to place ballistic \n     missile defense interceptor and radar sites in Poland and the \n     Czech Republic, respectively;\n       Whereas certain developments inside the Russian Federation \n     and the Russian Government's conduct of domestic policy have \n     undermined confidence in the Russian Federation's ability and \n     capability to serve as a full partner in the work of the \n     international community;\n       Whereas the Department of State's Country Report on Human \n     Rights Practices for 2007 stated that, in Russia, \n     ``continuing centralization of power in the executive branch, \n     a compliant State Duma, corruption and selectivity in \n     enforcement of the law, media restrictions, and harassment of \n     some NGOs eroded the government's accountability to its \n     citizens.'';\n       Whereas, in June 2008, a report released by Human Rights \n     Watch concluded that Russian ``law enforcement and security \n     forces involved in counterinsurgency [in the North Caucasus] \n     have committed dozens of extrajudicial executions, summary \n     and arbitrary detentions, and acts of torture and cruel, \n     inhuman or degrading treatment'';\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has failed \n     to successfully prosecute individuals responsible for the \n     murder of critics of the Kremlin, including journalist Anna \n     Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko;\n       Whereas the 2008 Annual Report of Reporters without Borders \n     noted a sharp increase in government pressure on the \n     independent media in Russia, reporting that at least 2 \n     journalists were forcibly sent to psychiatric hospitals in \n     2007 and others were badly beaten or kidnapped prior to the \n     local and parliamentary elections in 2007;\n       Whereas Transparency International ranked Russia 143 out of \n     179 countries for perceived corruption in 2007;\n       Whereas there is increasing concern about violent \n     nationalism and xenophobia in the Russian Federation and the \n     2008 Annual Report of the United States Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom reports that there has been a \n     ``sharp rise in violent\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\n     crimes against persons [in Russia] on account of their \n     religion or ethnicity'';\n       Whereas, in the handling of the Yukos Oil Company case and \n     numerous other judicial actions, the Government of the \n     Russian Federation has permitted the politicization of \n     Russia's legal system;\n       Whereas these developments have seriously damaged \n     international confidence in the institutions and laws of the \n     Russian Federation and hindered the ability of the United \n     States and other partners to work with the Russian Federation \n     in addressing a broad range of pressing global, regional, and \n     domestic challenges;\n       Whereas the people of the Russian Federation and the people \n     of the United States have been disadvantaged by the resulting \n     damage to relations between the countries;\n       Whereas President Dmitry Medvedev, in an interview with the \n     Reuters News Service on June 25, 2008, stated that ``freedom, \n     democracy and the right to private property'' should define \n     Russia's behavior;\n       Whereas the United States believes that adherence on the \n     part of the Government of the Russian Federation to the \n     values articulated by President Medvedev would provide a \n     foundation for improved cooperation with the Russian \n     Federation;\n       Whereas adherence to the values articulated by President \n     Medvedev would also help repair damage to the international \n     reputation of the Russian Federation and advance the goals of \n     security, prosperity, and representative governance that \n     should be the common ambition of all members of the G8;\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) in order to build a more constructive relationship with \n     the Government of the Russian Federation and its people, the \n     President of the United States and other leaders of the G8 \n     nations should--\n       (A) pursue a broad agenda of cooperation with the leaders \n     of the Russian Federation; and\n       (B) encourage Russia's transformation into a more liberal \n     and democratic polity;\n       (2) the Government of the United States and the Government \n     of the Russian Federation should work to ensure the continued \n     success of Nunn-Lugar initiatives and nonproliferation and \n     counterterrorism programs through--\n       (A) additional funding;\n       (B) access to sensitive facilities;\n       (C) effective safety and security measures to prevent \n     proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons \n     and weapons-related materials and technology; and\n       (D) cooperation between the United States and Russia to \n     enhance these objectives on a worldwide basis;\n       (3) the Government of the United States and the Government \n     of the Russian Federation, working within the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency and United Nations Security Council, \n     should renew demands for Iran to cease its nuclear enrichment \n     activities and fully disclose any prior weapons-related work;\n       (4) the Government of the United States and the Government \n     of the Russian Federation should negotiate a legally-binding \n     successor agreement to the 1991 Strategic Arms Reductions \n     Treaty and address all outstanding concerns regarding the \n     1991 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe;\n       (5) the leaders of the Russian Federation should adopt \n     foreign and domestic policies that are consistent with \n     ``freedom, democracy and the right to private property'', as \n     articulated by President Dmitry Medvedev;\n       (6) the Government of the Russian Federation should take \n     immediate steps to restore the freedom and independence of \n     the country's media in accordance with its obligations under \n     the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;\n       (7) the Government and officials of the Russian Federation \n     should refrain from portraying the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) as a threat to the Russian Federation and \n     fully utilize the consultative mechanisms that exist through \n     the NATO-Russia Council to facilitate cooperation between the \n     countries of NATO and the Russian Federation;\n       (8) the United States, in coordination with other members \n     of the G8, should--\n       (A) encourage the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     address the challenges facing its society, including \n     widespread corruption, a deteriorating health care system, \n     growing instability in the North Caucasus, and an \n     increasingly serious demographic crisis; and\n       (B) stand ready to assist the people and Government of the \n     Russian Federation in those efforts;\n       (9) just as the United States welcomed the increasing \n     prosperity and political development of Germany, Japan, and \n     the nations Eastern Europe in the aftermath of former \n     conflicts, the United States should welcome the emergence of \n     the Russian Federation as a strong, successful, democratic \n     partner in addressing global challenges; and\n       (10) the leaders of the Russian Federation should respect \n     the rights of sovereign, democratic governments in \n     neighboring countries and their prerogative to seek \n     membership in Euro-Atlantic institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"},

the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 613\n\n       Whereas direct support workers, direct care workers, \n     personal assistants, personal attendants, in-home support \n     workers, and paraprofessionals (referred to in this preamble \n     as ``direct support professionals'') are the primary \n     providers of publicly funded long term support and services \n     for millions of individuals;\n       Whereas a direct support professional must build a close, \n     trusted relationship with an individual with disabilities;\n       Whereas a direct support professional assists an individual \n     with disabilities with the most intimate needs, on a daily \n     basis;\n       Whereas direct support professionals provide a broad range \n     of support, including--\n       (1) preparation of meals;\n       (2) helping with medications;\n       (3) bathing;\n       (4) dressing;\n       (5) mobility;\n       (6) getting to school, work, religious, and recreational \n     activities; and\n       (7) general daily affairs;\n\n       Whereas a direct support professional provides essential \n     support to help keep an individual with disabilities \n     connected to the family and community of the individual;\n       Whereas direct support professionals enable individuals \n     with disabilities to live meaningful, productive lives;\n       Whereas direct support professionals are the key to \n     allowing an individual with disabilities to live successfully \n     in the community of the individual, and to avoid more costly \n     institutional care;\n       Whereas the majority of direct support professionals are \n     female, and many are the sole breadwinners of their families;\n       Whereas direct support professionals work and pay taxes, \n     but many remain impoverished and are eligible for the same \n     Federal and State public assistance programs on which the \n     individuals with disabilities served by the direct support \n     professionals must depend;\n       Whereas Federal and State policies, as well as the Supreme \n     Court, in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), assert the \n     right of an individual to live in the home and community of \n     the individual;\n       Whereas, in 2008, the majority of direct support \n     professionals are employed in home and community-based \n     settings and this trend is projected to increase over the \n     next decade;\n       Whereas there is a documented critical and growing shortage \n     of direct support professionals in every community throughout \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas many direct support professionals are forced to \n     leave jobs due to inadequate wages and benefits, creating \n     high turnover and vacancy rates that research demonstrates \n     adversely affects the quality of support to individuals with \n     disabilities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning September 8, 2008, as \n     ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week'';\n       (2) recognizes the dedication and vital role of direct \n     support professionals in enhancing the lives of individuals \n     with disabilities of all ages;\n       (3) appreciates the contribution of direct support \n     professionals in supporting the needs that reach beyond the \n     capacities of millions of families in the United States;\n       (4) commends direct support professionals as integral in \n     supporting the long-term support and services system of the \n     United States; and\n       (5) finds that the successful implementation of the public \n     policies of the United States depends on the dedication of \n     direct support professionals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2008/07/14/senate-section/article/S6654-2", "month": "07", "year": "2008", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6654-S6655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 5073.

and\n       ``(C) provide palliative care and HIV prevention assistance \n     to millions of other people.\n       ``(31) While United States leadership in the battles \n     against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria has had an \n     enormous impact, these diseases continue to take a terrible \n     toll on the human race.\n       ``(32) According to the 2007 AIDS Epidemic Update of the \n     Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)--\n       ``(A) an estimated 2,100,000 people died of AIDS-related \n     causes in 2007;

Res. 611\n\n       Whereas, over the last eight years, the Zimbabwean African \n     National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), led by Robert \n     Mugabe, has increasingly turned to violence and intimidation \n     to maintain power amidst a deteriorating crisis;\n       Whereas the gross domestic product of Zimbabwe has \n     decreased over 40 percent in the last decade, inflation is \n     estimated by United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Asha-\n     Rose Migiro at over 10,500,000 percent, unemployment is now \n     over 80 percent, and more than 4,000,000 people have fled the \n     country;\n       Whereas presidential and parliamentary elections were held \n     on March 29, 2008, in Zimbabwe amidst widespread reports of \n     voting irregularities and intimidation in favor of the ruling \n     ZANU-PF party and Robert Mugabe;\n       Whereas the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission refused to \n     release results, despite calls to do so by the African Union \n     (AU), the European Union (EU), the Republic of South Africa, \n     the Southern African Development Community (SADC), United \n     Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, and the United States;\n       Whereas the official results of the election, announced \n     five weeks later, showed that Robert Mugabe won 43.2 percent \n     of the vote, while Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the \n     opposition party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), won \n     47.9 percent of the vote;\n       Whereas, in the wake of the elections, Robert Mugabe \n     launched a brutal campaign of state-sponsored violence \n     against opposition members, supporters, and other civilians \n     in an attempt to consolidate his power;\n       Whereas United States Ambassador to the United Nations \n     Zalmay Khalilzad stated on April 16, 2008, that he was \n     ``gravely concerned about the escalating politically \n     motivated violence perpetrated by security forces and ruling \n     party militias'';\n       Whereas Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stated on April \n     17, 2008, that Robert Mugabe has ``done more harm to his \n     country than would have been imaginable'' and that ``the last \n     years have been really an abomination'' and called for the AU \n     and SADC to strengthen efforts to achieve a political \n     resolution to the crisis;\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch reported on April 19, 2008, that \n     the Mugabe regime had developed a network of informal \n     detention centers to intimidate, torture, and detain \n     political opponents;\n       Whereas the Mugabe regime has, in violation of the Vienna \n     Convention on Diplomatic Relations, done at Vienna April 18, \n     1961 (23 U.S.T. 3229), harassed United States and other \n     diplomats in retaliation for their repeated protest of recent \n     violence, including by detaining the United States \n     ambassador's vehicle for several hours on May 13, 2008, and \n     detaining five United States embassy staff and two local \n     embassy workers on June 5, 1998, one of whom was physically \n     assaulted;\n       Whereas reports of killings, abductions, beatings, torture, \n     and sexual violence against civilians in Zimbabwe have \n     continued, resulting in some 10,000 people being assaulted \n     and at least 30,000 displaced;\n       Whereas the MDC and Presidential candidate Tsvangirai \n     withdrew from the June 27, 2008, runoff presidential \n     election, citing intensified political repression and \n     killings of their supporters;\n       Whereas the Mugabe regime persisted with the runoff \n     election, despite the protest of many leaders in Africa, the \n     EU, SADC, the United Nations Security Council, and the United \n     States Government;\n       Whereas results from the runoff election unsurprisingly \n     declared Robert Mugabe, the only standing candidate, as the \n     winner with 85 percent of the vote, and he was sworn into \n     office;\n       Whereas SADC, the Pan-African Parliament, and AU Observer \n     missions to Zimbabwe made statements on June 29 and 30, 2008, \n     finding that the elections fell short of accepted African \n     Union standards, did not give rise to free, fair, or credible \n     elections, and did not reflect the will of the people of \n     Zimbabwe;\n       Whereas, on June 4, 2008, the Mugabe regime banned the \n     operations of non-governmental organizations in Zimbabwe, \n     including those who provide food and aid to millions of \n     Zimbabweans suffering at the result of a ZANU-PF's policies, \n     exacerbating the\n\n[[Page S6670]]\n\n     humanitarian crisis and leaving newly displaced victims of \n     political violence without assistance;\n       Whereas Nelson Mandela has described the situation in \n     Zimbabwe as a ``tragic failure of leadership,'' while the \n     Government of Botswana has refused to recognize the election \n     outcome as legitimate and has said that representatives of \n     the administration should be excluded from SADC and African \n     Union meetings;\n       Whereas the African Union passed a resolution on July 1, \n     2008, expressing concern for the loss of life in Zimbabwe and \n     the need to initiate political dialogue to promote peace, \n     democracy, and reconciliation;\n       Whereas the MDC reported on July 9, 2008, that 129 of its \n     supporters have been killed since the first round of \n     elections, including 20 since the runoff election, 1,500 of \n     its activists and officials are in detention, and 5,000 are \n     missing or unaccounted for; and\n       Whereas the Group of Eight (G8) industrialized nations, at \n     their annual summit, issued a joint statement on July 8, \n     2008, rejecting the June 27, 2008, election and legitimacy of \n     the Mugabe regime, as well as committing to further measures \n     against those responsible for

political repression, a humanitarian \n     emergency, and economic adversity;\n       (2) to condemn the Mugabe regime for its manipulation of \n     the country's electoral process, including the March 29, \n     2008, election and the June 27, 2008, runoff election and the \n     regime's continued attacks against, and intimidation of, \n     opposition members and supporters and civil society;\n       (3) to reject the results of the June 27, 2008, \n     presidential runoff election in Zimbabwe as illegitimate \n     because of widespread irregularities, systematic violence by \n     the Mugabe regime, and the boycott of the MDC;\n       (4) to encourage the President's continued efforts to \n     tighten and expand sanctions on those individuals responsible \n     for violations of human and political rights in Zimbabwe;\n       (5) to applaud the Governments of Benin, Botswana, Liberia, \n     Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Zambia for \n     condemning the violent derailment of the runoff election at \n     the African Union summit in Sharm El-Sheikh;\n       (6) to encourage all members of the United Nations Security \n     Council to vote in favor of the proposed resolution that \n     would authorize a United Nations Special Representative to \n     support the negotiations process, impose an international \n     arms embargo, and strengthen financial penalties on those \n     individuals most responsible for undermining democratic \n     processes;\n       (7) to encourage the African Union to initiate an inclusive \n     political dialogue between both parties and deploy a \n     protection force to prevent attacks, assist victims, and \n     prevent the security situation from further deteriorating;\n       (8) to urge leaders in Africa to engage directly in the \n     effort to achieve an expeditious political resolution to the \n     crisis;\n       (9) to urge the United States Government and the \n     international community to assemble a comprehensive economic \n     and political recovery package for Zimbabwe in the event that \n     a political resolution is reached and a truly democratic \n     government is formed; and\n       (10) to support a lasting democratic political solution \n     that reflects the will and respects the rights of the people \n     of Zimbabwe, including mechanisms to ensure that future \n     elections are free and fair, in accordance with regional and \n     international standards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url":

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 612) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 612\n\n       Expressing the sense of the Senate that President George W. \n     Bush, President Dmitry Medvedev of the Russian Federation, \n     and other participants in the 2008 Group of Eight (G8) Summit \n     in Toyako, Hokkaido, Japan should work together to foster a \n     more constructive relationship, and that the Government of \n     the Russian Federation should eschew behaviors that are \n     inconsistent with the Group's objectives of protecting global \n     security, economic stability, and democracy.\n       Whereas the leaders of 6 major industrialized democracies, \n     including France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the United \n     Kingdom, and the United States, gathered in 1975 for a summit \n     meeting in Rambouillet, France, and for annual meetings \n     thereafter under a rotating presidency known as the Group of \n     Six (G6);\n       Whereas the G6 was established based on the mutual interest \n     of its members in promoting economic stability, global \n     security, and democracy;\n       Whereas, in 1976, membership of the G6 was expanded to \n     include Canada;\n       Whereas the members of the G7 share a commitment to promote \n     security, economic stability, and democracy in their \n     respective nations and around the world;\n       Whereas Russia was integrated into the G7 in 1998 at the \n     behest of President William Jefferson Clinton following \n     Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decision to pursue reforms \n     and assume a neutral position on the acceptance of additional \n     members into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO);\n       Whereas the members of the G8 face common challenges, \n     including climate change, violent extremism, global economic \n     volatility, pandemic disease, nuclear proliferation, and \n     trafficking in narcotics, persons, and weapons of mass \n     destruction;\n       Whereas President Dmitry Medvedev, Prime Minister Vladimir \n     Putin, and other leaders of the Russian Federation have \n     regularly expressed a desire for the Russian Federation to \n     play a leading role in international affairs;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation and other members of the \n     international community all stand to benefit if the Russian \n     Federation is an active, constructive partner in addressing \n     the broad range of challenges confronting the global \n     community;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation has evidenced the capacity \n     and willingness to cooperate with the United States and other \n     nations in the interest of global security in certain areas \n     pertaining to arms control and weapons proliferation, notably \n     through its participation in the Six-Party Talks regarding \n     North Korea and its support of the incentives package offered \n     by leading countries to Iran if that country would suspend \n     its uranium enrichment program;\n       Whereas the United States and Russia have safely \n     deactivated and destroyed thousands of nuclear, chemical, and \n     biological weapons and provided upgraded storage and \n     transportation of nuclear materials through the Nunn-Lugar \n     program;\n       Whereas the United States and other countries participating \n     in the June 2002 G8 Summit in Kananaskis, Canada agreed to \n     raise up to $20,000,000,000 over 10 years to support \n     nonproliferation projects in Russia and other nations through \n     the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and \n     Materials of Mass Destruction;\n       Whereas participants in the July 2006 G8 Summit in St. \n     Petersburg, Russia launched the Global Initiative to Combat \n     Nuclear Terrorism to improve the physical protection of \n     nuclear materials, suppress illicit trafficking of such \n     materials, and bolster the capacity of willing partner \n     nations to respond to acts of nuclear terrorism;\n       Whereas the United States and the Government of the Russian \n     Federation pledged in the April 2008 Sochi Strategic \n     Framework Declaration to negotiate a ``legally binding post-\n     START arrangement'' for the purposes of extending provisions \n     of the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty;\n       Whereas, notwithstanding these successes, the potential for \n     collaboration between the United States and the Government of \n     the Russian Federation has been seriously undermined by the \n     manner in which the leaders of the Russian Federation have \n     conducted aspects of Russia's foreign policy;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     unilaterally suspended implementation of the 1991 Treaty on \n     Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty) and has yet \n     to fulfill its commitment to withdraw Russian forces from \n     Georgia and Moldova pursuant to the 1999 Istanbul Summit \n     Declaration of the Organization for Security and Cooperation \n     in Europe;\n       Whereas the CFE Treaty has played a key role in enhancing \n     the stability of the Euro-Atlantic region;\n       Whereas the Adapted CFE Treaty, which will not enter into \n     force until the Russian Federation fulfills commitments made \n     at the Istanbul Summit, will provide greater flexibility for \n     the Russian Federation in return for improved transparency \n     and verification;\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has \n     attempted to undermine the territorial integrity of the \n     Republic of Georgia through its support of the breakaway \n     provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia;\n       Whereas the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia has \n     concluded that a military aircraft belonging to the Russian \n     Federation shot down an unarmed Georgian drone on April 20, \n     2008, while flying over Abkhazia;\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\n       Whereas the conduct of Russian trade and energy policy has \n     created a widespread perception that the Government of the \n     Russian Federation is using oil and gas exports and economic \n     policy as a means of political pressure on countries that \n     seek closer ties with the United States and Euro-Atlantic \n     partners;\n       Whereas the behavior of the Russian Federation as it \n     relates to several neighboring countries has contributed to \n     the erosion of regional peace and security;\n       Whereas such actions are inconsistent with the G8's \n     objectives of protecting global security, economic stability, \n     and democracy, hinder cooperation with the Government of the \n     Russian Federation, and undermine the standing of the Russian \n     Federation as a respected member of the international \n     community;\n       Whereas there has been considerable disagreement between \n     the Government of the United States and the Government of the \n     Russian Federation regarding proposals to place ballistic \n     missile defense interceptor and radar sites in Poland and the \n     Czech Republic, respectively;\n       Whereas certain developments inside the Russian Federation \n     and the Russian Government's conduct of domestic policy have \n     undermined confidence in the Russian Federation's ability and \n     capability to serve as a full partner in the work of the \n     international community;\n       Whereas the Department of State's Country Report on Human \n     Rights Practices for 2007 stated that, in Russia, \n     ``continuing centralization of power in the executive branch, \n     a compliant State Duma, corruption and selectivity in \n     enforcement of the law, media restrictions, and harassment of \n     some NGOs eroded the government's accountability to its \n     citizens.'';\n       Whereas, in June 2008, a report released by Human Rights \n     Watch concluded that Russian ``law enforcement and security \n     forces involved in counterinsurgency [in the North Caucasus] \n     have committed dozens of extrajudicial executions, summary \n     and arbitrary detentions, and acts of torture and cruel, \n     inhuman or degrading treatment'';\n       Whereas the Government of the Russian Federation has failed \n     to successfully prosecute individuals responsible for the \n     murder of critics of the Kremlin, including journalist Anna \n     Politkovskaya and Alexander Litvinenko;\n       Whereas the 2008 Annual Report of Reporters without Borders \n     noted a sharp increase in government pressure on the \n     independent media in Russia, reporting that at least 2 \n     journalists were forcibly sent to psychiatric hospitals in \n     2007 and others were badly beaten or kidnapped prior to the \n     local and parliamentary elections in 2007;\n       Whereas Transparency International ranked Russia 143 out of \n     179 countries for perceived corruption in 2007;\n       Whereas there is increasing concern about violent \n     nationalism and xenophobia in the Russian Federation and the \n     2008 Annual Report of the United States Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom reports that there has been a \n     ``sharp rise in violent crimes against persons [in Russia] on \n     account of their religion or ethnicity'';\n       Whereas, in the handling of the Yukos Oil Company case and \n     numerous other judicial actions, the Government of the \n     Russian Federation has permitted the politicization of \n     Russia's legal system;\n       Whereas these developments have seriously damaged \n     international confidence in the institutions and laws of the \n     Russian Federation and hindered the ability of the United \n     States and other partners to work with the Russian Federation \n     in addressing a broad range of pressing global, regional, and \n     domestic challenges;\n       Whereas the people of the Russian Federation and the people \n     of the United States have been disadvantaged by the resulting \n     damage to relations between the countries;\n       Whereas President Dmitry Medvedev, in an interview with the \n     Reuters News Service on June 25, 2008, stated that ``freedom, \n     democracy and the right to private property'' should define \n     Russia's behavior;\n       Whereas the United States believes that adherence on the \n     part of the Government of the Russian Federation to the \n     values articulated by President Medvedev would provide a \n     foundation for improved cooperation with the Russian \n     Federation;\n       Whereas adherence to the values articulated by President \n     Medvedev would also help repair damage to the international \n     reputation of the Russian Federation and advance the goals of \n     security, prosperity, and representative governance that \n     should be the common ambition of all members of the G8;\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) in order to build a more constructive relationship with \n     the Government of the Russian Federation and its people, the \n     President of the United States and other leaders of the G8 \n     nations should--\n       (A) pursue a broad agenda of cooperation with the leaders \n     of the Russian Federation; and\n       (B) encourage Russia's transformation into a more liberal \n     and democratic polity;\n       (2) the Government of the United States and the Government \n     of the Russian Federation should work to ensure the continued \n     success of Nunn-Lugar initiatives and nonproliferation and \n     counterterrorism programs through--\n       (A) additional funding;\n       (B) access to sensitive facilities;\n       (C) effective safety and security measures to prevent \n     proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons \n     and weapons-related materials and technology; and\n       (D) cooperation between the United States and Russia to \n     enhance these objectives on a worldwide basis;\n       (3) the Government of the United States and the Government \n     of the Russian Federation, working within the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency and United Nations Security Council, \n     should renew demands for Iran to cease its nuclear enrichment \n     activities and fully disclose any prior weapons-related work;\n       (4) the Government of the United States and the Government \n     of the Russian Federation should negotiate a legally-binding \n     successor agreement to the 1991 Strategic Arms Reductions \n     Treaty and address all outstanding concerns regarding the \n     1991 Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe;\n       (5) the leaders of the Russian Federation should adopt \n     foreign and domestic policies that are consistent with \n     ``freedom, democracy and the right to private property'', as \n     articulated by President Dmitry Medvedev;\n       (6) the Government of the Russian Federation should take \n     immediate steps to restore the freedom and independence of \n     the country's media in accordance with its obligations under \n     the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;\n       (7) the Government and officials of the Russian Federation \n     should refrain from portraying the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) as a threat to the Russian Federation and \n     fully utilize the consultative mechanisms that exist through \n     the NATO-Russia Council to facilitate cooperation between the \n     countries of NATO and the Russian Federation;\n       (8) the United States, in coordination with other members \n     of the G8, should--\n       (A) encourage the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     address the challenges facing its society, including \n     widespread corruption, a deteriorating health care system, \n     growing instability in the North Caucasus, and an \n     increasingly serious demographic crisis; and\n       (B) stand ready to assist the people and Government of the \n     Russian Federation in those efforts;\n       (9) just as the United States welcomed the increasing \n     prosperity and political development of Germany, Japan, and \n     the nations Eastern Europe in the aftermath of former \n     conflicts, the United States should welcome the emergence of \n     the Russian Federation as a strong, successful, democratic \n     partner in addressing global challenges; and\n       (10) the leaders of the Russian Federation should respect \n     the rights of sovereign, democratic governments in \n     neighboring countries and their prerogative to seek \n     membership in Euro-Atlantic institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url":
